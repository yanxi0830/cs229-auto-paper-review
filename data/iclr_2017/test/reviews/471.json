{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Batch Policy Gradient  Methods for  Improving Neural Conversation Models", "abstract": "We study reinforcement learning of chat-bots with recurrent neural network architectures when the rewards are noisy and expensive to obtain. For instance, a chat-bot used in automated customer service support can be scored by quality assurance agents, but this process can be expensive, time consuming and noisy.  Previous reinforcement learning work for natural language uses on-policy updates and/or is designed for on-line learning settings. We demonstrate empirically that such strategies are not appropriate for this setting and develop an off-policy batch policy gradient method (\\bpg). We demonstrate the efficacy of our method via a series of synthetic experiments and an Amazon Mechanical Turk experiment on a restaurant recommendations dataset.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "The paper discuss a \"batch\" method for RL setup to improve chat-bots.\nThe authors provide nice overview of the RL setup they are using and present an algorithm which is similar to previously published on line setup for the same problem.

The idea is that you can collect human scoring data for some responses from a dialogue model, however such scores are expensive.

In fact, it is several orders of magnitude smaller than other datasets used in the literature (e.g. Twitter, the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus) for dialogue generation. It is a bit surprising to me that RNN chatbots (with no additional structure) are able to generate reasonable utterances on such a small dataset. Wen et al. (2016) are able to do this on a similarly small restaurant dataset, but this is mostly because they map directly from dialogue states to surface form, rather than some embedding representation of the context. Thus, it remains to be seen if the approaches in this paper also result in improvements when much more unsupervised data is available.\n\nReferences:\n\nWen, Tsung-Hsien, Milica Gasic, Nikola Mrksic, Lina M.
