{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "The Incredible Shrinking Neural Network: New Perspectives on Learning Representations Through The Lens of Pruning", "abstract": "How much can pruning algorithms teach us about the fundamentals of learning representations in neural networks? A lot, it turns out. Neural network model compression has become a topic of great interest in recent years, and many different techniques have been proposed to address this problem. In general, this is motivated by the idea that smaller models typically lead to better generalization. At the same time, the decision of what to prune and when to prune necessarily forces us to confront our assumptions about how neural networks actually learn to represent patterns in data. In this work we set out to test several long-held hypotheses about neural network learning representations and numerical approaches to pruning. To accomplish this we first reviewed the historical literature and derived a novel algorithm to prune whole neurons (as opposed to the traditional method of pruning weights) from optimally trained networks using a second-order Taylor method. We then set about testing the performance of our algorithm and analyzing the quality of the decisions it made. As a baseline for comparison we used a first-order Taylor method based on the Skeletonization algorithm and an exhaustive brute-force serial pruning algorithm. Our proposed algorithm worked well compared to a first-order method, but not nearly as well as the brute-force method. Our error analysis led us to question the validity of many widely-held assumptions behind pruning algorithms in general and the trade-offs we often make in the interest of reducing computational complexity. We discovered that there is a straightforward way, however expensive, to serially prune 40-70\\% of the neurons in a trained network with minimal effect on the learning representation and without any re-training.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "The paper introduces a new pruning method for neural networks based on the second-order Taylor expansion and compares the results against a first-order method and brute-force pruning. It performs experiments of the three methods on several toy examples - including a two-layer network on MNIST - and shows that the second-order method behaves much worse then the brute-force baseline. In addition, from the success of the brute-force pruning the authors conclude that the hypothesis of Mozer et al - that neurons either contribute to performance or cancel out the effect of other neurons - is probably correct.\n\nThe authors put in considerable effort to explain all details of the paper clearly and at length, so the content of the paper is accessible even to people novel to pruning methods.

In an answer to the pre-review questions the authors stated:\n\n> Furthermore, we do not have to accept the conclusion that re-training is a necessary part of pruning because a brute force search reveals that neurons can in fact be \n> pruned from trained networks in a piecemeal fashion with no retraining and minimal adverse effect on the overall performance of the network.

Optimally, one would need to consider all the different ways of pruning (which, of course, scales exponentially with the number of neurons and is computationally infeasible). Notably, the authors do consider this limitation in the context of conventional pruning methods in the conclusions: \"Third, we assumed that pruning could be done in a serial fashion [...].

I would suggest to focus the paper in the following way: first, use a state-of-the-art pruning method from the literature (that works without re-training) or do not use any other pruning methods besides brute-force (depending on whether you want to compare pruning methods against brute-force, or want to learn something about the learnt representations). In this way you need to write little about this second-order tuning methods, and readers are not so easily confused about the purpose of this paper (plus it will be considerably shorter!).

We hope these will help clarify any other questions our reviewers/readers might have.\n\nQ: Why doesn't the paper present numerical comparision to state-of-the-art/recent pruning techniques?\n\nA: Under certain motivational assumptions, it is understandable to demand benchmarking comparisons against state-of-the-art methods, but this may be missing the fundamental purpose of the present research. Our investigation is intended less to propose a competing alternative to existing pruning techniques and more to shed light on the limitations of generally accepted approaches to pruning and the degree to which increased numbers of parameters affect learning representations in neural networks. The paper does talk about most, if not all popoular pruning techniques out there. In fact, we examined the literature for numerical methods to approximate the importance of network elements, and the widely-cited 1st & 2nd order techniques proposed by Mozer, LeCun, Hassibi, Stork, et al. provided our initial inspiration. This is the jumping off point for our research in terms of key insights.\n\nQ: The idea of using Taylor series approximations seems interesting but not really effective.\n\nA: It is not effective when used as a pruning technique but it is VERY effective to test out the effectiveness of existing pruning techniques, which is what we do here. We have mentioned it multiple times in the paper that the motivation behind this work is NOT to propose a new pruning technique that will outperform all other techniques out there but to tap into learning representations to see how effective our established techniques are when seen from the perspective of representations. The Taylor series approximations play an important role here. A lot of pruning techniques out there use 2nd Order error gradients and assume that using them is the most effective way to prune networks. We have conclusively proved using the Taylor series that this is very much not the case. Our results with the brute-force method show us that there is a much larger extent to which networks can be pruned. This makes for a great starting-off point for future research to find methods that can produce similar results.\n\nQ: Why did you decide in favor of sigmoid activation functions instead of something more recent and more popular like ReLUs? \n\nA: As mentioned above, the main contribution of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of pruning entire neurons from trained networks, and offer novel insight on learning representations. We use Taylor methods to approximate the results achieved by the brute-force method but this is not an ideal solution to the problem, as we discuss. The 2nd order approximation technique will not work for ReLU networks because ReLUs do not have a 2nd derivative, unless we use the soft-plus function as a continuous approximation. Furthermore, due to the fact that we are approximating the error surface of a network element with respect to the output using a parabola, if there is no useful parabola to approximate this relationship, then the method breaks down. The derivatives of the activation function are simply parameters of the Taylor series. It doesn\u2019t cease to be a parabolic approximation or become more effective if we use a different doubly-differentiable activation function. \n\nQ: Why carry out your experiments on the MNIST dataset and not go for a larger and more practical image dataset?\n\nA: All experiments were necessarily carried out on optimally trained networks (not counting Section 4.5, which specifically examines non-optimally trained networks), so there is no way to improve them. We derived the algorithm assuming the well-studied sigmoid activation function. Furthermore, the MNIST dataset is a de-facto standard for demonstrating the potential of new techniques. A different dataset, task, activation function, or network architecture will not change the trends we see in the results but could make the results less interpretable. \n\nQ: The best setting is Iterative Re-ranking with Brute Force removal which is too expensive.\n\nA: The brute-force method is highly parallelizable, so time complexity is not necessarily a deal-breaker. Our focus is the proof of concept, and we intend to investigate potential speedups in future work. Also, since pruning is anyways a single step carried out after the training process is over (which usually takes orders of magnitude more time), this is potentially acceptable. \n\n\n", "OTHER_KEYS": "Aditya Sharma"}, {"DATE": "03 Dec 2016", "TITLE": "Revision History", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "comments": "First Revision: 27 November, 2016.

We hope these will help clarify any other questions our reviewers/readers might have.\n\nQ: Why doesn't the paper present numerical comparision to state-of-the-art/recent pruning techniques?\n\nA: Under certain motivational assumptions, it is understandable to demand benchmarking comparisons against state-of-the-art methods, but this may be missing the fundamental purpose of the present research. Our investigation is intended less to propose a competing alternative to existing pruning techniques and more to shed light on the limitations of generally accepted approaches to pruning and the degree to which increased numbers of parameters affect learning representations in neural networks. The paper does talk about most, if not all popoular pruning techniques out there. In fact, we examined the literature for numerical methods to approximate the importance of network elements, and the widely-cited 1st & 2nd order techniques proposed by Mozer, LeCun, Hassibi, Stork, et al. provided our initial inspiration. This is the jumping off point for our research in terms of key insights.\n\nQ: The idea of using Taylor series approximations seems interesting but not really effective.\n\nA: It is not effective when used as a pruning technique but it is VERY effective to test out the effectiveness of existing pruning techniques, which is what we do here. We have mentioned it multiple times in the paper that the motivation behind this work is NOT to propose a new pruning technique that will outperform all other techniques out there but to tap into learning representations to see how effective our established techniques are when seen from the perspective of representations. The Taylor series approximations play an important role here. A lot of pruning techniques out there use 2nd Order error gradients and assume that using them is the most effective way to prune networks. We have conclusively proved using the Taylor series that this is very much not the case. Our results with the brute-force method show us that there is a much larger extent to which networks can be pruned. This makes for a great starting-off point for future research to find methods that can produce similar results.\n\nQ: Why did you decide in favor of sigmoid activation functions instead of something more recent and more popular like ReLUs? \n\nA: As mentioned above, the main contribution of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of pruning entire neurons from trained networks, and offer novel insight on learning representations. We use Taylor methods to approximate the results achieved by the brute-force method but this is not an ideal solution to the problem, as we discuss. The 2nd order approximation technique will not work for ReLU networks because ReLUs do not have a 2nd derivative, unless we use the soft-plus function as a continuous approximation. Furthermore, due to the fact that we are approximating the error surface of a network element with respect to the output using a parabola, if there is no useful parabola to approximate this relationship, then the method breaks down. The derivatives of the activation function are simply parameters of the Taylor series. It doesn\u2019t cease to be a parabolic approximation or become more effective if we use a different doubly-differentiable activation function. \n\nQ: Why carry out your experiments on the MNIST dataset and not go for a larger and more practical image dataset?\n\nA: All experiments were necessarily carried out on optimally trained networks (not counting Section 4.5, which specifically examines non-optimally trained networks), so there is no way to improve them. We derived the algorithm assuming the well-studied sigmoid activation function. Furthermore, the MNIST dataset is a de-facto standard for demonstrating the potential of new techniques. A different dataset, task, activation function, or network architecture will not change the trends we see in the results but could make the results less interpretable. \n\nQ: The best setting is Iterative Re-ranking with Brute Force removal which is too expensive.\n\nA: The brute-force method is highly parallelizable, so time complexity is not necessarily a deal-breaker. Our focus is the proof of concept, and we intend to investigate potential speedups in future work. Also, since pruning is anyways a single step carried out after the training process is over (which usually takes orders of magnitude more time), this is potentially acceptable. \n\n\n", "OTHER_KEYS": "Aditya Sharma"}, {"DATE": "03 Dec 2016", "TITLE": "Revision History", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "comments": "First Revision: 27 November, 2016.
