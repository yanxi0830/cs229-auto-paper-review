{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Learning to Navigate in Complex Environments", "abstract": "Learning to navigate in complex environments with dynamic elements is an important milestone in developing AI agents. In this work we formulate the navigation question as a reinforcement learning problem and show that data efficiency and task performance can be dramatically improved by relying on additional auxiliary tasks to bootstrap learning. In particular we consider jointly learning the goal-driven reinforcement learning problem with an unsupervised depth prediction task and a self-supervised loop closure classification task. Using this approach we can learn to navigate from raw sensory input in complicated 3D mazes, approaching human-level performance even under conditions where the goal location changes frequently. We provide detailed analysis of the agent behaviour, its ability to localise, and its network activity dynamics, that show that the agent implicitly learns key navigation abilities, with only sparse rewards and without direct supervision.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "This paper shows that a deep RL approach augmented with auxiliary tasks improves performance on navigation in complex environments.
