{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Riemannian Optimization for Skip-Gram Negative Sampling", "abstract": "Skip-Gram Negative Sampling (SGNS) word embedding model, well known by its implementation in \"word2vec\" software, is usually optimized by stochastic gradient descent. It can be shown that optimizing for SGNS objective can be viewed as an optimization problem of searching for a good matrix with the low-rank constraint. The most standard way to solve this type of problems is to apply Riemannian optimization framework to optimize the SGNS objective over the manifold of required low-rank matrices. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that optimizes SGNS objective using Riemannian optimization and demonstrates its superiority over popular competitors, such as the original method to train SGNS and SVD over SPPMI matrix.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "This paper presents a principled optimization method for SGNS (word2vec).\n\nWhile the proposed method is elegant from a theoretical perspective, I am not sure what the tangible benefits of this approach are.

But I still have the following question:\n\n-- The response said a first contribution is a different formulation: you divide the word embedding learning into two steps, step 1 looks for a low-rank X (by Riemannian optimization), step 2 factorizes X into two matrices (W, C). You are claiming that your model outperforms previous approaches that directly optimizes over (W, C). But since the end result (the factors) is the same, can the authors provide some intuition and justification why the proposed method works better?\n\nAs far as I can see, though parameterized differently, the first step of your method and previous methods (SGD) are both optimizing over low-rank matrices. Admittedly, Riemannian optimization avoids the rotational degree of freedom (the invertible matrix S you are mentioning in sec 2.3), but I am not 100% certain at this point this is the source of your gain; learning curves of objectives would help to see if Riemannian optimization is indeed more effective. \n\n-- Another detail I could not easily find is the following. You said a disadvantage of other approaches is that their factors W and C do not directly reflect similarity. Did you try to multiply the factors W and C from other optimizers and then factorize the product using the method in section 2.3, and use the new W for your downstream tasks? I am not sure if this would cause much difference in the performance.\n\nOverall, I think it is always interesting to apply advanced optimization techniques to machine learning problems. The current paper would be stronger from the machine learning perspective, if more thorough comparison and discussion (as mentioned above) are provided.
