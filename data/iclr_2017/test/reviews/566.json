{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Introducing Active Learning for CNN under the light of Variational Inference", "abstract": "One main concern of the deep learning community is to increase the capacity of representation of deep networks by increasing their depth. This requires to scale up the size of the training database accordingly. Indeed a major intuition lies in the fact that the depth of the network and the size of the training set are strongly correlated. However recent works tend to show that deep learning may be handled with smaller dataset as long as the training samples are carefully selected (let us mention for instance curriculum learning). In this context we introduce a scalable and efficient active learning method that can be applied to most neural networks, especially Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first of its kind to design an active learning selection scheme based on a variational inference for neural networks. We also deduced a formulation of the posterior and prior distributions of the weights using statistical knowledge on the Maximum Likelihood Estimator. We describe our strategy to come up with our active learning criterion. We assess its consistency by checking the accuracy obtained by successive active learning steps on two benchmark datasets MNIST and USPS. We also demonstrate its scalability towards increasing training set size.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "This paper introduces a mechanism for active learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). I would not go as far as the authors in calling these \"deep\", seeing that they seem to have only 2 hidden layers with only 20 filters each.
