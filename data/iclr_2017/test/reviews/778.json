{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Ternary Weight Decomposition and Binary Activation Encoding for Fast and Compact Neural Network", "abstract": "This paper aims to reduce test-time computational load of a deep neural network. Unlike previous methods which factorize a weight matrix into multiple real-valued matrices, our method factorizes both weights and activations into integer and noninteger components. In our method, the real-valued weight matrix is approximated by a multiplication of a ternary matrix and a real-valued co-efficient matrix. Since the ternary matrix consists of three integer values, {-1, 0, +1}, it only consumes 2 bits per element. At test-time, an activation vector that passed from a previous layer is also transformed into a weighted sum of binary vectors, {-1, +1}, which enables fast feed-forward propagation based on simple logical operations: AND, XOR, and bit count. This makes it easier to deploy a deep network on low-power CPUs or to design specialized hardware. In our experiments, we tested our method on three different networks: a CNN for handwritten digits, VGG-16 model for ImageNet classification, and VGG-Face for large-scale face recognition. In particular, when we applied our method to three fully connected layers in the VGG-16, 15x acceleration and memory compression up to 5.2% were achieved with only a 1.43% increase in the top-5 error. Our experiments also revealed that compressing convolutional layers can accelerate inference of the entire network in exchange of slight increase in error.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "This paper explores a new quantization method for both the weights and the activations that does not need re-training. In VGG-16 the method reaches compression ratios of 20x and experiences a speed-up of 15x. The paper is very well written and clearly exposes the details of the methodology and the results.\n\nMy major criticisms are three-fold: for one, the results are not compared to one of the many other pruning methods that are described in section 1.1, and as such the performance of the method is difficult to judge from the paper alone. Second, there have been several other compression schemes involving pruning, re-training and vector-quantization [e.g. 1, 2, 3] that seem to achieve much higher accuracies, compression ratios and speed-ups. Hence, for the practical application of running such networks on low-power, low-memory devices, other methods seem to be much more suited. The advantage of the given method - other then possibly reducing the time it takes to compress the network - is thus unclear. In particular, taking a pre-trained network as a starting point for a quantized model that is subsequently fine-tuned might not take much longer to process then the method given here (but maybe the authors can quantify this?). Finally, much of the speed-up and memory reduction in the VGG-model seems to arise from the three fully-connected layers, in particular the last one. The speed-up in the convolutional layers is comparably small, making me wonder how well the method would work in all-convolutional networks such as the Inception architecture.\n\n[1] Deep Compression: Compressing Deep Neural Networks with Pruning, Trained Quantization and Huffman Coding,"}, {"DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "comments": "The paper presents a method for quantizing neural network weights and activations.
