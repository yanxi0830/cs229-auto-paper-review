{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Multi-label learning with the RNNs for Fashion Search", "abstract": "We build a large-scale visual search system which finds similar product images given a fashion item. Defining similarity among arbitrary fashion-products is still remains a challenging problem, even there is no exact ground-truth. To resolve this problem, we define more than 90 fashion-related attributes, and combination of these attributes can represent thousands of unique fashion-styles. We then introduce to use the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) recognising multi fashion-attributes with the end-to-end manner. To build our system at scale, these fashion-attributes are again used to build an inverted indexing scheme. In addition to these fashion-attributes for semantic similarity, we extract colour and appearance features in a region-of-interest (ROI) of a fashion item for visual similarity. By sharing our approach, we expect active discussion on that how to apply current deep learning researches into the e-commerce industry.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "The manuscript is a bit scattered and hard to follow.
