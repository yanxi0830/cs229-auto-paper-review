{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Gaussian Attention Model and Its Application to Knowledge Base Embedding and Question Answering", "abstract": "We propose the Gaussian attention model for content-based neural memory access. With the proposed attention model, a neural network has the additional degree of freedom to control the focus of its attention from a laser sharp attention to a broad attention. It is applicable whenever we can assume that the distance in the latent space reflects some notion of semantics. We use the proposed attention model as a scoring function for the embedding of a knowledge base into a continuous vector space and then train a model that performs question answering about the entities in the knowledge base. The proposed attention model can handle both the propagation of uncertainty when following a series of relations and also the conjunction of conditions in a natural way. On a dataset of soccer players who participated in the FIFA World Cup 2014, we demonstrate that our model can handle both path queries and conjunctive queries well.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "SUMMARY.\n\nThe paper propose a new scoring function for knowledge base embedding.\nThe scoring function called TransGaussian is an novel take on (or a generalization of) the well-known TransE scoring function.\nThe proposed function is tested on two tasks knowledge-base completion and question answering.\n\n----------\n\nOVERALL JUDGMENT\nWhile I think this proposed work is very interesting and it is an idea worth to explore further, the presentation and the experimental section of the paper have some problems.\nRegarding the presentation, as far as I understand this is not an attention model as intended standardly in the literature.\nPlus, it has hardly anything to share with memory networks/neural Turing machines, the parallel that the authors try to make is not very convincing.\nRegarding the experimental section, for a fair comparison the authors should test their model on standard benchmarks, reporting state-of-the-art models.\nFinally, the paper lack of discussion of results and insights on the behavior of the proposed model.\n\n\n----------\n\nDETAILED COMMENTS\n\n\nIn section 2.2 when the authors calculate \\mu_{context} do not they loose the order of relations?

More comments below:\n\n[Major comments]\n\n- My main concern is that that evaluation results are NOT strong. Either knowledge base completion or KB-based question answering, there are many existing and competitive benchmarks (e.g., FB15k / WebQuestions). Experimenting with such a tiny WordCup2014 dataset is not convincing.  Moreover, the questions are just generated by a few templates, which is far from NL questions. I am not even not sure why we need to apply an LSTM in such scenario. The paper would be much stronger if you can demonstrate its effectiveness on the above benchmarks. \n\n- Conjunctive queries:  the current model assumes that all the detected entities in the question could be aligned to one or more relations and we can take conjunctions in the end. This assumption might be not always correct, so it is more necessary to justify this on real QA datasets.\n\n- The model is named as  \u201cGaussian attention\u201d and I kind of think it is not very closely related to well-known attention mechanism, but more related to KB embedding literature.\n\n[Minor comments]\n- I find Figure 2 a bit confusing. The first row of orange blocks denote KB relations, and the second row of those denote every single word of the NL question.
