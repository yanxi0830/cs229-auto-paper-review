{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "What does it take to generate natural textures?", "abstract": "Natural image generation is currently one of the most actively explored fields in Deep Learning. Many approaches, e.g. for state-of-the-art artistic style transfer or natural texture synthesis, rely on the statistics of hierarchical representations in supervisedly trained deep neural networks. It is, however, unclear what aspects of this feature representation are crucial for natural image generation: is it the depth, the pooling or the training of the features on natural images? We here address this question for the task of natural texture synthesis and show that none of the above aspects are indispensable. Instead, we demonstrate that natural textures of high perceptual quality can be generated from networks with only a single layer, no pooling and random filters.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "The framework of Gatys et al. demonstrated that correlation statistics (empirical Gram matrices) of deep feature responses provide an excellent characterisation of visual textures. This paper investigates in detail which kind of deep or shallow networks may work well in this framework. One of the main findings is that that very shallow nets, consisting of a single filter bank with random weights, work surprisingly well, and for simple and regular textures may produce results which are visually superior to complex data-adapted filters such as the ones in networks like VGG-19. More broadly, the paper contains an interesting and informative discussion on the strength and limitations on such methods for texture synthesis.\n\nFigure 4 shows that the optimisation of images with respect to shallow filter banks may result in texture images that have a lower VGG-19 loss than optimising the VGG-19 objective directly. This is imputed to the difficulty of optimising the highly non-linear VGG-19 cost function, which is a reasonable explanation. In the new supplementary material, the authors show that better optimisation results can be obtained by initialising the VGG-19-based optimisation with the shallow network optimisation results, which is a useful complement to the original experiments.\n\nThe main limitation of the paper is that it does not systematically compare different methods against a quantifiable objective. It is trivial to define image statistics that would allow to simply generate an exact copy of any reference texture, hence with very good visual quality. Such trivial statistics would also be very shallow. The aim is instead to capture a texture distribution, and measuring how well a method meets this challenge remains an open problem. Hence, while the empirical results seem to confirm the intuition that simple statistics are good enough for texture synthesis both in terms of quality and diversity (when compared to more complex statistics), it is difficult to conclusively confirm that this is the case.\n\nThe authors indicate that diversity could be measured in terms of entropy. This is reasonable, but, as they acknowledge in their answers to questions, difficult to do in practice. Furthermore, this would still not account for the other aspect of the problem, namely visual quality. They also suggest to perform a psychophysical assessment, which may be the only practical way of addressing this problem, but deem that to be material for future work.\n\nOverall, since evaluation of image generation is such an hard problem, I think the paper still has sufficient strengths to warrant publication in ICLR. Still, some form of psychophysical assessment would be useful to confirm the intuitions that, at present, can only be obtained by inspecting the figure sin the paper and in the supplementary material."}, {"DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "comments": "The authors agreed that the paper presented a solid contribution and interesting (and somewhat surprising findings).
