{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Investigating Different Context Types and Representations for Learning Word Embeddings", "abstract": "The number of word embedding models is growing every year. Most of them learn word embeddings based on the co-occurrence information of words and their context. However, it's still an open question what is the best definition of context. We provide the first systematical investigation of different context types and representations for learning word embeddings. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate their effectiveness under 4 tasks (21 datasets), which give us some insights about context selection. We hope that this paper, along with the published code, can serve as a guideline of choosing context for our community.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "comments": "Reviewers agree that the findings are not clear enough to be of interest, though the effort to do a controlled study is appreciated.", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 pcs"}, {"DATE": "14 Jan 2017", "TITLE": "GloVe model", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "comments": "\nDear reviewers,\n\nWe have analyzed GloVe model and updated our paper:\n   -The overall tendency of GloVe with different contexts is similar to Skip-Gram. \n   -GloVe is more sensitive to different contexts than Skip-Gram and CBOW, which is probably due to its explicitly defined/optimized objective function.\nPlease see our revised paper for more details.\n\nThe source code at Github is also updated to support GloVe.
