{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "SqueezeNet: AlexNet-level accuracy with 50x fewer parameters and <0.5MB model size", "abstract": "Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving accuracy. For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify multiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent accuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1) Smaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed training. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from the cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on FPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these advantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet achieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters. Additionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress SqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510x smaller than AlexNet).", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "Strengths\n\uf06e-- An interesting proposal for a smaller CNN architecture designed for embedded CNN applications. \n\uf06e-- Balanced exploration of CNN macroarchitecture and microarchitecture with fire modules.\n\uf06e-- x50 less memory usage than AlexNet, keeping similar accuracy \n\uf06e-- strong experimental results\n\nWeaknesses\n\uf06e--Would be nice to test Sqeezenet on multiple tasks\n\n\uf06e--lack of insights and rigorous analysis into what factors are responsible for the success of SqueezeNet.
