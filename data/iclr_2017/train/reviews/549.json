To use these codes for discriminative classification, we describe a model we term Energy-Based Spherical Sparse Coding (EB-SSC) in which the hypothesized class label introduces a learned linear bias into the coding step. We evaluate and visualize performance of stacking this encoder to make a deep layered model for image classification.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "First, I'd like to thank the authors for their answers and clarifications.\nI find, the presentation of the multi-stage version of the model much clearer now.\n\nPros:\n\n+ The paper states a sparse coding problem using cosine loss, which allows to solve the problem in a single pass.\n\n+ The energy-based formulation allows bi-directional coding that incorporates top-down and bottom-up information in the feature extraction process. \n\nCons:\n\n+ The cost of running the evaluation could be large in the  multi-class setting, rendering the approach less attractive and the computational cost comparable to recurrent architectures.\n\n+ While the model is competitive and improves over the baseline, the paper would be more convincing with other comparisons (see text).
