{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Modular Multitask Reinforcement Learning with Policy Sketches", "abstract": "We describe a framework for multitask deep reinforcement learning guided by policy sketches. Sketches annotate each task with a sequence of named subtasks, providing high-level structural relationships among tasks, but not providing the detailed guidance required by previous work on learning policy abstractions for RL (e.g. intermediate rewards, subtask completion signals, or intrinsic motivations). Our approach associates every subtask with its own modular subpolicy, and jointly optimizes over full task-specific policies by tying parameters across shared subpolicies. This optimization is accomplished via a simple decoupled actor\u2013critic training objective that facilitates learning common behaviors from dissimilar reward functions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on a maze navigation game and a 2-D Minecraft-inspired crafting game. Both games feature extremely sparse rewards that can be obtained only after completing a number of high-level subgoals (e.g. escaping from a sequence of locked rooms or collecting and combining various ingredients in the proper order). Experiments illustrate two main advantages of our approach. First, we outperform standard baselines that learn task-specific or shared monolithic policies. Second, our method naturally induces a library of primitive behaviors that can be recombined to rapidly acquire policies for new tasks.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "The paper presents an approach to learning shared neural representations of temporal abstractions in hierarchical RL, based on actor-critic methods. The approach is illustrated in two tasks: gridworld with objects and a simplified Minecraft problem).  The idea of providing symbolic descriptions of tasks and learning corresponding \"implementations\" is potentially interesting and the empirical results are promising.  However, there are two main drawbacks of the current incarnation of this work.  First, the ideas presented in the paper have all been explored in other work (symbolic specifications, actor-critic, shared representations).  While related work is discussed, it is not really clear what is new here, and what is the main contribution of this work besides providing a new implementation of existing ideas in the context of deep learning. The main contribution if the work needs to be clearly spelled out.  Secondly, the approach presented relies crucially on curriculum learning (this is quite clear from the experiments).  While the authors argue that specifying tasks in simplified language is easy, designing a curriculum may in fact be pretty complicated, depending on the task at hand.  The examples provided are fairly small, and there is no hint of how curriculum can be designed for larger problems. Because the approach is sensitive to the curriculum, this limits the potential utility of the work. It is also unclear if there is a way to provide supervision automatically, instead of doing it based on prior domain knowledge.\nMore minor comments:\n- The experiments are not described in enough detail in the paper. It's great to provide github code, but one needs to explain in the paper why certain choices were made in the task setup (were these optimized? What's this the first thing that worked?)
