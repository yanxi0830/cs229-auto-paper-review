{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "A Convolutional Encoder Model for Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "The prevalent approach to neural machine translation relies on bi-directional LSTMs to encode the source sentence. In this paper we present a faster and simpler architecture based on a succession of convolutional layers.  This allows to encode the entire source sentence simultaneously compared to recurrent networks for which computation is constrained by temporal dependencies. On WMT'16 English-Romanian translation we achieve competitive accuracy to the state-of-the-art and we outperform several recently published results on the WMT'15 English-German task.  Our models obtain almost the same accuracy as a very deep LSTM setup on WMT'14 English-French translation. Our convolutional encoder speeds up CPU decoding by more than two times at the same or higher accuracy as a strong bi-directional LSTM baseline.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "This paper is the first (I believe) to establish a simple yet important result that Convnets for NMT encoders can be competitive to RNNs.
