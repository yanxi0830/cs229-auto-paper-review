{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Bridging Nonlinearities and Stochastic Regularizers with Gaussian Error Linear Units", "abstract": "We propose the Gaussian Error Linear Unit (GELU), a high-performing neural network activation function. The GELU nonlinearity is the expected transformation of a stochastic regularizer which randomly applies the identity or zero map to a neuron's input. This stochastic regularizer is comparable to nonlinearities aided by dropout, but it removes the need for a traditional nonlinearity. The connection between the GELU and the stochastic regularizer suggests a new probabilistic understanding of nonlinearities. We perform an empirical evaluation of the GELU nonlinearity against the ReLU and ELU activations and find performance improvements across all tasks.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "Approaches like adaptive dropout also have the binary mask as a function of input to a neuron very similar to the proposed approach.
