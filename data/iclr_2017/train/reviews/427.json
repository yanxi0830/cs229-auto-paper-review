{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Visualizing Deep Neural Network Decisions: Prediction Difference Analysis", "abstract": "This article presents the prediction difference analysis method for visualizing the response of a deep neural network to a specific input. When classifying images, the method highlights areas in a given input image that provide evidence for or against a certain class. It overcomes several shortcoming of previous methods and provides great additional insight into the decision making process of classifiers. Making neural network decisions interpretable through visualization is important both to improve models and to accelerate the adoption of black-box classifiers in application areas such as medicine. We illustrate the method in experiments on natural images (ImageNet data), as well as medical images (MRI brain scans).", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "The authors of this work propose an interesting approach to visualizing the predictions made by a deep neural network. The manuscript is well written is provides good insight into the problem. I also appreciate the application to medical images, as simply illustrating the point on ImageNet isn't interesting enough. I do have some questions and comments.\n1.  As the authors correctly point out in 3.1, approximating the conditional probability of a feature x_i by the marginal distribution p(x_i) is not realistic. They advocate for translation invariance, i.e. the position of the pixel in the image shouldn't affect the probability, and suggest that the pixels appearance depends on the small neighborhood around it. However, it is well known that global context makes an big impact on the semantics of pixels. In \"Objects in Contexts\", authors show that a given neighborhood of pixels can take different semantic meanings based on the global context in the image. In the context of deep neural networks, works such as \"ParseNet\" also illustrate the importance of global context on the spatial label distribution.
