{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Inverse Problems in Computer Vision using  Adversarial  Imagination Priors", "abstract": "Given an image,  humans  effortlessly run the image formation process backwards in their minds: they can tell albedo from shading,  foreground from background, and imagine the occluded parts of the scene behind foreground objects. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised inversion machine trained to generate similar imaginations that when rendered using differentiable, graphics-like decoders, produce the original visual input. We constrain the imagination spaces by providing exemplar memory repositories in the form of foreground segmented objects, albedo, shading, background scenes and imposing adversarial losses on the imagination spaces. Our model learns to perform such inversion with weak supervision, without ever having seen paired annotated data, that is, without having seen the image paired with the corresponding ground-truth imaginations. We demonstrate our method by applying it to three  Computer Vision tasks: image in-painting, intrinsic decomposition and object segmentation, each task having its own differentiable renderer.  Data driven adversarial imagination priors  effectively guide inversion,  minimize the need for hand designed priors of smoothness or good continuation, or the need for paired annotated data.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "The paper describes a network architecture for inverse problems in computer vision.

The adversarial prior has a convolutional form matching local image statistics, rather than the entire image.  The particular form of network architecture with the memory-based fully convolutional adversarial loss appears to be novel and potentially interesting.\n\n- Motivation for the Architecture. The weakest point of the proposed architecture is the \"Memory retrieval engine\" R (section 2.4),\nwhere images are retrieved from the memory by measuring L2 distance on pixel intensities. While this maybe ok for simple problems considered in this work, it is unclear how this can generalize to other more complicated datasets and problems.  \nThis should be better discussed, better justified and ideally results in some more realistic set-up shown (see below).\n\n\nQuality:\n- Experiments. Results are shown for inpainting of MNIST digits, intrinsic image decomposition on the MIT intrinsic image database, and figure/ground layer extraction on the synthesized dataset of 3D chairs rendered onto background from real photographs.  \n The experimental validation of the model is not very strong and proof-of-concept only. All the experiments are performed in simplified toy set-ups. The MNIST digit inpainting is far from current state-of-the-art on image inpainting in real photographs (see e.g. Pathak et al., 2016). The foreground background separation is done on  only synthetically generated test data. Even for intrinsic image demposition problem there is now relatively large-scale dataset of (Bell et al., 2014), see the citation below.  \n\nWhile this is probably ok for the ICLR paper, it diminishes the significance of the work. Is this model going to be useful in a real settings? One possibility to address this would be to focus on one of the problems and show results on a challenging state-of-the-art data.
