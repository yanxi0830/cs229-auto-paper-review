{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Entropy-SGD: Biasing Gradient Descent Into Wide Valleys", "abstract": "This paper proposes a new optimization algorithm called Entropy-SGD for training deep neural networks that is motivated by the local geometry of the energy landscape. Local extrema with low generalization error have a large proportion of almost-zero eigenvalues in the Hessian with very few positive or negative eigenvalues. We leverage upon this observation to construct a local-entropy-based objective function that favors well-generalizable solutions lying in large flat regions of the energy landscape, while avoiding poorly-generalizable solutions located in the sharp valleys. Conceptually, our algorithm resembles two nested loops of SGD where we use Langevin dynamics in the inner loop to compute the gradient of the local entropy before each update of the weights. We show that the new objective has a smoother energy landscape and show improved generalization over SGD using uniform stability, under certain assumptions. Our experiments on convolutional and recurrent neural networks demonstrate that Entropy-SGD compares favorably to state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generalization error and training time.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "__Note__: An earlier version of the review (almost identical to the present one) for an earlier version of the paper (available on arXiV) can be found here:"}, {"DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "comments": "This paper presents both an analysis of neural net optimization landscapes, and an optimization algorithm that encourages movement in directions of high entropy.

This increases the scope parameter \\gamma as training progresses instead of fixing it and has the effect of exploring the parameter space in the beginning of training (Sec. 4.3). As a result of this, we can now train all our networks with only the local entropy loss instead of treating it as a regularizer (Eqn. 6).\n\nc) For a fair comparison of the training time, we now plot the error curves in Figs. 4, 5 and 6 against the \"effective number of epochs\", i.e., the number of epochs of Entropy-SGD is multiplied by the number of Langevin iterations L (we set L=1 for SGD/Adam). Thus the x-axis is a direct measure of the wall-clock time agnostic to the underlying implementation and is proportional to the number of back-props as suggested.\n\nWe obtain significant speed-ups with respect to our earlier results due to scoping and the wall-clock training time for all our networks with Entropy-SGD is now comparable to SGD/Adam.

While smoothing the original loss function using convolutions or averaging the gradient over perturbations of weights reduces the ruggedness of the energy landscape, it does not help with sharp, narrow valleys. Local entropy introduces a measure that focuses on wide local minima in the energy landscape (cf. Fig. 2 which has a \"global\" minimum at a wide valley); this is the primary reason for its efficacy. Smoothing the loss function can also, for instance, generate an artificial local minimum between two close by sharp valleys, which is detrimental to generalization.\n\n>> unrealistic eigenvalue assumption in Sec. 4.3\nWe have clarified this point in Remark 4. Our analysis employs an assumption that the Hessian \\nabla^2 f(x) does not have eigenvalues in the set [-2\\gamma-c, c] for some c > 0. This is admittedly unrealistic, for instance, the eigenspectrum of the Hessian in Fig. 1 has a large fraction of its eigenvalues almost zero. Let us note though that Fig. 1 is plotted at a local minimum, from our experiments, the eigenspectrum is less sparse in the beginning of training.\n\nWe would like to remark that the bound on uniform stability in Thm. 3 by Hardt et al. assumes global conditions on the smoothness of the loss function; one imagines that Eqn. 9 remains qualitatively the same (in particular, with respect to the number of training iterations) even if this assumption is violated to an extent before convergence happens.

Vanilla SGD requires a single forward pass through all M minibatches during one epoch for a parameter update, but the new method, E-SGD requires, L*M forward passes during one epoch where L is the number of Langevin updates, which require a minibatch sample each.

So It seems bizarre that you would compare Adam against a complicated method with SGLD in the inner loop, without comparing against the much simpler SGLD as well.\n\nFinally, it's frustrating that you discuss free energy and entropy at length in words without giving their precise definitions.  If you did so, I suspect it would become clear that you're proposing maximizing the marginal likelihood, which is definitely a great idea but already well-known.  How does the entropy you optimize relate to the marginal likelihood and the variational ELBO?", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference"}, {"DATE": "02 Dec 2016", "TITLE": "Allowing eigenvalues with mixed signs?", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "comments": "", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2"}, {"DATE": "13 Nov 2016", "TITLE": "updates to the paper", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "comments": "We have updated the \"Related work\" section of the paper with a discussion of [HS97] and [KS16].\n\n[HS97] Hochreiter, Sepp, and J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber. \"Flat minima.\" Neural Computation 9.1 (1997): 1-42.\n[KS16] Keskar, Nitish Shirish, et al. \"On Large-Batch Training for Deep Learning: Generalization Gap and Sharp Minima.\" arXiv:1609.04836 (2016).", "OTHER_KEYS": "Pratik A Chaudhari"}, {"DATE": "08 Nov 2016", "TITLE": "Relation to \"Flat Minimum Search\"", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "comments": "Very interesting paper.
