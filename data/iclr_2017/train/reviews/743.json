Given an algorithm, which we take to be both the optimization routine and the form of the random landscape, the fluctuations of the halting time follow a distribution that remains unchanged even when the input is changed drastically. We observe two main classes, a Gumbel-like distribution that appears in Google searches, human decision times, QR factorization and spin glasses, and a Gaussian-like distribution that appears in conjugate gradient method, deep network with MNIST input data and deep network with random input data. This empirical evidence suggests presence of a class of distributions for which the halting time is independent of the underlying distribution under some conditions.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "The idea of universality that is independent of input distribution and dimension, depending only on the algorithm is an appealing one.

One could use this to conclude that the power method is naive. Therefore the presence of universality is a desirable feature of a numerical method\u201d\n\nNo. An algorithm is naive if there are better ways to answer the problem. One could not conclude from a halting time with infinite expectation (e.g. solving a problem extremely quickly 99% of the time, and looping forever in 1% of cases) or infinite variance, that the algorithm is naive.\u2028\nMoreover the universal property is more restrictive than having a finite halting time expectation. Even if in many specific cases, having a finite halting time expectation is a desirable property, showing that the presence of universality is desirable would require a demonstration that the other more restrictive aspects are also desirable.\u2028\nAlso, the paragraph only concerns one algorithm. why would the conclusions generalise to all numerical methods ?\u2028\nEven if the universality property is arguably desirable (i.e. event if the conclusion of this paragraph is assumed correct), the paragraph does not support the given conclusion.\n\n\n\nComparing Eq 1 and figures 2,3,4,5\u2028\nFrom Eq 1, universality means that the centered/scaled halting time fluctuations (which depend on A, epsilon, N, E) can be approximated by a distribution that only depends on A (not on epsilon, N, E) but in the experiments only E varies (figures 2,3,4,5).

However, I would like to describe a hypothesis/counter-example and I hope you will\neasily reject it. Otherwise, I will fail to see any universality in the discussed \"universality in halting time\".\n\nI would like to present a toy minimization problem where f(x) is defined in [0,1] and has two global\noptima in 0.0 and 1.0 respectively. f(x) has its maximum in 0.5 but f(x) decays somewhat differently to the \"left\"\nand to the \"right\" optima. These somewhat different decays (shapes of f(x)) impact the way some optimizer A minimizes\nf(x). My A can be e.g. a deterministic local search algorithm such that if it is initialized in the basin of attraction [0,0.5], it will stay/search there. Thus, the starting position will determine in which global optima it will end up. To observe the halting distribution, I run A starting from different starting positions generated uniformly at random in [0,1]. I expect the halting distribution to have two peaks: the first peak corresponds to a typical number of iterations required to reach some epsilon around the \"left\" optima, the second peak would correspond to the \"right\" optima. Question: Why there are two peaks and not one? Answer: Because, as mentioned before, the shapes/decays of f(x) on the left and right side are different and this affects our algorithm A, i.e., the number of iterations to reach some epsilon precision. Question: Is this a problem to have two peaks in the halting distribution not like the ones shown in figures? Answer: No, it is perfectly fine. What is not fine is that when I run the same algorithm A on another problem which is unimodal, then I will get a completely different halting distribution, e.g., like the \"one peak\" ones shown in the paper. Question: Where is the problem? Answer: The problem is that these observations contradict the discussed universality in halting time distribution which is an intrinsic thing to A and does not depend on the problem. Question: This was stated for large dimension N and not one-dimensional problem. Answer: Increase the dimensionality of the toy problem preserving the idea of the two (multiple) optima with, e.g., basins of attraction of equal size (keep in mind the  course of dimensionality). Question: There is a restriction on the class of ensembles E. Answer: If we restrict our-self to unimodal problems then I barely see \"universality\". Moreover, unimodal non-convex problems may exhibit the same properties as multi-modal ones, e.g., make a horizontal one-dimensional slice of 2-dimensional Rosenbrock function. Question: Why we see these nice-looking distribution for very different problems? Answer: because for some problems the multi-modality is negligeable and the dynamical system behind the optimizer may behave similarly for different values of N, especially for the large ones. Nevertheless, to claim it to be the \"universal law\" is misleading since it depends on the properties of the problem at hand and is not strictly intrinsic to the optimizer. Moreover, for the same (class of) problem the landscape may qualitatively change with increasing N. Rosenbrock function is a good example, it is uni-modal for 2 variables and multi-modal for multiple variables which would affect the halting time distribution.
