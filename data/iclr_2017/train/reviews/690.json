{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "An Analysis of Deep Neural Network Models for Practical Applications", "abstract": "Since the emergence of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) as a prominent technique in the field of computer vision, the ImageNet classification challenge has played a major role in advancing the state-of-the-art. While accuracy figures have steadily increased, the resource utilisation of winning models has not been properly taken into account. In this work, we present a comprehensive analysis of important metrics in practical applications: accuracy, memory footprint, parameters, operations count, inference time and power consumption. Key findings are: (1) power consumption is independent of batch size and architecture; (2) accuracy and inference time are in a hyperbolic relationship; (3) energy constraint are an upper bound on the maximum achievable accuracy and model complexity; (4) the number of operations is a reliable estimate of the inference time. We believe our analysis provides a compelling set of information that helps design and engineer efficient DNNs.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "A few issues with this paper:\n1- I find finding #2 trivial and unworthy of mention, but the author don't seem to agree with me that it is.

These cluster in the upper left corner of Figure 9 and on their own do not seem to show too much of a linear behaviour.
