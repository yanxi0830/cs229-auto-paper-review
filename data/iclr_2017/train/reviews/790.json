{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Learning to Protect Communications with Adversarial Neural Cryptography", "abstract": "We ask whether neural networks can learn to use secret keys to protect information from other neural networks.  Specifically, we focus on ensuring confidentiality properties in a multiagent system, and we specify those properties in terms of an adversary.  Thus, a system may consist of neural networks named Alice and Bob, and we aim to limit what a third neural network named Eve learns from eavesdropping on the communication between Alice and Bob. We do not prescribe specific cryptographic algorithms to these neural networks; instead, we train end-to-end, adversarially. We demonstrate that the neural networks can learn  how to perform forms of encryption and decryption, and also how to apply these operations selectively in order to meet confidentiality goals.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "This paper proposed to use GAN for encrypted communications.\n\nIn section 2, the authors proposed a 3 part neural network trained to encode and decode data.

It considers the standard scenario of Alice, Eve and Bob, where A and B aim to exchange messages conditioned on a shared key, while Eve should be unable to encrypt the message. Experiments are performed in a simple symmetric 16 bit encryption task, and an application on privacy. The concepts, ideas and previous literature are quite nicely and carefully presented.\n\nThe only major concern I have - and I apologize to the authors for not raising this earlier - are the experiments in section 3. In particular, I don't quite get the scenario. The reasoning here seems to be as follows: given information < A, B, C, D >, I want to give the public the value of D (e.g. movies watched) without releasing information about C (e.g. gender). In this scenario, Eve would need to be able to reconstruct D as good as possible without gaining information about C. What is described in section 3, however, is that D and D-public are both reconstructed by Bob, but why would Bob reconstruct the latter (he is not public, in particular because he is allowed to reconstruct C, which is not tested here)? Also, Eve only tries to estimate C, thus rendering the scenario not different in any way to the scenario considered in section 2.\n\nI have two more minor concerns:\n\n1) As raised in the pre-review, Eve should actually be stronger then Alice and Bob in order to be able to compensate for the missing key. The authors noted they have been doing these experiments and are going to add the results.\n\n2) In any natural encryption case I would expect the length of the key to be much shorter then the length of the message. This, however, could potentially make the scenario much easier for Eve (although I doubt any of the results will change if the key is long enough).\n\nI like the creative application of adversarial training to a completely different domain, and I believe it could be the starting point of a very interesting direction in cryptographic systems or in privacy applications (although it is unclear whether the weak guarantees of neural network based approaches can ever be overcome). At the same time the application in the privacy setting leaves me quite confused, and the symmetric encryption example is not particularly strong either. I'd appreciate if the authors could address the major concern I raised above, and I will be quite happy to raise the score in case this confusion can be resolved.", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 6, "DATE": "16 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 3}, {"TITLE": "No Title", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "comments": "This paper proposed to use GAN for encrypted communications.\n\nIn section 2, the authors proposed a 3 part neural network trained to encode and decode data.
