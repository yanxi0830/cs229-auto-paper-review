{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Variational Recurrent Adversarial Deep Domain Adaptation", "abstract": "We study the problem of learning domain invariant representations for time series data while transferring the complex temporal latent dependencies between the domains. Our model termed as Variational Recurrent Adversarial Deep Domain Adaptation (VRADA) is built atop a variational recurrent neural network (VRNN) and trains adversarially to capture complex temporal relationships that are domain-invariant. This is (as far as we know) the first to capture and transfer temporal latent dependencies in multivariate time-series data. Through experiments on real-world multivariate healthcare time-series datasets, we empirically demonstrate that learning temporal dependencies helps our model's ability to create domain-invariant representations, allowing our model to outperform current state-of-the-art deep domain adaptation approaches.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "This paper combines variational RNN (VRNN) and domain adversarial networks (DANN) for domain adaptation in the sequence modelling domain.

We have incorporated your suggestions to improve our paper.\n\nFirst, we would like to clarify the key contributions of our paper. Motivated by challenges within the healthcare domain, we are proposing a novel unsupervised deep domain adaptation framework for knowledge transfer within healthcare time series data. The framework 1) captures temporal dependencies present in the time series data, and 2) transfers these dependencies from  the source to target domain via adversarial training, and 3) is able to obtain state-of-the-art results, outperforming previous domain adaptation approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that complex temporal latent dependencies have been used to transfer knowledge in healthcare multivariate time series data. It is worth noting that our domain adaptation framework is general and is suitable for applications where dependencies are present in the multivariate time series data. \n\nThe other major contribution of our work is moreso from an applications perspective. Healthcare data is a new frontier for machine learning. The data we worked with is complex: it\u2019s temporal, it's multivariate, and it\u2019s noisy,. Healthcare data is also quite different from the data that machine learning scientists are accustomed to working with. The dataset we used (which is the largest publicly available medical data healthset) only have a few thousand training examples (which we then further subdivided into multiple domains). This is considered a small dataset. Further, domain adaptation is typically done when there are ample unlabeled target examples which can be used to learn some mutual representation. We did not have this luxury. Despite, our model outperformed all other models.\n\nWe have uploaded a revised draft to address the questions and comments of the reviewers. In the revised draft, we have added an appendix section with the following new results:\n- Discussion on different training methods for our VRADA model and their results\n- Results on variations of VRADA model including\n  --- Adversarial training at each time step\n  --- Impact of adversarial training on the memory cell state visualizations\n  --- Study on the effect of reconstruction loss on the prediction performance\n- R-DANN model architecture block diagram\n", "OTHER_KEYS": "Sanjay Purushotham"}, {"TITLE": "Interesting applications but with unconvincing results", "RECOMMENDATION_UNOFFICIAL": 3, "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer1", "comments": "The work combines variational recurrent neural networks, and adversarial neural networks to handle domain adaptation for time series data.

It extends VRNN with adversarial training for learning domain agnostic representations. From the experimental results, the proposed method clearly out-performs competing algorithms. However, it is not clear where the advantage is coming from. The only difference between the proposed method and R-DANN is using variational RNN vs RNN.
