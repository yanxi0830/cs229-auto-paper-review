We address those points here.\n\nReviewer 1:\n* Idea somewhat incremental (e.g. can be seen as derivative from Bell 2016).\n \nReviewer 2:\n* Regarding novelty, the idea of combining a recurrent layer with a CNN, something practically very similar was proposed in Bell et al (2016). There are a few technical differences (e.g. cascading versus applying in parallel the recurrent layers), but in my understanding these are minor changes. The idea of initializing the recurrent network with the CNN is reasonable but is at the level of improving one wrong choice in the original work of Bell, rather than really proposing something novel.\n \nReviewer 3:\n* Contributions relative to, e.g. Bell et al., are minor.\n\nResponse:\nIn our paper, the proposed L-RNN module aims to be general; it can be inserted at any stage in the architectures for capturing contextual information at multiple levels.\n\nTo be clear on the differences:\n\n1. Interleaving CNN with L-RNN modules:\nIn Bell et al., the spatial RNNs are applied on top of CNN features (VGG-net) to learn contextual information at the final stage. A similar idea was also proposed in ReSeg (Visin et al. 2016).\nOur paper goes further than Bell et al. or Visin et al. by interleaving the CNN and LRNN modules at multiple levels of the network.\nIn consequence, the network is capable of learning representations from both local and larger context at every layer, alleviating the limitations of a fixed kernel size.\n \n2. How L-RNNs are inserted and initialized:\nUnder the scenario when the amount of data is limited, e.g. detection in Bell et al, semantic segmentation in our case.\nIn Bell et al., the authors take pre-trained CNN networks (VGG-16 up to conv5), and then train spatial RNNs on top of the pre-computed features.\nIn contrast, we show that a L-RNN can be directly inserted and trained within existing convolutional layers. This means that we increase the representational power of the pre-trained model directly. All layers in the pre-trained networks can therefore be adapted efficiently.\n\nIn our case, we re-purpose several layers in the pre-trained network as L-RNN modules at multiple levels, e.g. after pool3, pool4, and the final fully connected layers. As a result, we get a performance boost of 5% (mean IOU).\n \n3. Choice of RNNs.\nIn Bell et al., to avoid computational cost, the authors choose to use ReLU-based vanilla RNN (rather than GRU or LSTM).\nIn our paper, we validate this choice by showing that vanilla RNN with Layer Normalization (Ba et al. 2016) achieves similar performance to GRU.\n \n4. Separable Convolutions:\nIn Bell et al., 4 bidirectional spatial RNNs are applied to learn the global context. While in our paper, we propose to use 2, each bidirectional spatial RNNs is learning to approximate 1D convolutions, this idea comes from separable convolution.\n\n---- Comments on CIFAR classification experiments.\n \nReviewer 2:\n* Furthermore, as noted in my early question, Wide Residual Networks (Sergey Zagoruyko, Nikos Komodakis, BMVC16) report  better results on CIFAR-10 (4% error), while not using any recurrent layers (rather using instead a wide, VGG-type, ResNet variant). \nSo, the authors answer: \"Wide Residual Networks use the depth of the network to spread the receptive field across the entire image (DenseNet (Huang et al., 2016) similarly uses depth). Thus there is no need for recurrence within layers to capture contextual information. In contrast, we show that a shallow CNN, where the receptive field would be limited, can capture contextual information within the whole image if a L-RNN is used.\"\n \n* So, we agree that WRN do not need recurrence - and can still do better.\nThe point of my question has practically been whether using a recurrent layer is really necessary; I can understand the answer as being \"yes, if you want to keep your network shallow\".  I do not necessarily see why one would want to keep one's network shallow.\n \nReviewer 3:\n* One additional issue with the CIFAR experiments is that I expect to see a direct comparison of models A-F with and without L-RNN. It is hard to understand from the presented results if L-RNN actually adds much. In sum, I have a hard time taking away any valuable information from the CIFAR experiments.\n \nResponse:\nHere is a short summary of the discussion part of the CIFAR experiments (now included in  the updated paper).\n\nThe L-RNN module is a general computational module; it is not our intention to replace the deep networks (e.g. residual variants). \n\n1. Why only use shallow networks?\nIt is well known that deep networks can generally achieve better results than shallow ones. Thus, in our experiments, we use relatively shallow networks to avoid the possibility that the performance gain is due to network depth. Our experiments confirm that increasing the network depth by only adding low-level CNN modules below a L-RNN improves the results (Table 2, Network A to D)\n\n2. Interleaving L-RNN with CNN modules.\nWe show a comparison between a Baseline-CNN and Network-E in Table 2. Baseline-CNN is composed of 7 convolutional layers with 1.56M parameters, it achieves 8.48% top1 error. While the Network-E interleaved with CNN and L-RNN modules contains 0.97M parameters, achieving 5.96% top1 error. The difference between them is the added LRNN modules.\nMoreover, by adding more layers, Network F(5.39% top1 error) achieves comparable performance to ResNet-164 (5.46%). \n\n---- Questions related to ImageNet.\n\nReviewer 2:\n* Regarding the evaluation, experiments on CIFAR are interesting, but only as proof of concept.\n* Probably an evaluation on imageNet would bring some more insight about the merit of this layer.\n \nReviewer 3:\n* Classification experiments are not convincing.\n* I am generally skeptical of the utility of classification experiments on CIFAR-10 when presented in isolation (e.g., no results on ImageNet too). The issue is that CIFAR-10 is not interesting as a task unto itself *and* methods that work well on CIFAR-10 do not necessarily generalize to other tasks. ImageNet has been useful because, thus far, it produces features that generalize well to other tasks. Showing good results on ImageNet is much more likely to demonstrate a model that learns generalizable features. However, that is not even necessarily true, and ideally I would like to see that that a model that does well on ImageNet in fact transfers its benefit to at least one other tasks (e.g., detection).\n \nResponse:\nFurther experiments on ImageNet are definitely on the top list of our future work.\n\n---- Comments on Training Details.\n \nReviewer 1:\n* Section 5.2.1 (and appendix A), how is the learning rate increased and decreased? Manually ? This is an important detail that should be made explicit. Is the learning rate schedule the same in all experiments of each table? If there is a human in the loop, what is the variance in results between \u201ctwo human schedulers\u201d?\n \nReviewer 2:\n* Appendix A: this is very mysterious. Did you try other learning rate schedules? (e.g. polynomial)\n \nResponse:\nThe important message here is that restarting the learning rate several times can help the networks to escape saddle points or local minima.\nWe only experiment with the stepwise decay (no polynomial), and change the learning rate every 40, 60 or 80 epochs, we did not find much difference on this detail.\nWe only provide the intuitive explanation because it is not the main focus of this paper, it is just a training trick.

The objective is to combine the feature extraction abilities of CNNs with the ability of RNNs to gather global context information.\nThe authors validate their idea on two tasks, image classification (on CIFAR-10) and semantic segmentation (on PASCAL VOC12).\n\nOn the positive side, the paper is clear and well-written (apart from some occasional typos), the proposed idea is simple and could be adopted by other works, and can be deployed as a beneficial perturbation of existing systems, which is practically important if one wants to increase the performance of a system without retraining it from scratch. The evaluation is also systematic, providing a clear ablation study. \n\nOn the negative side, the novelty of the work is relatively limited, while the validation is lacking a bit. \nRegarding novelty, the idea of combining a recurrent layer with a CNN, something practically very similar was proposed in Bell et al (2016).

I do not necessarily see why one would want to keep one's network shallow.\n\nProbably an evaluation on imagenet would bring some more insight about the merit of this layer. \n\n\nRegarding semantic segmentation, one of my questions has been:\n\"Is the boost you are obtaining due to something special to the recurrent layer, or is simply because one is adding extra parameters on top of a pre-trained network? (I admit I may have missed some details of your experimental evaluation)\"\nThe answer was:\n\"...For PASCAL segmentation, we add the L-RNN into a pre-trained network (this adds recurrence parameters), and again show that this boosts performance - more so than adding the same number of parameters as extra CNN layers - as it is able to model long-range dependences\"\nI could not find one such experiment in the paper ('more so than adding the same number of parameters as extra CNN layers'); I understand that you have 2048 x 2048 connections for the recurrence, it would be interesting to see what you get by spreading them over (non-recurrent) residual layers.\nClearly, this is not going to be my criterion for rejection/acceptance, since one can easily make it fail - but I was mostly asking for some sanity check \n\nFurthermore, it is a bit misleading to put in Table 3 FCN-8s and FCN8s-LRNN, since this gives the impression that the LRNN gives a  boost by 10%. In practice the \"FCN8s\" prefix of \"FCN8s-LRNN\" is that of the authors, and not of Long et al (as indicated in Table 2, 8s original is quite worse than 8s here). \n\nAnother thing that is not clear to me is where the boost comes from in Table 2; the authors mention that \"when inserting the L-RNN after pool 3 and pool4 in FCN-8s, the L-RNN is able to learn contextual information over a much larger range than the receptive field of pure local convolutions. \"\nThis is potentially true, but I do not see why this was not also the case for FCN-32s (this is more a property of the recurrence rather than the 8/32 factor, right?)\n\nA few additional points: \nIt seems like Fig 2b and Fig2c never made it into the pdf. \n\nFigure 4 is unstructured and throws some 30 boxes to the reader - I would be surprised if anyone is able to get some information out of this (why not have a table?) \n\nAppendix A: this is very mysterious.

Bell et al. \"more substantial differences are two fold: first, we treat the L-RNN module as a general block, that can be inserted into any layer of a modern architecture, such as into a residual module. Second, we show (section 4) that the\nL-RNN can be formulated to be inserted into a pre-trained FCN (by initializing with zero recurrence\nmatrices), and that the entire network can then be fine-tuned end-to-end.\"\n\nI felt positive about these contributions after reading the intro, but then much less so after reading the experimental sections. Based on the first contribution (\"general block that can be inserted into any layer\"), I strongly expected to see the L-RNN block integrated throughout the CNN starting from near the input. However, the architectures for classification and segmentation only place the module towards the very end of the network. While not exactly the same as Bell et al. (there are many technical details that differ), it is close. The paper does not compare to the design from Bell et al. Is there any advantage to the proposed design? Or is it a variation that performs similarly? What happens if L-RNN is integrated earlier in the network, as suggested by the introduction?\n\nThe second difference is a bit more solid, but still does not rise to a 'substantive difference' in my view. Note that Bell et al. also integrate 1D RNNs into an ImageNet pretrained VGG-16 model. I do, however, think that the method of integration proposed in this paper (zero initialization) may be more elegant and does not require two-stage training by first freezing the lower layers and then later unfreezing them.\n\n(3) I am generally skeptical of the utility of classification experiments on CIFAR-10 when presented in isolation (e.g., no results on ImageNet too).

L-RNN modules are an alternative to deeper or wider networks, 2D RNNs, dilated (Atrous) convolutional layers, and a simple flatten or global pooling layer when applied to the last convolutional layer for classification. L-RNN modules are faster than 2D RNNs, since rows and columns can be processed in parallel, are easy to implemented, and can be inserted in existing convolutional networks. The authors demonstrate improvements for classification and semantic segmentation.\n\nHowever, further evaluations are required that show for which use cases L-RNNs are superior to alternatives for summarizing convolutional feature maps:\n\n1. I suggest to use a fixed CNN with as certain number of layers, and summarize the last feature map by a) a flatten layer, b) global average pooling, c) a 2D RNN, d) and dilated convolutional layers for segmentation. The authors should report both the run-time and number of parameters for these variants in addition to prediction performances. For segmentation, the number of dilated convolutional layers should be chosen such that the number of parameters is similar to a single L-RNN module.\n\n2. The authors compare classification performances only on 32x32 CIFAR-10 images. For higher resolution images, the benefit of L-RNN modules to capture long-range dependencies might be more pronounced. I therefore suggest evaluating classification performances on one additional dataset with higher resolution images, e.g. ImageNet or the CUB bird dataset.\n\nAdditionally, I have the following minor comments:\n\n3. The authors use vanilla RNNs. It might be worth investigating LSTMs or GRUs instead.\n\n4. For classification, the authors summarize hidden states of the final vertical recurrent layer by global max pooling. Is this different from more common global average pooling or concatenating the final forward and backward recurrent states?\n\n5.

A similar idea was also proposed in ReSeg (Visin et al. 2016).\nOur paper goes further than Bell et al. or Visin et al. by interleaving the CNN and LRNN modules at multiple levels of the network.\nIn consequence, the network is capable of learning representations from both local and larger context at every layer, alleviating the limitations of a fixed kernel size.\n \n2. How L-RNNs are inserted and initialized:\nUnder the scenario when the amount of data is limited, e.g. detection in Bell et al, semantic segmentation in our case.\nIn Bell et al., the authors take pre-trained CNN networks (VGG-16 up to conv5), and then train spatial RNNs on top of the pre-computed features.\nIn contrast, we show that a L-RNN can be directly inserted and trained within existing convolutional layers. This means that we increase the representational power of the pre-trained model directly. All layers in the pre-trained networks can therefore be adapted efficiently.\n\nIn our case, we re-purpose several layers in the pre-trained network as L-RNN modules at multiple levels, e.g. after pool3, pool4, and the final fully connected layers. As a result, we get a performance boost of 5% (mean IOU).\n \n3. Choice of RNNs.\nIn Bell et al., to avoid computational cost, the authors choose to use ReLU-based vanilla RNN (rather than GRU or LSTM).\nIn our paper, we validate this choice by showing that vanilla RNN with Layer Normalization (Ba et al. 2016) achieves similar performance to GRU.\n \n4. Separable Convolutions:\nIn Bell et al., 4 bidirectional spatial RNNs are applied to learn the global context. While in our paper, we propose to use 2, each bidirectional spatial RNNs is learning to approximate 1D convolutions, this idea comes from separable convolution.\n\n---- Comments on CIFAR classification experiments.\n \nReviewer 2:\n* Furthermore, as noted in my early question, Wide Residual Networks (Sergey Zagoruyko, Nikos Komodakis, BMVC16) report  better results on CIFAR-10 (4% error), while not using any recurrent layers (rather using instead a wide, VGG-type, ResNet variant). \nSo, the authors answer: \"Wide Residual Networks use the depth of the network to spread the receptive field across the entire image (DenseNet (Huang et al., 2016) similarly uses depth). Thus there is no need for recurrence within layers to capture contextual information. In contrast, we show that a shallow CNN, where the receptive field would be limited, can capture contextual information within the whole image if a L-RNN is used.\"\n \n* So, we agree that WRN do not need recurrence - and can still do better.\nThe point of my question has practically been whether using a recurrent layer is really necessary; I can understand the answer as being \"yes, if you want to keep your network shallow\".  I do not necessarily see why one would want to keep one's network shallow.\n \nReviewer 3:\n* One additional issue with the CIFAR experiments is that I expect to see a direct comparison of models A-F with and without L-RNN. It is hard to understand from the presented results if L-RNN actually adds much. In sum, I have a hard time taking away any valuable information from the CIFAR experiments.\n \nResponse:\nHere is a short summary of the discussion part of the CIFAR experiments (now included in  the updated paper).\n\nThe L-RNN module is a general computational module; it is not our intention to replace the deep networks (e.g. residual variants). \n\n1. Why only use shallow networks?\nIt is well known that deep networks can generally achieve better results than shallow ones. Thus, in our experiments, we use relatively shallow networks to avoid the possibility that the performance gain is due to network depth. Our experiments confirm that increasing the network depth by only adding low-level CNN modules below a L-RNN improves the results (Table 2, Network A to D)\n\n2. Interleaving L-RNN with CNN modules.\nWe show a comparison between a Baseline-CNN and Network-E in Table 2. Baseline-CNN is composed of 7 convolutional layers with 1.56M parameters, it achieves 8.48% top1 error. While the Network-E interleaved with CNN and L-RNN modules contains 0.97M parameters, achieving 5.96% top1 error. The difference between them is the added LRNN modules.\nMoreover, by adding more layers, Network F(5.39% top1 error) achieves comparable performance to ResNet-164 (5.46%). \n\n---- Questions related to ImageNet.\n\nReviewer 2:\n* Regarding the evaluation, experiments on CIFAR are interesting, but only as proof of concept.\n* Probably an evaluation on imageNet would bring some more insight about the merit of this layer.\n \nReviewer 3:\n* Classification experiments are not convincing.\n* I am generally skeptical of the utility of classification experiments on CIFAR-10 when presented in isolation (e.g., no results on ImageNet too). The issue is that CIFAR-10 is not interesting as a task unto itself *and* methods that work well on CIFAR-10 do not necessarily generalize to other tasks. ImageNet has been useful because, thus far, it produces features that generalize well to other tasks. Showing good results on ImageNet is much more likely to demonstrate a model that learns generalizable features. However, that is not even necessarily true, and ideally I would like to see that that a model that does well on ImageNet in fact transfers its benefit to at least one other tasks (e.g., detection).\n \nResponse:\nFurther experiments on ImageNet are definitely on the top list of our future work.\n\n---- Comments on Training Details.\n \nReviewer 1:\n* Section 5.2.1 (and appendix A), how is the learning rate increased and decreased? Manually ? This is an important detail that should be made explicit. Is the learning rate schedule the same in all experiments of each table?

Did you try other learning rate schedules? (e.g. polynomial)\n \nResponse:\nThe important message here is that restarting the learning rate several times can help the networks to escape saddle points or local minima.\nWe only experiment with the stepwise decay (no polynomial), and change the learning rate every 40, 60 or 80 epochs, we did not find much difference on this detail.\nWe only provide the intuitive explanation because it is not the main focus of this paper, it is just a training trick.

The objective is to combine the feature extraction abilities of CNNs with the ability of RNNs to gather global context information.\nThe authors validate their idea on two tasks, image classification (on CIFAR-10) and semantic segmentation (on PASCAL VOC12).\n\nOn the positive side, the paper is clear and well-written (apart from some occasional typos), the proposed idea is simple and could be adopted by other works, and can be deployed as a beneficial perturbation of existing systems, which is practically important if one wants to increase the performance of a system without retraining it from scratch. The evaluation is also systematic, providing a clear ablation study. \n\nOn the negative side, the novelty of the work is relatively limited, while the validation is lacking a bit. \nRegarding novelty, the idea of combining a recurrent layer with a CNN, something practically very similar was proposed in Bell et al (2016). There are a few technical differences (e.g. cascading versus applying in parallel the recurrent layers), but in my understanding these are minor changes. The idea of initializing the recurrent network with the CNN is reasonable but is at the level of improving one wrong choice in the original work of Bell, rather than really proposing something novel. \nThis contribution (\" we use RNNs within layers\") is repeatedly mentioned in the paper (including intro &  conclusion), but in my understanding was part of Bell et al, modulo minor changes. \n\nRegarding the evaluation, experiments on CIFAR are interesting, but only as proof of concept. \n\nFurthermore, as noted in my early question, Wide Residual Networks (Sergey Zagoruyko, Nikos Komodakis, BMVC16)\nreport  better results on CIFAR-10 (4% error), while not using any recurrent layers (rather using instead a wide, VGG-type, ResNet variant).

(I admit I may have missed some details of your experimental evaluation)\"\nThe answer was:\n\"...For PASCAL segmentation, we add the L-RNN into a pre-trained network (this adds recurrence parameters), and again show that this boosts performance - more so than adding the same number of parameters as extra CNN layers - as it is able to model long-range dependences\"\nI could not find one such experiment in the paper ('more so than adding the same number of parameters as extra CNN layers'); I understand that you have 2048 x 2048 connections for the recurrence, it would be interesting to see what you get by spreading them over (non-recurrent) residual layers.\nClearly, this is not going to be my criterion for rejection/acceptance, since one can easily make it fail - but I was mostly asking for some sanity check \n\nFurthermore, it is a bit misleading to put in Table 3 FCN-8s and FCN8s-LRNN, since this gives the impression that the LRNN gives a  boost by 10%. In practice the \"FCN8s\" prefix of \"FCN8s-LRNN\" is that of the authors, and not of Long et al (as indicated in Table 2, 8s original is quite worse than 8s here). \n\nAnother thing that is not clear to me is where the boost comes from in Table 2; the authors mention that \"when inserting the L-RNN after pool 3 and pool4 in FCN-8s, the L-RNN is able to learn contextual information over a much larger range than the receptive field of pure local convolutions. \"\nThis is potentially true, but I do not see why this was not also the case for FCN-32s (this is more a property of the recurrence rather than the 8/32 factor, right?)\n\nA few additional points: \nIt seems like Fig 2b and Fig2c never made it into the pdf. \n\nFigure 4 is unstructured and throws some 30 boxes to the reader - I would be surprised if anyone is able to get some information out of this (why not have a table?) \n\nAppendix A: this is very mysterious.

Based on the first contribution (\"general block that can be inserted into any layer\"), I strongly expected to see the L-RNN block integrated throughout the CNN starting from near the input. However, the architectures for classification and segmentation only place the module towards the very end of the network. While not exactly the same as Bell et al. (there are many technical details that differ), it is close. The paper does not compare to the design from Bell et al. Is there any advantage to the proposed design? Or is it a variation that performs similarly? What happens if L-RNN is integrated earlier in the network, as suggested by the introduction?\n\nThe second difference is a bit more solid, but still does not rise to a 'substantive difference' in my view. Note that Bell et al. also integrate 1D RNNs into an ImageNet pretrained VGG-16 model. I do, however, think that the method of integration proposed in this paper (zero initialization) may be more elegant and does not require two-stage training by first freezing the lower layers and then later unfreezing them.\n\n(3) I am generally skeptical of the utility of classification experiments on CIFAR-10 when presented in isolation (e.g., no results on ImageNet too).

L-RNN modules are an alternative to deeper or wider networks, 2D RNNs, dilated (Atrous) convolutional layers, and a simple flatten or global pooling layer when applied to the last convolutional layer for classification. L-RNN modules are faster than 2D RNNs, since rows and columns can be processed in parallel, are easy to implemented, and can be inserted in existing convolutional networks. The authors demonstrate improvements for classification and semantic segmentation.\n\nHowever, further evaluations are required that show for which use cases L-RNNs are superior to alternatives for summarizing convolutional feature maps:\n\n1. I suggest to use a fixed CNN with as certain number of layers, and summarize the last feature map by a) a flatten layer, b) global average pooling, c) a 2D RNN, d) and dilated convolutional layers for segmentation. The authors should report both the run-time and number of parameters for these variants in addition to prediction performances. For segmentation, the number of dilated convolutional layers should be chosen such that the number of parameters is similar to a single L-RNN module.\n\n2. The authors compare classification performances only on 32x32 CIFAR-10 images. For higher resolution images, the benefit of L-RNN modules to capture long-range dependencies might be more pronounced. I therefore suggest evaluating classification performances on one additional dataset with higher resolution images, e.g. ImageNet or the CUB bird dataset.\n\nAdditionally, I have the following minor comments:\n\n3. The authors use vanilla RNNs. It might be worth investigating LSTMs or GRUs instead.\n\n4. For classification, the authors summarize hidden states of the final vertical recurrent layer by global max pooling.
