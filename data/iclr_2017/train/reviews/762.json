{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Filling in the details: Perceiving from low fidelity visual input", "abstract": "Humans perceive their surroundings in great detail even though most of our visual field is reduced to low-fidelity color-deprived (e.g., dichromatic) input by the retina. In contrast, most deep learning architectures deploy computational resources homogeneously to every part of the visual input. Is such a prodigal deployment of resources necessary? In this paper, we present a framework for investigating the extent to which connectionist architectures can perceive an image in full detail even when presented with low acuity, distorted input. Our goal is to initiate investigations that will be fruitful both for engineering better networks and also for eventually testing hypotheses on the neural mechanisms responsible for our own visual system's ability to perceive missing information. We find that networks can compensate for low acuity input by learning global feature functions that allow the network to fill in some of the missing details. For example, the networks accurately perceive shape and color in the periphery, even when 75\\% of the input is achromatic and low resolution. On the other hand, the network is prone to similar mistakes as humans; for example, when presented with a fully grayscale landscape image, it perceives the sky as blue when the sky is actually a red sunset.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "This paper is motivated by the ability that human's visual system can recognize contents of environment by from critical features, and tried to investigate whether neural networks can also have this kind of ability.

This is done by manipulating the input image x in various ways (e.g. downsamplig, foveating), and training an auto-encoder to reconstruct the original full-resolution image.  MSE and qualitative results are shown and compared for the different input conditions.\n\nUnfortunately, this paper seems to lack focus, presenting a set of preliminary inspections with few concrete conclusions.  For example, at the end of sec 4.4, \"This result is not surprising, given that FOV-R contains additional information ....

But this hypothesis is left dangling:  What detailed regions are needed, and from where?  For what sort of tasks?\n\nSecondly, it isn't clear to me what reconstruction behaviors are caused by a fundamental perception of the input, and what are artifacts of the autoencoder and pixelwise l2 loss?  A prime example is texture, which the autoencoder fails to recover.  But with a pixelwise loss, the network must predict high-frequency textures nearly pixel-for-pixel at training time; if this is impossible, then it will generate a pixelwise average of the training samples --- a flat region.  So then the network's inability to reconstruct textures is due to a problem generating them, specifically averaging from the training loss, not necessarily an issue in perceiving textures.  A network trained a different way (perhaps an adversarial network) may infer a texture is there, even if it wouldn't be able to generate it in a pixelwise l2 sense.\n\nSimilarly, the ability to perform color reconstruction given a color glimpse I think has much to do with disambiguating the color of an object/scene:  If there is an ambiguity, the network won't know which to \"choose\" (white flower or yellow flower?) and output an average, which is why there are so many sepia tones.  However, in its section on this, the paper only measures the reconstruction error for different amounts of color given, and does not drill very far into any hypotheses for why this behavior occurs.\n\nThere are some interesting measurements here, such as the amount of color needed in the foveation to reconstruct a color image, and the discussion on global features, which may start to get at a mechanism by which glimpses may propagate to an entire reconstruction.
