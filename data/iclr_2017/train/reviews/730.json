{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "A Way out of the Odyssey: Analyzing and Combining Recent Insights for LSTMs", "abstract": "LSTMs have become a basic building block for many deep NLP models. In recent years, many improvements and variations have been proposed for deep sequence models in general, and LSTMs in particular. We propose and analyze a series of architectural modifications for LSTM networks resulting in improved performance for text classification datasets. We observe compounding improvements on traditional LSTMs using Monte Carlo test-time model averaging, deep vector averaging (DVA), and residual connections, along with four other suggested modifications. Our analysis provides a simple, reliable, and high quality baseline model.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "I agree with the other reviewer that the application areas are limited in the paper. I agree with the overall sentiment of the paper to evaluate effectiveness of some of the more recent techniques in this area, in conjunction with the recurrent networks. \n\nThe paper advertises itself as a method (or a list of methods) of improving the recurrent baselines when performing experiments, however fails (or not shown) to generalize to other tasks. Effectiveness of these methods need to be shown across a wide variety of tasks if we intend to replace traditional baselines in general, rather than a specific subset of applications.\n\nI like the desire to evaluate many of the recent techniques and having many replications of experiments towards this end (which is a strong point of the paper).
