{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Deep Probabilistic Programming", "abstract": "We propose Edward, a Turing-complete probabilistic programming language. Edward defines two compositional representations\u2014random variables and inference. By treating inference as a first class citizen, on a par with modeling, we show that probabilistic programming can be as flexible and computationally efficient as traditional deep learning. For flexibility, Edward makes it easy to fit the same model using a variety of composable inference methods, ranging from point estimation to variational inference to MCMC. In addition, Edward can reuse the modeling representation as part of inference, facilitating the design of rich variational models and generative adversarial networks. For efficiency, Edward is integrated into TensorFlow, providing significant speedups over existing probabilistic systems. For example, we show on a benchmark logistic regression task that Edward is at least 35x faster than Stan and 6x faster than PyMC3. Further, Edward incurs no runtime overhead: it is as fast as handwritten TensorFlow.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "Thank you for an interesting read.\n\nI found this paper very interesting.

We proposed new compositional representations, \"putt[ing] focus on compositional inference\" (Reviewer 3).

We also show how to integrate such a language into computational graph frameworks; this provides significant speedups with distributing training, parallelism, vectorisation, and GPU support.\n\nFinally, we note that Edward is growing with active contributions from the community (", "OTHER_KEYS": "Dustin Tran"}, {"TITLE": "Exciting and promising approach which still needs to be demonstrated empirically", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer4", "comments": "The authors propose a new software package for probabilistic programming, taking advantage of recent successful tools used in the deep learning community. The software looks very promising and has the potential to transform the way we work in the probabilistic modelling community, allowing us to perform rapid-prototyping to iterate through ideas quickly. The composability principles are used insightfully, and the extension of inference to HMC for example, going beyond VI inference (which is simple to implement using existing deep learning tools), makes the software even more compelling. \n\nHowever, the most important factor of any PPL is whether it is practical for real-world use cases. This was not demonstrated sufficiently in the submission. There are many example code snippets given in the paper, but most are not evaluated. The Dirichlet process mixture model example (Figure 12) is an important one: do the proposed black-box inference tools really work for this snippet? and will the GAN example (Figure 7) converge when optimised with real data? To convince the community of the practicality of the package it will be necessary to demonstrate these empirically. Currently the only evaluated model is a VAE with various inference techniques, which are not difficult to implement using pure TF.\n\nPresentation:\n* Paper presentation could be improved. For example the authors could use more signalling for what is about to be explained. On page 5 qbeta and qz are used without explanation - the authors could mention that an example will be given thereafter.\n* I would also suggest to the authors to explain in the preface how the layers are implemented, and how the KL is handled in VI for example.\nIt will be useful to discuss what values are optimised and what values change as inference is performed (even before section 4.4). This was not clear for the majority of the paper. \n\nExperiments:\n* Why is the run time not reported in table 1?\n* What are the \"difficulties around convergence\" encountered with the analytical entropies? inference issues become more difficult to diagnose as inference is automated. Are there tools to diagnose these with the provided toolbox? \n* Did HMC give sensible results in the experiment at the bottom of page 8? only run time is reported. \n* How difficult is it to get the inference to work (eg HMC) when we don't have full control over the computational graph structure and sampler?\n* It would be extremely insightful to give a table comparing the performance (run time, predictive log likelihood, etc) of the various inference tools on more models.\n* What benchmarks do you intend to use in the Model Zoo? the difficulty with probabilistic modelling is that there are no set benchmarks over which we can evaluate and compare many models.
