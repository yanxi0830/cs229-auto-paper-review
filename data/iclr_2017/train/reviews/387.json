(2015) showed that pair-wise products of features in a convolutional network are a very effective representation of image textures. We propose a simple modification to that representation which makes it possible to incorporate long-range structure into image generation, and to render images that satisfy various symmetry constraints. We show how this can greatly improve rendering of regular textures and of images that contain other kinds of symmetric structure. We also present applications to inpainting and season transfer.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "The paper introduces a variation to the CNN-based texture synthesis procedure of Gatys et al. that matches correlations between spatially shifted feature responses in addition to the correlations between feature responses at the same position in the feature maps. \nThe paper claims that this \na) improves texture synthesis for textures with long-range regular structures, that are not preserved with the Gatys et al. method\nb) improves performance on texture inpainting tasks compared to the Gatys et al. method\nc) improves results in season transfer when combined with the style transfer method by Gatys et al. \nFurthermore the paper shows that\nd) by matching correlations between spatially flipped feature maps, symmetry properties around the flipping axis can be preserved.\n\nI agree with claim a).
