{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Learning to Act by Predicting the Future", "abstract": "We present an approach to sensorimotor control in immersive environments. Our approach utilizes a high-dimensional sensory stream and a lower-dimensional measurement stream. The cotemporal structure of these streams provides a rich supervisory signal, which enables training a sensorimotor control model by interacting with the environment. The model is trained using supervised learning techniques, but without extraneous supervision. It learns to act based on raw sensory input from a complex three-dimensional environment. The presented formulation enables learning without a fixed goal at training time, and pursuing dynamically changing goals at test time. We conduct extensive experiments in three-dimensional simulations based on the classical first-person game Doom. The results demonstrate that the presented approach outperforms sophisticated prior formulations, particularly on challenging tasks. The results also show that trained models successfully generalize across environments and goals. A model trained using the presented approach won the Full Deathmatch track of the Visual Doom AI Competition, which was held in previously unseen environments.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "The paper presents an on-policy method to predict future intrinsic measurements.

This empirically driven work builds on these approaches. It introduces a new algorithm which performs better in novel 3D environments from raw sensory data and allows better generalization across goals and environments. Notably, this algorithm was the winner of the Visual Doom AI competition.\n\nThe key idea of their algorithm is to use additional low-dimensional observations (such as ammo or health which is provided by the game engine) as a supervised target for prediction. Importantly, this prediction is conditioned on a goal vector (which is given, not learned) and the current action. Once trained the optimal action for the current state can be chosen as the action that maximises the predicted outcome according the goal. Unlike in successor feature representations, learning is supervised and there is no TD relationship between the predictions of the current state and the next state.\n\nThere have been a number of prior works both in predicting future states as part of RL and goal driven function approximators which the authors review in section 2. The key contributions of this work are the focus on Monte Carlo estimation (rather than TD), the use of low-dimensional \u2018measurements\u2019 for prediction, the parametrized goals and, perhaps most importantly, the empirical comparison to relevant prior work.\n\nIn addition to the comparison with Visual Doom AI, the authors show that their algorithm is able to learn generalizable policies which can respond, without further training, to limited changes in the goal.\n\nThe paper is well-communicated and the empirical results compelling and will be of significant interest.\n\nSome minor potential improvements:\nThere is an approximation in the supervised training as it is making an on-policy assumption but it learns from a replay buffer (with the Monte Carlo regression the expectation of the remainder of the trajectory is assumed to follow the current policy, but is being sampled from episodes generated by prior versions of the policy). This should be discussed.\nThe algorithm uses additional metadata (the information about which parts of the sensory input are worth predicting) that the compared algorithms do not. I think this, and the limitations of this approach (e.g. it may not work well in a sensory environment if such measurements are not provided) should be mentioned more clearly.\n\n", "ORIGINALITY": 4, "IS_ANNOTATED": true, "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 7, "DATE": "17 Dec 2016", "CLARITY": 5, "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"TITLE": "No Title", "SUBSTANCE": 2, "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": 2, "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "comments": "This paper presents an on-policy deep RL method with additional auxiliary intrinsic variables. \n\n- The method is a special case of an universal value function based approach and the authors do cite the correct references.

I have the following questions:\n\n(1) In Figure 1, why there is a \"Target f\" drawn to the right of \"Prediction P\"? Though this makes the model looks more end-to-end, I guess the \"Expectation\" component and \"Action\" component are updating their parameters according to their own regression losses, instead of back-propagating through a unified end. \n\n(2) The reward formulation in this work is similar to Monte-Carlo methods. In this work, the cumulative reward is represented by summing up the outputs of expectation stream and action stream *over each time steps*. If only those over the last time step is considered, it will become almost same as Monte-Carlo. However, the presented work accumulates the difference over multiple future steps. Based on the proposed form of *f* (in Section 3), the reward collected by near-future steps are weighted more. Or we could see the weight to be interpreted as linearly decaying based on the time distance from the future step to the current step. If this is the case, re-formulating the proposed approach with linearly discounted Monte-Carlo could be possible. You may also compare such Monte-Carlo as a compelling baseline. Also, it's better to put more discussion over your reward formulation, since it contributes a lot to the performance improvement and it's better to let people understand why it works well. \n\n(3) I don't quite understand what is the meaning of *goal*. In Section 3, *g* is proposed to be of the same dimension as  *f*. The maximization is over g^T*f, but what the architecture try to regress is over f, and g is designed as part of inputs to the deep neural network. And action-selection is over the maximum of summed E and A over all future steps. In this way, what the agent is trying to do is to maximize the future gain over those measurements, instead of performing according to the specified goal. Hope the authors could clarify on this.\n\n\n", "OTHER_KEYS": "(anonymous)"}, {"TITLE": "comparisons", "SUBSTANCE": 2, "MEANINGFUL_COMPARISON": 2, "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer3", "comments": "", "SOUNDNESS_CORRECTNESS": 4, "ORIGINALITY": 4, "IS_ANNOTATED": true, "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "01 Dec 2016"}, {"TITLE": "Goals", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "RECOMMENDATION_UNOFFICIAL": 2, "comments": "", "ORIGINALITY": 4, "IS_ANNOTATED": true, "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "DATE": "01 Dec 2016", "CLARITY": 5}, {"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "The paper presents an on-policy method to predict future intrinsic measurements.
