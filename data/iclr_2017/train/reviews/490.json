{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Pointer Sentinel Mixture Models", "abstract": "Recent neural network sequence models with softmax classifiers have achieved their best language modeling performance only with very large hidden states and large vocabularies. Even then they struggle to predict rare or unseen words even if the context makes the prediction unambiguous. We introduce the pointer sentinel mixture architecture for neural sequence models which has the ability to either reproduce a word from the recent context or produce a word from a standard softmax classifier. Our pointer sentinel-LSTM model achieves state of the art language modeling performance on the Penn Treebank (70.9 perplexity) while using far fewer parameters than a standard softmax LSTM. In order to evaluate how well language models can exploit longer contexts and deal with more realistic vocabularies and corpora we also introduce the freely available WikiText corpus.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "This work is an extension of previous works on pointer models, that mixes its outputs with standard softmax outputs. \nThe idea is appealing in general for context biasing and the specific approach appears quite simple.\n\nThe idea is novel to some extent, as previous paper had already tried to combine pointer-based and standard models,\nbut not as a mixture model, as in this paper.\n\nThe paper is clearly written and the results seem promising.\nThe new dataset the authors created (WikiText) also seems of high interest. \n\nA comment regarding notation:\nThe symbol p_ptr is used in two different ways in eq. 3 and eq. 5. : p_ptr(w) vs. p_ptr(y_i|x_i) \nThis is confusing as these are two different domains: for eq 3. the domain is a *set* of words and for eq. 5 the domain is a *list* of context words.\nIt would be helpful to use different symbol for the two objects."}, {"DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "comments": "The reviewers liked this paper quite a bit, and so for this reason it is a perfectly fine paper to accept.

The pointer network can point to words in the recent context, and hence the prediction for each time step is a mixture between the usual softmax output and the pointer distribution over the recent words. The paper also introduces a new language modelling dataset, which overcomes some of the shortcomings of previous datasets.\n\nThe reason for the score I gave for this paper is that I find the proposed model a direct application of the previous work Gulcehre et al., which follows a similar approach but for machine translation and summarization. The main differences I find is that Gulcehre et al. use an encoder-decoder architecture, and use the attention weights of the encoder to point to locations of words in the input, while here an RNN is used and a pointer network produces a distribution over the full vocabulary (by summing the softmax probabilities of words in the recent context). The context (query) vector for the pointing network is also different, but this is also a direct consequence of having a different application.\n\nWhile the paper describes the differences between the proposed approach and Gulcehre et al.\u2019s approach, I find some of the claims either wrong or not that significant. For example, quoting from Section 1:\n\u201cRather than relying on the RNN hidden state to decide when to use the pointer, as in the recent work of Gulcehre et al. (2016), we allow the pointer component itself to decide when to use the softmax vocabulary through a sentinel.\u201d\nAs far as I can tell, your model also uses the recent hidden state to form a query vector,  which is matched by the pointer network to previous words. Can you please clarify what you mean here?\n\nIn addition, quoting from section 3 which describes the model of Gulcehre et al.:\n\u201cRather than constructing a mixture model as in our work, they use a switching network to decide which component to use\u201d\nThis is not correct. The model of Gulcehre is also a mixture model, where an MLP with sigmoid output (switching network) is used to form a mixture between softmax prediction and locations of the input text.\n\nFinally, in the following quote, also from section 3: \n\u201cThe pointer network is not used as a source of information for the switching network as in our model.\u201d \nIt is not clear what the authors mean by \u201csource of information\u201d here. Is it the fact that the switching probability is part of the pointer softmax?
