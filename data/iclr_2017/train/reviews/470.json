{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Stick-Breaking Variational Autoencoders", "abstract": "We extend Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes to perform posterior inference for the weights of Stick-Breaking processes. This development allows us to define a Stick-Breaking Variational Autoencoder (SB-VAE), a Bayesian nonparametric version of the variational autoencoder that has a latent representation with stochastic dimensionality. We experimentally demonstrate that the SB-VAE, and a semi-supervised variant, learn highly discriminative latent representations that often outperform the Gaussian VAE\u2019s.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "The paper attempts to combine Variational Auto-Encoders with the Stick-Breaking process.

This is achieved by using an inherently infinite prior, the stick-breaking process. This is coupled with inference tailored to this model, specifically the Kumaraswamy distribution as an approximate variational posterior. The resulting model is named the SB-VAE which also has a semi-supervised extension, in similar vein to the original VAE paper.\n\nThere's a lot of interest in VAEs these days; many lines of work seek to achieve automatic \"black-box\" inference in these models. For example, the authors themselves mention parallel work by Blei's lab (also others) towards this direction. However, there's a lot of merit in investigating more bespoke solutions to new models, which is what the authors are doing in this paper. Indeed, a (useful) side-effect of providing efficient inference for the SB-VAE is drawing attention to the use of the Kumaraswamy distribution which hasn't been popular in ML.\n\nAlthough the paper is in general well structured, I found it confusing at parts. I think the major source of confusion comes from the fact that the model specification and model inference are discussed in a somehow mixed manner. The pre-review questions clarified most parts.\n\nI have two main concerns regarding the methodology and motivation of this paper. Firstly, conditioning the model directly on the stick-breaking weights seems a little odd. I initially thought that there was some mixture probabilistic model involved, but this is not the case. To be fair, the authors discuss about this issue (which became clearer to me after the pre-review questions), and explain that they're investigating the apparently challenging problem of using a base distribution G_0. The question is whether their relaxation is still useful. From the experiments it seems that the method is at least competitive, so the answer is yes. Hopefully an extension will come in the future, as the authors mention.\n\nThe second concern is about the motivation of this method. It seems that the paper fails to clearly explain in a convincing way why it is beneficial to reformulate the VAE as a SB-VAE. I understand that the non-parametric property induced by the prior might result in better capacity control, however I feel that this advantage (and potentially others which are still unclear to me) is not sufficiently explained and demonstrated. Perhaps some comparison with a dropout approach or a more thorough discussion related to dropout would make this clearer.\n\nOverall, I found this to be an interesting paper, it would be a good fit for ICLR.\n", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "RECOMMENDATION": 8, "DATE": "17 Dec 2016", "REVIEWER_CONFIDENCE": 4}, {"TITLE": "No Title", "OTHER_KEYS": "ICLR 2017 conference AnonReviewer2", "comments": "The paper attempts to combine Variational Auto-Encoders with the Stick-Breaking process.
