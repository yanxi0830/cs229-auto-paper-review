{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Inference and Introspection in Deep Generative Models of Sparse Data", "abstract": "Deep generative models such as deep latent Gaussian models (DLGMs) are powerful and popular density estimators. However, they have been applied almost exclusively to dense data such as images; DLGMs are rarely applied to sparse, high-dimensional integer data such as word counts or product ratings. One reason is that the standard training procedures find poor local optima when applied to such data. We propose two techniques that alleviate this problem, significantly improving our ability to fit DLGMs to sparse, high-dimensional data. Having fit these models, we are faced with another challenge: how to use and interpret the representation that we have learned? To that end, we propose a method that extracts distributed representations of features via a simple linearization of the model.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "comments": "The paper introduces a number of ideas / heuristics for learning and interpreting deep generative models of text (tf-idf weighting, a combination of using an inference networks with direct optimization of the variational parameters, a method for inducing context-sensitive word embeddings).

Here intractable inference is replaced by the VAE formulation where an inference network (with parameters \\phi) independently predicts for each document the mean and variance of a normal distribution (amenable to reparameterised gradient computation).\n\nThe first, and rather trivial, contribution is to use tf-idf features to inject first order statistics (a global information) into local observations. The authors claim that this is particularly helpful in the case of sparse data such as text.\n\nThe second contribution is more interesting. In optimising generative parameters (\\theta) and variational parameters (\\phi), the authors turn to a treatment which is reminiscent of the original SVI procedure. That is, they see the variational parameters \\phi as *global* variational parameters, and the predicted mean \\mu(x) and covariance \\Sigma(x) of each observation x are treated as *local* variational parameters. In the original VAE, local parameters are not directly optimised, instead they are indirectly optimised via optimisation of the global parameters utilised in their prediction (shared MLP parameters). Here, local parameters are optimised holding generative parameters fixed (line 3 of Algorithm 1). The optimised local parameters are then used in the gradient step of the generative parameters (line 4 of Algorithm 1). Finally, global variational parameters are also updated (line 5). \nWhereas indeed other authors have proposed to optimise local parameters, I think that deriving this procedure from the more familiar SVI makes the contribution less of a trick and easier to relate to.\n\nSome things aren't entirely clear to me. I think it would have been nice if the authors had shown the functional form of the gradient used in step 3 of Algorithm 1. The gradient step for global variational parameters (line 5 of Algorithm 1) uses the very first prediction of local parameters (thus ignoring the optimisation in step 3), this is unclear to me. Perhaps I am missing a fundamental reason why that has to be the case (either way, please clarify).\nThe authors argue that this optimisation turns out helpful to modelling sparse data because there is evidence that the generative model p_\\theta(x|z) suffers from poor initialisation. Please, discuss why you expect the initialisation problem to be worse in the case of sparse data.\n\nThe final contribution is a neat procedure to derive word embeddings from the generative model parameters. These embeddings are then used to interpret what the model has learnt. Interestingly, these word embeddings are context-sensitive once that the latent variable models an entire document.\n\nAbout Figures 2a and 2b: the caption says that solid lines indicate validation perplexity for M=1 (no optimisation of local parameters) and dashed lines indicate M=100 (100 iterations of optimisation of local parameters), but the legends of the figures suggest a different reading. If I interpret the figures based on the caption, then it seems that indeed deeper networks exposed to more data benefit from optimisation of local parameters. Are the authors pretty sure that in Figure 2b models with M=1 have reached a plateau (so that longer training would not allow them to catch up with M=100 curves)? As the authors explain in the caption, x-axis is not comparable on running time, thus the question.\n\nThe analysis of singular values seems like an interesting way to investigate how the model is using its capacity.  However, I can barely interpret Figures 2c and 2d, I think the authors could have walked readers through them.\n\nAs for the word embedding I am missing an evaluation on a predictive task.
