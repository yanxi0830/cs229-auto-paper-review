      "text" : "Recently, deterministic deep neural networks (DNN) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on many supervised tasks, e.g., speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012a) and object recognition (Krizhevsky et al., 2012). One of the main components underlying these successes is on the efficient training methods for deeper and wider DNNs, which include backpropagation (Rumelhart et al., 1988), stochastic gradient descent (Robbins & Monro, 1951), dropout/dropconnect (Hinton et al., 2012b; Wan et al., 2013), batch/weight normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015; Salimans & Kingma, 2016), and various activation functions (Nair & Hinton, 2010; Gulcehre et al., 2016). On the other hand, stochastic feedforward neural networks (SFNN) (Neal, 1990) having random latent units are often necessary in order to model complex stochastic natures in many real-world tasks, e.g., structured prediction (Tang & Salakhutdinov, 2013), image generation (Goodfellow et al., 2014) and memory networks (Zaremba & Sutskever, 2015). Furthermore, it has been believed that SFNN has several advantages beyond DNN (Raiko et al., 2014): it has more expressive power for multi-modal learning and regularizes better for large-scale learning.\nTraining large-scale SFNN is notoriously hard since backpropagation is not directly applicable. Certain stochastic neural networks using continuous random units are known to be trainable efficiently using backpropagation under the variational techniques and the reparameterization tricks (Kingma & Welling, 2013). On the other hand, training SFNN having discrete, i.e., binary or multi-modal, random units is more difficult since intractable probabilistic inference is involved requiring too many random samples. There have been several efforts developing efficient training methods for SFNN having binary random latent units (Neal, 1990; Saul et al., 1996; Tang & Salakhutdinov, 2013; Bengio et al., 2013; Raiko et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2015) (see Section 2.1 for more details). However, training SFNN is still significantly slower than doing DNN of the same architecture, e.g., most prior\nworks on this line have considered a small number (at most 5 or so) of layers in SFNN. We aim for the same goal, but our direction is orthogonal to them.\nInstead of training SFNN directly, we study whether pre-trained parameters of DNN (or easier models) can be transferred to it, possibly with further fine-tuning of light cost. This approach can be attractive since one can utilize recent advances in DNN on its design and training. For example, one can design the network structure of SFNN following known specialized ones of DNN and use their pre-trained parameters. To this end, we first try transferring pre-trained parameters of DNN using sigmoid activation functions to those of the corresponding SFNN directly. In our experiments, the heuristic reasonably works well. For multi-modal learning, SFNN under such a simple transformation outperforms DNN. Even for the MNIST classification, the former performs similarly as the latter (see Section 2 for more details). However, it is questionable whether a similar strategy works in general, particularly for other unbounded activation functions like ReLU (Nair & Hinton, 2010) since SFNN has binary, i.e., bounded, random latent units. Moreover, it lost the regularization benefit of SFNN: it is rather believed that transferring parameters of stochastic models to DNN helps its regularization, but the opposite direction is unlikely possible.\nTo address the issues, we propose a special form of stochastic neural networks, named SimplifiedSFNN, which intermediates between SFNN and DNN, having the following properties. First, Simplified-SFNN can be built upon any baseline DNN, possibly having unbounded activation functions. The most significant part of our approach lies in providing rigorous network knowledge transferring (Chen et al., 2015) between Simplified-SFNN and DNN. In particular, we prove that parameters of DNN can be transformed to those of the corresponding Simplified-SFNN while preserving the performance, i.e., both represent the same mapping and features. Second, Simplified-SFNN approximates certain SFNN, better than DNN, by simplifying its upper latent units above stochastic ones using two different non-linear activation functions. Simplified-SFNN is much easier to train than SFNN while utilizing its stochastic nature for regularization.\nThe above connection DNN→ Simplified-SFNN→ SFNN naturally suggests the following training procedure for both SFNN and Simplified-SFNN: train a baseline DNN first and then fine-tune its corresponding Simplified-SFNN initialized by the transformed DNN parameters. The pre-training stage accelerates the training task since DNN is faster to train than Simplified-SFNN. In addition, one can also utilize known DNN training techniques such as dropout and batch normalization for fine-tuning Simplified-SFNN. In our experiments, we train SFNN and Simplified-SFNN under the proposed strategy. They consistently outperform the corresponding DNN for both multi-modal and classification tasks, where the former and the latter are for measuring the model expressive power and the regularization effect, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to confirm that SFNN indeed regularizes better than DNN. We also construct the stochastic models following the same network structure of popular DNNs including Lenet-5 (LeCun et al., 1998), NIN (Lin et al., 2014) and WRN (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016). In particular, WRN (wide residual network) of 28 layers and 36 million parameters has shown the state-of-art performances on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 classification datasets, and our stochastic models built upon WRN outperform the deterministic WRN on the datasets.\nOrganization. In Section 2, we focus on DNNs having sigmoid and ReLU activation functions and study simple transformations of their parameters to those of SFNN. In Section 3, we consider DNNs having general activation functions and describe more advanced transformations via introducing a new model, named Simplified-SFNN."

      "text" : "Stochastic feedforward neural network (SFNN) is a hybrid model, which has both stochastic binary and deterministic hidden units. We first introduce SFNN with one stochastic hidden layer (and without deterministic hidden layers) for simplicity. Throughout this paper, we commonly denote the bias for unit i and the weight matrix of the `-th hidden layer by b`i and W\n`, respectively. Then, the stochastic hidden layer in SFNN is defined as a binary random vector with N1 units, i.e., h1 ∈\n{0, 1}N1 , drawn under the following distribution:\nP ( h1 | x ) = N1∏ i=1 P ( h1i | x ) , where P ( h1i = 1 | x ) = σ ( W1ix+ b 1 i ) . (1)\nIn the above, x is the input vector and σ (x) = 1/ (1 + e−x) is the sigmoid function. Our conditional distribution of the output y is defined as follows:\nP (y | x) = EP (h1|x) [ P ( y | h1 )] = EP (h1|x) [ N ( y |W2h1 + b2, σ2y )] ,\nwhere N (·) denotes the normal distribution with mean W2h1 + b2 and (fixed) variance σ2y . Therefore, P (y | x) can express a very complex, multi-modal distribution since it is a mixture of exponentially many normal distributions. The multi-layer extension is straightforward via a combination of stochastic and deterministic hidden layers, e.g., see Tang & Salakhutdinov (2013), Raiko et al. (2014). Furthermore, one can use any other output distributions as like DNN, e.g., softmax for classification tasks.\nThere are two computational issues for training SFNN: computing expectations with respect to stochastic units in forward pass and computing gradients in backward pass. One can notice that both are computationally intractable since they require summations over exponentially many configurations of all stochastic units. First, in order to handle the issue in forward pass, one can use the follow-\ning Monte Carlo approximation for estimating the expectation: P (y | x) w 1M M∑ m=1 P (y | h(m)),\nwhere h(m) ∼ P ( h1 | x ) and M is the number of samples. This random estimator is unbiased and has relatively low variance (Tang & Salakhutdinov, 2013) since its accuracy does not depend on the dimensionality of h1 and one can draw samples from the exact distribution. Next, in order to handle the issue in backward pass, Neal (1990) proposed a Gibbs sampling, but it is known that it often mixes poorly. Saul et al. (1996) proposed a variational learning based on the mean-field approximation, but it has additional parameters making the variational lower bound looser. More recently, several other techniques have been proposed including unbiased estimators of the variational bound using importance sampling (Tang & Salakhutdinov, 2013; Raiko et al., 2014) and biased/unbiased estimators of the gradient for approximating backpropagation (Bengio et al., 2013; Raiko et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2015)."

      "heading" : "2.2 SIMPLE TRANSFORMATION FROM SIGMOID-DNN AND RELU-DNN TO SFNN",
      "text" : "Despite the recent advances, training SFNN is still very slow compared to DNN due to the sampling procedures: in particular, it is notoriously hard to train SFNN when the network structure is deeper and wider. In order to handle these issues, we consider the following approximation:\nP (y | x) = EP (h1|x) [ N ( y |W2h1 + b2, σ2y )] w N ( y | EP (h1|x) [ W2h1 ] + b2, σ2y ) = N ( y |W2σ ( W1x+ b1 ) + b2, σ2y ) . (2)\nNote that the above approximation corresponds to replacing stochastic units by deterministic ones such that their hidden activation values are same as marginal distributions of stochastic units, i.e., SFNN can be approximated by DNN using sigmoid activation functions, say sigmoid-DNN. When there exist more latent layers above the stochastic one, one has to apply similar approximations to all of them, i.e., exchanging the orders of expectations and non-linear functions, for making DNN and SFNN are equivalent. Therefore, instead of training SFNN directly, one can try transferring pretrained parameters of sigmoid-DNN to those of the corresponding SFNN directly: train sigmoidDNN instead of SFNN, and replace deterministic units by stochastic ones for the inference purpose. Although such a strategy looks somewhat ‘rude’, it was often observed in the literature that it reasonably works well for SFNN (Raiko et al., 2014) and we also evaluate it as reported in Table 1. We also note that similar approximations appear in the context of dropout: it trains a stochastic model averaging exponentially many DNNs sharing parameters, but also approximates a single DNN well.\nNow we investigate a similar transformation in the case when DNN uses the unbounded ReLU activation function, say ReLU-DNN. Many recent deep networks are of ReLU-DNN type due to the gradient vanishing problem, and their pre-trained parameters are often available. Although it is straightforward to build SFNN from sigmoid-DNN, it is less clear in this case since ReLU is\nunbounded. To handle this issue, we redefine the stochastic latent units of SFNN:\nP ( h1 | x ) = N1∏ i=1 P ( h1i | x ) , where P ( h1i = 1 | x ) = min { αf ( W1ix+ b 1 i ) , 1 } . (3)\nIn the above, f(x) = max{x, 0} is the ReLU activation function and α is some hyper-parameter. A simple transformation can be defined similarly as the case of sigmoid-DNN via replacing deterministic units by stochastic ones. However, to preserve the parameter information of ReLU-DNN, one has to choose α such that αf ( W1ix+ b 1 i ) ≤ 1 and rescale upper parameters W2 as follows:\nα−1 ← max i,x ∣∣∣f (Ŵ1ix+ b̂1i)∣∣∣ , (W1, b1)← (Ŵ1, b̂1) , (W2, b2)← ( Ŵ2/α, b̂2) . (4) Then, applying similar approximations as in (2), i.e., exchanging the orders of expectations and non-linear functions, one can observe that ReLU-DNN and SFNN are equivalent.\nWe evaluate the performance of the simple transformations from DNN to SFNN on the MNIST dataset (LeCun et al., 1998) and the synthetic dataset (Bishop, 1994), where the former and the latter are popular datasets used for a classification task and a multi-modal (i.e., one-to-many mappings) prediction learning, respectively. In all experiments reported in this paper, we commonly use the softmax and Gaussian with standard deviation of σy = 0.05 are used for the output probability on classification and regression tasks, respectively. The only first hidden layer of DNN is replaced by stochastic one, and we use 500 samples for estimating the expectations in the SFNN inference. As reported in Table 1, we observe that the simple transformation often works well for both tasks: the SFNN and sigmoid-DNN inferences (using same parameters trained by sigmoid-DNN) perform similarly for the classification task and the former significantly outperforms for the latter for the\nmulti-modal task (also see Figure 1). It might suggest some possibilities that the expensive SFNN training might not be not necessary, depending on the targeted learning quality. However, in case of ReLU, SFNN performs much worse than ReLU-DNN for the MNIST classification task under the parameter transformation."

      "text" : "For clarity of presentation, we first introduce Simplified-SFNN with two hidden layers and nonnegative activation functions, where its extensions to multiple layers and general activation functions are presented in Appendix B. We also remark that we primarily describe fully-connected SimplifiedSFNNs, but their convolutional versions can also be naturally defined. In Simplified-SFNN of two hidden layers, we assume that the first and second hidden layers consist of stochastic binary hidden units and deterministic ones, respectively. As like (3), the first layer is defined as a binary random vector with N1 units, i.e., h1 ∈ {0, 1}N1 , drawn under the following distribution:\nP ( h1 | x ) = N1∏ i=1 P ( h1i | x ) , where P ( h1i = 1 | x ) = min { α1f ( W1ix+ b 1 i ) , 1 } . (5)\nwhere x is the input vector, α1 > 0 is a hyper-parameter for the first layer, and f : R→ R+ is some non-negative non-linear activation function with |f ′(x)| ≤ 1 for all x ∈ R, e.g., ReLU and sigmoid activation functions. Now the second layer is defined as the following deterministic vector with N2 units, i.e., h2(x) ∈ RN2 : h2 (x) = [ f ( α2 ( EP (h1|x) [ s ( W2jh 1 + b2j )] − s (0) )) : ∀j ∈ N2 ] , (6)\nwhere α2 > 0 is a hyper-parameter for the second layer and s : R → R is a differentiable function with |s′′(x)| ≤ 1 for all x ∈ R, e.g., sigmoid and tanh functions. In our experiments, we use the sigmoid function for s(x). Here, one can note that the proposed model also has the same computational issues with SFNN in forward and backward passes due to the complex expectation. One can train Simplified-SFNN similarly as SFNN: we use Monte Carlo approximation for estimating the expectation and the (biased) estimator of the gradient for approximating backpropagation inspired by Raiko et al. (2014) (more detailed explanation is presented in Appendix A).\nWe are interested in transferring parameters of DNN to Simplified-SFNN to utilize the training benefits of DNN since the former is much faster to train than the latter. To this end, we consider the following DNN of which `-th hidden layer is deterministic and defined as follows:\nĥ` (x) = [ ĥ`i (x) = f ( Ŵ`i ĥ `−1 (x) + b̂`i ) : i ∈ N ` ] , (7)\nwhere ĥ0(x) = x. As stated in the following theorem, we establish a rigorous way how to initialize parameters of Simplified-SFNN in order to transfer the knowledge stored in DNN.\nTheorem 1 Assume that both DNN and Simplified-SFNN with two hidden layers have same network structure with non-negative activation function f . Given parameters {Ŵ`, b̂` : ` = 1, 2} of DNN and input dataset D, choose those of Simplified-SFNN as follows:(\nα1,W 1, b1 ) ← ( 1\nγ1 , Ŵ1, b̂1\n) , ( α2,W 2, b2 ) ← ( γ2γ1 s′ (0) , 1 γ2 Ŵ2, 1 γ1γ2 b̂2 ) , (8)\nwhere γ1 = max\ni,x∈D\n∣∣∣f (Ŵ1ix+ b̂1i)∣∣∣ and γ2 > 0 is any positive constant. Then, it follows that\n∣∣∣h2j (x)− ĥ2j (x)∣∣∣ ≤ γ1 (∑ i ∣∣∣Ŵ 2ij∣∣∣+ b̂2jγ−11 )2 2s′ (0) γ2 , ∀j,x ∈ D.\nThe proof of the above theorem is presented in Appendix D.1. Our proof is built upon the first-order Taylor expansion of non-linear function s(x). Theorem 1 implies that one can make Simplified-SFNN represent the function values of DNN with bounded errors using a linear transformation. Furthermore, the errors can be made arbitrarily small by choosing large γ2, i.e., lim γ2→∞\n∣∣∣h2j (x)− ĥ2j (x)∣∣∣ = 0, ∀j,x ∈ D. Figure 2(c) shows that knowledge transferring loss decreases as γ2 increases on MNIST classification. Based on this, we choose γ2 = 50 commonly for all experiments."

      "heading" : "3.2 WHY SIMPLIFIED-SFNN ?",
      "text" : "Given a Simplified-SFNN model, the corresponding SFNN can be naturally defined by taking out the expectation in (6). As illustrated in Figure 2(a), the main difference between SFNN and SimplifiedSFNN is that the randomness of the stochastic layer propagates only to its upper layer in the latter, i.e., the randomness of h1 is averaged out at its upper units h2 and does not propagate to h3 or output y. Hence, Simplified-SFNN is no longer a Bayesian network. This makes training Simplified-SFNN much easier than SFNN since random samples are not required at some layers1 and consequently the quality of gradient estimations can also be improved, in particular for unbounded activation functions. Furthermore, one can use the same approximation procedure (2) to see that SimplifiedSFNN approximates SFNN. However, since Simplified-SFNN still maintains binary random units, it uses approximation steps later, in comparison with DNN. In summary, Simplified-SFNN is an intermediate model between DNN and SFNN, i.e., DNN→ Simplified-SFNN→ SFNN. The above connection naturally suggests the following training procedure for both SFNN and Simplified-SFNN: train a baseline DNN first and then fine-tune its corresponding Simplified-SFNN initialized by the transformed DNN parameters. Finally, the fine-tuned parameters can be used for SFNN as well. We evaluate the strategy for the MNIST classification, which is reported in Table 2 (see Appendix C for more detailed experiment setups). We found that SFNN under the two-stage training always performs better than SFNN under a simple transformation (4) from ReLU-DNN.\n1 For example, if one replaces the first feature maps in the fifth residual unit of Pre-ResNet having 164 layers (He et al., 2016) by stochastic ones, then the corresponding DNN, Simplified-SFNN and SFNN took 1 mins 35 secs, 2 mins 52 secs and 16 mins 26 secs per each training epoch, respectively, on our machine with one Intel CPU (Core i7-5820K 6-Core@3.3GHz) and one NVIDIA GPU (GTX Titan X, 3072 CUDA cores). Here, we trained both stochastic models using the biased estimator (Raiko et al., 2014) with 10 random samples on CIFAR-10 dataset.\nMore interestingly, Simplified-SFNN consistently outperforms its baseline DNN due to the stochastic regularizing effect, even when we train both models using dropout (Hinton et al., 2012b) and batch normalization (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015). In order to confirm the regularization effects, one can again approximate a trained Simplified-SFNN by a new deterministic DNN which we call DNN∗ and is different from its baseline DNN under the following approximation at upper latent units above binary random units:\nEP (h`|x) [ s ( W`+1j h ` )] w s ( EP (h`|x) [ W`+1j h ` ]) = s (∑ i W `+1ij P ( h`i = 1 | x )) . (9)\nWe found that DNN∗ using fined-tuned parameters of Simplified-SFNN also outperforms the baseline DNN as shown in Table 2 and Figure 2(b)."

Here, we present some key results due to the space constraints and more detailed explanations for our experiment setups are presented in Appendix C.\nWe first verify that it is possible to learn one-to-many mapping via Simplified-SFNN on the TFD and MNIST datasets, where the former and the latter are used to predict multiple facial expressions from the mean of face images per individual and the lower half of the MNIST digit given the upper half, respectively. We remark that both tasks are commonly performed in recent other works to test the multi-modal learning using SFNN (Raiko et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2015). In all experiments, we first train a baseline DNN, and the trained parameters of DNN are used for further fine-tuning those of Simplified-SFNN. As shown in Table 3 and Figure 3, stochastic models outperform their baseline DNN, and generate different digits for the case of ambiguous inputs (while DNN does not). We also evaluate the regularization effect of Simplified-SFNN for the classification tasks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN. Table 4 reports the classification error rates using convolutional neural networks such as Lenet-5 (LeCun et al., 1998), NIN (Lin et al., 2014) and WRN (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016). Due to the regularization effects, Simplified-SFNNs consistently outperform\ntheir baseline DNNs. For example, WRN∗ outperforms WRN by 0.08% on CIFAR-10 and 0.58% on CIFAR-100. We expect that if one introduces more stochastic layers, the error would be decreased more (see Figure 4), but it increases the fine-tuning time-complexity of Simplified-SFNN."

For these datasets, we design a convolutional version of Simplified-SFNN. In a similar manner to the case of fully-connected networks, one can define a stochastic convolution layer, which considers the input feature map as a binary random matrix and generates the output feature map as defined in (6). All Simplified-SFNNs are constructed by replacing a hidden feature map of a baseline models, i.e., Lenet-5, NIN and WRN, with stochastic one as shown in Figure 5(d). We use WRN with 16 and 28 layers for SVHN and CIFAR datasets, respectively, since they showed state-of-the-art performance as reported by Zagoruyko & Komodakis (2016). In case of WRN, we introduce up to two stochastic convolution layers.For 100 epochs, we first train baseline models, i.e., Lenet-5, NIN and WRN, and trained parameters are used for initializing those of Simplified-SFNNs. All Simplified-SFNNs are trained with M = 5 samples and the test error is only measured by the approximation (9).

However, training SFNN is notoriously harder. In this paper, we aim at developing efficient training methods for large-scale SFNN, in particular using known architectures and pre-trained parameters of DNN. To this end, we propose a new intermediate stochastic model, called Simplified-SFNN, which can be built upon any baseline DNN and approximates certain SFNN by simplifying its upper latent units above stochastic ones. The main novelty of our approach is in establishing the connection between three models, i.e., DNN → Simplified-SFNN → SFNN, which naturally leads to an efficient training procedure of the stochastic models utilizing pre-trained parameters of DNN. Using several popular DNNs, we show how they can be effectively transferred to the corresponding stochastic models for both multi-modal and classification tasks on MNIST, TFD, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN datasets. In particular, our stochastic model built from the wide residual network has 28 layers and 36 million parameters, where the former consistently outperforms the latter for the classification tasks on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 due to its stochastic regularizing effect.",
