      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Sparse coding has been widely studied as a representation for images, audio and other vectorial data. This has been a highly successful method that has found its way into many applications, from signal compression and denoising (Donoho, 2006; Elad & Aharon, 2006) to image classification (Wright et al., 2009), to modeling neuronal receptive fields in visual cortex (Olshausen & Field, 1997). Since its introduction, subsequent works have brought sparse coding into the supervised learning setting by introducing classification loss terms to the original formulation to encourage features that are not only able to reconstruct the original signal but are also discriminative (Jiang et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2010; Zeiler et al., 2010; Ji et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013).\nWhile supervised sparse coding methods have been shown to find more discriminative features leading to improved classification performance over their unsupervised counterparts, they have received much less attention in recent years and have been eclipsed by simpler feed-forward architectures.\nThis is in part because sparse coding is computationally expensive. Convex formulations of sparse coding typically consist of a minimization problem over an objective that includes a least-squares (LSQ) reconstruction error term plus a sparsity inducing regularizer.\nBecause there is no closed-form solution to this formulation, various iterative optimization techniques are generally used to find a solution (Zeiler et al., 2010; Bristow et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013; Heide et al., 2015). In applications where an approximate solution suffices, there is work that learns non-linear predictors to estimate sparse codes rather than solve the objective more directly (Gregor & LeCun, 2010). The computational overhead for iterative schemes becomes quite significant when training discriminative models due to the demand of processing many training examples necessary for good performance, and so sparse coding has fallen out of favor by not being able to keep up with simpler non-iterative coding methods.\nIn this paper we introduce an alternate formulation of sparse coding using unit length codes and a reconstruction loss based on the cosine similarity. Optimal sparse codes in this model can be computed in a non-iterative fashion and the coding objective lends itself naturally to embedding in a discriminative, energy-based classifier which we term energy-based spherical sparse coding (EBSSC). This bi-directional coding method incorporates both top-down and bottom-up information where the features representation depends on both a hypothesized class label and the input signal. Like Cao et al. (2015), our motivation for bi-directional coding comes from the “Biased Competition Theory”, which suggests that visual processing can be biased by other mental processes (e.g., topdown influence) to prioritize certain features that are most relevant to current task. Fig. 1 illustrates the flow of computation used by our SSC and EB-SSC building blocks compared to a standard feed-forward layer.\nOur energy based approach for combining top-down and bottom-up information is closely tied to the ideas of Larochelle & Bengio (2008); Ji et al. (2011); Zhang et al. (2013); Li & Guo (2014)— although the model details are substantially different (e.g., Ji et al. (2011) and Zhang et al. (2013) use sigmoid non-linearities while Li & Guo (2014) use separate representations for top-down and bottom-up information). The energy function of Larochelle & Bengio (2008) is also similar but includes an extra classification term and is trained as a restricted Boltzmann machine."

To measure the compatibility between the top-down and bottom-up information, we define the energy function of EB-SSC to be the sum of bottom-up coding term and a top-down classification term:\nE(x, y, z) = Ecode(x, z) + Eclass(y, z).

      "text" : "To measure the compatibility between the input signal x and the latent feature maps z, we introduce a novel variant of sparse coding that is amenable to efficient feed-forward optimization. While the idea behind this variant can be applied to either patch-based or convolutional sparse coding, we specifically use the convolutional variant that shares the burden of coding an image among nearby overlapping dictionary elements. Using such a shift-invariant approach avoids the need to learn dictionary elements which are simply translated copies of each other, freeing up resources to discover more diverse and specific filters (see Kavukcuoglu et al. (2010)).\nConvolutional sparse coding (CSC) attempts to find a set of dictionary elements {d1, . . . ,dK} and corresponding sparse codes {z1, . . . , zK} so that the resulting reconstruction, r = ∑K k=1 dk ∗ zk accurately represents the input signal x. This is traditionally framed as a least-squares minimization with a sparsity inducing prior on z:\narg min z ‖x− K∑ k=1 dk ∗ zk‖22 + β‖z‖1. (2)\nUnlike standard feed-forward CNN models that convolve the input signal x with the filters, this energy function corresponds to a generative model where the latent feature maps {z1, . . . , zK} are convolved with the filters and compared to the input signal (Bristow et al., 2013; Heide et al., 2015; Zeiler et al., 2010).\nTo motivate our novel variant of CSC, consider expanding the squared reconstruction error ‖x − r‖22 = ‖x‖22 − 2xᵀr + ‖r‖22. If we constrain the reconstruction r to have unit norm, the reconstruction error depends entirely on the inner product between x and r and is equivalent to the cosine similarity (up to additive and multiplicative constants). This suggests the closely related unit-length reconstruction problem:\narg max z xᵀ ( K∑ k=1 dk ∗ zk ) − β‖z‖1 (3)\ns.t. ∥∥ K∑ k=1 dk ∗ zk ∥∥ 2 ≤ 1\nIn Appendix A we show that, given an optimal unit length reconstruction r̄∗ with corresponding codes z̄∗, the solution to the least squares reconstruction problem (Eq. 2) can be computed by a simple scaling r∗ = (xᵀr̄∗ − β2 ‖z̄\n∗‖1)r̄∗. The unit-length reconstruction problem is no easier than the original least-squares optimization due to the constraint on the reconstruction which couples the codes for different filters. Instead consider a simplified constraint on z which we refer to as spherical sparse coding (SSC):\narg max ‖z‖2≤1 Ecode(x, z) = arg max ‖z‖2≤1 xᵀ ( K∑ k=1 dk ∗ zk ) − β‖z‖1. (4)\nIn 2.3 below, we show that the solution to this problem can be found very efficiently without requiring iterative optimization.\nThis problem is a relaxation of convolutional sparse coding since it ignores non-orthogonal interactions between the dictionary elements1. Alternately, assuming unit norm dictionary elements, the code norm constraint can be used to upper-bound the reconstruction length. We have by the triangle and Young’s inequality that:∥∥∑\nk\ndk ∗ zk ∥∥ 2 ≤ ∑ k ‖dk ∗ zk‖2 ≤ ∑ k ‖dk‖1‖zk‖1 ≤ D ∑ k ‖zk‖2 (5)\nwhere the factor D is the dimension of zk and arises from switching from the 1-norm to the 2-norm. Since D ∑ k ‖zk‖2 ≤ 1 is a tighter constraint we have\nmax ‖ ∑ k dk∗zk‖2≤1 Ecode(x, z) ≥ max∑ k ‖zk‖2≤ 1 D Ecode(x, z) (6)\nHowever, this relaxation is very loose, primarily due to the triangle inequality. Except in special cases (e.g., if the dictionary elements have disjoint spectra) the SSC codes will be quite different from the standard least-squares reconstruction.\n1We note that our formulation is also closely related to the dynamical model suggested by Rozell et al. (2008), but without the dictionary-dependent lateral inhibition between feature maps. Lateral inhibition can solve the unit-length reconstruction formulation of standard sparse coding but requires iterative optimization."

      "heading" : "2.2 TOP-DOWN CLASSIFICATION",
      "text" : "To measure the compatibility between the class label y and the latent feature maps z, we use a set of one-vs-all linear classifiers. To provide more flexibility, we generalize this by splitting the code vector into positive and negative components:\nzk = z + k + z − k z + k ≥ 0 z − k ≤ 0\nand allow the linear classifier to operate on each component separately. We express the classifier score for a hypothesized class label y by:\nEclass(y, z) = K∑ k=1 w+ᵀy z + k + K∑ k=1 w−ᵀy z − k . (7)\nThe classifier thus is parameterized by a pair of weight vectors (w+yk and w − yk) for each class label y and k-th channel of the latent feature map.\nThis splitting, sometimes referred to as full-wave rectification, is useful since a dictionary element and its negative do not necessarily have opposite visual semantics. This splitting also allows the classifier the flexibility to assign distinct meanings or alternately be completely invariant to contrast reversal depending on the problem domain. For example, Shang et al. (2016) found CNN models with ReLU non-linearities which discard the negative activations tend to learn pairs of filters which are related by negation. Keeping both positive and negative responses allowed them to halve the number of dictionary elements.\nWe note that it is also straightforward to introduce spatial average pooling prior to classification by introducing a fixed linear operator P used to pool the codes (e.g., w+ᵀy Pz + k ). This is motivated by a variety of hand-engineered feature extractors and sparse coding models, such as Ren & Ramanan (2013), which use spatially pooled histograms of sparse codes for classification. This fixed pooling can be viewed as a form of regularization on the linear classifier which enforces shared weights over spatial blocks of the latent feature map. Splitting is also quite important to prevent information loss when performing additive pooling since positive and negative components of zk can cancel each other out."

On the other hand, the asymmetric shrink function can be viewed as the sum of two ReLUs applied to appropriately biased inputs:\nshrink(β+,β−)(x) = ReLU(x− β+)− ReLU(−(x+ β−)),\nSSC coding can thus be seen as a CNN in which the ReLU activation has been replaced with shrinkage followed by a global normalization."

We constrain the relationship between β and the entries of w+y and w − y in order for the asymmetric shrinkage to be a proper function (see Sec. 2.3.1 and Appendix B for details).\nIn classical sparse coding, it is typical to constrain the `2-norm of each dictionary filter to unit length. Our spherical coding objective behaves similarly. For any optimal code z∗, there is a 1-dimensional subspace of parameters for which z∗ is optimal given by scaling d inversely to w, β. For simplicity of the implementation, we opt to regularize d to assure a unique solution. However, as Tygert et al. (2015) point out, it may be advantageous from the perspective of optimization to explicitly constrain the norm of the filter bank.\nNote that unlike classical sparse coding, where β is a hyperparameter that is usually set using crossvalidation, we treat it as a parameter of the model that is learned to maximize performance."

We optimize the objective using stochastic gradient descent (SGD).\nAs mentioned in Sec. 2.3 shrinkage function is assymetric with parameters β+yk or β − yk as defined in Eq. 10. However, the inequality constraint on their relationship to keep the shrinkage function a proper function is difficult to enforce when optimizing with SGD. Instead, we introduce a central offset parameter and reduce the ordering constraint to pair of positivity constraints. Let\nŵ+yk = β + yk − bk ŵ − yk = β − yk + bk (14)\nbe the modified linear “classifiers” relative to the central offset bk. It is straightforward to see that if β+yk and β − yk that satisfy the constrain in Eq. 13, then adding the same value to both sides of the inequality will not change that. However, taking bk to be a midpoint between them, then both β+yk − bk and β − yk + bk will be strictly non-negative.\nUsing this variable substitution, we rewrite the energy function (Eq. 1) as\nE′(x, y, z) = xᵀ ( K∑ k=1 dk ∗ zk ) + K∑ k=1 bk1 ᵀzk − K∑ k=1 ŵ+ᵀyk z + k + K∑ k=1 ŵ−ᵀyk z − k .

      "heading" : "3.1.1 STACKING BLOCKS",
      "text" : "We also examine stacking multiple blocks of our energy function in order to build a hierarchical representation. As mentioned in Sec. 3.1.1, the optimal codes can be computed in a simple feedforward pass—this applies to shallow versions of our model. When stacking multiple blocks of our energy-based model, solving for the optimal codes cannot be done in a feed-forward pass since the codes for different blocks are coupled (bilinearly) in the joint objective. Instead, we can proceed in an iterative manner, performing block-coordinate descent by repeatedly passing up and down the hierarchy updating the codes. In this section we investigate the trade-off between the number of passes used to find the optimal codes for the stacked model and classification performance.\nFor this purpose, we train multiple instances of a 2-block version of our energy-based model that differ in the number of iterations used when solving for the codes. For recurrent networks such as this, inference is commonly implemented by “unrolling” the network, where the parts of the network structure are repeated with parameters shared across these repeated parts to mimic an iterative algorithm that stops at a fixed number of iterations rather than at some convergence criteria.\nIn Fig. 3, we compare the performance between models that were unrolled zero to four times. We see that there is a difference in performance based on how many sweeps of the variables are made. In terms of the training objective, more unrolling produces models that have lower objective values with convergence after only a few passes. In terms of testing error, however, we see that full code inference is not necessarily better, as unrolling once or twice has lower errors than unrolling three or four times. The biggest difference was between not unrolling and unrolling once, where both the training objective and testing error goes down. The testing error decreases from 0.0131 to 0.0074. While there is a clear benefit in terms of performance for unrolling at least once, there is also a trade-off between performance and computational resource, especially for deeper models."

This model can be viewed as a basic feed-forward version of our proposed model which we take as a baseline. We also consider variants of the baseline model that utilize a subset of architectural features of our proposed model (e.g., concatenated rectified linear units (CReLU) and spherical normalization (SN)) to understand how subtle design changes of the network architecture affects performance.\nWe describe the model architecture in terms of the feature extractor and classifier. Table 1 shows the overall network architecture of feature extractors, which consist of seven convolution blocks and two pooling layers. We test two possible classifiers: a simple linear classifier (LC) and our energy-based classifier (EBC), and use softmax-loss for all models. For linear classifiers, a numerical subscript indicates which of the seven conv blocks of the feature extractor is used for classification (e.g., LC7 indicates the activations out of the last conv block is fed into the linear classifier). For energy-based classifiers, a numerical subscript indicates which conv blocks of the feature extractor are replace with a energy-based classifier (e.g., EBC6−7 indicates the activations out of conv5 is fed into the energy-based classifier and the energy-based classifier has a similar architecture to the conv blocks it replaces). The notation differ because for energy-based classifiers, the optimal activations are a function of the hypothesized class label, whereas for linear classifiers, they are not.\nThe results shown in Table 2 compare our proposed model to the baselines ReLU+LC7 (Springenberg et al., 2015) and CReLU+LC7 (Shang et al., 2016), and to intermediate variants. The baseline models all perform very similarly with some small reductions in error rates over the baseline CReLU+LC7. However, CReLU+LC7 reduces the error rate over ReLU+LC7 by more than one percent (from 11.40% to 10.17%), which confirms the claims by Shang et al. (2016) and demonstrates the benefits of splitting positive and negative activations. Likewise, we see further decrease in the error rate (to 9.74%) from using spherical normalization. Though normalizing the activations doesn’t add any capacity to the model, this improved performance is likely because scale-invariant activations makes training easier. On the other hand, further sparsifying the activations yielded no\nbenefit. We tested values β = {0.001, 0.01} and found 0.001 to perform better.

Similar to the work on deconvolutional networks built on least-squares sparse coding (Zeiler et al., 2010), we can synthesize input images from activations in our spherical coding network by performing repeated deconvolutions (transposed convolutions) back through the network. Since our model is energy based, we can further examine how the topdown information of a hypothesized class effects the intermediate activations.\nThe first column in Fig. 4 visualizes reconstructions of a given input image based on activations from different layers of the model by convolution transpose. In this case we put in zeros for class biases (i.e., no top-down) and are able to recover high fidelity reconstructions of the input. In the remaining columns, we use the same deconvolution pass to construct input space representations of the learned classifier biases. At low levels of the feature hierarchy, these biases are spatially smooth since the receptive fields are small and there is little spatial invariance capture in the activations. At higher levels these class-conditional bias fields become more tightly localized.\nFinally, in Fig. 5 we shows decodings from the conv2 and conv5 layer of the EB-SSC model for a given input under different class hypotheses. Here we subtract out the contribution of the top-down bias term in order to isolate the effect of the class conditioning on the encoding of input features. As visible in the figure, the modulation of the activations focused around particular regions of the image and the differences across class hypotheses becomes more pronounced at higher layers of the network."

In applications where an approximate solution suffices, there is work that learns non-linear predictors to estimate sparse codes rather than solve the objective more directly (Gregor & LeCun, 2010). The computational overhead for iterative schemes becomes quite significant when training discriminative models due to the demand of processing many training examples necessary for good performance, and so sparse coding has fallen out of favor by not being able to keep up with simpler non-iterative coding methods. In this paper we introduce an alternate formulation of sparse coding using unit length codes and a reconstruction loss based on the cosine similarity. Optimal sparse codes in this model can be computed in a non-iterative fashion and the coding objective lends itself naturally to embedding in a discriminative, energy-based classifier which we term energy-based spherical sparse coding (EBSSC). This bi-directional coding method incorporates both top-down and bottom-up information where the features representation depends on both a hypothesized class label and the input signal. Like Cao et al. (2015), our motivation for bi-directional coding comes from the “Biased Competition Theory”, which suggests that visual processing can be biased by other mental processes (e.",

The baseline models all perform very similarly with some small reductions in error rates over the baseline CReLU+LC7. However, CReLU+LC7 reduces the error rate over ReLU+LC7 by more than one percent (from 11.40% to 10.17%), which confirms the claims by Shang et al. (2016) and demonstrates the benefits of splitting positive and negative activations.",

To use these codes for discriminative classification, we describe a model we term Energy-Based Spherical Sparse Coding (EB-SSC) in which the hypothesized class label introduces a learned linear bias into the coding step. We evaluate and visualize performance of stacking this encoder to make a deep layered model for image classification.",
