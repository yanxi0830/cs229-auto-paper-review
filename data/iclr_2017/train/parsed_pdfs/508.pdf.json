      "text" : "Many different problems in various fields of science require the classification of structured data, i.e. collections of objects bond together by some kind of relation. A natural way to represent such structures is through graphs, which are able to encode both the individual objects composing the collection (as vertices) and the relationships between them (as edges). A number of approaches to the graph classification problem has been studied in graph kernel and neural network literature.\nGraph kernels decompose input graphs in substructures such as shortest paths (Borgwardt & Kriegel, 2005), graphlets (Shervashidze et al., 2009) or neighborhood subgraph pairs (Costa & De Grave, 2010). The similarity between two graphs is then computed by comparing the respective sets of parts. Methods based on recursive neural networks unfold a neural network over input graphs and learn vector representations of their nodes employing backpropagation though structure (Goller & Kuchler, 1996). Recursive neural networks have been successfully applied to domains such as natural language (Socher et al., 2011) and biology (Vullo & Frasconi, 2004; Baldi & Pollastri, 2003). An advantage of recursive neural networks over graph kernels, is that the vector representations of the input graphs are learnt rather than handcrafted.\nLearning on social network data can be considerably hard due to their peculiar structure: as opposed to chemical compounds and parse trees, the structure of social network graphs is highly irregular. Indeed in social networks it is common to have nodes in the same graph whose degree differs by orders of magnitude. This poses a significant challenge for the substructure matching approach used by some graph kernels as the variability in connectivity generates a large number of unique patterns leading to diagonally dominant kernel matrices.\nWe propose Shift Aggregate Extract Networks (SAEN), a neural network architecture for learning representations of input graphs. SAEN decomposes input graphs intoH-hierarchies made of multiple strata of objects. Objects in each stratum are connected by “part-of” relations to the objects to the stratum above.\nIn case we wish to classify graphs we can use an H-hierarchical decomposition in which the top stratum contains the graphG that we want to classify, while the intermediate strata contain subgraphs of G, subgraphs of subgraphs of G and so on, until we reach the bottom stratum which contains the vertices v of G.\nUnlike R-convolution relations in kernel methods (which decompose objects into the set of their parts), H-hierarchical decompositions are deep as they can represent the parts of the parts of an object.\nRecursive neural networks associate to the vertices of the input graphs vector representations imposing that they have identical dimensions. Moreover, the propagation follows the edge connectivity and weights are shared over the whole input graph. If we consider that vector representations of nodes (whose number of parents can differ by orders of magnitude) must share the same weights, learning on social network data with recursive neural networks might be nontrivial.\nSAEN compensates the limitations of recursive neural networks by adding the following degrees of flexibility:\n1. the SAEN computation schema unfolds a neural network over H-decompositions instead of the input graph, 2. SAEN imposes weight sharing and fixed size of the learnt vector representations on a per stratum basis instead of globally.\nIndeed SAEN allows to use vector representations of different sizes for different strata of objects (e.g. graphs, subgraphs, subgraphs of subgraphs, edges, vertices etc.) The SAEN schema computes the vector representation of each object by applying shift, aggregate and extract operations on the vector representations of its parts.\nAnother contribution of this paper is the introduction of a domain compression algorithm, that we use in our experiments to reduce memory usage and runtime. Domain compression collapses objects in the same stratum of an H-hierarchical decomposition into a compressed one whenever these objects are indistinguishable for the SAEN computation schema. In particular objects made of the same sets of parts are indistinguishable. In order obtain a lossless compression an H-hierarchical decomposition we store counts on symmetries adopting some mathematical results from lifted linear programming (Mladenov et al., 2012). The domain compression algorithm is also reminiscent of the work of Sperduti & Starita (1997) in which common substructures of recursive neural networks are collapsed in order to reduce the computational cost."

      "text" : "We propose a neural network architecture that takes as input an undirected attributed graph G = (V,E,X) where V is the vertex set, E ⊆ V × V is the edge set, and X = {xv ∈ Rp}v∈V is a set of p-dimensional vertex attributes. When vertices do not have associated attributes (for example this happens in some of the social network datasets of § 4.1), we can set xv to some vertex invariant such as node centrality or betweenness.\n2.1 H-HIERARCHICAL DECOMPOSITIONS\nMost graph kernels decompose graphs into parts by using an R-convolution relation (Haussler, 1999). We extend this approach by decomposing graphs into a hierarchy of π-parametrized “part of” relations. Formally, anH-hierarchical decomposition is a pair ({Sl}Ll=0, {Rl,π}Ll=1) where: • {Sl}Ll=0 are disjoint sets of objects Sl called strata, or levels of the hierarchy. The bottom stratum S0 contains non-decomposable objects (e.g. individual vertices), while the other strata Sl, l = 1, . . . , L contain composite objects, oi ∈ Sl, whose parts oj ∈ Sl−1 belong to the preceding stratum, Sl−1.\n• {Rl,π}Ll=1 is a set of l, π-parametrized Rl,π-convolution relations. A pair (oi, oj) ∈ Sl × Sl−1 belongs toRl,π iff “oj is part of oi with membership type π”. For notational convenience, the parts of oi are denoted asR−1l,π(oi) = {oj |(oj , oi) ∈ Rl,π}. The membership type π is used to represent the roles of the parts of an object. For example, we could decompose a graph as a multiset of π-neighborhood subgraphs 1 in which π is the radius of the neighborhoods (see Figure 1 on the left). Another possible use of the π membership type is to\n1The r-neighborhood subgraph (or ego graph) of a vertex v in a graph G is the induced subgraph of G consisting of all vertices whose shortest-path distance from v is at most r.\ndistinguish the root from the other vertices in a rooted neighborhood subgraph (see Figure 1 on the right).\nAn H-hierarchical decomposition is a multilevel generalization of R-convolution relations, and it reduces to anR-convolution relation for L = 1."

      "text" : "We propose Shift Aggregate Extract Network (SAEN) to learn vector representations for all the objects of all the strata {Sl}Ll=0 in an H-hierarchical decomposition. SAEN unfolds a neural network architecture over anH-hierarchical decomposition by using the Shift Aggregate Extract (SAE) schema.\nAccording to the SAE schema the vector representation of each object in theH-hierarchical decomposition is either computed by applying a neural network on the vertex attributes (for the objects in bottom stratum) or defined in terms of the vector representations of its parts (for the other objects).\nMore formally, the SAE schema associates a dl-dimensional representation hi ∈ Rdl to each object oi ∈ Sl of theH-hierarchical decomposition according to the following formula:\nhi =    f0(xvi ; Θ0) if oi ∈ S0 fl ( ∑ π∈Πl ∑ oj∈R−1l,π(oi) (zπ ⊗ hj)︸ ︷︷ ︸ Shift︸ ︷︷ ︸ Aggregate ; Θl )\n︸ ︷︷ ︸ Extract\notherwise (1)\nwhere fl(·; Θl), l = 0, . . . , L are multilayer neural networks with parameters Θl. With respect to the base case (first branch of Eq. 1) we have that each object oi in the bottom stratum S0 is in one-to-one correspondence with the vertices vi ∈ V of the graph that we are decomposing. Indeed the vector representations hi are computed by evaluating f0(·; Θ0) in correspondence of the vertex attributes xvi ∈ X . The recursion step (second branch of Eq. 1) follows the Shift Aggregate Extract (SAE) schema:\n• Shift: each part representation hj ∈ Rdl−1 is remapped into a space R|Πldl−1| made of |Πl| slots, where each slot has dimension dl−1. This transformation shifts part representations hj by using the Kronecker product ⊗ between an indicator vector zπ ∈ R|Πl| and the vector representation hj of part oj ∈ Sl−1. The indicator vector zπ ∈ R|Πl| defined as zi = { 1 if i=π 0 otherwise. and it is used to\nmake sure that vector representations hj of object parts will fall in the same slot if and only if they have the same membership type π. • Aggregate: the shifted representations (zπ ⊗ hj) of the parts oj are then aggregated with a sum. • Extract: the aggregated representation is compressed to a dl-dimensional space by a Θlparametrized nonlinear map fl(·,Θl) : R|Πldl−1| → Rdl implemented with a multilayer neural network.\nThe shift and aggregate steps, that we have seen so far, are identical to those used in kernel design when computing the explicit feature of a kernel k(x, z) derived from a sum ∑ π∈Π kπ(x, z) of base kernels kπ(x, z), π ∈ Π. In principle, it would be indeed possible to turn SAEN into a kernel method by removing the extraction step E from the SAE schema. However, such an approach would increase the dimensionality of the feature space by a multiplicative factor |Πl| for each level l of the Hhierarchical decomposition, thus leading to an exponential number of features. When using SAEN, the feature space growth is prevented by exploiting a distributed representation (via a multilayered neural network) during the E step of the SAE schema. As a result, SAEN can easily cope with Hhierarchical decompositions consisting of multiple strata."

      "text" : "In this section we propose a technique, called domain compression, which allows to save memory and speedup the SAEN computation. Domain compression exploits symmetries inH-hierarchical decompositions by collapsing equivalent objects in each stratum. The greater the number of collapsed objects the highest the compression ratio.\nTwo objects a, b in a stratum Sl are collapsable a ∼ b if they share the same representation (i.e. ha = hb) for all the possible values of Θl. A compressed stratum S comp l is the quotient set Sl/∼ of stratum Sl w.r.t. the collapsibility relation ∼. We assume that the attributes of the elements in the bottom stratum S0 are categorical, so that the same vector representation can be shared by multiple elements with non-zero probability. 2 While objects in the bottom stratum S0 are collapsable when their attributes are identical, for all the other strata Sl, l = 1, . . . , L, objects are collapsable if they are made by the same sets of parts for all the membership types π.\nIn Figure 2 we provide a pictorial representation of the domain compression of an H-hierarchical decomposition (EGNN, described in § 4.2).

A pseudo-inverse C of D can be computed by dividing the rows of D> by their sum (where D> is the transpose of D).\nExample 1 If we look at matrix M in Eq. 2 we notice that row 1 and 4 share the encoding [0, 0, 0], rows 3 and 5 share the encoding [1, 1, 0] while the encoding [1, 0, 1] appears only once at row 2.

Domain compression on Eq. 3 is performed by the DOMAIN-COMPRESSION procedure (see Algorithm 3) that takes as input the attribute matrix X and the part-of matrices Rl,π and returns their compressed versions Xcomp and the Rcompl,π respectively. The algorithm starts by invoking (line 1) the procedure COMPUTE-CD on X to obtain the compression and decompression matrices C0 and D0 respectively. The compression matrix C0 is used to compress X (line 2) then we start iterating over the levels l = 0, . . . , L of the H-hierarchical decomposition (line 4) and compress the Rl,π matrices. The compression of the Rl,π matrices is done by right-multiplying them by the decompression matrixDl−1 of the previous level l−1 (line 5). In this way we collapse the parts of relation Rl,π (i.e. the columns of Rl,π) as these were identified in stratum Sl−1 as identical objects (i.e. those objects corresponding to the rows of X or Rl−1,π collapsed during the previous step). The result is a list Rcol comp = [Rl,πDl−1, ∀π = 1, . . . , |Πl|] of column compressed Rl,π−matrices. We proceed collapsing equivalent objects in stratum Sl, i.e. those made of identical sets of parts: we find symmetries in Rcol comp by invoking COMPUTE-CD (line 6) and obtain a new pair Cl, Dl of compression, and decompression matrices respectively.

Willing to recover the original encodings Hl we just need to employ the decompression matrix Dl on the compressed encodings H comp l , indeed Hl = DlH comp l .\nAs we can see by substituting Sl with S comp l , the more are the symmetries (i.e. when |S comp l | |Sl|) the greater the domain compression will be."

      "text" : "When learning with graph inputs two fundamental design aspects that must be taken into account are: the choice of the pattern generator and the choice of the matching operator. The former decomposes the graph input in substructures while the latter allows to compare the substructures.\nAmong the patterns considered from the graph kernel literature we have paths, shortest paths, walks (Kashima et al., 2003), subtrees (Ramon & Gärtner, 2003; Shervashidze et al., 2011) and neighborhood subgraphs (Costa & De Grave, 2010). The similarity between graphs G and G′ is computed by counting the number of matches between their common the substructures (i.e. a kernel on the sets of the substructures). The match between two substructures can be defined by using graph isomorphism or some other weaker graph invariant.\nWhen the number of substructures to enumerate is infinite or exponential with the size of the graph (perhaps this is the case for random walks and shortest paths respectively) the kernel between the two graphs is computed without generating an explicit feature map. Learning with an implicit feature map is not scalable as it has a space complexity quadratic in the number of training examples (because we need to store in memory the gram matrix).\nOther graph kernels such as the Weisfeiler-Lehman Subtree Kernel (WLST) (Shervashidze et al., 2011) and the Neighborhood Subgraph Pairwise Distance Kernel (NSPDK) (Costa & De Grave, 2010) deliberately choose a pattern generator that scales polynomially and produces an explicit feature map. However the vector representations produced by WLST and NSPDK are handcrafted and not learned.\nA recent work by Yanardag & Vishwanathan (2015) proposes to uses pattern generators such as graphlets, shortest paths and WLST subtrees to transform input graphs into documents. The generated substructures are then treated as words and embedded in the Euclidean space with a CBOW or a Skip-gram model. The deep upgrade of existing graph kernels is performed by reweighing the counts of the substructures by the square root of their word-vector self similarity.\nAnother recent work by Niepert et al. (2016) upgrades the convolutional neural networks CNNs for images to graphs. While the receptive field of a CNN is usually a square window (Niepert et al., 2016) employ neighborhood subgraphs as receptive fields. As nodes in graphs do not have a specific temporal or spatial order, (Niepert et al., 2016) employ vertex invariants to impose an order on the nodes of the subgraphs/receptive fields."

We label vertices v of G with their degree and encode this information into the attributes xv by employing the 1-hot encoding.\nEGNN decomposes attributed graphs G = (V,E,X) into a 3 level H-hierarchical decomposition with the following strata (see Figure 1 for a pictorial representation of EGNN): • stratum S0 contains objects ov that are in one-to-one correspondence with the vertices v ∈ V . • stratum S1 contains vroot-rooted r-neighborhood subgraphs (i.e. ego graphs) e = (vroot, Ve, Ee) of radius r = 0, 1, . . . , R and has part-of alphabet Π1 = {ROOT, ELEM}.

Vector representations of each object are learnt by applying shift, aggregate and extract operations on the vector representations of its parts. We propose an algorithm for domain compression which takes advantage of symmetries in hierarchical decompositions to reduce the memory usage and obtain significant speedups. Our method is empirically evaluated on real world social network datasets, outperforming the current state of the art.",
