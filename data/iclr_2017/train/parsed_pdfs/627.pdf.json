      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Neural machine translation (NMT) has achieved great success in recent years (Sutskever et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). In contrast to statistical machine translation, which requires huge phrase and rule tables, NMT requires much less memory. However, the most standard model, NMT with attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) entails the shortcoming that the attention mechanism cannot capture the entire meaning of a sentence because it generates a target word while depending heavily on the relevant parts of the source sentence (Tu et al., 2016). To overcome this problem, Variational Neural Machine Translation (VNMT), which outperforms NMT with attention introduces a latent variable to capture the underlying semantic from source and target (Zhang et al., 2016). We follow the motivation of VNMT, which is to capture underlying semantic of a source.\nImage information is related to language. For example, we human beings understand the meaning of language by linking perceptual information given by the surrounding environment and language (Barsalou, 1999). Although it is natural and easy for humans, it is difficult for computers to understand different domain’s information integrally. Solving this difficult task might, however, bring great improvements in natural language processing. Several researchers have attempted to link language and images such as image captioning by Xu et al. (2015) or image generation from sentences by Reed et al. (2016). They described the possibility of integral understanding of images and text. In machine translation, we can expect an improvement using not only text information but also image information because image information can bridge two languages.\nAs described herein, we propose the neural machine translation model which introduces a latent variable containing an underlying semantic extracted from texts and images. Our model includes an explicit latent variable z, which has underlying semantics extracted from text and images by introducing a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) (Kingma et al., 2014; Rezende et al., 2014). Our model,\n∗First two authors contributed equally.\nGreen dotted lines denote that π and encoded y are used only when training.\nwhich can be trained end-to-end, requires image information only when training. As described herein, we tackle the task with which one uses a parallel corpus and images in training, while using a source corpus in translating. It is important to define the task in this manner because we rarely have a corresponding image when we want to translate a sentence. During translation, our model generates a semantic variable z from a source, integrates variable z into a decoder of neural machine translation system, and then finally generates the translation. The difference between our model and VNMT is that we use image information in addition to text information.\nFor experiments, we used Multi30k (Elliott et al., 2016), which includes images and the corresponding parallel corpora of English and German. Our model outperforms the baseline with two evaluation metrics: METEOR (Denkowski & Lavie, 2014) and BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002). Moreover, we obtain some knowledge related to our model and Multi30k. Finally, we present some examples in which our model either improved, or worsened, the result.\nOur paper contributes to the neural machine translation research community in three ways.\n• We present the first neural machine translation model to introduce a latent variable inferred from image and text information. We also present the first translation task with which one uses a parallel corpus and images in training, while using a source corpus in translating.\n• Our translation model can generate more accurate translation by training with images, especially for short sentences.\n• We present how the translation of source is changed by adding image information compared to VNMT which does not use image information."

      "text" : "Multimodal Translation is the task with which one might one can use a parallel corpus and images. The first papers to study multimodal translation are Elliott et al. (2015) and Hitschler & Riezler (2016). It was selected as a shared task in Workshop of Machine Translation 2016 (WMT161). Although several studies have been conducted (Caglayan et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2016; Calixto et al., 2016; Libovický et al., 2016; Rodrı́guez Guasch & Costa-jussà, 2016; Shah et al., 2016), they do not show great improvement, especially in neural machine translation (Specia et al., 2016). Here, we introduce end-to-end neural network translation models like our model.\nCaglayan et al. (2016) integrate an image into an NMT decoder. They simply put source context vectors and image feature vectors extracted from ResNet-50’s ‘res4f relu’ layer (He et al., 2016) into the decoder called multimodal conditional GRU. They demonstrate that their method does not surpass the text-only baseline: NMT with attention.\nHuang et al. (2016) integrate an image into a head of source words sequence. They extract prominent objects from the image by Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (R-CNN) (Girshick, 2015). Objects are then converted to feature vectors by VGG-19 (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014) and are put into a head of source words sequence. They demonstrate that object extraction by R-CNN contributes greatly to the improvement. This model achieved the highest METEOR score in NMTbased models in WMT16, which we compare to our model in the experiment. We designate this model as CMU.\nCaglayan et al. (2016) argue that their proposed model did not achieve improvement because they failed to benefit from both text and images. We assume that they failed to integrate text and images because they simply put images and text into neural machine translation despite huge gap exists between image information and text information. Our model, however, presents the possibility of benefitting from images and text because text and images are projected to their common semantic space so that the gap of images and text would be filled."

We propose several ways of extracting image features.\nGlobal (G) The image feature vector is extracted from the image using a CNN. With this method, we use a feature vector in the certain layer as π. Then π is encoded to the image representation vector hπ simply by affine transformation as\nhπ = Wππ + bπ where Wπ ∈ Rdπ×dfc7 , bπ ∈ Rdπ . (3)\nGlobal and Objects (G+O) First we extract some prominent objects from images in some way. Then, we obtain fc7 image feature vectors π from the original image and extracted objects using a CNN. Therefore π takes a variable length. We handle π in two ways: average and RNN encoder. In average (G+O-AVG), we first obtain intermediate image representation vector h′π by affine transformation in Eq. (3). Then, the average of h′π becomes the image representation\nvector: hπ = ∑l i h ′ πi l , where l is the length of h ′ π .\nIn RNN encoder (G+O-RNN), we first obtain h′π by affine transformation in Eq. (3). Then, we encode h′π in the same way as we encode text in Section 3.1.1 to obtain hπ .\nGlobal and Objects into source and target (G+O-TXT) Thereby, we first obtain h′π by affine transformation in Eq. (3). Then, we put sequential vector h′π into the head of the source sequence and target sequence. In this case, we set dπ to be the same dimension as demb. In fact, the source sequence including h′π is only used to model qϕ(z|x,y,π). Context vector c (Eq. (15)) and pθ(z|x) are computed by a source sequence that does not include h′π . We encode the source sequence including h′π as Section 3.1.1 to obtain hf and hg . In this case, hπ is not obtained. Image information is contained in hf and hg .\nAll representation vectors hf , hg and hπ are concatenated to obtain a semantic representation vector as he = [hf ;hg;hπ], where he ∈ Rde=2×dh+dπ (in G+O-TXT: he = [hf ;hg], where he ∈ Rde=2×dh ).

Compound-word splitting is conducted only to German sentences using Sennrich et al. (2016)3. Then we tokenize sentences2 and use them as training data. We produce vocabulary dictionaries from training data. The vocabulary becomes 10,211 words for English and 13,180 words for German after compound-word splitting.\nImage features are extracted using VGG-19 CNN (Simonyan & Zisserman, 2014). We use 4096- dimensional fc7 features. To extract the object’s region, we use Fast R-CNN (Girshick, 2015).

      "text" : "Table 1 shows that G scores the best in proposed models. In G, we simply put the feature of the original image. Actually, proposed model does not benefit from R-CNN, presumably because we can not handle sequences of image features very well. For example, G+O-AVG uses the average of multiple image features, but it only makes the original image information unnecessarily confusing.\nFigure 4 shows that G and G+O-AVG outperforms VNMT almost every time, but all model scores increase suddenly in the 17,000 iteration validation. We have no explanation for this behavior. Figure 4 also shows that G and G+O-AVG scores fluctuate more moderately than others. We state that G and G+O-AVG gain stability by adding image information. When one observes the difference between the test score and the validation score for each model, baseline scores decrease more than proposed model scores. Especially, the G score increases in the test, simply because proposed models produce a better METEOR score on average, as shown in Figure 4.\nFigure 5 shows that G and G+O-AVG make more improvements on baselines in short sentences than in long sentences, presumably because qϕ(z|x,y,π) can model z well when a sentence is short. Image features always have the same dimension, but underlying semantics of the image and text differ. We infer that when the sentence is short, image feature representation can afford to approximate the underlying semantic, but when a sentence is long, image feature representation can not approximate the underlying semantic.\nMulti30k easily becomes overfitted, as shown in Figure 8 and 9 in the appendix. This is presumably because 1) Multi30k is the descriptions of image, making the sentences short and simple, and 2) Multi30k has 29,000 sentences, which could be insufficient. In the appendix, we show how the parameter setting affects the score. One can see that decay-c has a strong effect. Huang et al. (2016) states that their proposed model outperforms the baseline (NMT), but we do not have that observation. It can be assumed that their baseline parameters are not well tuned."

These comments are summarized into two general remarks. One is that G translates the meaning of the source material more accurately than VNMT. The other is that our model has more grammatical errors as prepositions’ mistakes or missing verbs compared to VNMT. We assume these two remarks are reasonable because G is trained with images which mainly have a representation of noun rather than verb, therefore can capture the meaning of materials in sentence.\nFigure 6 presents the translation results and the corresponding image which G translates more accurately than VNMT in METEOR. Figure 7 presents the translation results and the corresponding image which G translates less accurately than VNMT in METEOR. Again, we note that our model does not use image during translating. In Figure 6, G translates ”a white and black dog” correctly while VNMT translates it incorrectly implying ”a white dog and a black dog”. We assume that G correctly translates the source because G captures the meaning of material in the source. In Figure 7, G incorrectly translates the source. Its translation result is missing the preposition meaning ”at”, which is hardly represented in image.We present more translation examples in appendix."

Before training, punctuation normalization and lowercase are applied to both English and German sentences by Moses (Koehn et al., 2007) scripts2.

    "abstractText" : "Although attention-based Neural Machine Translation have achieved great success, attention-mechanism cannot capture the entire meaning of the source sentence because the attention mechanism generates a target word depending heavily on the relevant parts of the source sentence. The report of earlier studies has introduced a latent variable to capture the entire meaning of sentence and achieved improvement on attention-based Neural Machine Translation. We follow this approach and we believe that the capturing meaning of sentence benefits from image information because human beings understand the meaning of language not only from textual information but also from perceptual information such as that gained from vision. As described herein, we propose a neural machine translation model that introduces a continuous latent variable containing an underlying semantic extracted from texts and images. Our model, which can be trained endto-end, requires image information only when training. Experiments conducted with an English–German translation task show that our model outperforms over the baseline.",
