      "text" : "We investigate deep generative models that can exchange multiple modalities bidirectionally, e.g., generating images from corresponding texts and vice versa. Recently, some studies handle multiple modalities on deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, these models typically assume that modalities are forced to have a conditioned relation, i.e., we can only generate modalities in one direction. To achieve our objective, we should extract a joint representation that captures high-level concepts among all modalities and through which we can exchange them bi-directionally. As described herein, we propose a joint multimodal variational autoencoder (JMVAE), in which all modalities are independently conditioned on joint representation. In other words, it models a joint distribution of modalities. Furthermore, to be able to generate missing modalities from the remaining modalities properly, we develop an additional method, JMVAE-kl, that is trained by reducing the divergence between JMVAE’s encoder and prepared networks of respective modalities. Our experiments show that our proposedmethod can obtain appropriate joint representation frommultiple modalities and that it can generate and reconstruct themmore properly than conventional VAEs. We further demonstrate that JMVAE can generate multiple modalities bidirectionally."

      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "In our world, information is represented through various modalities. While images are represented by pixel information, these can also be described with text or tag information. People often exchange such information bi-directionally. For instance, we can not only imagine what “a young female with a smile who does not wear glasses” looks like, but also add this caption to a corresponding photograph. To do so, it is important to extract a joint representation that captures high-level concepts among all modalities. Then we can bi-directionally generate modalities through the joint representations. However, each modality typically has a different kind of dimension and structure, e.g., images (real-valued and dense) and texts (discrete and sparse). Therefore, the relations between each modality and the joint representations might become high nonlinearity. To discover such relations, deep neural network architectures have been used widely for multimodal learning (Ngiam et al., 2011; Srivastava & Salakhutdinov, 2012). The common approach with these models to learn joint representations is to share the top of hidden layers in modality specific networks. Among them, generative approaches using deep Boltzmannmachines (DBMs) (Srivastava & Salakhutdinov, 2012; Sohn et al., 2014) offer the important advantage that these can generate modalities bi-directionally.\nRecently, variational autoencoders (VAEs) (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014) have been proposed to estimate flexible deep generative models by variational inference methods. These models use back-propagation during training, so that it can be trained on large-scale and highdimensional dataset compared with DBMs with MCMC training. Some studies have addressed to handle such large-scale and high-dimensionalmodalities on VAEs, but they are forced to model conditional distribution (Kingma et al., 2014; Sohn et al., 2015; Pandey & Dukkipati, 2016). Therefore, it can only generate modalities in one direction. For example, we cannot obtain generated images from texts if we train the likelihood of texts given images. To generate modalities bi-directionally,\nall modalities should be treated equally under the learned joint representations, which is the same as previous multimodal learning models before VAEs.\nAs described in this paper, we develop a novel multimodal learning model with VAEs, which we call a joint multimodal variational autoencoder (JMVAE). The most significant feature of our model is that all modalities, x and w (e.g., images and texts), are conditioned independently on a latent variable z corresponding to joint representation, i.e., the JMVAE models a joint distribution of all modalities, p(x,w). Therefore, we can extract a high-level representation that contains all information of modalities. Moreover, since it models a joint distribution, we can draw samples from both p(x|w) and p(w|x). Because, at this time, modalities that we want to generate are usually missing, the inferred latent variable becomes incomplete and generated samples might be collapsed in the testing time when missing modalities are high-dimensional and complicated. To prevent this issue, we propose a method of preparing the new encoders for each modality, p(z|x) and p(z|w), and reducing the divergence between the multimodal encoder p(z|x,w), which we call JMVAE-kl. This contributes to more effective bi-directional generation of modalities, e.g., from face images to texts (attributes) and vice versa (see Figure 1).\nThe main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n• We introduce a joint multimodal variational autoencoder (JMVAE), which is the first study to train joint distribution of modalities with VAEs.\n• We propose an additional method (JMVAE-kl), which prevents generated samples from being collapsed when some modalities are missing. We experimentally confirm that this method solves this issue.\n• We show qualitatively and quantitatively that JMVAE can extract appropriate joint distribution and that it can generate and reconstruct modalities similarly or more properly than conventional VAEs.\n• We demonstrate that the JMVAE can generate multiple modalities bi-directionally even if these modalities have completely different kinds of dimensions and structures, e.g., highdimentional color face images and low-dimentional binary attributes."

      "text" : "The common approach of multimodal learning with deep neural networks is to share the top of hidden layers in modality specific networks. Ngiam et al. (2011) proposed this approach with deep autoencoders (AEs) and found that it can extract better representations than single modality settings. Srivastava & Salakhutdinov (2012) also took this idea but used deep Boltzmann machines (DBMs) (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009). DBMs are generative models with undirected connections based on maximum joint likelihood learning of all modalities. Therefore, this model can generate modalities bi-directionally. Sohn et al. (2014) improved this model to exchange multiple modalities effectively, which are based on minimizing the variation of information and JMVAE-kl in ours can be regarded as minimizing it with variational learning on parameterized distributions (see Section 3.3\nand Appendix A). However, it is computationally difficult for DBMs to train high-dimensional data such as natural images because of MCMC training.\nRecently, VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014) are used to train such highdimensional modalities. Kingma et al. (2014); Sohn et al. (2015) propose conditional VAEs (CVAEs), which maximize a conditional log-likelihood by variational methods. Many studies are based on CVAEs to train various multiple modalities such as handwriting digits and labels (Kingma et al., 2014; Sohn et al., 2015), object images and degrees of rotation (Kulkarni et al., 2015), face images and attributes (Larsen et al., 2015; Yan et al., 2015), and natural images and captions (Mansimov et al., 2015). The main features of CVAEs are that the relation between modalities is one-way and a latent variable does not contain the information of a conditioned modality1, which are unsuitable for our objective.\nPandey & Dukkipati (2016) proposed a conditional multimodal autoencoder (CMMA), which also maximizes the conditional log-likelihood. The difference between CVAEs is that a latent variable is connected directly from a conditional variable, i.e., these variables are not independent. Moreover, this model forces the latent representation from an input to be close to the joint representation from multiple inputs, which is similar to JMVAE-kl. However, the CMMA still considers that modalities are generated in fixed direction. This is the most different part from ours."

The objective of VAEs is maximization of the marginal distribution p(x) = ∫ pθ(x|z)p(z)dx. Because this distribution is intractable, we instead train the model to maximize the following lower bound of the marginal distribution LV AE(x) as\nlog p(x) ≥ −DKL(qφ(z|x)||p(z)) + Eqφ(z|x)[log pθ(x|z)] = LV AE(x), (1)\nwhere qφ(z|x) is an approximate distribution of posterior p(z|x) and φ is the model parameter of q. We designate qφ(z|x) as encoder and pθ(x|z) as decoder. Moreover, in Equation 1, the first term represents a regularization. The second one represents a negative reconstruction error.\nTo optimize the lower bound L(x) with respect to parameters θ, φ, we estimate gradients of Equation 1 using stochastic gradient variational Bayes (SGVB). If we consider qφ(z|x) as Gaussian distribution N (z;µ, diag(σ2)), where φ = {µ,σ2}, then we can reparameterize z ∼ qφ(z|x) to z = µ + σ ⊙ ǫ, where ǫ ∼ N (0, I). Therefore, we can estimate the gradients of the negative reconstruction term in Equation 1 with respect to θ and φ as ∇θ,φEqφ(z|x)[log pθ(x|z)] = EN (ǫ;0,I)[∇θ,φ log pθ(z|µ + σ ⊙ ǫ)].

      "text" : "Next, we consider i.i.d. dataset (X,W) = {(x1,w1), ..., (xN ,wN )}, where two modalities x and w have different kinds of dimensions and structures2. Our objective is to generate two modalities bi-directionally. For that reason, we assume that these are conditioned independently on the same latent concept z: joint representation. Therefore, we assume their generating processes as z ∼ p(z) and x,w ∼ p(x,w|z) = pθx(x|z)pθw (w|z), where θx and θw represent the model parameters of each independent p. Figure 2(a) shows a graphical model that represents generative processes. One can see that this models joint distribution of all modalities, p(x,w). Therefore, we designate this model as a joint multimodal variational autoencoder (JMVAE).\n1According to Louizos et al. (2015), this independence might not be satisfied strictly because the encoder in CVAEs still has the dependence.\n2In our experiment, these depend on dataset, see Section 4.2.\nConsidering an approximate posterior distribution as qφ(z|x,w), we can estimate a lower bound of the log-likelihood log p(x,w) as follows:\nLJM (x,w) = Eqφ(z|x,w)[log pθ(x,w, z)\nqφ(z|x,w) ] (2)\n= −DKL(qφ(z|x,w)||p(z))\n+Eqφ(z|x,w)[log pθx(x|z)] + Eqφ(z|x,w)[log pθw(w|z)]. (3)\nEquation 3 has two negative reconstruction terms which are correspondent to each modality. As with VAEs, we designate qφ(z|x,w) as the encoder and both pθx(x|z) and pθw(w|z) as decoders.\nWe can apply the SGVB to Equation 3 just as Equation 1, so that we can parameterize the encoder and decoder as deterministic deep neural networks and optimize them with respect to their parameters, θx, θw, and φ. Because each modality has different feature representation, we should set different networks for each decoder, pθx(x|z) and pθw(w|z). The type of distribution and corresponding network architecture depends on the representation of each modality, e.g., Gaussian when the representation of modality is continuous, and a Bernoulli when it is a binary value.\nUnlike original VAEs and CVAEs, the JMVAE models joint distribution of all modalities. In this model, modalities are conditioned independently on a joint latent variable. Therefore, we can extract better representation that includes all information of modalities. Moreover, we can estimate both marginal distribution and conditional distribution in bi-directional, so that we can not only obtain images reconstructed themselves but also draw texts from corresponding images and vice versa. Additionally, we can extend JMVAEs to handle more than two modalities such as p(x,w1,w2, ...) in the same learning framework."

      "heading" : "3.3 INFERENCE MISSING MODALITIES",
      "text" : "In the JMVAE, we can extract joint latent features by sampling from the encoder qφ(z|x,w) at testing time. Our objective is to exchange modalities bi-directionally, e.g., images to texts and vice versa. In this setting, modalities that we want to sample are missing, so that inputs of such modalities are set to zero (the left panel of Figure 2(b)). The same is true of reconstructing a modality only from itself. This is a natural way in discriminative multimodal settings to estimate samples from unimodal information (Ngiam et al., 2011). However, if missing modalities are high-dimensional and complicated such as natural images, then the inferred latent variable becomes incomplete and generated samples might collapse.\nWe propose a method to solve this issue, which we designate as JMVAE-kl. Moreover, we describe the former way as JMVAE-zero to distinguish it. Suppose that we have encoders with a single input, qφx(z|x) and qφw(z|w), where φx and φw are parameters. We would like to train them by bringing their encoders close to an encoder qφ(z|x,w) (the right panel of Figure 2(b)). Therefore, the object function of JMVAE-kl becomes\nLJMkl(α)(x,w) = LJM (x,w) − α · [DKL(qφ(z|x,w)||qφx (z|x)) +DKL(qφ(z|x,w)||qφw (z|w))], (4)\nwhere α is a factor that regulates the KL divergence terms.\nFrom another viewpoint, maximizing Equation 4 can be regarded as minimizing the variation of information with variational learning on parameterized distributions (proven and derived in Appendix A). The variation of information, a measure of the distance between two variables, is written as\n−EpD(x,w)[log p(x|w) + log p(w|x)], where pD is the data distribution. It is apparent that the variation of information is the sum of two negative conditional log-likelihoods. Therefore, minimizing the variation of information contributes to appropriate bi-directional exchange of modalities. Sohn et al. (2014) also train their model to minimize the VI for the same objective as ours. However, they use DBMs with MCMC training."

Moreover, we prepared two networks each with three dense layers of 512 units and set p(x|z) as Bernoulli and p(w|z) as categorical distribution whose output layer is softmax. We used warm-up (Bowman et al., 2015; Sønderby et al., 2016), which first forces training only of the term of the negative reconstruction error and then gradually increases the effect of the regularization term to prevent local minima during early training. We increased this term linearly during the first Nt epochs as with Sønderby et al. (2016). We set Nt = 200 and trained for 500 epochs on MNIST. Moreover, same as Burda et al. (2015); Sønderby et al. (2016), we resampled the binarized training values randomly from MNIST for each epoch to prevent over-fitting.\nFor CelebA, we considered face images as x ∈ R32×32×3 and corresponding attributes as w ∈ {−1, 1}40. We prepared two networks with layers (four convolutional and a flattened layers for x and two dense layers forw) with ReLU and shared the top of each layers and mapped them into 128 units. For the decoder, we prepared two networks, with a dense and four deconvolutional layers for x and three dense layers for w, and set Gaussian distribution for decoder of both modalities, where the variance of Gaussian was fixed to 1 for the decoder of w. In CelebA settings, we combined JMVAE with generative adversarial networks (GANs) (Goodfellow et al., 2014) to generate clearer images. We considered the network of p(x|z) as generator in GAN, then we optimized the GAN loss with the lower bound of the JMVAE, which is the same way as a VAE-GAN model (Larsen et al., 2015). As presented herein, we describe this model as JMVAE-GAN. We set Nt = 20 and trained for 100 epochs on CelebA.\nWe used the Adam optimization algorithm (Kingma & Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of 10−3 on MNIST and 10−4 on CelebA.

Therefore, higher is better. From this performance, we can find that not only whether the JMVAE can generate samples properly but also whether it can obtain joint representation properly. If the log-likelihood of a modality is low, representation for this modality might be hurt by other modalities. By contrast, if it is the same or higher than model trained on a single modality, then other modalities contribute to obtaining appropriate representation.\nWe estimate the test marginal log-likelihood and test conditional log-likelihood on JMVAE. We compare the test marginal log-likelihood against VAEs (Kingma & Welling, 2013; Rezende et al., 2014) and the test conditional log-likelihood against CVAEs (Kingma et al., 2014; Sohn et al., 2015) and CMMAs (Pandey & Dukkipati, 2016). On CelebA, we combine all competitive models with GAN and describe them as VAE-GAN, CVAE-GAN, and CMMA-GAN. For fairness, architectures and parameters of these competitive models were set to be as close as possible to those of JMVAE.\nWe calculate the importance weighted estimator (Burda et al., 2015) from lower bounds at testing time because we would like to estimate the true test log-likelihood from lower bounds. To estimate the test marginal log-likelihood p(w) of the JMVAE, we use two possible lower bounds: sampling from qφ(z|x,w) or qφx(z|x). We describe the former lower bound as the multiple lower bound and the latter one as the single lower bound. When we estimate the test conditional loglikelihood log p(x|w), we also use two lower bounds, each of which is estimated by sampling from qφ(z|x,w) (multiple) or qφw(z|w) (single) (see Appendix B for more details). To estimate the single lower bound, we should approximate the single encoder (qφx(z|x) or qφw(z|w)) by JMVAE-zero or JMVAE-kl. When the value of log-likelihood with the single lower bound is the same or larger than that with the multiple lower bound, the approximation of the single encoder is good. Note that original VAEs use a single lower bound and that CVAEs and CMMAs use a multiple lower bound."

We trained the model with both JMVAE-zero and JMVAE-kl and confirmed these differences. As described in Section 4.3.1, we have two possible ways of estimating the marginal log-likelihood of the JMVAE, i.e., multiple and single lower bounds. The left of Table 1 shows the test marginal log-likelihoods of the VAE and JMVAE. It is apparent that log-likelihood of the JMVAE-zero is the same or slightly better than that of the VAE. In the case of the loglikelihood of JMVAE-kl, the log-likelihood becomes better as α is small. Especially, JMVAE-kl with α = 0.01 and single lower bound archives the highest log-likelihood in Table 1. If α is 1, however, then the test log-likelihood on JMVAE-kl becomes much lower. This is because the influence of the regularization term becomes strong as α is large.\nNext, we evaluated the test conditional log-likelihood and compared it with that of the CVAE and CMMA conditioned on w. As in the case of the marginal log-likelihood, we can estimate the JMVAE’s conditional log-likelihood by both the single and multiple lower bound. The single bound can be estimated using JMVAE-zero or JMVAE-kl. The right of Table 1 shows the test conditional log-likelihoods of the JMVAE, CVAE, and CMMA. It is apparent that the CVAE achieves the highest log-likelihood. Even so, in the case of multiple bound, log-likelihoods with both JMVAE-zero and JMVAE-kl (except α = 1) outperform that of the CMMA.\nIt should be noted that the log-likelihood with JMVAE-zero and single bound is significantly low. As described in Section 3.3, this is because a modality w is missing as input. By contrast, it is apparent that the log-likelihood with JMVAE-kl is improved significantly from that with JMVAEzero. It shows that JMVAE-kl solves the issue of missing modalities (we can also find this result in generated images, see Appendix E). Moreover, we find that this log-likelihood becomes better as α is large, which is opposite to the other results. Therefore, there is a trade-off between whether each modality can be reconstructed properly and whether multiple modalities can be exchanged properly and it can be regulated by α."

For example, we obtain an importance weighted bound on log p(x) from Equation 11 as follows:\nlog p(x) ≥ Ez1,...,zk∼qφx (z|x)[log 1\nk\nk∑\ni=1\npθx(x|z)p(z)\nqφx(z|x) ] = Lksingle(x). (11)\nStrictly speaking, these two lower bounds are not equal. However, if the number of importance samples is extremely large, the difference of these two lower bounds converges to 0.\nProof. Let the multiple and single k-hold importanceweighted lower bounds asLksingle andL k single. From the theorem of the importance weighted bound, both Lksingle and L k multiple converge to log p(x) as k → ∞.\nTherefore,\nlimk→∞|L k multiple − L k single| ≤ |limk→∞L k multiple − limk→∞L k single| = 0"

    "abstractText" : "We investigate deep generative models that can exchange multiple modalities bidirectionally, e.g., generating images from corresponding texts and vice versa. Recently, some studies handle multiple modalities on deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs). However, these models typically assume that modalities are forced to have a conditioned relation, i.e., we can only generate modalities in one direction. To achieve our objective, we should extract a joint representation that captures high-level concepts among all modalities and through which we can exchange them bi-directionally. As described herein, we propose a joint multimodal variational autoencoder (JMVAE), in which all modalities are independently conditioned on joint representation. In other words, it models a joint distribution of modalities. Furthermore, to be able to generate missing modalities from the remaining modalities properly, we develop an additional method, JMVAE-kl, that is trained by reducing the divergence between JMVAE’s encoder and prepared networks of respective modalities. Our experiments show that our proposedmethod can obtain appropriate joint representation frommultiple modalities and that it can generate and reconstruct themmore properly than conventional VAEs. We further demonstrate that JMVAE can generate multiple modalities bidirectionally.",
