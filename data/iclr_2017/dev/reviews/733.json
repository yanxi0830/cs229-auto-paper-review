{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "LSTM-Based System-Call Language Modeling and Ensemble Method for Host-Based Intrusion Detection", "abstract": "In computer security, designing a robust intrusion detection system is one of the most fundamental and important problems. In this paper, we propose a system-call language-modeling approach for designing anomaly-based host intrusion detection systems. To remedy the issue of high false-alarm rates commonly arising in conventional methods, we employ a novel ensemble method that blends multiple thresholding classifiers into a single one, making it possible to accumulate `highly normal' sequences. The proposed system-call language model has various advantages leveraged by the fact that it can learn the semantic meaning and interactions of each system call that existing methods cannot effectively consider. Through diverse experiments on public benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, we show that our model possesses high portability, which is one of the key aspects of realizing successful intrusion detection systems.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "In this paper a novel approach for anomaly detection is considered for the task of intrusion detection based on system call sequence.\nThe system call sequence is regarded as a language, and multiple lstm-rnn language models are trained and ensembled. \nDiversity in the ensemble is achieved by choosing different hyper parameters for each lstm-LM.\nThe combination of the LMs is done by averaging transformations of the likelihoods. \n\nI really like the fact that no attack data is used during training, and I like the LM and ensemble approach. \nThe only high level drawbacks I have are the following, which might have a simple answer as I'm not an expert in this field:\n\n- Relaying of system calls seems weak: If the attacker has access to some \"normal\" sequences of system calls, all she can fool the system by interleaving its malicious system calls with normal ones, in a way that will artificially raise the likelihood of the sequence. \n- A few lines covering other anomaly detection tasks, where RNNs are used, can be added to the introduction, to give a better idea about the novelty of the approach."}, {"DATE": "06 Feb 2017", "TITLE": "ICLR committee final decision", "IS_META_REVIEW": false, "comments": "This is a pure application paper: an application of LSTMs to host intrusion detection systems based upon observed system calls.
