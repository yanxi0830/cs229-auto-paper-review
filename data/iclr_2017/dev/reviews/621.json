{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Counterpoint by Convolution", "abstract": "Machine learning models of music typically break down the task of composition into a chronological process, composing a piece of music in a single pass from beginning to end. On the contrary, human composers write music in a nonlinear fashion, scribbling motifs here and there, often revisiting choices previously made. We explore the use of blocked Gibbs sampling as an analogue to the human approach, and introduce Coconet, a convolutional neural network in the NADE family of generative models. Despite ostensibly sampling from the same distribution as the NADE ancestral sampling procedure, we find that a blocked Gibbs approach significantly improves sample quality. We provide evidence that this is due to some conditional distributions being poorly modeled. Moreover, we show that even the cheap approximate blocked Gibbs procedure from Yao et al. (2014) yields better samples than ancestral sampling. We demonstrate the versatility of our method on unconditioned polyphonic music generation.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "This paper proposed COCONET, which is a neural autoregressive model with convolution, to do music composition task.

We have looked into the datasets used in prior works, but found that their preprocessing severely degraded the musical structure.

The pieces become unrecognizable, and (worse) non-musical.  Downsampling or blurring does not work in symbolic music like it does in images: music is more similar to language, and using a coarse grid is analogous to removing words from a sentence and asking a model to learn this new distribution of broken sentences.

They use an orderless NADE model for the task of \"fill in the notes\". Given a roll of T timesteps of pitches, they randomly mask out some pitches, and the model is trained to predict the missing notes. This follows how the orderless NADE model can be trained. During sampling, one normally follows an ancestral sampling procedure. For this, an ordering is defined over outputs, and one runs the model on the current input, samples one of the outputs according to the order, adds this output to the next input, and continues this procedure until all outputs have been sampled. The key point of the paper is that this is a bad sampling strategy. Instead, they suggest the strategy of Yao et al. 2014, which uses a blocked Gibbs sampling approach. The blocked Gibbs strategy instead masks N inputs randomly and independently, samples them, and repeats this procedure. The point of this strategy is the make sure the sampling chain mixes well, which will happen for large N. However, since the samples are independent, having a large N gives incoherent samples.
