{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Annealing Gaussian into ReLU: a New Sampling Strategy for Leaky-ReLU RBM", "abstract": "Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a bipartite graphical model that is used as the building block in energy-based deep generative models. Due to numerical stability and quantifiability of the likelihood,  RBM is commonly used with Bernoulli units. Here, we consider an alternative member of exponential family RBM with leaky rectified linear units -- called leaky RBM.  We first study the joint and marginal distributions of leaky RBM under different leakiness, which provides us important insights by connecting the leaky RBM model and truncated Gaussian distributions.  The connection leads us to a simple yet efficient method for sampling from this model, where the basic idea is to anneal the leakiness rather than the energy; -- i.e., start from a fully Gaussian/Linear unit and gradually decrease the leakiness over iterations.  This serves as an alternative to the annealing of the temperature parameter and enables numerical estimation of the likelihood that are more efficient and more accurate than the commonly used annealed importance sampling (AIS).  We further demonstrate that the proposed sampling algorithm enjoys faster mixing property than contrastive divergence algorithm, which benefits the training without any additional computational cost.", "histories": [], "reviews": [{"IS_META_REVIEW": true, "comments": "The authors proposed to use leaky rectified linear units replacing binary units in Gaussian RBM.

Analogous to ReLU units in feed-forward networks, these leaky relu RBMs split the input space into a combinatorial number of regions, where each region defines p(v) as a truncated Gaussian. A further contribution of the paper is in proposing a novel sampling scheme for the leaky RBM: one can run a much shorter Markov chain by initializing it from a sample of the leaky RBM with c=1 (which yields a standard multi-variate normal over the visibles) and then slowly annealing c. In low-dimension a similar scheme is shown to outperform AIS for estimating the partition function. Experiments are performed on both CIFAR-10 and SVHN.\n\nThis is an interesting paper which I believe would be of interest to the ICLR community. The theoretical contributions are strong: the authors not only introduce a proper energy formulation of ReLU RBMs, but also a novel sampling mechanism and an improvement on AIS for estimating their partition function. \n\nUnfortunately, the experimental results are somewhat limited. The PCD baseline is notably absent. Including (bernoulli visible, leaky-relu hidden) would have allowed the authors to evaluate likelihoods on standard binary RBM datasets. As it stands, performance on CIFAR-10 and SVHN, while improved with leaky-relu, is a far cry from more recent generative models (VAE-based, or auto-regressive models). While this comparison may be unfair, it will certainly limit the wider appeal of the paper to the community. Furthermore, there is the issue of the costly projection method which is required to guarantee that the energy-function remain bounded (covariance matrix over each region be PSD).
