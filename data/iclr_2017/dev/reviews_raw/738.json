{"conference": "ICLR 2017 conference submission", "title": "Training Long Short-Term Memory With Sparsified Stochastic Gradient Descent", "abstract": "Prior work has demonstrated that exploiting the sparsity can dramatically improve the energy efficiency and shrink the memory footprint of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, these sparsity-centric optimization techniques might be less effective for Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), especially for the training phase, because of the significant structural difference between the neurons. To investigate if there is possible sparsity-centric optimization for training LSTM-based RNNs, we studied several applications and observed that there is potential sparsity in the gradients generated in the backward propagation. In this paper, we illustrate why the sparsity exists and propose a simple yet effective thresholding technique to induce further more sparsity during training an LSTM-based RNN training. Experiment results show that the proposed technique can increase the sparsity of linear gate gradients to higher than 80\\% without loss of performance, which makes more than 50\\% multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations redundant in an entire LSTM training process. These redudant MAC operations can be eliminated by hardware techniques to improve the energy efficiency and training speed of LSTM-based RNNs.", "reviews": [{"is_meta_review": true, "comments": "CONTRIBUTIONS\nWhen training LSTMs, many of the intermediate gradients are close to zero due to the flat shape of the tanh and sigmoid nonlinearities far from the origin.

This observation is novel (although not too surprising) to my knowledge, but I must state that I am not very familiar with research on fast RNN implmentations.\n\nMinor note:\nThe LSTM language model does not use a 'word2vec' layer. It is simply a linear embedding layer. Word2vec is the name of a specific model which is not directly to character level language models.\n\nThe paper presents the central observation clearly. However, it will be much more convincing if a well known dataset and experiment set up are used, such as Graves (2013) or Sutskever et al (2014), and actual training, validation and test performances are reported.\n\nWhile the main observation is certainly interesting, I think it is not sufficient to be the subject of a full conference paper without implementation (or simulation) and benchmarking of the promised speedups on multiple tasks.
