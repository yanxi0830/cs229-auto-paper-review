Here we show that the regret can be significantly reduced even without curvature, in cases where there is a stable optimum to converge to. More precisely, the regret of existing methods is determined by the norms of the encountered gradients, and matching worst-case performance lower bounds tell us that this cannot be improved uniformly. Yet we argue that this is a rather pessimistic assessment of the complexity of the problem. We introduce a new parameter-free algorithm, called MetaGrad, for which the gradient norms in the regret are scaled down by the distance to the (unknown) optimum. So when the optimum is reasonably stable over time, making the algorithm converge, this new scaling leads to orders of magnitude smaller regret even when the gradients themselves do not vanish.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 29 Apr 2016 09:05:46 GMT  (43kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08740v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 23 Jun 2016 22:25:38 GMT  (36kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08740v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 1 Nov 2016 17:57:06 GMT  (37kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08740v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["tim van erven", "wouter m koolen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1604.08740"}
