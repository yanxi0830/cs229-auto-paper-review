We demonstrate its feasibility through a case study and empirical analysis. To fully make such technique useful in practice, we also point out several cross-disciplinary challenges, including modeling user intention, providing datasets, improving model architectures, etc. Although much long-term research shall be addressed in this new field, we believe end-to-end program generation would become a reality in future decades, and we are looking forward to its practice.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 25 Oct 2015 06:52:45 GMT  (217kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07211v1", "Submitted to 2016 International Conference of Software Engineering \"Vision of 2025 and Beyond\" track"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to 2016 International Conference of Software Engineering \"Vision of 2025 and Beyond\" track", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.LG", "authors": ["lili mou", "rui men", "ge li", "lu zhang", "zhi jin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.07211"}
