We show that this output structure is equivalent to a finite quasi-ultrametric space and study admissibility with respect to two desirable properties. We prove that a modified version of single linkage is the only admissible quasi-clustering method. Moreover, we show stability of the proposed method and we establish invariance properties fulfilled by it. Algorithms are further developed and the value of quasi-clustering analysis is illustrated with a study of internal migration within United States.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 Apr 2014 21:16:13 GMT  (168kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.4655v1", "Accepted to the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), Beijing, China, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), Beijing, China, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["gunnar e carlsson", "facundo m\u00e9moli", "alejandro ribeiro", "santiago segarra"], "accepted": true, "id": "1404.4655"}
