{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Aug-2017", "title": "On Relaxing Determinism in Arithmetic Circuits", "abstract": "The past decade has seen a significant interest in learning tractable probabilistic representations. Arithmetic circuits (ACs) were among the first proposed tractable representations, with some subsequent representations being instances of ACs with weaker or stronger properties. In this paper, we provide a formal basis under which variants on ACs can be compared, and where the precise roles and semantics of their various properties can be made more transparent. This allows us to place some recent developments on ACs in a clearer perspective and to also derive new results for ACs. This includes an exponential separation between ACs with and without determinism; completeness and incompleteness results; and tractability results (or lack thereof) when computing most probable explanations (MPEs).", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Aug 2017 23:02:11 GMT  (254kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06846v1", "In Proceedings of the Thirty-fourth International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings of the Thirty-fourth International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["arthur choi", "adnan darwiche"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.06846"}
