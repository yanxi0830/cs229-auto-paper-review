STOC 2015], [Hardt and Ullman FOCS 2014], [Steinke and Ullman COLT 2015], [Bassily et al. STOC 2016] demonstrates how differential privacy [Dwork et al. TCC 2006] can be used as a mathematical tool for guaranteeing generalization in adaptive data analysis. Specifically, if a differentially private analysis is applied on a sample S of i.i.d. examples to select a low-sensitivity function f, then w.h.p. f(S) is close to its expectation, although f is being chosen based on the data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 16:53:32 GMT  (23kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01970v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["kobbi nissim", "uri stemmer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.01970"}
