However, the complex nature of multimedia data makes it difficult to develop DL-based software. The state-of-the art tools, such as Caffe, TensorFlow, Torch7, and CNTK, while are successful in their applicable domains, are programming libraries with fixed user interface, internal representation, and execution environment. This makes it difficult to implement portable and customized DL applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Jan 2017 18:02:13 GMT  (80kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02284v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.LG", "authors": ["tian zhao", "xiaobing huang", "yu cao"], "accepted": true, "id": "1701.02284"}
