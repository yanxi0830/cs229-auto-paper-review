In this paper we present a novel methodology for rapid source estimation during radiological releases based on deep feature extraction and weather clustering. Atmospheric dispersions are then calculated based on identified predominant weather patterns and are matched against simulated incidents indicated by radiation readings on the ground. We evaluate the accuracy of our methods over multiple years of weather reanalysis data in the European region. We juxtapose these results with deep classification convolution networks and discuss advantages and disadvantages.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 09:55:31 GMT  (1284kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05840v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["i a klampanos", "a davvetas", "s", "ronopoulos", "c pappas", "a ikonomopoulos", "v karkaletsis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.05840"}
