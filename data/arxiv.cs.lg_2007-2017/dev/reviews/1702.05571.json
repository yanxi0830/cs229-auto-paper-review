That is, given a data matrix $M^*$, where $(1-\\alpha)$ fraction of the points are noisy samples from a low-dimensional subspace while $\\alpha$ fraction of the points can be arbitrary outliers, the goal is to recover the subspace accurately. Existing results for \\OR-PCA have serious drawbacks: while some results are quite weak in the presence of noise, other results have runtime quadratic in dimension, rendering them impractical for large scale applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 Feb 2017 05:00:04 GMT  (106kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05571v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yeshwanth cherapanamjeri", "prateek jain", "praneeth netrapalli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.05571"}
