{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "5-Apr-2015", "title": "Discriminative Neural Sentence Modeling by Tree-Based Convolution", "abstract": "This paper proposes a new convolutional neural architecture based on tree-structures, called the tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN). Two variants take advantage of constituency trees and dependency trees, respectively, to model sentences. Compared with traditional \"flat\" convolutional neural networks (CNNs), TBCNNs explore explicitly the structural information of sentences; compared with recursive neural networks, TBCNNs have much shorter propagation paths, enabling more effective feature learning and extraction. In the experiment of sentiment analysis, our two models consistently outperform CNNs and RNNs in a controlled setting. Our models are also competitive to most state-of-the-art results, including RNNs based on long short term memory and deep CNNs/RNNs.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 5 Apr 2015 10:18:32 GMT  (289kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01106v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 7 Apr 2015 07:30:08 GMT  (289kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01106v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 23 Apr 2015 17:16:32 GMT  (289kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01106v3", null], ["v4", "Mon, 1 Jun 2015 12:23:16 GMT  (409kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01106v4", null], ["v5", "Tue, 2 Jun 2015 05:56:06 GMT  (409kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01106v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["lili mou", "hao peng", "ge li", "yan xu", "lu zhang 0023", "zhi jin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1504.01106"}
