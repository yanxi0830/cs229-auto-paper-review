{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "23-Sep-2015", "title": "On The Direct Maximization of Quadratic Weighted Kappa", "abstract": "In recent years, quadratic weighted kappa has been growing in popularity in the machine learning community as an evaluation metric in domains where the target labels to be predicted are drawn from integer ratings, usually obtained from human experts. For example, it was the metric of choice in several recent, high profile machine learning contests hosted on Kaggle : www.kaggle.com/c/asap-aes , www.kaggle.com/c/asap-sas , www.kaggle.com/c/diabeticretinopathy- detection . Yet, little is understood about the nature of this metric, its underlying mathematical properties, where it fits among other common evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and correlation, or if it can be optimized analytically, and if so, how. Much of this is due to the cumbersome way that this metric is commonly defined. In this paper we first derive an equivalent but much simpler, and more useful, definition for quadratic weighted kappa, and then employ this alternate form to address the above issues.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Sep 2015 19:39:39 GMT  (209kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07107v1", "preliminary draft"], ["v2", "Tue, 29 Sep 2015 21:30:43 GMT  (199kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07107v2", "preliminary draft"], ["v3", "Sun, 6 Dec 2015 15:16:19 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07107v3", "realized some inaccuracies, and some sloppy reasoning.
