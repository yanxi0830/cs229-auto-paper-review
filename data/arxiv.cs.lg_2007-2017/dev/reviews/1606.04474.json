In spite of this, optimization algorithms are still designed by hand. In this paper we show how the design of an optimization algorithm can be cast as a learning problem, allowing the algorithm to learn to exploit structure in the problems of interest in an automatic way. Our learned algorithms, implemented by LSTMs, outperform generic, hand-designed competitors on the tasks for which they are trained, and also generalize well to new tasks with similar structure. We demonstrate this on a number of tasks, including simple convex problems, training neural networks, and styling images with neural art.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 17:49:32 GMT  (3040kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04474v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 16:45:45 GMT  (3270kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04474v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["marcin andrychowicz", "misha denil", "sergio gomez colmenarejo", "matthew w hoffman", "david pfau", "tom schaul", "nando de freitas"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.04474"}
