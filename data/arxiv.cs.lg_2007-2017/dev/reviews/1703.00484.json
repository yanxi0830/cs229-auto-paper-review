Selfish clients submit jobs, each with an arrival time, deadline, length, and value. The service provider's goal is to implement a truthful online mechanism for scheduling jobs so as to maximize the social welfare of the schedule. Recent work shows that under a stochastic assumption on job arrivals, there is a single-parameter family of mechanisms that achieves near-optimal social welfare. We show that given any such family of near-optimal online mechanisms, there exists an online mechanism that in the worst case performs nearly as well as the best of the given mechanisms. Our mechanism is truthful whenever the mechanisms in the given family are truthful and prompt, and achieves optimal (within constant factors) regret.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 20:09:43 GMT  (135kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00484v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.AI cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["shuchi chawla", "nikhil devanur", "janardhan kulkarni", "rad niazadeh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.00484"}
