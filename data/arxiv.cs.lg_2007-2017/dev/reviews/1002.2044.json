This paper concerns a phase transition in the training stability of ERM, conjectured by the same authors. Kutin and Niyogi proved that ERM on finite hypothesis spaces containing a unique risk minimizer has training stability that scales exponentially with sample size, and conjectured that the existence of multiple risk minimizers prevents even super-quadratic convergence. We prove this result for the strictly weaker notion of CV-stability, positively resolving the conjecture.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Feb 2010 09:08:56 GMT  (102kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2044v1", "4 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["benjamin i p rubinstein", "aleksandr simma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1002.2044"}
