Bayesian optimization is sample efficient by building a posterior distribution to capture the evidence and prior knowledge for the target function. Built in standard C++, the library is extremely efficient while being portable and flexible. It includes a common interface for C, C++, Python, Matlab and Octave.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 May 2014 00:37:28 GMT  (11kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7430v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ruben martinez-cantin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.7430"}
