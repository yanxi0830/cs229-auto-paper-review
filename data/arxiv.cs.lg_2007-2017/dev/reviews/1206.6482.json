However, many latent feature models ignore that objects can appear at different locations or require pre-segmentation of images. While the transformed Indian buffet process (tIBP) provides a method for modeling transformation-invariant features in unsegmented binary images, its current form is inappropriate for real images because of its computational cost and modeling assumptions. We combine the tIBP with likelihoods appropriate for real images and develop an efficient inference, using the cross-correlation between images and features, that is theoretically and empirically faster than existing inference techniques. Our method discovers reasonable components and achieve effective image reconstruction in natural images.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (612kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6482v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["ke zhai 0001", "yuening hu", "jordan l boyd-graber", "sinead williamson"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6482"}
