FR under surveillance scenario does not give satisfactory performance due to low contrast, noise and poor illumination conditions on probes, as compared to the training samples. A state-of-the-art technology, Deep Learning, even fails to perform well in these scenarios. We propose a novel soft-margin based learning method for multiple feature-kernel combinations, followed by feature transformed using Domain Adaptation, which outperforms many recent state-of-the-art techniques, when tested using three real-world surveillance face datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 11:48:56 GMT  (2366kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01374v1", "This is an extended version of the paper accepted in CVPR Biometric Workshop, 2016. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1610.00660"], ["v2", "Thu, 27 Oct 2016 13:14:49 GMT  (2366kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01374v2", "This is an extended version of the paper accepted in CVPR Biometric Workshop, 2016. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1610.00660"]], "COMMENTS": "This is an extended version of the paper accepted in CVPR Biometric Workshop, 2016. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1610.00660", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.HC cs.LG", "authors": ["samik banerjee", "sukhendu das"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01374"}
