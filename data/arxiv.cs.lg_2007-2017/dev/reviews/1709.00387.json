For the 2017 Multi-Genre Broadcast challenge (MGB-3) there were two possible tasks: Arabic speech recognition, and Arabic Dialect Identification (ADI). In this paper, we describe our efforts to create an ADI system for the MGB-3 challenge, with the goal of distinguishing amongst four major Arabic dialects, as well as Modern Standard Arabic. Our research fo- cused on dialect variability and domain mismatches between the training and test domain. In order to achieve a robust ADI system, we explored both Siamese neural network models to learn similarity and dissimilarities among Arabic dialects, as well as i-vector post-processing to adapt domain mismatches. Both Acoustic and linguistic features were used for the final MGB-3 submissions, with the best primary system achieving 75% accuracy on the official 10hr test set.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Aug 2017 14:20:02 GMT  (168kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00387v1", "Submitted to the 2017 IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop (ASRU 2017)"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to the 2017 IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop (ASRU 2017)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.SD", "authors": ["suwon shon", "ahmed ali", "james glass"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.00387"}
