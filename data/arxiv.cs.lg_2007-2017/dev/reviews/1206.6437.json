Representing such prior knowledge in non-factorial latent tree models can boost performance of image denoising, inpainting, deconvolution or reconstruction substantially, beyond standard factorial \"sparse\" methodology. We derive a large scale approximate Bayesian inference algorithm for linear models with non-factorial (latent tree-structured) scale mixture priors. Experimental results on a range of denoising and inpainting problems demonstrate substantially improved performance compared to MAP estimation or to inference with factorial priors.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (750kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6437v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["young-jun ko", "matthias w seeger"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6437"}
