In this paper, we delineate four types of prediction errors and demonstrate that these four types characterize all prediction errors. In addition, we describe potential remedies and tools that can be used to reduce the uncertainty when trying to determine the source of a prediction error and when trying to take action to remove a prediction errors.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Nov 2016 02:33:10 GMT  (135kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05955v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["christopher meek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.05955"}
