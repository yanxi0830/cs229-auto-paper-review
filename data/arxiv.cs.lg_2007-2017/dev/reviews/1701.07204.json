The current state of the art is a $O(kn^2)$ dynamic programming algorithm that uses $O(nk)$ space. We present a new algorithm improving this to $O(kn \\log n)$ time and optimal $O(n)$ space. We generalize our algorithm to work for the absolute distance instead of squared distance and to work for any Bregman Divergence as well.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 08:44:04 GMT  (385kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07204v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 16 Feb 2017 20:40:50 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07204v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 10:37:16 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07204v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["allan gr{\\o}nlund", "kasper green larsen", "alexander mathiasen", "jesper sindahl nielsen", "stefan schneider", "mingzhou song"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.07204"}
