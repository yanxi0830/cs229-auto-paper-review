Traditionally CLU does not utilize the dialogue history beyond the previous system turn and contextual ambiguities are resolved by the downstream components. In this paper, we explore novel approaches for modeling dialogue context in a re- current neural network (RNN) based lan- guage understanding system. We propose the Hierarchical Dialogue Encoder Net- work, that allows encoding context from the dialogue history in chronological or- der. We compare the performance of our proposed architecture with two context models, one that uses just the previous turn context and another that encodes dialogue context in a memory network, but loses the order of utterances in the dialogue his- tory. Experiments with a multi-domain di- alogue dataset demonstrate that the pro- posed architecture results in reduced se- mantic frame error rates.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 May 2017 20:57:30 GMT  (70kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03455v1", "8 + 2 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 11 May 2017 00:21:13 GMT  (70kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03455v2", "8 + 2 pages, Updated 10/17: Updated typos in abstract"], ["v3", "Fri, 7 Jul 2017 21:35:02 GMT  (60kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03455v3", "8 + 2 pages, Updated 10/17: Updated typos in abstract, Updated 07/07: Updated Title, abstract and few minor changes"]], "COMMENTS": "8 + 2 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["ankur bapna", "gokhan tur", "dilek hakkani-tur", "larry heck"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03455"}
