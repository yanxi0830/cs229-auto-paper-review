We formalize this approach, which we call statistical cost sharing, and consider the computation of the core and the Shapley value, when the tuples are drawn from some distribution $\\mathcal{D}$.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Mar 2017 02:50:49 GMT  (355kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03111v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.LG", "authors": ["eric balkanski", "umar syed", "sergei vassilvitskii"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.03111"}
