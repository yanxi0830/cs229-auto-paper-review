Interactive environments, in which an agent can deliberately take actions, offer an opportunity to tackle this task better, because the agent can experiment with different actions and observe their effects. We introduce the idea that in interactive environments, latent factors that control the variation in observed data can be identified by figuring out what the agent can control. We propose a naive method to find factors that explain or measure the effect of the actions of a learner, and test it in illustrative experiments.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 15:54:18 GMT  (123kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07718v1", "RLDM submission"]], "COMMENTS": "RLDM submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["emmanuel bengio", "valentin thomas", "joelle pineau", "doina precup", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07718"}
