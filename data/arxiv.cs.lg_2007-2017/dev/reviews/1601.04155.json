Being extensively inspired by the scientific advances in the human visual perception and neuroaesthetics, we design the Brain-Inspired Deep Networks (BDN) for this task. BDN first learns attributes through the parallel supervised pathways, on a variety of selected feature dimensions. A high-level synthesis network is trained to associate and transform those attributes into the overall aesthetics rating. We then extend BDN to predicting the distribution of human ratings, since aesthetics ratings often vary somewhat from observer to observer. Another highlight is our first-of-its-kind study of label-preserving transformations in the context of aesthetics assessment, which leads to effective data augmentation approaches. Experimental results on the AVA dataset show that our biological inspired, task-specific BDN model leads to significantly improved performances, compared to other state-of-the-art models with the same or higher parameter capacity.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 16 Jan 2016 10:59:40 GMT  (2510kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04155v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 15 Mar 2016 03:46:27 GMT  (2539kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04155v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["zhangyang wang", "shiyu chang", "florin dolcos", "diane beck", "ding liu", "thomas s huang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.04155"}
