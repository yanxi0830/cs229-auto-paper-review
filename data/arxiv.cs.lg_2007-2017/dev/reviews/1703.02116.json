Regression-based analytical approaches however might fail to fully account for interactions between metabolites, rely on a priori selected input features and thus might suffer from poorer accuracy. Supervised machine learning methods can potentially be used in order to fully exploit the dimensionality and richness of the data. In this paper, we systematically implement and evaluate a set of supervised learning methods (L1 regression, random forest classifier) and compare them to traditional regression-based approaches for disease prediction using metabolomic data.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 11:53:49 GMT  (255kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02116v1", "Medical Informatics Europe (MIE2017)"]], "COMMENTS": "Medical Informatics Europe (MIE2017)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["henrietta forssen", "riyaz s patel", "natalie fitzpatrick", "aroon hingorani", "adam timmis", "harry hemingway", "spiros c denaxas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.02116"}
