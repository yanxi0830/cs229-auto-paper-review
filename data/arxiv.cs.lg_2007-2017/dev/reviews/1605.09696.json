We propose a unified solution for subspace learning methods using the Rayleigh quotient, which is extensible for multiple views, supervised learning, and non-linear embeddings. Numerous methods including Canonical Correlation Analysis, Partial Least Sqaure regression and Linear Discriminant Analysis are studied using specific intrinsic and penalty graphs within the same framework. Non-linear extensions based on kernels and (deep) neural networks are derived, achieving better performance than the linear ones. Moreover, a novel variant of multi-view Linear Discriminant Analysis is proposed by taking the view difference into consideration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-view embedding methods on visual object recognition and cross-modal image retrieval, and obtain superior results in both applications compared to related methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 May 2016 16:11:16 GMT  (8493kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09696v1", "Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing"], ["v2", "Thu, 22 Sep 2016 15:58:20 GMT  (8738kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09696v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 09:17:50 GMT  (7015kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09696v3", null]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["guanqun cao", "alexandros iosifidis", "ke chen", "moncef gabbouj"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.09696"}
