We give an inefficient algorithm that obtains regret bounded by $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ after $T$ prediction rounds. We complement this result by showing that no algorithm running in polynomial time per iteration can achieve regret bounded by $O(T^{1-\\delta})$ for any constant $\\delta &gt; 0$ unless $\\text{NP} \\subseteq \\text{BPP}$. This computational hardness result resolves an open problem presented in COLT 2014 (Kale, 2014) and also posed by Zolghadr et al. (2013). This hardness result holds even if the algorithm is allowed to access more features than the best sparse linear regressor up to a logarithmic factor in the dimension.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Mar 2016 20:49:52 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02250v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["dean foster", "satyen kale", "howard karloff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.02250"}
