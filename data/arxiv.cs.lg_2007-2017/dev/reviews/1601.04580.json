Identifying these storylines would enable many high-impact applications, such as tracking public interest and opinion in ongoing crisis events. However, this requires integrating temporal and linguistic information, and prior work takes a largely heuristic approach. We present a novel online non-parametric Bayesian framework for storyline detection, using the distance-dependent Chinese Restaurant Process (dd-CRP). To ensure efficient linear-time inference, we employ a fixed-lag Gibbs sampling procedure, which is novel for the dd-CRP. We evaluate our baseline and proposed models on the TREC Twitter Timeline Generation task and show strong results.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jan 2016 15:46:00 GMT  (23kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04580v1", "This report is based on a rejected submission from the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods on Natural Language Processing, incorporating some of the reviewers' suggestions for improvement"], ["v2", "Sat, 24 Sep 2016 20:27:47 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04580v2", "Appeared at the Workshop on Computing News Storylines at the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "This report is based on a rejected submission from the 2015 Conference on Empirical Methods on Natural Language Processing, incorporating some of the reviewers' suggestions for improvement", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["vinodh krishnan", "jacob eisenstein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.04580"}
