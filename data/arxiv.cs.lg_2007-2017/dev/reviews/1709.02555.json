In this paper we introduce the idea of causality aid in falsification: by providing a falsification solver -- that relies on stochastic optimization of a certain cost function -- with suitable causal information expressed by a Bayesian network, search for a falsifying input value can be efficient. Our experiment results show the idea's viability.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Sep 2017 06:34:21 GMT  (1096kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02555v1", "In Proceedings FVAV 2017,arXiv:1709.02126"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings FVAV 2017,arXiv:1709.02126", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.AI cs.LG cs.LO", "authors": ["takumi akazaki", "yoshihiro kumazawa", "ichiro hasuo university of tokyo", "national institute of informatics)"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.02555"}
