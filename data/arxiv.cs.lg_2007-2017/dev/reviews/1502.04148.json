The ICA model assumes that a number of independent source signals are linearly mixed to form the observed signal. Traditional ICA algorithms typically aim to recover the mixing matrix, the inverse of which can be applied to data in order to recover the latent independent signals. However, in the presence of noise, this demixing process is non-optimal for signal recovery as measured by signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), even if the mixing matrix is recovered exactly.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Feb 2015 23:18:35 GMT  (80kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04148v1", "18 pages, 3 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 1 Oct 2015 16:05:56 GMT  (54kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04148v2", "17 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["james r voss", "mikhail belkin", "luis rademacher"], "accepted": true, "id": "1502.04148"}
