Despite its simplicity, analyzing its running time and quality of approximation is surprisingly difficult and can lead to deep insights that can be used to improve the algorithm. In this paper we survey the recent results in this direction as well as several extension of the basic $k$-means method.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 Feb 2016 09:39:50 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08254v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["johannes bl\\\"omer", "christiane lammersen", "melanie schmidt", "christian sohler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.08254"}
