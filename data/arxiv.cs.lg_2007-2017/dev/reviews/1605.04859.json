Recent research shows that there is considerable redundancy in the parameter space of deep neural networks. In this paper, we propose a method to compress deep neural networks by using the Fisher Information metric, which we estimate through a stochastic optimization method that keeps track of second-order information in the network. We first remove unimportant parameters and then use non-uniform fixed point quantization to assign more bits to parameters with higher Fisher Information estimates. We evaluate our method on a classification task with a convolutional neural network trained on the MNIST data set. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing methods for both network pruning and quantization.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 May 2016 18:12:45 GMT  (1022kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04859v1", "To appear in ISVLSI 2016 special session"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in ISVLSI 2016 special session", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["ming tu", "visar berisha", "yu cao", "jae-sun seo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.04859"}
