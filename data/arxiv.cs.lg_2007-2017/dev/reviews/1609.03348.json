By reference to a node threshold three features are described 1) A mechanism for Primary Reinforcement, capable of solving linearly inseparable problems 2) The learning scheme is extended to include a mechanism for Conditioned Reinforcement, capable of forming long term strategy 3) The learning scheme is modified to use a threshold-based deep learning algorithm, providing a robust and biologically inspired alternative to backpropagation. The model may be used for supervised as well as unsupervised training regimes.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Sep 2016 11:23:20 GMT  (1348kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03348v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 17 Sep 2016 04:20:01 GMT  (1350kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03348v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 05:11:01 GMT  (1384kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03348v3", null], ["v4", "Sat, 14 Jan 2017 05:54:29 GMT  (1341kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03348v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["thomas h ward"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.03348"}
