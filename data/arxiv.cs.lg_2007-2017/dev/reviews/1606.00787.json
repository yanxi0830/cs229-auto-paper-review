In this paper, we investigate the following question: for a given model, is it possible to use any convenient prior to infer a false posterior, and afterwards, given some true prior of interest, quickly transform this result into the true posterior?", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 18:20:35 GMT  (743kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00787v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 12 Jul 2017 18:01:17 GMT  (878kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00787v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG stat.CO stat.ME", "authors": ["willie neiswanger", "eric p xing"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.00787"}
