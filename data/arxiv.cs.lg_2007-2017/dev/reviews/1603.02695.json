Each student provides a partial ranking of the courses taken throughout his or her undergraduate career. We compute pairwise rank comparisons between courses based on the order students typically take them, aggregate the results over the entire student population, and then obtain a proxy for the rank offset between pairs of courses. We extract a global ranking of the courses via several state-of-the art algorithms for ranking with pairwise noisy information, including SerialRank, Rank Centrality, and the recent SyncRank based on the group synchronization problem. We test this application of rank aggregation on 15 years of student data from the Department of Mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Furthermore, we experiment with the above approach on different subsets of the student population conditioned on final GPA, and highlight several differences in the obtained rankings that uncover hidden pre-requisites in the Mathematics curriculum.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 17:29:03 GMT  (432kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02695v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["mihai cucuringu", "charlie marshak", "dillon montag", "puck rombach"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.02695"}
