The algorithm selection problem is attracting increasing attention from researchers and practitioners in AI. Years of fruitful applications in a number of domains have resulted in a large amount of data, but the community lacks a standard format or repository for this data. This situation makes it difficult to share and compare different approaches effectively, as is done in other, more established fields. It also unnecessarily hinders new researchers who want to work in this area. To address this problem, we introduce a standardized format for representing algorithm selection scenarios and a repository that contains a growing number of data sets from the literature. Our format has been designed to be able to express a wide variety of different scenarios. Demonstrating the breadth and power of our platform, we describe a set of example experiments that build and evaluate algorithm selection models through a common interface. The results display the potential of algorithm selection to achieve significant performance improvements across a broad range of problems and algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 12:35:04 GMT  (2356kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02465v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 14:38:52 GMT  (1600kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02465v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 6 Apr 2016 13:20:23 GMT  (2168kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02465v3", "Accepted to be published in Artificial Intelligence Journal"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["bernd bischl", "pascal kerschke", "lars kotthoff", "marius lindauer", "yuri malitsky", "alexandre frechette", "holger hoos", "frank hutter", "kevin leyton-brown", "kevin tierney", "joaquin vanschoren"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.02465"}
