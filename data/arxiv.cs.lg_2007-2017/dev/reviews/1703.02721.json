Our novel analysis also uncovers previously unknown connections between the low rank estimation and combinatorial optimization, so much so that our bounds are reminiscent of corresponding approximation bounds in submodular maximization. Additionally, we also provide statistical recovery guarantees. Finally, we present empirical comparison of greedy estimation with established baselines on two important real-world problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Mar 2017 06:20:10 GMT  (1180kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02721v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "authors": ["rajiv khanna", "ethan r elenberg", "alexandros g dimakis", "joydeep ghosh", "sahand negahban"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.02721"}
