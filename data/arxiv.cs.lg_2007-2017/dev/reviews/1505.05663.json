In this paper, we approach this problem from the sparse recovery perspective. We introduce a general model of cascades, including the voter model and the independent cascade model, for which we provide the first algorithm which recovers the graph's edges with high probability and $O(s\\log m)$ measurements where $s$ is the maximum degree of the graph and $m$ is the number of nodes. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm also recovers the edge weights (the parameters of the diffusion process) and is robust in the context of approximate sparsity. Finally we prove an almost matching lower bound of $\\Omega(s\\log\\frac{m}{s})$ and validate our approach empirically on synthetic graphs.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 May 2015 10:04:42 GMT  (246kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05663v1", "Full version of the ICML paper with the same title"]], "COMMENTS": "Full version of the ICML paper with the same title", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["jean pouget-abadie", "thibaut horel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1505.05663"}
