{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "24-Apr-2017", "title": "Semi-supervised Multitask Learning for Sequence Labeling", "abstract": "We propose a sequence labeling framework with a secondary training objective, learning to predict surrounding words for every word in the dataset. This language modeling objective incentivises the system to learn general-purpose patterns of semantic and syntactic composition, which are also useful for improving accuracy on different sequence labeling tasks. The architecture was evaluated on a range of datasets, covering the tasks of error detection in learner texts, named entity recognition, chunking and POS-tagging. The novel language modeling objective provided consistent performance improvements on every benchmark, without requiring any additional annotated or unannotated data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 11:47:06 GMT  (195kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07156v1", "ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["marek rei"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.07156"}
