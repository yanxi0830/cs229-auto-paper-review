{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "6-Feb-2017", "title": "Preference-based Teaching", "abstract": "We introduce a new model of teaching named \"preference-based teaching\" and a corresponding complexity parameter---the preference-based teaching dimension (PBTD)---representing the worst-case number of examples needed to teach any concept in a given concept class. Although the PBTD coincides with the well-known recursive teaching dimension (RTD) on finite classes, it is radically different on infinite ones: the RTD becomes infinite already for trivial infinite classes (such as half-intervals) whereas the PBTD evaluates to reasonably small values for a wide collection of infinite classes including classes consisting of so-called closed sets w.r.t. a given closure operator, including various classes related to linear sets over $\\mathbb{N}_0$ (whose RTD had been studied quite recently) and including the class of Euclidean half-spaces. On top of presenting these concrete results, we provide the reader with a theoretical framework (of a combinatorial flavor) which helps to derive bounds on the PBTD.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Feb 2017 18:40:32 GMT  (39kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02047v1", "35 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Feb 2017 11:37:57 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02047v2", "35 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "35 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ziyuan gao", "christoph ries", "hans ulrich simon", "sandra zilles"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.02047"}
