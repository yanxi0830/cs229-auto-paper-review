The technique enables practitioners to improve hBOA efficiency by collecting statistics from probabilistic models obtained in previous hBOA runs and using the obtained statistics to bias future hBOA runs on similar problems. The purpose of this paper is threefold: (1) test the technique on several classes of NP-complete problems, including MAXSAT, spin glasses and minimum vertex cover; (2) demonstrate that the technique is effective even when previous runs were done on problems of different size; (3) provide empirical evidence that combining transfer learning with other efficiency enhancement techniques can often provide nearly multiplicative speedups.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 24 Mar 2012 20:11:21 GMT  (79kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5443v1", "Submitted to Parallel Problem Solving from Nature (PPSN XII), 10 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1201.2241"], ["v2", "Thu, 21 Jun 2012 12:47:30 GMT  (79kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.5443v2", "Accepted at Parallel Problem Solving from Nature (PPSN XII), 10 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1201.2241"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to Parallel Problem Solving from Nature (PPSN XII), 10 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1201.2241", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["martin pelikan", "mark w hauschild", "pier luca lanzi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.5443"}
