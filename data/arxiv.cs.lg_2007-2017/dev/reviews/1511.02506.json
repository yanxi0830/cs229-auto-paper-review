This approach can learn to find the best structured object (such as a label sequence) given a structured input (such as a vector sequence) by globally considering the mapping relationships between the structures rather than item by item.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 8 Nov 2015 17:08:54 GMT  (385kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02506v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1506.01163"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1506.01163", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["yi-hsiu liao", "hung-yi lee", "lin-shan lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.02506"}
