When the input vectors consists of time, latitude and longitude, the map can be strongly linked to physical world, providing valuable information. Beyond basic clustering, a novel approach to address the temporal element is developed, enabling 3D SOM to track behaviors in multiple periods concurrently. Combined with adaptations targeting to process heterogeneous data relating to distribution in time and space, the paper offers a fresh scope for business and services based on temporal-spatial pattern.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 27 Sep 2016 08:25:40 GMT  (5148kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09116v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["yu ding"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.09116"}
