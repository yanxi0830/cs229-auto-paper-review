These problems appear in computational physics, numerical approximation, non-parametric statistics, and machine learning. In our context, the sums depend on a kernel function that is a pair potential defined on a dataset of points in a high-dimensional Euclidean space. A direct evaluation of the sum scales quadratically with the number of points. Fast kernel summation methods can reduce this cost to linear complexity, but the constants involved do not scale well with the dimensionality of the dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Oct 2014 15:41:11 GMT  (105kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0260v1", "22 pages, 6 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 23 Jan 2015 22:38:05 GMT  (112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0260v2", "22 pages, 6 figures"], ["v3", "Fri, 13 Mar 2015 17:31:21 GMT  (112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0260v3", "22 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["william b march", "bo xiao", "george biros"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.0260"}
