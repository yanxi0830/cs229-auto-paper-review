Given a photo album, our model first selects the most representative (summary) photos, and then composes a natural language story for the album. For this task, we make use of the Visual Storytelling dataset and a model composed of three hierarchically-attentive Recurrent Neural Nets (RNNs) to: encode the album photos, select representative (summary) photos, and compose the story. Automatic and human evaluations show our model achieves better performance on selection, generation, and retrieval than baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Aug 2017 19:26:47 GMT  (6201kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02977v1", "To appear at EMNLP-2017 (7 pages)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear at EMNLP-2017 (7 pages)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["licheng yu", "mohit bansal", "tamara l berg"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.02977"}
