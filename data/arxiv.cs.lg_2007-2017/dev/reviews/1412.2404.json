{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "7-Dec-2014", "title": "Dimensionality Reduction with Subspace Structure Preservation", "abstract": "Modeling data as being sampled from a union of independent subspaces has been widely applied to a number of real world applications. However, dimensionality reduction approaches that theoretically preserve this independence assumption have not been well studied. Our key contribution is to show that $2K$ projection vectors are sufficient for the independence preservation of any $K$ class data sampled from a union of independent subspaces. It is this non-trivial observation that we use for designing our dimensionality reduction technique. In this paper, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction algorithm that theoretically preserves this structure for a given dataset. We support our theoretical analysis with empirical results on both synthetic and real world data achieving \\textit{state-of-the-art} results compared to popular dimensionality reduction techniques.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 7 Dec 2014 22:02:33 GMT  (104kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2404v1", "Published in NIPS 2014"], ["v2", "Sun, 31 May 2015 22:30:47 GMT  (104kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2404v2", "Published in NIPS 2014; v2: minor updates to the algorithm and added a few lines addressing application to large-scale/high-dimensional data"], ["v3", "Wed, 6 Apr 2016 23:11:46 GMT  (226kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2404v3", "Published in NIPS 2014; v2: minor updates to the algorithm and added a few lines addressing application to large-scale/high-dimensional data"]], "COMMENTS": "Published in NIPS 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["devansh arpit", "ifeoma nwogu", "venu govindaraju"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.2404"}
