Most existing methodologies use text similarity metrics to identify whether two articles are related or not. However biomedical knowledge discovery is hypothesis-driven. The most related articles may not be ones with the highest text similarities. In this study, we first develop an innovative crowd-sourcing approach to build an expert-annotated document-ranking corpus. Using this corpus as the gold standard, we then evaluate the approaches of using text similarity to rank the relatedness of articles. Finally, we develop and evaluate a new supervised model to automatically rank related scientific articles. Our results show that authors' ranking differ significantly from rankings by text-similarity-based models. By training a learning-to-rank model on a subset of the annotated corpus, we found the best supervised learning-to-rank model (SVM-Rank) significantly surpassed state-of-the-art baseline systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Nov 2016 14:43:44 GMT  (271kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01400v1", "12 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.DL cs.LG cs.SI", "authors": ["jesse m lingeman", "hong yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01400"}
