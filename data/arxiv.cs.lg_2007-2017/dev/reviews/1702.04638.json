The mapping from input to output is learned with fixed semantics by training outcomes deliberately. This is an expensive and static approach which depends heavily on the availability of a very particular kind of prior raining data to make inferences in a single step. Conventional semantic network approaches, on the other hand, base multi-step reasoning on modal logics and handcrafted ontologies, which are {\\em ad hoc}, expensive to construct, and fragile to inconsistency. Both approaches may be enhanced by a hybrid approach, which completely separates reasoning from pattern recognition. In this report, a quasi-linguistic approach to knowledge representation is discussed, motivated by spacetime structure. Tokenized patterns from diverse sources are integrated to build a lightly constrained and approximately scale-free network. This is then be parsed with very simple recursive algorithms to generate `brainstorming' sets of reasoned knowledge.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 12 Feb 2017 14:58:45 GMT  (114kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04638v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 1 Aug 2017 11:32:42 GMT  (3786kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04638v2", "Typos corrected and new examples added to appendix"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["mark burgess"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.04638"}
