We study incremental learning in the context of sequence learning, using generative RNNs in the form of multi-layer recurrent Mixture Density Networks. We introduce Incremental Sequence Learning, a simple incremental approach to sequence learning. Incremental Sequence Learning starts out by using only the first few steps of each sequence as training data. Each time a performance criterion has been reached, the length of the parts of the sequences used for training is increased. To evaluate Incremental Sequence Learning and comparison methods, we introduce and make available a novel sequence learning task and data set: predicting and classifying MNIST pen stroke sequences, where the familiar handwritten digit images have been transformed to pen stroke sequences representing the skeletons of the digits. We find that Incremental Sequence Learning greatly speeds up sequence learning and reaches the best test performance level of regular sequence learning 20 times faster, reduces the test error by 74%, and in general performs more robustly; it displays lower variance and achieves sustained progress after all three comparison method have stopped improving. A trained sequence prediction model is also used in transfer learning to the task of sequence classification, where it is found that transfer learning realizes improved classification performance compared to methods that learn to classify from scratch.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Nov 2016 20:12:08 GMT  (5605kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03068v1", "18 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 21:33:19 GMT  (5706kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03068v2", "Updated version: Clarified the contribution (see abstract, intro, and conclusion); added figures to illustrate the architecture of the network and the difference between training and generation; different selection of experiments in Section 6.4; some textual edits"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["edwin d de jong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.03068"}
