In this paper, we tackle this challenge by modeling the unknown function as a sample from a high-dimensional Gaussian process (GP) distribution. Assuming that the unknown function only depends on few relevant variables, we show that it is possible to perform joint variable selection and GP optimization. We provide strong performance guarantees for our algorithm, bounding the sample complexity of variable selection, and as well as providing cumulative regret bounds. We further provide empirical evidence on the effectiveness of our algorithm on several benchmark optimization problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (572kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6396v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["bo chen", "rui m castro", "andreas krause 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6396"}
