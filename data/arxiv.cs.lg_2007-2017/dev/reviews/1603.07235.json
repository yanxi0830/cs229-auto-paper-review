{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "23-Mar-2016", "title": "Global-Local Face Upsampling Network", "abstract": "Face hallucination, which is the task of generating a high-resolution face image from a low-resolution input image, is a well-studied problem that is useful in widespread application areas. Face hallucination is particularly challenging when the input face resolution is very low (e.g., 10 x 12 pixels) and/or the image is captured in an uncontrolled setting with large pose and illumination variations. In this paper, we revisit the algorithm introduced in [1] and present a deep interpretation of this framework that achieves state-of-the-art under such challenging scenarios. In our deep network architecture the global and local constraints that define a face can be efficiently modeled and learned end-to-end using training data. Conceptually our network design can be partitioned into two sub-networks: the first one implements the holistic face reconstruction according to global constraints, and the second one enhances face-specific details and enforces local patch statistics. We optimize the deep network using a new loss function for super-resolution that combines reconstruction error with a learned face quality measure in adversarial setting, producing improved visual results. We conduct extensive experiments in both controlled and uncontrolled setups and show that our algorithm improves the state of the art both numerically and visually.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Mar 2016 15:29:09 GMT  (4928kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07235v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 27 Apr 2016 15:31:01 GMT  (4927kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07235v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["oncel tuzel", "yuichi taguchi", "john r hershey"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.07235"}
