In this work, we study how constrained connections can affect estimation performance in online review systems (ORS). We find that reviewers' constrained connections will cause poor estimation performance, both from the measurements of estimation accuracy and Bayesian Cramer Rao lower bound.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 14 Jul 2013 01:37:48 GMT  (60kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3687v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.LG", "authors": ["junzhou zhao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.3687"}
