Each test outputs a prediction of the latent state, and carries with it inherent costs. Our objective is to {\\it learn} strategies for selecting tests to optimize accuracy \\&amp; costs. Unfortunately it is often impossible to acquire in-situ ground truth annotations and we are left with the problem of unsupervised sensor selection (USS). We pose USS as a version of stochastic partial monitoring problem with an {\\it unusual} reward structure (even noisy annotations are unavailable). Unsurprisingly no learner can achieve sublinear regret without further assumptions. To this end we propose the notion of weak-dominance. This is a condition on the joint probability distribution of test outputs and latent state and says that whenever a test is accurate on an example, a later test in the sequence is likely to be accurate as well. We empirically verify that weak dominance holds on real datasets and prove that it is a maximal condition for achieving sublinear regret. We reduce USS to a special case of multi-armed bandit problem with side information and develop polynomial time algorithms that achieve sublinear regret.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 01:15:57 GMT  (228kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05394v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["manjesh hanawal", "csaba szepesvari", "venkatesh saligrama"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.05394"}
