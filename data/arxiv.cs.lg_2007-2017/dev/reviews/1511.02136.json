{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "6-Nov-2015", "title": "Diffusion-Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "We present a new deterministic relational model derived from convolutional neural networks. Search-Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNNs) extend the notion of convolution to graph search to construct a rich latent representation that extracts local behavior from general graph-structured data. Unlike other neural network models that take graph-structured data as input, SCNNs have a parameterization that is independent of input size, a property that enables transfer learning between datasets. SCNNs can be applied to a wide variety of prediction tasks, including node classification, community detection, and link prediction. Our results indicate that SCNNs can offer considerable lift over off-the-shelf classifiers and simple multilayer perceptrons, and comparable performance to state-of-the-art probabilistic graphical models.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Nov 2015 16:09:32 GMT  (7317kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02136v1", "Published in NIPS Networks 2015"], ["v2", "Mon, 16 Nov 2015 14:33:30 GMT  (3671kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02136v2", "First version published in NIPS Networks 2015; Second version submitted to ICLR 2016"], ["v3", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 14:38:08 GMT  (3681kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02136v3", "First version published in NIPS Networks 2015; Second version submitted to ICLR 2016 as a draft; Third version submitted to ICLR 2016"], ["v4", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 19:33:18 GMT  (3772kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02136v4", "Revised to address reviewer comments"], ["v5", "Tue, 19 Jan 2016 20:36:29 GMT  (3683kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02136v5", "Added a note about the time complexity of prediction for sparse graphs to section 2.4.1; added a link to a reference implementation"], ["v6", "Fri, 8 Jul 2016 15:05:17 GMT  (270kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02136v6", "Full paper"]], "COMMENTS": "Published in NIPS Networks 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["james atwood", "don towsley"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.02136"}
