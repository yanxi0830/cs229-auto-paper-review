Though some approaches have advantages over others, the resulting networks are often qualitatively similar. We find that, in dynamically-routed networks trained to classify images, layers and branches become specialized to process distinct categories of images. Additionally, given a fixed computational budget, dynamically-routed networks tend to perform better than comparable statically-routed networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Mar 2017 23:52:14 GMT  (3551kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06217v1", "Submitted to ICML 2017"], ["v2", "Tue, 12 Sep 2017 22:14:36 GMT  (2257kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06217v2", "ICML 2017.
