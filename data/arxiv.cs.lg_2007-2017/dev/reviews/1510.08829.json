This demonstrates that biologically-plausible spiking LIF neurons can be integrated into deep networks can perform as well as other spiking models (e.g. integrate-and-fire). We achieved this result by softening the LIF response function, such that its derivative remains bounded, and by training the network with noise to provide robustness against the variability introduced by spikes. Our method is general and could be applied to other neuron types, including those used on modern neuromorphic hardware. Our work brings more biological realism into modern image classification models, with the hope that these models can inform how the brain performs this difficult task. It also provides new methods for training deep networks to run on neuromorphic hardware, with the aim of fast, power-efficient image classification for robotics applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Oct 2015 19:24:03 GMT  (51kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08829v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["eric hunsberger", "chris eliasmith"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.08829"}
