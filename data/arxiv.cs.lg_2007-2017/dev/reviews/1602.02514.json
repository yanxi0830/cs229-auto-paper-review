We also propose a general improvement of existing state-of-the-art accelerated exact $k$-means algorithms through better estimates of the distance bounds used to reduce the number of distance calculations, and get a speedup in 36 of 44 experiments, up to 1.8$\\times$ faster.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Feb 2016 10:19:09 GMT  (31kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02514v1", "8 pages + supplementary material"], ["v2", "Wed, 10 Feb 2016 18:51:11 GMT  (31kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02514v2", "8 pages + supplementary material"], ["v3", "Thu, 25 Feb 2016 15:18:03 GMT  (32kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02514v3", "8 pages + supplementary material"], ["v4", "Mon, 4 Apr 2016 09:12:21 GMT  (32kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02514v4", "8 pages + supplementary material v2: mlpack installed with optimisation (previously installed in DEBUG) v3: Annulus -&gt; Annular"], ["v5", "Thu, 28 Apr 2016 12:11:49 GMT  (32kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02514v5", "8 pages + supplementary material v2: mlpack installed with optimisation (previously installed in DEBUG) v3: Annulus -&gt; Annular v4: Author affiliation update"], ["v6", "Sun, 11 Sep 2016 14:57:29 GMT  (37kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02514v6", "8 pages + supplementary material v2: mlpack installed with optimisation (previously installed in DEBUG) v3: Annulus -&gt; Annular v4: Author affiliation update v5: Synced with version at ICML, now including Suppl.
