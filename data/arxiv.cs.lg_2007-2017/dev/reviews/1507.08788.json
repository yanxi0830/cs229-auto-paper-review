{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "31-Jul-2015", "title": "Fast Stochastic Algorithms for SVD and PCA: Convergence Properties and Convexity", "abstract": "We study the convergence properties of the VR-PCA algorithm introduced by \\cite{shamir2015stochastic} for fast computation of leading singular vectors. We prove several new results, including a formal analysis of a block version of the algorithm, and convergence from random initialization. We also make a few observations of independent interest, such as how pre-initializing with just a single exact power iteration can significantly improve the runtime of stochastic methods, and what are the convexity and non-convexity properties of the underlying optimization problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 07:57:18 GMT  (362kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.08788v1", "35 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "35 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NA math.NA math.OC stat.ML", "authors": ["ohad shamir"], "accepted": true, "id": "1507.08788"}
