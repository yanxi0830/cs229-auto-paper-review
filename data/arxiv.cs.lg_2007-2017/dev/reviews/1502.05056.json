In short, the theory suggests that the evolutionary process of gene recombination implements the celebrated multiplicative weights updates algorithm (MWUA). They prove that the population dynamics induced by sexual reproduction can be precisely modeled by genes that use MWUA as their learning strategy in a particular coordination game. The result holds in the environments of \\emph{weak selection}, under the assumption that the population frequencies remain a product distribution.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Feb 2015 21:02:37 GMT  (35kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05056v1", "full version of a paper accepted to AAMAS-2015"]], "COMMENTS": "full version of a paper accepted to AAMAS-2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GT", "authors": ["reshef meir", "david parkes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.05056"}
