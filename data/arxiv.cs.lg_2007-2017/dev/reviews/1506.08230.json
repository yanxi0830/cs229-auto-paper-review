In the specific application to supervised learning for convnets, a simple scale-invariant classification stage turns out to be more robust than multinomial logistic regression, appears to result in slightly lower errors on several standard test sets, has similar computational costs, and features precise control over the actual rate of learning. \"Scale-invariant\" means that multiplying the input values by any nonzero scalar leaves the output unchanged.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 Jun 2015 22:22:21 GMT  (617kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08230v1", "14 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables"], ["v2", "Sun, 13 Sep 2015 18:10:04 GMT  (652kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08230v2", "12 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables (ICLR reviewers need only consider the first 8 pages -- the remaining pages are appendices)"], ["v3", "Thu, 24 Dec 2015 20:20:48 GMT  (652kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08230v3", "12 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables (ICLR reviewers need only consider the first 9 pages -- the remaining pages are appendices)"], ["v4", "Tue, 16 Feb 2016 22:55:43 GMT  (653kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08230v4", "12 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["mark tygert", "arthur szlam", "soumith chintala", "marc'aurelio ranzato", "yuandong tian", "wojciech zaremba"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.08230"}
