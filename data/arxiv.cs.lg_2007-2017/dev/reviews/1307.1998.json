In this work, we present a method to extract Behavioural Groups by using simple clustering techniques that can potentially reveal aspects of the Personalities for their members. We believe that this is very important because the psychological information regarding the Personalities of individuals is limited in real world applications and because it can become a useful tool in improving the traditional models of Knowledge Economy.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Jul 2013 09:25:07 GMT  (515kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1998v1", "UKCI 2012, the 12th Annual Workshop on Computational Intelligence, Heriot-Watt University, 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "UKCI 2012, the 12th Annual Workshop on Computational Intelligence, Heriot-Watt University, 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE", "authors": ["alexandros ladas", "uwe aickelin", "jon garibaldi", "eamonn ferguson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.1998"}
