Nowadays, authorship attribution,for both information retrieval and analysis, has gained great importance in the context of security, trust and copyright preservation. This work proposes an innovative multi-agent driven machine learning technique that has been developed for authorship attribution. By means of a preprocessing for word-grouping and time-period related analysis of the common lexicon, we determine a bias reference level for the recurrence frequency of the words within analysed texts, and then train a Radial Basis Neural Networks (RBPNN)-based classifier to identify the correct author. The main advantage of the proposed approach lies in the generality of the semantic analysis, which can be applied to different contexts and lexical domains, without requiring any modification. Moreover, the proposed system is able to incorporate an external input, meant to tune the classifier, and then self-adjust by means of continuous learning reinforcement.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Sep 2014 11:10:23 GMT  (648kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8484v1", "Published on: Proceedings of the XV Workshop \"Dagli Oggetti agli Agenti\" (WOA 2014), Catania, Italy, Sepember. 25-26, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Published on: Proceedings of the XV Workshop \"Dagli Oggetti agli Agenti\" (WOA 2014), Catania, Italy, Sepember. 25-26, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG cs.MA", "authors": ["christian napoli", "giuseppe pappalardo", "emiliano tramontana"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.8484"}
