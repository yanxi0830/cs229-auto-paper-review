Most nonlinear supervised manifold learning methods compute the embedding of the manifolds only at the initially available training points, while the generalization of the embedding to novel points, known as the out-of-sample extension problem in manifold learning, becomes especially important in classification applications. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised method for building an interpolation function that provides an out-of-sample extension for general supervised manifold learning algorithms studied in the context of classification. The proposed algorithm computes a radial basis function (RBF) interpolator that minimizes an objective function consisting of the total embedding error of unlabeled test samples, defined as their distance to the embeddings of the manifolds of their own class, as well as a regularization term that controls the smoothness of the interpolation function in a direction-dependent way. The class labels of test data and the interpolation function parameters are estimated jointly with a progressive procedure. Experimental results on face and object images demonstrate the potential of the proposed out-of-sample extension algorithm for the classification of manifold-modeled data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Feb 2015 09:56:57 GMT  (713kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02410v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["elif vural", "christine guillemot"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.02410"}
