No initial segmentation of audio data is assumed, i.e., no onset, offset, nor pitch data are needed. The notion of random ferns is described in the paper, to familiarize the reader with this classification algorithm, which was introduced quite recently and applied so far in image recognition tasks. The performance of random ferns is compared with random forests for the same data. The results of experiments are presented in the paper, and conclusions are drawn.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 May 2013 10:43:25 GMT  (34kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.5078v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IR cs.SD", "authors": ["alicja a wieczorkowska", "miron b kursa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.5078"}
