We approach this problem from first principles and formulate it as a surprisingly simple optimization problem. Indeed, our formulation even admits a closed form solution. This solution possesses several very attractive properties: (i) an innate geometric appeal through the Riemannian geometry of positive definite matrices; (ii) ease of interpretability; and (iii) computational speed several orders of magnitude faster than the widely used LMNN and ITML methods. Furthermore, on standard benchmark datasets, our closed-form solution consistently attains higher classification accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jul 2016 10:14:46 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05002v1", "7 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["pourya zadeh", "reshad hosseini", "suvrit sra"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.05002"}
