First, we show that this problem is NP-hard. In the two-stage case, we provide two relaxation schemes. The first relaxation scheme works by dropping some constraints in order to obtain a problem that is solvable in polynomial time. The second relaxation scheme, based on a Lagrangian relaxation where all constraints are dualized, leads to a conic quadratic programming problem. We also theoretically prove and empirically illustrate that both relaxation schemes provide better results than those given in [22].", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Feb 2012 20:53:18 GMT  (560kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5298v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 30 Oct 2012 16:29:38 GMT  (560kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5298v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.LG", "authors": ["raphael fonteneau", "damien ernst", "bernard boigelot", "quentin louveaux"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.5298"}
