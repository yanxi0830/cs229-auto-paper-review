Our framework is based on the theory of random atomic measures, with the prior specified by a gamma process. We derive a posterior characterization and a simple and effective Gibbs sampler for posterior simulation. We develop a time-varying extension of our model, and apply it to the New York Times lists of weekly bestselling books.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Nov 2012 07:40:51 GMT  (556kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4321v1", "NIPS - Neural Information Processing Systems (2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS - Neural Information Processing Systems (2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME", "authors": ["francois caron", "yee whye teh"], "accepted": true, "id": "1211.4321"}
