Under the generic RegBayes (regularized Bayesian inference) framework, we handily incorporate the prediction loss with probabilistic inference of a Bayesian model; set distinct regularization parameters for different types of links to handle the imbalance issue in real networks; and unify the analysis of both the smooth logistic log-loss and the piecewise linear hinge loss. For the nonconjugate posterior inference, we present a simple Gibbs sampler via data augmentation, without making restricting assumptions as done in variational methods. We further develop an approximate sampler using stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics to handle large networks with hundreds of thousands of entities and millions of links, orders of magnitude larger than what existing LFRM models can process. Extensive studies on various real networks show promising performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Dec 2015 12:37:41 GMT  (301kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02016v1", "Accepted by AAAI 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by AAAI 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["bei chen", "ning chen", "jun zhu", "jiaming song", "bo zhang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.02016"}
