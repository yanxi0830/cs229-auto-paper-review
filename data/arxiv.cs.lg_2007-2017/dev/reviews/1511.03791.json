The capability to autonomously learn robot controllers solely from raw-pixel images and without any prior knowledge of configuration is shown for the first time. We build upon the success of recent deep reinforcement learning and develop a system for learning target reaching with a three-joint robot manipulator using external visual observation. A Deep Q Network (DQN) was demonstrated to perform target reaching after training in simulation. Transferring the network to real hardware and real observation in a naive approach failed, but experiments show that the network works when replacing camera images with synthetic images.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Nov 2015 06:19:59 GMT  (4489kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03791v1", "8 pages, to appear in the proceedings of Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA) 2015"], ["v2", "Fri, 13 Nov 2015 05:41:08 GMT  (4489kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03791v2", "8 pages, to appear in the proceedings of Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA) 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, to appear in the proceedings of Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA) 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.RO", "authors": ["fangyi zhang", "j\\\"urgen leitner", "michael milford", "ben upcroft", "peter corke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.03791"}
