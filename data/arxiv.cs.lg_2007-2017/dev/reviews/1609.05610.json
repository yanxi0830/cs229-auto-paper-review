We present experimental results which suggest that the performance of the current state-of-the-art learning to rank algorithm LambdaMART, when used for document retrieval for search engines, can be improved if standard regression trees are replaced by oblivious trees. This paper provides a comparison of both variants and our results demonstrate that the use of oblivious trees can improve the performance by more than $2.2\\%$. Additional experimental analysis of the influence of a number of features and of a size of the training set is also provided and confirms the desirability of properties of oblivious decision trees.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Sep 2016 07:03:29 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05610v1", "Accepted for publication in proceedings of RUSSIR 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for publication in proceedings of RUSSIR 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["michal ferov", "marek modr\\'y"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.05610"}
