In this paper, Normalization based K-means clustering algorithm(N-K means) is proposed. Proposed N-K means clustering algorithm applies normalization prior to clustering on the available data as well as the proposed approach calculates initial centroids based on weights. Experimental results prove the betterment of proposed N-K means clustering algorithm over existing K-means clustering algorithm in terms of complexity and overall performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Mar 2015 11:26:27 GMT  (360kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00900v1", "5 pages, 4 figures in International Journal of Advanced Engineering Research and Science (IJAERS)-Feb 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 4 figures in International Journal of Advanced Engineering Research and Science (IJAERS)-Feb 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DB", "authors": ["deepali virmani", "shweta taneja", "geetika malhotra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.00900"}
