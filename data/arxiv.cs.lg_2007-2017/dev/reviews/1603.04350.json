We give the first $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$-regret algorithm for this setting based on a novel application of the ellipsoid method to online learning. This bound is known to be tight up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis is introduces new tools in discrete convex geometry.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Mar 2016 17:15:15 GMT  (756kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04350v1", "28 pages, 7 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 15 Mar 2016 17:46:58 GMT  (756kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04350v2", "29 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "28 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["elad hazan", "yuanzhi li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.04350"}
