Previous works in taxonomy induction generally ignore the increasingly prominent visual data, which encode important perceptual semantics. Instead, we propose a probabilistic model for taxonomy induction by jointly leveraging text and images. To avoid hand-crafted feature engineering, we design end-to-end features based on distributed representations of images and words. The model is discriminatively trained given a small set of existing ontologies and is capable of building full taxonomies from scratch for a collection of unseen conceptual label items with associated images. We evaluate our model and features on the WordNet hierarchies, where our system outperforms previous approaches by a large gap.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Jun 2016 19:52:53 GMT  (630kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09239v1", "To appear in ACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in ACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["hao zhang", "zhiting hu", "yuntian deng", "mrinmaya sachan", "zhicheng yan", "eric p xing"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.09239"}
