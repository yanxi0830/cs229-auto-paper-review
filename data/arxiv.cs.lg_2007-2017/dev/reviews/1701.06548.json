We show that penalizing low entropy output distributions, which has been shown to improve exploration in reinforcement learning, acts as a strong regularizer in supervised learning. Furthermore, we connect a maximum entropy based confidence penalty to label smoothing through the direction of the KL divergence. We exhaustively evaluate the proposed confidence penalty and label smoothing on 6 common benchmarks: image classification (MNIST and Cifar-10), language modeling (Penn Treebank), machine translation (WMT'14 English-to-German), and speech recognition (TIMIT and WSJ). We find that both label smoothing and the confidence penalty improve state-of-the-art models across benchmarks without modifying existing hyperparameters, suggesting the wide applicability of these regularizers.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Jan 2017 18:35:28 GMT  (64kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06548v1", "Submitted to ICLR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to ICLR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["gabriel pereyra", "george tucker", "jan chorowski", "{\\l}ukasz kaiser", "geoffrey hinton"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.06548"}
