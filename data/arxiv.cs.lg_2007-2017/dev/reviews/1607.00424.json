We present our pipeline, which employs Relational Dependency Networks (RDNs) to learn linguistic patterns for relation extraction. Additionally, we demonstrate how several components such as weak supervision, word2vec features, joint learning and the use of human advice, can be incorporated in this relational framework. We evaluate the different components in the benchmark KBP 2015 task and show that RDNs effectively model a diverse set of features and perform competitively with current state-of-the-art relation extraction.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Jul 2016 22:11:38 GMT  (231kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00424v1", "In Proceedings of Sixth International Workshop on Statistical Relational AI at the 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings of Sixth International Workshop on Statistical Relational AI at the 25th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["dileep viswanathan", "ameet soni", "jude shavlik", "sriraam natarajan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1607.00424"}
