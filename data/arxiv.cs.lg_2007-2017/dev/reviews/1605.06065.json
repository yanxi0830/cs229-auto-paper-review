When new data is encountered, the models must inefficiently relearn their parameters to adequately incorporate the new information without catastrophic interference. Architectures with augmented memory capacities, such as Neural Turing Machines (NTMs), offer the ability to quickly encode and retrieve new information, and hence can potentially obviate the downsides of conventional models. Here, we demonstrate the ability of a memory-augmented neural network to rapidly assimilate new data, and leverage this data to make accurate predictions after only a few samples. We also introduce a new method for accessing an external memory that focuses on memory content, unlike previous methods that additionally use memory location-based focusing mechanisms.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 May 2016 17:44:51 GMT  (2237kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06065v1", "13 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["adam santoro", "sergey bartunov", "matthew botvinick", "daan wierstra", "timothy lillicrap"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.06065"}
