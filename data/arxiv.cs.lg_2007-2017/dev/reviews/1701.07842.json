The protocols for interacting with these frameworks can often be described by finite-state machines we dub *asynchronous typestates*. Asynchronous typestates are akin to classical typestates, with the key difference that their outputs (callbacks) are produced asynchronously.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Jan 2017 19:06:45 GMT  (81kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07842v1", "Submitted to CAV 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to CAV 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.LG cs.PL", "authors": ["arjun radhakrishna", "nicholas lewchenko", "shawn meier", "sergio mover", "krishna chaitanya sripada", "damien zufferey", "bor-yuh evan chang", "pavol \\v{c}ern\\'y"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.07842"}
