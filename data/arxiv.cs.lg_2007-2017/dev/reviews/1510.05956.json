{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Oct-2015", "title": "Optimal Cluster Recovery in the Labeled Stochastic Block Model", "abstract": "We consider the problem of community detection in the labeled Stochastic Block Model (labeled SBM) with a finite number $K$ of communities of sizes linearly growing with the network size $n$. Every pair of nodes is labeled independently at random, and label $\\ell$ appears with probability $p(i,j,\\ell)$ between two nodes in community $i$ and $j$, respectively. One observes a realization of these random labels, and the objective is to reconstruct the communities from this observation. Under mild assumptions on the parameters $p$, we show that under spectral algorithms, the number of misclassified nodes does not exceed $s$ with high probability as $n$ grows large, whenever $\\bar{p}n=\\omega(1)$ (where $\\bar{p}=\\max_{i,j,\\ell\\ge 1}p(i,j,\\ell)$), $s=o(n)$ and $\\frac{n D(p)}{ \\log (n/s)} &gt;1$, where $D(p)$, referred to as the {\\it divergence}, is an appropriately defined function of the parameters $p=(p(i,j,\\ell), i,j, \\ell)$. We further show that $\\frac{n D(p)}{ \\log (n/s)} &gt;1$ is actually necessary to obtain less than $s$ misclassified nodes asymptotically. This establishes the optimality of spectral algorithms, i.e., when $\\bar{p}n=\\omega(1)$ and $nD(p)=\\omega(1)$, no algorithm can perform better in terms of expected misclassified nodes than spectral algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Oct 2015 16:47:27 GMT  (210kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05956v1", "16 pages"], ["v2", "Mon, 26 Oct 2015 01:18:59 GMT  (247kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05956v2", "20 pages"], ["v3", "Mon, 2 Nov 2015 23:50:11 GMT  (392kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05956v3", "32 pages"], ["v4", "Wed, 4 Nov 2015 14:03:41 GMT  (392kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05956v4", "32 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1412.7335"], ["v5", "Mon, 21 Dec 2015 01:23:31 GMT  (399kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05956v5", "33 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1412.7335"], ["v6", "Sat, 21 May 2016 19:41:08 GMT  (399kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05956v6", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1412.7335"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.PR cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML", "authors": ["se-young yun", "alexandre prouti\u00e8re"], "accepted": true, "id": "1510.05956"}
