This is due to the heterogeneity of ad opportunity types and the non-convexity of the objective function. In this work, we show how to reduce reserve price optimization to the standard setting of prediction under squared loss, a well understood problem in the learning community. We further bound the gap between the expected bid and revenue in terms of the average loss of the predictor. This is the first result that formally relates the revenue gained to the quality of a standard machine learned model.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 04:05:56 GMT  (64kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04732v1", "Submitted to NIPS 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to NIPS 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GT", "authors": ["andr\\'es mu\\~noz medina", "sergei vassilvitskii"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.04732"}
