The method tracks the relative changes in the objective function with a running average, and uses it to adaptively tune the learning rate in stochastic gradient descent. We specifically apply this idea to modify Adam, a popular algorithm for training deep neural networks. We conduct experiments to compare the resulting algorithm, which we call Eve, with state of the art methods used for training deep learning models. We train CNNs for image classification, and RNNs for language modeling and question answering. Our experiments show that Eve outperforms all other algorithms on these benchmark tasks. We also analyze the behavior of the feedback mechanism during the training process.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Nov 2016 19:42:45 GMT  (1769kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01505v1", "ICLR 2017 Submission"], ["v2", "Thu, 17 Nov 2016 04:39:29 GMT  (1769kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01505v2", "Added section 3.1 discussing an assumption of our method.
