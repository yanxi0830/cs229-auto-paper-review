Although not usually interpreted thus, these are learning algorithms that fit a local quadratic approximation to the objective function. We show that many, including the most popular, quasi-Newton methods can be interpreted as approximations of Bayesian linear regression under varying prior assumptions. This new notion elucidates some shortcomings of classical algorithms, and lights the way to a novel nonparametric quasi-Newton method, which is able to make more efficient use of available information at computational cost similar to its predecessors.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 14:41:11 GMT  (475kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4602v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NA cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["philipp hennig", "martin kiefel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4602"}
