This transformation procedure, which we call “prior swapping” works for arbitrary priors. Notably, its cost is independent of data size. It therefore allows us, in some cases, to apply significantly less-costly inference procedures to more-sophisticated models than previously possible. It also lets us quickly perform any additional inferences, such as with updated priors or for many different hyperparameter settings, without touching the data.

      "text" : "There are many cases in Bayesian modeling where a certain choice of prior distribution allows for computationally simple or tractable inference. For example,\n• Conjugate priors yield posteriors with a known parametric form and therefore allow for noniterative, exact inference [9, 14].\n• Certain priors yield models with tractable conditional or marginal distributions, which allows efficient approximate inference algorithms to be applied (e.g. Gibbs sampling [50, 10, 65], sampling in collapsed models [60, 52, 38], or mean-field variational methods [56, 52]).\n• Simple parametric priors (e.g. the normal distribution) allow for computationally cheap density queries, maximization, and sampling [2], which can allow for easier use in iterative inference algorithms (e.g. Metropolis-Hastings [29, 8], gradient-based MCMC [34], or sequential Monte Carlo [12, 41]).\n• Certain priors mitigate issues of identifiability, and allow for simpler posteriors without multiple modes [43].\nHowever, more sophisticated priors that provide a better depiction of observed or expert knowledge do not, in general, allow for the above inference techniques. Instead, researchers must resort to more general and computationally expensive inference methods. This can encourage the use of convenient priors in practice, rather than priors that might yield a more realistic or accurate inference, which is a criticism of Bayesian methods [15].\nIn this paper, we investigate the following question: for a given model, is it possible to use any convenient prior to infer a false posterior, and afterwards, given some true prior of interest, quickly transform this result into the true posterior?\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n00 78\n7v 1\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n2 J\nun 2\nIntuitively, our strategy is the following: for a given model, we first choose any computationally convenient false prior, and perform inference, which returns the false posterior. We then use our inferred false posterior, a true prior of interest, and the false prior, to efficiently produce samples from the true posterior via a method we call prior swapping.\nOne key attribute of prior swapping is that it runs without touching any data. Existing general inference algorithms are iterative and data-dependent: parameter updates at each iteration involve data, and the computational complexity or quality of each update depends on the amount of data used. Thus, inference on larger datasets takes more time. Furthermore, in practice, we often want to perform inference for a number of different priors or hyperparameter settings; for each, some data-dependent inference algorithm must be run to compute a new result.\nIn contrast, prior swapping algorithms are data-independent—i.e. parameter updates do not involve data, and neither the complexity nor quality of each update depends on data size. We therefore advocate doing difficult inference in two steps: first, perform data-dependent inference using the most computationally convenient prior for a given model, and then, for all future priors of interest (e.g. complex priors or a range of prior hyperparameter settings), perform quick, data-independent prior swapping. We summarize the advantages of this approach:\n1. There often exists some false posterior that can be computed more efficiently than the true posterior; in some cases, we can therefore apply significantly less-costly inference procedures to more-sophisticated models than previously possible.\n2. The prior swapping procedure runs independently of the data; this can allow for considerable speed-ups when doing inference on large datasets or ranges of hyperparameter values.\n3. We can often maintain theoretical guarantees of existing approximate inference algorithms; e.g. when inferring the false posterior with an asymptotically-exact method (such as sampling), prior swapping can return asymptotically-exact true posterior samples.\n4. We can update our prior, or incorporate new prior information, in an online fashion, without redoing data-dependent inference.\n5. This is a black box procedure, which can be run directly on the output of most existing inference methods to add richer prior information to inference results."

      "text" : "Suppose we have a dataset of n real, finite-dimensional vectors xn = {x1, . . . , xn} ⊂ Rm, and we are interested in a family of models specified by the likelihood function fx |θ (xn|θ), parameterized by a real, d-dimensional vector θ ∈ Rd . Suppose we have a prior distribution over the space of model parameters θ , with probability density function (PDF) fθ (θ). The likelihood and prior define a joint model given by the PDF fθ ,x(θ , xn) = fθ (θ) fx |θ (xn|θ). In Bayesian inference, we are interested in computing the posterior distribution—i.e. a conditional distribution of this joint model—with PDF\nfθ |x(θ |xn) = fθ (θ) fx |θ (xn|θ) ∫\nfθ (θ) fx |θ (xn|θ) dθ =\n1 Z fθ (θ) fx |θ (x n|θ). (1)\nSuppose we’ve chosen a different prior distribution fφ(θ), which we refer to as a false prior (while we refer to fθ (θ) as the true prior). We can now can define a new joint model fφ,x(θ , xn) = fφ(θ) fx |θ (xn|θ), with posterior (conditional) PDF fφ|x(θ |xn) = 1 Z\nfφ(θ) fx |θ (xn|θ). We refer to this second posterior distribution as a false posterior.\nThe goal of our method is to first infer a false posterior and then leverage it to infer a true posterior. To carry out this transformation, we use the prior swap function f\neps, which we define as the false posterior density multiplied by the true prior density and divided by the false prior density, i.e.\nf eps(θ) = fφ|x(θ |xn) fθ (θ) fφ(θ) ∝ fφ(θ) fx |θ (xn|θ) fθ (θ) fφ(θ) ∝ fθ |x(θ |xn). (2)\nNote that f eps is proportional to the true posterior density fθ |x . However, depending on how we\nrepresent the false posterior fφ|x , f eps can have a much simpler analytic representation than fθ |x , which is typically defined via a likelihood function (which is a function of the data; see Eq. 1). It is therefore often possible to apply existing inference algorithms to f\neps, instead of fθ |x , to perform quicker inference. We will use fps to denote the prior swap density, i.e. fps = 1 Z f eps.\nOur strategy is to first compute some expression for fφ|x , and then infer the true posterior using fps as a target density. This can be done with various types of inference for fφ|x , including closed form (exact) computations, sampling-based methods (such as Markov chain Monte Carlo), and other approximate inference strategies such as variational inference and expectation propagation methods. We illustrate prior swapping in Fig. 1.\nFixed-complexity false posterior. As a first case, suppose that we have computed an analytic expression f ∗\nφ|x for the false posterior density with a fixed-complexity parametric form (i.e. the complexity of the expression does not grow as inference proceeds). For example, this is the case if we\n• Compute fφ|x exactly (in a closed form) via a conjugate prior.\n• Generate samples from fφ|x , via MCMC or other sampling methods, then use these samples to compute a parametric density estimate f̂ p\nφ|x .\n• Apply optimization-based approximate inference methods, such as variational inference or expectation propagation, that return analytic approximate posteriors f̂ VI\nφ|x or f̂ EP φ|x .\nIn each case, while we use some data-dependent algorithm to infer the false posterior, our resulting expression f ∗\nφ|x is not a function of the data. Given this expression, consider the functions\nf ∗ eps(θ) =\nf ∗ φ|x(θ) fθ (θ)\nfφ(θ) (3) and ∇θ log f ∗ eps(θ) =∇θ log f ∗φ|x(θ) + log fθ (θ)− log fφ(θ) . (4)\nWe can use these to draw posterior samples extremely efficiently with a variety of standard MCMC algorithms. At each iteration in MCMC, to draw a new parameter, we must evaluate a target function associated with the posterior density. For example, we evaluate a function proportional to fθ |x(θ |xn) in Metropolis-Hastings (MH) [29, 8] and ∇θ log fθ |x(θ |xn) in gradient-based MCMC methods (such as Langevin dynamics (LD) [46], Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) [34, 19], and their stochastic variants [59, 7]). Due to the likelihood function in fθ |x , these target functions are data-dependent.\nIn prior swapping, we instead evaluate f ∗ eps(θ) (Eq. 3) in MH, or ∇θ log f ∗ eps(θ) (Eq. 4) in LD, HMC, or gradient ascent optimization to a MAP point estimate (see appendix for detailed algorithm pseudocode). Here, each iteration only requires evaluating a few simple analytic expressions, and thus has O(1) complexity with respect to data size.\nConsistent false posterior. Suppose our false posterior inference procedure yields a set of samples {eθt}Tt=1 ∼ fφ|x . Above, we proposed the strategy of computing a fixed-complexity parametric density estimate f̂ p\nφ|x , and plugging this into the prior swap function (which we will denote f̂ p eps). This f̂ p φ|x is,\nin general, an inconsistent estimate of fφ|x , and using it in prior swapping yields asymptotically-biased samples from fθ |x . Here, we aim to answer the question: given samples from fφ|x , can we develop an efficient method that returns asymptotically-exact samples from fθ |x?\nSuppose we instead use a consistent false posterior density estimate, such as a nonparametric [58, 21] or semiparametric [18] estimate. We will prove (Sec. 2.1) that plugging a consistent estimate for fφ|x into the prior swap function yields asymptotically-exact samples. However, the cost of these consistent estimates grows with the number of samples T ; typically, evaluating their PDF or gradient has a complexity of O(T). Using these estimates for fφ|x in the above prior swapping procedure therefore has a complexity of O(T ) per iteration, which is costly for large T .\nWe instead propose the following prior swapping method, which still yields asymptoticallyexact samples from fθ |x , yet does not require a significant increase in computation: first generate approximate posterior samples using f̂ p\neps (as above), and then correct these samples via algorithms from the parallel MCMC literature (described below), designed to sample from the product of densities.\nTo motivate this method, we choose a a consistent semiparametric false posterior estimate f̂ s φ|x (see [18] for background and consistency guarantees), which can be viewed as the product of a parametric density estimate f̂ p\nφ|x and a nonparametric correction function. This is written\nf̂ sφ|x(θ) = 1\nT\nT ∑\nt=1\n\n \n1\nhd K ‖θ − eθt‖ h\n! f̂ p φ|x(θ)\nf̂ p φ|x( eθt)\n\n  , (5)\nwhere we use K to denote a probability density kernel, with bandwidth h, where h→ 0 as T →∞ (see [58] for details on probability density kernels and bandwidth selection). A general parametric family for f̂ p\nφ|x that we can use in nearly all cases is the family of false prior distributions. These are typically simple parametric distributions over the correct parameter space, which contain parameterizations in a broad vicinity of fφ|x , and for which there exist efficient parameter estimation algorithms. Given f̂ s φ|x , we write the semiparametric prior swap function as\nf̂ s eps(θ) =\nf̂ s φ|x(θ) fθ (θ)\nfφ(θ) =\n1\nT\nT ∑\nt=1\n1 hd K ‖θ−eθt‖ h f̂ p φ|x(θ) fθ (θ)\nf̂ p φ|x( eθt) fφ(θ) (6)\n=\n\n\nf̂ p φ|x(θ) fθ (θ)\nfφ(θ)\n\n\n\n  \n1\nT\nT ∑\nt=1\nK ‖θ−eθt‖ h\nf̂ p φ|x( eθt)hd\n\n   = h f̂ p eps(θ) i\n\n\n1\nT\nT ∑\nt=1\nwt K ‖θ − eθt‖ h\n!\n .\nHence, the prior swap function is proportional to the product of two densities: the parametric prior swap density, and a correction density. We can easily generate samples from both of the densities that comprise f̂ s\neps—the former with (fixed-complexity) parametric prior swapping and the latter by sampling from components in the correction density with frequency proportional to the components’ weights.\nAlgorithm 1: Asymptotically-exact prior swapping\nInput: False posterior samples {eθt}Tt=1 ∼ fφ|x(θ |x n). Output: Samples {θt}Tt=1 ∼ f̂ s ps(θ) T→∞−→ fθ |x(θ |xn).\n1 Estimate f̂ p φ|x using {eθt} T t=1 . parametric estimate. 2 Sample {θ 1t } T t=1 ∼ f̂ p ps(θ ) . parametric prior swapping.\n3 Sample {θ 2t } T t=1 ∼ 1 T ∑T t=1 f̂ p φ|x( eθt)−1K ‖θ−eθt‖ h . 4 Sample {θt}Tt=1 ∼ f̂ s ps(θ) via Prod {θ 1t } T t=1, {θ 2 t } T t=1 .\nWe therefore turn to sample combination methods for efficiently generating samples from the product of densities [48, 37, 42]. Given two sets of samples {θ 1t } T t=1 ∼ f1(θ) and {θ 2 t } T t=1 ∼ f2(θ), these algorithms aim to return Prod({θ 1t1} T t=1, {θ 2 t2 }Tt=1) = {θt} T t=1 ∼ 1 Z\nf1 f2(θ). These methods are efficient because each density product sample can be generated without iterating through either set of T input samples; typically, only a single sample from each input density is required. Each sample can therefore be produced with constant O(1) complexity. We summarize the full asymptotically-exact prior swapping procedure in Alg. 1. In the appendix, we give pseudocode for the density product sample combination algorithms, summarize the complexity of all methods, and also discuss how this semiparametric prior swapping method allows for easy incorporation of observed prior information.\nThis setting also has some relation to importance sampling (IS) [2]. For example, one could use the false posterior as an IS proposal (i.e. simply reweight and then use samples from fφ|x). However, in practice, performance would only be adequate for false posteriors that are very similar to the true posterior (and not for arbitrary fφ|x), especially in high dimensions [35, 54]. We show this empirically by comparing against this strategy in Sec. 3."

We aim to demonstrate empirically that prior swapping allows us to apply less-costly inference algorithms to more-complex models than was previously possible, and that it efficiently yields correct samples. We compare the following inference procedures:\n• MCMC on the true posterior: MCMC sampling algorithms run directly on fθ |x .\n• VI on the true posterior: variational inference algorithms run directly on fθ |x .\n• False posterior: using the inferred false posterior fφ|x .\n• Importance sampling with false posterior proposal: using fφ|x as a proposal density and running importance sampling.\n• Prior swapping (fixed-complexity): prior swapping using a fixed-complexity expression f ∗ φ|x ,\nincluding exactly-computed fφ|x , parametric estimates f̂ p φ|x , and approximations f̂ VI φ|x .\n• Prior swapping (consistent): prior swapping via Alg. 1 using a semiparametric f̂ s φ|x .\n• Prior swapping to MAP: optimization, using the prior swap function, to a MAP point estimate.\n• False-true hybrid prior prior swapping on fφ|x(θ) fθ (θ) without dividing out the false prior.\n• Normal approximation: prior swapping using normal approximations for fφ|x , fθ , and fφ .\nTo assess performance, we use two metrics: posterior error and test error. To compute posterior error, we run a single chain of MCMC on the true posterior for one million steps, and use these samples as groundtruth (after removing the first quarter as burn in). We then compare these groundtruth samples with those returned by our inference methods. Specifically, we compute the Euclidean distance between the means of both sets of samples, the Euclidean distance between the variances of both sets of samples, and the estimated L2 distance between the groundtruth density f and a sampled posterior density f̂ : d2( f , f̂ ) = ‖ f − f̂ ‖2 = ( ∫\n( f (θ)− f̂ (θ))2)1/2. Posterior error is the normalized average of these three computations. Test error, which we report for classification models, is the proportion of misclassified held-out (test) data.

      "text" : "Sparsity-encouraging regularizers have gained a high level of popularity over the past decade due to their ability to produce models with greater interpretability, predictive accuracy, and parsimony. For example, the L1 norm has been used to induce sparsity with great effect [53, 39], and has been shown to be equivalent to a mean-zero independent Laplace prior [53, 49, 32, 6]. In a Bayesian setting, inference given a sparsity prior can be difficult, and researchers often resort to computationally intensive methods (such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) or biased posterior approximations (e.g. expectation propagation [31]) that make factorization or parametric assumptions [49, 16]. We provide a cheap yet accurate solution: first use a more-tractable prior (such as a normal prior, in which closed form inference is possible), and then use prior swapping to quickly convert the result to the posterior given a sparsity prior.\nOur first set of experiments are on sparse Bayesian linear regression models [49, 30], which we can write as yi = X iθ+ε, ε∼N (0,σ2), θ ∼ fθ , i = 1,...,n. For fθ , we compute results on on Laplace, Student’s t, and VerySparse (with PDF VerySparse(σ) =\n∏d i=1 1 2σ exp{−|θi |0.4/σ} [49]) priors. Here, a normal fφ is conjugate and allows for exact inference. Our second set of experiments are on a hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression model [20, 13], which we write as yi ∼ Bern(pi), pi = logistic(X iθ ), θ ∼ fθ , i = 1,...,n. We will consider a hierarchical fθ =N (0,α−1 I), α∼ Gamma(γ, 1).\nHere, we also use a normal fφ (see [20, 1] for examples of convenient inference in Bayesian logistic regression under normal priors). In these experiments, we generate synthetic data from the models in order to show results under varying n and d. For comparison methods, we use MH for MCMC, and a mean field approximation [13] for VI.\nIn Fig. 2 we show results for sparse linear models, with n=10,000 observations, and d=20 dimensions. In (a) and (b) we show convergence plots and see that prior swapping performs faster inference (by a few orders of magnitude) than MCMC. We also see that semiparametric prior swapping (Alg. 1) achieves nearly identical performance as prior swapping on the exactly computed fφ|x . The other comparison methods yield posteriors that are incorrect or very slow to converge. In (b) we halve the variance of our false prior, which hurts performance of the comparison methods, but leaves prior swapping unchanged. In (c) we show 1-d density marginals as we increase the prior sparsity, and in (d) we show prior swapping results for different sparsity priors.\nIn Fig. 3, we show results for hierarchical logistic regression. In (a) and (b) we vary the number of observations (n=10-120,000) and see that prior swapping has a constant wall time while the wall times of both MCMC and VI increase with n. In (b) we see that the prior swapping methods achieve the same test error as the standard inference methods. In (c) and (d) we vary the number of dimensions (d=1-40). In this case, all methods have increasing wall time, and again the test errors match. In (e), (f), and (g), we vary the prior hyperparameter (γ=1-1.05). For prior swapping, we infer a single fφ|x (using γ= 1.025) with both MCMC and VI, and compute all other hyperparameter results using this fφ|x . This demonstrates that prior swapping can quickly infer correct results over a range of hyperparameters. Here, the asymptotically-exact semiparametric prior swapping method matches the test error of MCMC slightly better than the parametric method."

      "text" : "Many latent variable models in machine learning—such as mixture models, topic models, probabilistic matrix factorization, and various others—involve a set of latent factors (e.g. components or topics). Often, we’d like to use priors that encourage interesting behaviors among the factors. For example, we might want dissimilar factors via a diversity-promoting prior [63, 24, 62] or for the factors to show some sort of sparsity pattern [28, 23, 64]. Inference in such models is often computationally expensive or designed on a case-by-case basis [63, 23, 64].\nHowever, when conjugate priors are placed over the factor parameters, collapsed Gibbs sampling can be applied. In this method, the factor parameters are integrated out, leaving only a subset of variables; on these, the conditional distributions can be computed analytically, which allows for Gibbs sampling over these variables. Afterwards, samples of the collapsed factor parameters can be computed.\nHence, we propose the following strategy: first, assign a prior for the factor parameters that allows for collapsed Gibbs sampling; afterwards, reconstruct the factor samples and apply prior swapping for more complex relational priors over the factors. We can thus perform convenient inference in the collapsed model, yet apply more-sophisticated priors to variables in the uncollapsed model.\nWe first show results on a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) [27, 51], written x i ∼N (µzi ,Σzi ), zi ∼ Dir(α), {µm}Mm=1 ∼ fθ , i = 1,...,n. Using a normal fφ over {µm} M m=1 allows for collapsed Gibbs sampling. We also show results on a topic model (latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) [3]) for text data (for the form of this model, see [3, 55]). Here, using a Dirichlet fφ over topics allows for collapsed Gibbs sampling. For mixture models, we generate synthetic data from the above model (n=10,000, d=2, M=9), and for topic models, we use the Simple English Wikipedia∗ corpus (n=27,443 documents, vocab=10,192 words) [36], and set M=400 topics.\nIn Fig. 4 we show results for mixture and topic models. In (a) we show inferred posteriors over GMM components for a number of relational priors, which we define in (b). In (c), we apply the diversity-promoting prior to LDA, to separate redundant topics. Here, we show two topic-clusters (“geography” and “family”) in fφ|x , which are separated into thematically-similar yet distinct topics after prior swapping.

Since the prior swap function can be used as an objective for optimization to a MAP estimate, we aim to use prior swapping for quick hyperparameter tuning of weight decay in neural networks. We will compare this to finding the optimal weight decay via stochastic gradient descent [4] and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics [59], two popular methods for learning and inference in neural networks. These stochastic gradient methods have only a weak dependence on data at each iteration; however, their updates may be noisy or suboptimal [22, 57, 44, 11], while prior swapping updates involve exact gradients (of the prior swap function) without any stochasticity. Furthermore, note that we can use stochastic gradient inference methods in conjunction with prior swapping (i.e. to compute fφ|x , which we will do here).\nWe run our experiment on an eight-layer fully connected deep neural network with 400 nodes per layer, yielding a model with 1,280,410 dimensions. For data, we use the MNIST† handwritten digits classification dataset (n=60,000, d=784) [25].

For prior swapping, we perform gradient ascent optimization using the gradient log prior swap function (Eq. 4).

For any fps ∈ P(2, L), we can write the bias as\nE h\nf̂ s eps\ni\n− f eps = E f̂ sφ|x fθ fφ − fφ|x fθ fφ\n= fθ fφ E h f̂ sφ|x i − fφ|x\n= c̃ E h f̂ sφ|x i − fφ|x\n≤ ch2\nfor some c > 0, where we have used the fact that E h\nf̂ s φ|x\ni\n− fφ|x ≤ c̃h2 for some c̃ > 0 (given in [18, 58]).\nWe next bound the variance of our semiparametric prior swap estimator. For any fps ∈ P(2, L), we can write the variance of our estimator as\nVar h\nf̂ s eps\ni\n= Var f̂ sφ|x fθ fφ = f 2θ f 2 φ Var h f̂ sφ|x i ≤ c\nThd\nfor some c > 0, where we have used the facts that Var h\nf̂ s φ|x\ni\n≤ c Thd\nfor some c > 0 and E h\nf̂ s φ|x\ni2 ≤ c̃\nfor some c̃ > 0 (given in [18, 58]). Next, we will use these two results to bound the mean-squared error of our semiparametric prior swap estimator, which shows that it is mean-square consistent. We can write the mean-squared error as the sum of the variance and the bias-squared, and therefore,\nE ∫\nf̂ s eps(θ)− f eps(θ)\n2 dθ ≤ c1h2 + c2\nThd\n= c\nT 4/(4+d)\nfor some c > 0, using the fact that h T−1/(4+d).\nTheorem 2.2. The procedure given in Alg. 1 generates samples from f̂ sps (Eq. 6) as T →∞.\nProof. In Alg. 1, note that line 2 is equivalent to standard MCMC (such as Metropolis-Hastings or Hamiltonian Monte Carlo) run on a posterior target function proportional to f̂ p\neps, and thus yields\nsamples from f̂ pps as T →∞ (see [8, 2, 34] for MCMC guarantees).\nIn line 3, we can sample from 1 T ∑T t=1 f̂ p φ|x( eθt)−1K ‖θ−eθt‖ h exactly via the following procedure:\nFor each sample s,\n1. Draw an index i ∈ {1, . . . , T}: i ∼ Cat n f̂ p φ|x( eθt)−1 oT\nt=1\n.\n2. Draw the sample θs: θs ∼ K ‖θ−eθi‖ h .\nWe thus have two streams of asymptotically-exact samples, which is exactly the setting of the product density sample combination procedures [48, 37, 42], which run on the output of MCMC algorithms to generate asymptotically-exact samples from the distribution with PDF proportional to the product of the PDFs of the Markov chains’ stationary distributions (see [37], Sec. 5). We give pseudocode for these sample combination procedures in the “Sample Combination Algorithm Pseudocode” section of the appendix. Therefore, as T → ∞, line 4 of Alg. 1 yields samples from f̂ sps ∝ h f̂ pps i 1 T ∑T t=1 f̂ p φ|x( eθt)−1K ‖θ−eθt‖ h ."

Assume that we have run an existing inference algorithm to compute either a fixed-complexity analytic expression for the false-posterior density, or to draw T false-posterior samples, given some dataset of n observations. Suppose that we wish to compute S samples from the true-posterior.\nGiven a fixed-complexity analytic expression for the false-posterior, each step (i.e. generating each sample) in an MCMC algorithm requires a constant O(1) number of operations, and drawing S samples via our procedure therefore requires O(S) operations.\nGiven T samples from the false-posterior, the asymptotically-exact (semiparametric) procedure in Alg. 1 must perform the fixed-complexity prior swapping procedure on a parametric false posterior fφ|x (O(S) operations for S samples), draw S samples from the correction density (O(T) operations to compute component weights and O(S) operations to draw S samples, for a total complexity of O(S+ T )), then apply a density product sample combination algorithm [48, 37, 42] (O(S) operations for S samples). Therefore, the asymptotically-exact (semiparametric) procedure has a total complexity of O(S+ T ) to draw S samples.\nIn general, given the false-posterior inference result, none of the prior swapping algorithms depend on the number of data points n."

Often, instead of (or in addition to) an analytic expression for our prior beliefs, we have prior observations, such as previously observed outcomes of what we aim to infer. Incorporating information such as this can lead to better data-driven priors. Here, we will extend our asymptotically-exact prior swapping procedure to this setting.\nSuppose that we only have access to samples {eθ 1t } T t=1 from the true-prior fθ , in addition to falseposterior samples {eθ 2t } T t=1 from fφ|x . In this case, we can apply a density product sample combination algorithm [48, 37, 42] (described in the “Sample Combination Algorithm Pseudocode” section of the appendix) to generate samples {eθt}Tt=1 from fpsnum ∝ fφ|x fθ , and then construct a semiparametric estimate [18] of this density (the same one used in defining the asympotically-exact prior swapping method), written\nf̂ spsnum(θ) = 1\nT\nT ∑\nt=1\n1 hd K ‖θ−eθt‖ h f̂ ppsnum(θ)\nf̂ ppsnum(eθt) .

As in the asymptotically-exact prior swapping procedure,\nf̂ o eps is proportional to the product of two densities, both of which we can easily sample from (note that we can sample from f̂ ppsnum/ fφ using the fixed-complexity parametric prior swapping method). As before, we then apply the density product sample combination methods to generate samples from f̂ ops.

In this paper, we investigate the following question: for a given model, is it possible to use any convenient prior to infer a false posterior, and afterwards, given some true prior of interest, quickly transform this result into the true posterior? We present a procedure to carry out this task: given an inferred false posterior and true prior, our algorithm generates samples from the true posterior. This transformation procedure, which we call “prior swapping” works for arbitrary priors. Notably, its cost is independent of data size. It therefore allows us, in some cases, to apply significantly less-costly inference procedures to more-sophisticated models than previously possible. It also lets us quickly perform any additional inferences, such as with updated priors or for many different hyperparameter settings, without touching the data. We prove that our method can generate asymptotically exact samples, and demonstrate it empirically on a number of models and priors.",
