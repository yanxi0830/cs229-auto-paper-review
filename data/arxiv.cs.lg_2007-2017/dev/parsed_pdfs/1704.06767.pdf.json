      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Multiple instance learning (MIL) [8] is a learning problem with bags and instances. Instances are the same as the traditional feature vectors, while bags are sets of instances. The numbers of instances in bags vary among the bags. Bag labels are defined as follows:\n• If a given bag contains at least one positive instance, then its label is positive. • If a given bag contains no positive instances, then its label is negative.\nThis is the basic setup of MIL. The goal of MIL is to predict labels of test bags. Here instance labels are unavailable, which makes MIL more difficult than the ordinary classification setting. MIL is applicable to a wide range of real-world problems such as molecule behavior prediction [3,15], drug activity prediction [8], domain theory [7], content-based image retrieval [17,13,25], visual tracking [2], object detection [18,12], text categorization [1] and medical diagnosis [9,22].\nA lot of approaches for MIL have been developed [8,16,26,1,11,23], which are classified into two groups in general: (1) The methods in the first group are based on generative modeling, including\n2 the diverse density [16] and its extension, the expectation-maximization diverse density (EM-DD) [26]. These methods find out an instance close to training positive bags and far from training negative bags, which is referred to as the concept point. This process is carried out by gradient-based search from every training instance, which is computationally inefficient. (2) The methods in the second group are based on discriminative modeling. The multiple-instance support vector machine (MI-SVM) [1] is an approach based on SVMs. Empirical evaluation shows that MI-SVM performs well on MIL datasets, but its optimization problem is non-convex and computationally inefficient. The key-instance support vector machine (KI-SVM) [14] converts MI-SVM into a convex problem by using a discrete vector, but it is still difficult to optimize due to a large number of optimization variables. Gärtner et al. [11] introduced set kernels (a.k.a. multiple instance kernels), which are extensions of the standard kernel functions to MIL. The set kernels can be used to construct a standard SVM classifier, which performs well on MIL datasets. The optimization problem in this training procedure is convex and the global solution can be obtained efficiently.\nIn this work, we propose a novel method to construct the multiple instance classifiers only from positive and unlabeled bags, while the above standard approaches to MIL assume that training bags are fully labeled. This problem is called PU-MIL. For example, PU-MIL is considered to be applicable to the following situations:\n• The situation where it is difficult to obtain an enough amount of labeled data due to the significant labeling cost, such as outlier detection. In outlier detection based on supervised classification, it is often difficult to label all outlier samples, so we can label a few outlier samples as positive and regard the other samples as unlabeled. • The situation where the true negative labels are essentially unavailable, such as music album recommendation, where we try to predict a music album that attracts a consumer from their purchase history. Each album contains some songs, which can be regarded as multiple instances. Whether the album is attracting the consumer or not corresponds to positive and negative, but only whether the consumer bought (positive) or not (unlabeled) is available4.\nOur contribution in this paper is to propose a novel PU-MIL method based on the risk minimization framework [20]. Together with a linear-in-parameter model, the proposed method is formulated as a convex optimization problem, and the global optimal solution can be computed efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convex PU-MIL method (see Table 1). Through experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method combined with the minimax kernel [1] compares favorably with an existing method.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we review existing methods for PU learning [19,20] and MIL [11], on which our proposed method\n4 The fact that the consumer did not buy an album does not directly mean that the album is not attracting (negative). The consumer might not buy just because he or she did not notice it.\n3\nis based. In Sect. 3, we explain the formulation and optimization algorithm of our proposed method, called the positive and unlabeled set kernel classifier (PUSKC). In Sect. 4, we experimentally compare the proposed method (PU-SKC) with the existing method (puMIL) [24]. Finally, we conclude this work in Sect. 5."

These kernels map bags (sets of instances) to feature spaces.\nA type of the set kernels called the statistic kernel k̃ is defined as follows:\nk̃(X,X ′) := k(s(X), s(X ′)),\nwhere k is an arbitrary kernel function such as the Gaussian kernel, and s is called the statistics. For example, the following minimax statistics is a typical choice:\nsmin-max(X) := [ min x∈X x(1), . . . , min x∈X x(d), max x∈X x(1), . . . , max x∈X x(d) ]⊤ , (4)\nwhere x(i) is the i-th element of an instance x in the bag X . Gärtner et al. [11] showed that the statistic kernel with the minimax statistics (4) for s and the polynomial kernel for k outperforms other set kernels in the standard MIL:\nk̃min-max(X,X ′) := (smin-max(X) ⊤smin-max(X ′) + 1)ρ, (5)\nwhere ρ is a positive integer.

Our objective is to construct a binary classifier (1) only from positive samples and unlabeled samples.\n6 Learning Instance-Level Classifiers From Positive and Unlabeled Data du Plessis et al. [19,20] proposed methods based on the empirical risk minimization framework to learn only from positive and unlabeled samples. In the ordinary binary classification setting, the Bayes optimal classifier g∗ minimizes the following misclassification rate:\nR0-1(g) = πEP [ℓ0-1(g(x))] + (1 − π)EN [ℓ0-1(−g(x))] , (8)\nwhere EP [·] and EN [·] denote the expectations over p+(x) and p−(x) respectively and ℓ0-1 denotes the zero-one loss:\nℓ0-1(z) =\n{ 0 if z ≥ 0,\n1 otherwise.\nIn practice, the misclassification rate (8) is difficult to optimize since the subgradient of ℓ0-1 is always 0 except at z = 0. For this reason, we usually use a surrogate loss function6. Then the risk function R with the surrogate loss function ℓ is written as\nR(g) := πEP [ℓ(g(x))] + (1 − π)EN [ℓ(−g(x))] . (9)\nSince negative samples are not available in the PU learning setup, let us consider expressing the risk (9) without EN [·]. By the definition of the unlabeled sample distribution (7), the following holds:\n(1 − π)EN [ℓ(−g(x))] = EU [ℓ(−g(x))]− πEP [ℓ(−g(x))] .\nSubstituting this into the risk (9), we obtain\nR(g) = πEP [ℓ(g(x))− ℓ(−g(x))] + EU [ℓ(−g(x))] . (10)\nIf the surrogate loss function ℓ satisfies\nℓ(z)− ℓ(−z) = −z, (11)\nthe risk (10) can be written as\nR(g) = πEP [−g(x)] + EU [ℓ(−g(x))] . (12)\nThe risk (12) is convex if the surrogate loss function ℓ is convex. Convex loss functions such as the squared loss ℓS, the logistic loss ℓLL and the double hinge loss ℓDH satisfy condition (11):\nℓS(z) = 1\n4 (z − 1)2 −\n1 4 ,\nℓLL(z) = log(1 + exp(−z)),\nℓDH(z) = max\n( −z,max ( 0, 1− z\n2\n)) . (13)\nWe use the risk (12) to obtain a convex formulation of PU-MIL in Sect. 3.\n6 For example, the hinge loss ℓH(z) = max(−z, 0) and the ramp loss ℓRH(z) = 1\n2 max(0,min(2, 1− z)) are commonly used.\n7"

      "heading" : "B Multiple Instance Learning from Positive and Unlabeled Bags",
      "text" : "Wu et al. [24] proposed an instance-level method for the PU-MIL problem (called puMIL). As discussed in the previous work [1,14], the key instance (the most positive instance) in each bag is important in MIL. This is also the case in PUMIL, but the problem is that we cannot tell the labels of unlabeled bags. To address this issue, Wu et al. [24] introduced the bag confidence, which describes how much confident the given unlabeled bag is negative. Let νb ∈ [0, 1] be the confidence of the b-th bag. Then the learning problem of an SVM classifier g(X) = w⊤x̃ (x̃ ∈ X) under the given ν is formulated as\nmin w∈Rd,{x̃b} NP+NU b=1\n1 2 ||w||2 + C\nNP+NU∑\nb=1\nmax(0, 1− νbỸbw ⊤x̃b), (21)\nwhere Ỹb is the estimated bag label (Ỹb = +1 for a positive bag and Ỹb = −1 for a possibly negative bag coming from the set of unlabeled bags) and x̃b is the key instance in the bag Xb. νb weighs the contribution of x̃b according to its confidence. For positive bags, the confidence is simply set as νb = 1. The overall training method is summarized as follows:\n1. Initialize L distinct bag confidences ν(1), . . . ,ν(L), where L is the number of the bag confidences. 2. Extract NP possibly negative bags from unlabeled bags. 3. Make a positive margin pool (PMP), which consists of the key instances\nfrom positive bags and possibly negative bags. 4. Solve (21) with using the PMP to obtain an SVM classifier, which is evalu-\nated by the F-measure.\nIn Step 2, unlabeled bags with the highest confidences are extracted and regarded as possibly negative. Bag confidences are initialized randomly and updated via a genetic algorithm (see Step 4 and (23)).\n16\nIn Step 3, first the generative distribution of negative instances is estimated by a weighted kernel density estimator [10]:\np̂(x|y = −1) = 1\nÑN\nÑN∑\nb=1\n∑\nx′∈X̃N b\nk(x, νbx ′), (22)\nwhere ÑN is the number of all instances included in the extracted bags in Step 2 and k denotes a kernel function and X̃Nb is the b-th possibly negative bag. Using the estimator (22), we can obtain a PMP by extracting the key instances from bags:\nx̃b = arg min xb∈Xb p̂(xb|y = −1).\nAfter building the PMP, an SVM classifier can be obtained in Step 4. We evaluate the given bag confidences ν by calculating the F-measures9. Here we have L bag confidences, and we update them by a genetic algorithm. First, the bag confidence with the highest F-measure (denoted by ν̂) is cloned to replace the other confidences under the fixed rate c ∈ [0, 1]. This process, called the mutation, is caused by\nvl = νl + r(1 − fl)(ν̂ − νl), (23)\nwhere r is drawn from the standard normal distribution, νl is the l-th bag confidence and fl is the F-measure obtained from νl. νl is to be replaced for vl if vl produces a better result. We iterate Steps 2 – 4 until the best bag confidence ν̂ converges or the number of iterations reaches the predefined limit.\nAfter the above training steps, the best bag confidence ν̂ is to be obtained. We use ν̂ for the initial bag confidence and iterate Steps 2 – 4 again to obtain a classifier for test prediction10.\nHowever, the process to extract possibly negative bags from unlabeled bags based on the bag confidences (Step 2) is not shown to converge to the optimal solution in the previous work, while this method works well experimentally. In the following section, we use the PU risk minimization framework (12) to formulate PU-MIL.\n9 True bag labels are needed to calculate the F-measure, but those of unlabeled bags are unavailable. This point was not discussed in Wu et al. [24], so we assume that possibly negative bags have negative labels and the other bags in the unlabeled set have positive labels when we calculate the F-measure in our experiments. 10 In test prediction, test bag confidences are not defined. This point was also not discussed in Wu et al. [24], so we set all test bag confidences to 1 in our experiments."

MIL has a variety of applications such as content-based image retrieval, text categorization and medical diagnosis. Most of the previous work for MIL assume that the training bags are fully labeled. However, it is often difficult to obtain an enough number of labeled bags in practical situations, while many unlabeled bags are available. A learning framework called PU learning (positive and unlabeled learning) can address this problem. In this paper, we propose a convex PU learning method to solve an MIL problem. We experimentally show that the proposed method achieves better performance with significantly lower computational costs than an existing method for PU-MIL.",
