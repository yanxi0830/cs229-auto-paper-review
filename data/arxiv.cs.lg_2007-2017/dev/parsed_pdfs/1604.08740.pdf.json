Unlike all previous methods with provable guarantees, its learning rates are not monotonically decreasing over time, but instead are based on a novel aggregation technique. We provide two versions of MetaGrad. The first maintains a full covariance matrix to guarantee the sharpest bounds for problems where we can afford update time quadratic in the dimension. The second version maintains only the diagonal. Its linear cost in the dimension makes it suitable for large-scale problems.

      "text" : "Methods for online convex optimization (OCO) (Shalev-Shwartz, 2012; Hazan, 2015) make it possible to optimize parameters sequentially, by processing convex functions in a streaming fashion. This is important in time series prediction where the data are inherently online; but it may also be convenient to process offline data sets sequentially, for instance if the data do not all fit into memory at the same time or if parameters need to be updated quickly when extra data become available.\nThe simplest and most commonly used strategy for OCO is online gradient descent (GD) (Zinkevich, 2003), which updates parameters wt+1 = wt − η∇ft(wt) by taking a step in the direction of the negative gradient. For carefully tuned step size η, this guarantees that the regret over T rounds, which measures the difference in performance between the GD iterates wt and the best offline parameters u, is bounded by (Shalev-Shwartz, 2012)\nRuT :=\nT∑\nt=1\nft(wt)− T∑\nt=1\nft(u) ≤ O\n\n\n√ √ √ √ T∑\nt=1\n‖gt‖2   , (1)\nc© W.M. Koolen & T. van Erven.\nwhere gt := ∇ft(wt) is the gradient of the function processed in the t-th step of the algorithm. The difficulty of the optimization problem depends on the sequence of functions f1, f2, . . . If the functions are nicely smooth and all have their minimum at the same point u, we can expect GD to converge to wt → u, such that the encountered gradients gt → 0 vanish over time and hence by (1) the regret of GD plateaus. In most applications in machine learning, however, every function ft measures the loss on a different training example (Xt, Yt) and even though the average of all functions may have a clear minimum u, the noise in the data will prevent the individual gradients from going to zero even when the algorithm approaches u, and the guarantee (1) becomes of the worst-case order √ T .\nIf it is known a priori that the functions ft have sufficient curvature, the situation is dramatically better, and it is possible to achieve regret that scales as O(ln T ). For strongly convex functions this is achieved by GD with step size proportional to 1/t (Bartlett et al., 2007), while exp-concave functions require more sophisticated algorithms like Online Newton Step (Hazan et al., 2007).\nIn this paper we take a different approach to reducing regret, which does not depend on curvature of the functions. We introduce MetaGrad, a parameter-free algorithm that, up to a logarithmic factor, improves the regret bound (1) by replacing each gradient norm ‖gt‖ by the quantity\n|(u−wt)⊺gt| = ‖u−wt‖ ︸ ︷︷ ︸\ndistance\n∣ ∣ ∣ (u−wt)⊺ ‖u−wt‖ gt\n︸ ︷︷ ︸\ndirectional derivative\n∣ ∣ ∣, (2)\nwhich we interpret as a scale factor that measures the distance of the current parameters wt to the (unknown) offline best parameters u, times the directional derivative of the objective function ft in the direction of u. In this introduction, we assume for simplicity that u, wt and gt are all from the unit Euclidean ball. To compare the two bounds, let us first observe that the norm of the gradient ‖gt‖ is equal to the directional derivative in the most difficult direction:\n‖gt‖ = max u (u−wt)⊺ ‖u−wt‖ gt. (3)\nThus, MetaGrad can be seen to perform better for two reasons: first, if gt points us in a wrong direction that is very different from u − wt, then the directional derivative in (2) will be smaller than ‖gt‖. And second, most importantly, we gain a factor ‖u−wt‖ equal to the distance from wt to the optimum u. This means that the closer we get to u, the more the gradients are discounted, and consequently we can get an order of magnitude smaller regret even in cases where the gradients themselves do not vanish around u. We will give two examples where this happens in Section 1.1 below. We emphasize that MetaGrad needs no knowledge of the eventual global optimum u and will, in fact, guarantee a bound in terms of (2) compared to every point u of the domain.\nIn order to guarantee bounds with this refined dependence (2) on the data, MetaGrad maintains a covariance matrix of size d× d where d is the parameter dimension. In the remainder of the paper we call this version full MetaGrad. We also design and analyze a faster approximation that only maintains the d diagonal elements called diagonal MetaGrad. We show in Theorem 8 below that\nTheorem 1 The regret of both full and diagonal MetaGrad is bounded by\nRuT ≤ O (√ V uT d lnT )\nfor each u with ‖u‖ ≤ 1, (4)\nwhere V uT denotes either\nT∑\nt=1\n((u−wt)⊺gt)2 (full MetaGrad) or T∑\nt=1\nd∑\ni=1\n(ui −wt,i)2g2t,i (diagonal MetaGrad).\nThe crucial improvement over the GD bound (1) is that (4) replaces ∑T\nt=1‖gs‖2 by V uT (for both the full and diagonal version the latter is bounded in terms of the former by the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality). We see that this new adaptivity to the data may come at a cost of a factor √ d ln T . The presence of this factor now leaves open a regime where (1) is better than (4), namely when V uT is close to its bound\n∑T t=1‖gt‖2. However, MetaGrad is always guaranteed to get the best of both,\nbecause in Theorem 8 we prove separately that its regret stays within a factor of the standard GD bound (1) as well. We now discuss two examples where our new type of adaptivity is key."

      "text" : "We illustrate the benefits of our new algorithm with two simple (yet representative) examples where our adaptive bound (4) implies fundamentally faster rates, namely O(d ln T ) instead of O( √ T ) regret. In the first example, we consider offline convex optimization of a fixed function. In the second case we look at stochastic optimization with convex functions that measure the loss on stochastic outcomes that are independently, identically distributed (IID). Figure 1 graphs the results. As our baseline we have included GD with three choices of learning rates. We also include AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011), which is a state-of-the-art adaptive OCO method that is commonly used in practice (Mikolov et al., 2013; Schmidhuber, 2015).\nBoth our examples are one-dimensional (so the full and diagonal algorithms coincide), and have a stable optimum (that good algorithms will converge to); yet the functions are based on absolute values, which are neither strongly convex nor smooth so the gradient norms do not vanish near the optimum. We see that in both cases the performance of AdaGrad is close to its O( √ T ) bound, while our new algorithm MetaGrad achieves a O(d ln T ) rate. We emphasize that MetaGrad has no parameters that we tuned specifically to achieve this.\nFixed function For our first example we consider a fixed convex function ft ≡ f . We chose the 1-dimensional absolute value function f(x) = |x− 14 |, offset by 14 instead of 0 so that the algorithms cannot exploit starting at the optimum. Now the gradients gt ∈ {±1} square to unity (none of the methods queries the non-differentiable point at 1/4), and hence sum to\n∑T t=1 g 2 t = T . So AdaGrad\n(which due to its adaptive tuning guarantees the GD bound (1)) will give us a √ T regret bound. We\nsee in Figure 1 that the actual regret is also of order √ T .\nNow for MetaGrad the situation is starkly different. We proceed to prove this, not just for the absolute value, but for any fixed convex function f .\nTheorem 2 A method with regret bound (4, full version) incurs regret O(d ln T ) on fixed ft = f with bounded domain and gradient.\nProof Let u∗ = argminu f(u) be the offline minimiser. Then (wt − u∗)⊺gt ∈ [0, 4]. The upper bound holds for all wt, u∗ and gt in the Euclidean ball. But the lower bound holds, by convexity of f , only for the optimizer u∗. It implies (here we use the full version of V u ∗\nT ) that\nV u ∗\nT =\nT∑\nt=1\n((u∗ −wt)⊺gt)2 ≤ 4 T∑\nt=1\n(wt − u∗)⊺gt.\nNow using the fact that our regret bound (4) also bounds the right-hand side above (which we recognize as the standard “gradient trick” regret upper bound), we find V u ∗\nT ≤ O (√ V uT d ln T )\nso that √\nV u ∗ T ≤ O (√ d ln T ) and hence Ru ∗ T ≤ O (d ln T ) .\nPreviously, such fast O(d lnT ) rates have only been obtained for functions with significant curvature, which are either strongly convex or at least exp-concave (Hazan et al., 2007). Here we obtain O(d ln T ) regret for any fixed convex function, even if it has no curvature at all.\nAt first sight this may appear to contradict the lower bound of order 1/ √ T for convergence of the iterates by Nesterov (2004) (see also Tibshirani (2014)), which implies a lower bound of order√ T on the regret. Yet there is no contradiction, as Nesterov’s example requires large dimension\nd ≥ T , in which case O(d ln T ) is vacuous. MetaGrad still gets the √ T rate, however, as can be seen because the GD bound (1) applies to MetaGrad as well.\nStochastic function In the second case we consider the popular extension to stochastic optimization. Staying with the absolute value function, we take ft(u) = |u − xt| where the outcomes xt = ±12 are now chosen IID with probabilities 0.4 and 0.6. (These values are by no means essential, it is important however to avoid the worst case where the probabilities are equal.) It can be shown (by a variation of the fixed function argument that holds in expectation, proof omitted)\nAlgorithm 1: Protocol of Online Convex Optimization from First-order Information Input: Convex set U\n1: for t = 1, 2, . . . do 2: Learner plays wt ∈ U 3: Environment reveals convex loss function ft : U → R 4: Learner incurs loss ft(wt) and observes (sub)gradient gt = ∇ft(wt) 5: end for\nthat in a broad class of stochastic optimization problems the expected regret is O(d ln T ) like in the fixed function case."

      "text" : "Other methods that adapt in various ways to the data have been developed in the literature. Among these, AdaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011) is an important extension of gradient descent that improves practical performance in training large neural networks (Mikolov et al., 2013; Schmidhuber, 2015). The crux of AdaGrad (and similar methods developed independently by McMahan and Streeter (2010)) is their adaptive online tuning of the learning rate. As briefly mentioned in the examples above, in one dimension AdaGrad guarantees the optimally tuned GD bound (1). In higher dimensions gradient energy may vary wildly between dimensions (e.g. due to rarely occurring but informative features). AdaGrad capitalizes on this by learning a separate learning rate per dimension (diagonal version) or even a positive definite learning rate matrix (full version) to find the optimal basis.\nAnother notion of adaptivity is explored by Hazan and Kale (2010) and Chiang et al. (2012), who obtain tighter bounds for (linear) functions ft that vary little between rounds (as measured by either deviation from the mean or by successive differences). Such bounds imply fast rates for optimizing a fixed function (first example above), but give slow O( √ T ) rates for stochastic optimization (second example above). A downside of AdaGrad and the other methods discussed above, is that they use monotonically decreasing learning rates. Methods that do this may suffer when the initial gradients are much larger than subsequent ones, because they can never recover from decreasing the learning rate too much in the first few rounds (Senior et al., 2013; Zeiler, 2012). Such monotonic tunings are avoided by Squint and iProd, which are adaptive methods developed for the expert setting (Koolen and Van Erven, 2015) that provide bounds in terms of the squared excess loss. If we disregard computational efficiency, then applying Squint to the continuously many experts in the unit ball shows that regret guarantees like (4) are possible in principle. In fact, our main contribution can be seen as an efficient implementation of the continuous extension of Squint."

(If ft is\nnot differentiable at wt, we do not make any assumptions about the choice of subgradient gt ∈ ∂ft(wt).)

(7) Our surrogate loss consists of a linear and a quadratic part. In the language of Steinhardt and Liang (2014), the quadratic part causes an “adaptive regularizer” and Duchi et al. (2011) call it “temporal adaptation of the proximal function”, but in our approach it is more convenient to treat the two parts of the surrogate loss together, without moving the quadratic part into the regularizer. The sum of quadratic terms in our surrogate is what appears in the regret bound of Theorem 1."

      "text" : "The MetaGrad algorithm is a two-level hierarchical construction, displayed as Algorithms 2 (main algorithm that learns the learning rate) and 3 (sub-module for individual learning rates). We call it MetaGrad because the key idea is the aggregation of “multiple η”, i.e. the predictions of gradientbased learners parametrised by the learning rate η.\nMaster The task of the Master Algorithm 2 is to learn the best learning rate η (parameter of the surrogate loss ℓηt ). The (approximately) best learning rate is notoriously difficult to track online because the regret is non-monotonic over rounds and may have several local minima as a function of η (see Koolen et al. (2014) for a study in the expert setting). Our approach, inspired by the approach for combinatorial games in (Koolen and Van Erven, 2015, Section 4), is to have our master aggregate the predictions of a discrete grid of learning rates. The master is in fact a variant of the exponential weights method (line 5) with the standard gradient trick (line 4), yet with a modified aggregation rule (line 3) that tilts the weights of the slaves by their learning rates, having the effect of giving a larger weight to larger η.\nAlgorithm 2: MetaGrad Master\nInput: Grid of learning rates 15DG ≥ η1 ≥ η2 ≥ . . . with prior weights π η1 1 , π η2 1 , . . . ⊲ As in (9)\n1: for t = 1, 2, . . . do 2: Get prediction wηt ∈ U of slave (Algorithm 3) for each η 3: Play wt = ∑ η π η t ηw η t∑\nη π η t η ∈ U ⊲ Tilted Exponentially Weighted Average 4: Observe gradient gt = ∇ft(wt) 5: Update πηt+1 = π η t e −αℓ η t (w η t )\n∑ η π η t e −αℓ η t (w η t )\nfor all η ⊲ Exponential Weights with surrogate loss (7)\n6: end for\nAlgorithm 3: MetaGrad Slave\nInput: Learning rate 0 < η ≤ 15DG , domain size D > 0. 1: w\nη 1 = 0 and Σ η 1 = D 2I\n2: for t = 1, 2, . . . do 3: Issue wηt to master (Algorithm 2) 4: Observe gradient gt = ∇ft(wt) ⊲ Gradient at master point wt 5: Update Σηt+1 = ( 1 D2 I + 2η2 ∑t s=1Ms )−1\n• For Mt = M fullt use rank-one update Σηt+1 = Σηt − 2η2 Σ\nη t gtg ⊺ t Σ η t 1+g⊺t Σ η t gt\n• For Mt = M diagt only maintain diagonal\n6: Update wηt+1 = Π Σ\nη t+1 U ( w η t − ηΣηt+1gt )\n• For Mt = M fullt use Σηt+1gt = Σ\nη t gt\n1+2η2g⊺t Σ η t gt\n7: end for\nGrid Our analysis below indicates that we may exponentially space the learning rates from 1 down to 1√\nT , where T is the number of prediction rounds. So for T = 109 rounds we would\nneed 15 slaves. This seems computationally quite affordable, especially since the slaves operate completely independently and can hence be executed in parallel.\nSlaves The role of the Slave Algorithm 3 is to guarantee small surrogate regret for a fixed learning rate η. One way to obtain the Slave algorithm, as we will explain and use in Theorem 6 below, is as an instance of exponential weights with Gaussian prior, quadratic losses and Kullback-Leibler projections. The Slave algorithm is very similar to what would result from applying Online Newton Step (ONS) by Hazan et al. (2007) to our surrogate loss ℓηt (u), which we will prove to be expconcave. The only difference is that the ONS algorithm (and analysis) make use of a quadratic lower bound on the loss that follows from the exp-concavity assumption. Our surrogate losses are quadratic by construction, and MetaGrad slaves uses them exactly. Intuitively, even though our bounds do not quantify the improvement, employing the actual Hessian will give a little epsilon boost in performance in practice.\nWe also remark that the combined algorithm is a bona fide first-order algorithm that only accesses ft through ∇ft(wt). In particular, the Slaves do not see their “own” gradients (i.e. ∇ft(wηt )), but all receive the gradient at the master point.\nWe consider two versions of the Slave algorithm, corresponding to whether we take rank-one or diagonal matrices Mt (see (6)) in the surrogate (7). The first version maintains a full d × d covariance matrix and has the best regret bound. The second version uses only diagonal matrices (with d non-zero entries), thus trading off a mildly weaker bound with a better run-time in high dimensions. We expect the second version to be especially relevant in practice.\nWe finally note that we have chosen the Mirror Descent version that iteratively updates and projects (see line 6). One might alternatively consider the Lazy Projection version (as in Zinkevich (2004); Nesterov (2009); Xiao (2010)) that forgets past projections when updating on new data. Since projections are typically computationally expensive, we have opted for the Mirror Descent version, which we expect to project less often.\nRun time The run-time is dominated by the O(lnT ) slaves. Ignoring the projection, a slave with full covariance matrix takes O(d2) time to update, while slaves with diagonal covariance matrix take O(d) time. This makes the overall computational effort as follows:\ntime per round:\n{\nO(d2 lnT ) full version O(d ln T ) diagonal version memory:\n{\nO(d2 lnT ) full version O(d ln T ) diagonal version .\nOn top of that each slave may incur the cost of a projection, which depends on the shape of the domain U . To get a sense for the projection cost we consider a typical example. For the Euclidean ball a diagonal projection can be performed using a few iterations of Newton’s method to get the desired precision. Each such iteration costs O(d) time. This is generally considered affordable. For full projections the story is starkly different. We typically reduce to the diagonal case by a basis transformation, which takes O(d3) to compute using SVD. Hence here the projection dwarfs the other run time by an order of magnitude. We refer to Duchi et al. (2011) for examples of how to compute projections for various domains U . Finally, we remark that a potential speed-up is possible by running the slaves in parallel."

Even though the learning rate is “just a single parameter”, it governs a fundamental trade off between exploiting signal and stabilizing parameter estimates through regularization.\nTaking stock of online convex optimization, we find that all techniques for tuning the learning rate with provable regret bounds essentially amount to the following approach: monotonically decrease the learning rate over time to minimize some upper bound on the regret. This approach has two fundamental limitations. First, the monotonicity constraint prevents the algorithm from ever recovering if some hard initial data cause the learning rate to go down (Senior et al., 2013). And secondly, any slack in the bound (which often is significant since bounds must cover the hard instances along with the easy ones) will be hard-coded in the algorithm, making it overly conservative.\nWith MetaGrad, we introduce a fundamentally different technique for tuning the learning rate. By keeping track of multiple learning rates with tilted exponential weights, we have the data inform us about the best learning rate without invoking any bounds, and avoid monotonicity constraints altogether.\nOur methods lead to a new form of adaptive bound (Theorem 8), which cannot be achieved with any prior methods for tuning the learning rate. This bound expresses that in stable problem instances the MetaGrad algorithm will “accelerate” due to a virtuous feedback cycle (see e.g. Theorem 2). Namely, if the algorithm works well in the sense that its parameter estimates converge to the optimum u sufficiently fast, then the regret bound expresses that the algorithm converges even faster."

      "text" : "Given T IID samples from a distribution P , the standard technique of online-to-batch conversion can be used to turn MetaGrad into a method with small excess risk of at most E[RuT ]/T relative to\nthe best parameters u for P by averaging the parameters: w̄T = 1T ∑T\nt=1wt (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2004). However, when the regret RuT is of order O(d lnT ), the achievable excess risk is typically of order O(d/T ), so standard online-to-batch conversion will be suboptimal. This happens because parameter estimates in the first rounds are much worse than those in the later rounds, and can be fixed by averaging only the later parameters (Rakhlin et al., 2012; Shamir and Zhang, 2013) or by dividing the data into exponentially increasing epochs and using the average of the parameters over the previous epoch as a starting point for the next (Hazan and Kale, 2014)."

      "text" : "One may consider extending MetaGrad in various directions. In particular it would be interesting to integrate composite losses (Duchi et al., 2010; Xiao, 2009) and optimistic gradient estimates (Chiang et al., 2012; Rakhlin and Sridharan, 2013). We would further like to know whether it is possible to learn a learning rate vector (one rate per dimension), or a positive definite learning rate matrix (one rate per direction) like Duchi et al. (2011). We have tried this ourselves, but are stuck at the construction of the master. In contrast with a single learning rate, there is no obvious way to guarantee that the aggregate of slave predictions (which are all in U ) is itself in U , because the tilted average in the master leads to a non-convex constraint. A second problem would be computational efficiency, which gets out of hand when a grid of discretized learning rate vectors needs to be considered every round.\nOne way to address this efficiency problem would be to run an independent one-dimensional MetaGrad learner for each dimension separately. One would need to take care of the projections, which do tie the dimensions together. However, if we are running on the box U = [−1, 1]d, the problem factorizes, and d independent MetaGrads, one per dimension, would be able to tune a separate learning rate independently per dimension. If we are not too picky about the shape of the parameter domain U , this may actually be a very promising way to use MetaGrad."

Proof of Lemma 4\nProof We have two cases. First, for Mt = M fullt , the left-hand side is exp-concave in w η t by Lemma 3, and hence bounded by its tangent at wηt = wt, which is the right-hand side. Then for Mt = M diag t = diag(g 2 t,1, . . . , g 2 t,d) (recalling that now α = 1/d), we have\ne−αℓ η t (w η t ) = e ∑ i 1 d(η(wt,i−w η t,i)gt,i−η2(wt,i−w η t,i) 2g2t,i)\nJensen ≤ ∑\ni\n1 d e(η(wt,i−w η t,i)gt,i−η2(wt,i−w η t,i) 2g2t,i)\nexp-concavity ≤ ∑\ni\n1\nd\n( 1 + η(wt,i − wηt,i)gt,i )\n= 1 + αη(wηt −wt)⊺gt,\nwhere the exp-concavity inequality is the result for the full case applied in 1 dimension.\nA.3. Gaussian Exp-Concavity\nLemma 3 establishes exp-concavity of the surrogate losses ℓηt (u) for u ∈ U . We now argue that this property somewhat extends outside of U for Gaussian distributions with mean in U . This does not follow from exp-concavity alone (which holds for u ∈ U ) since Gaussian distributions are supported on all of Rd.\nLemma 9 (Gaussian exp-concavity) Let 0 < η ≤ 15DG . Consider a Gaussian distribution with mean µ ∈ U and arbitrary covariance Σ ≻ 0 in the full case or diagonal Σ ≻ 0 in the diagonal case. Then\nE u∼N (µ,Σ)\n[\ne−ℓ η t (u)\n]\n≤ e−ℓηt (µ)\nProof We first consider the full case. Abbreviating r := (wt − µ)⊺gt and s := (µ − u)⊺gt, from the definition (7) of ℓηt we get\nℓηt (µ) − ℓηt (u) = η(µ− u)⊺gt − η2 (2(µ−wt)⊺gtg⊺t (µ− u) + (µ− u)⊺gtg⊺t (µ− u)) = ηs− η2 ( 2rs+ s2 ) .\nSince u ∼ N (µ,Σ) implies s ∼ N (0, v) with v = g⊺tΣgt, the claim collapses to\n1 ≥ E u∼N (µ,Σ)\n[\neℓ η t (µ)−ℓ η t (u)\n]\n= E s∼N (0,v)\n[\neηs−η 2(2rs+s2)\n]\n= e\nη2v(1−2ηr)2\n2(1+2η2v)\n√ 1 + 2η2v ,\nwhich is equivalent to\n(1− 2ηr)2η2v ≤ ( 1 + 2η2v ) ln ( 1 + 2η2v ) .\nThe left-hand side is maximized over r ∈ [−DfullGfull,DfullGfull] at r = −DfullGfull. So it suffices to establish\nv(1 + 2ηDfullGfull)2η2 ≤ ( 1 + 2η2v ) ln ( 1 + 2η2v ) .\nNow the right-hand is convex in v and hence bounded below by its tangent at v = 0, which is 2η2v. The proof is completed by observing that (1 + 2ηDfullGfull)2 ≤ 2 by the assumed bound on η.\nIt remains to consider the diagonal case. There the surrogate loss (7) is a sum over dimensions, say ℓηt (u) = ∑d i=1 ℓ η t,i(ui). For a Gaussian with diagonal covariance matrix Σ the coordinates of u are independent, and hence\nE u∼N (µ,Σ)\n[\ne−ℓ η t (u)\n] = d∏\ni=1\nE ui∼N (µi,Σi,i)\n[\ne−ℓ η t,i(ui)\n] ≤ d∏\ni=1\ne−ℓ η t,i(µi) = e−ℓ η t (µ),\nwhere the inequality is the result for the full case applied to each dimension separately."

      "heading" : "Appendix B. Slave Regret Bound (Proof of Lemma 6)",
      "text" : "Proof For any distributions P and Q on Rd, let KL(P‖Q) = EP [ln dPdQ ] denote the KullbackLeibler divergence of P from Q, and let µP = EP [u] denote the mean of P . In addition, let N (µ,Σ) denote a normal distribution with mean µ and covariance matrix Σ.\nIn round t, we play according to the mean of a multivariate Gaussian distribution Pt. In the first round, this is a normal distribution, which plays the role of a prior:\nP1 = N (0,D2I).\nThen we update using the exponential weights update, followed by a projection onto P = {P : µP ∈ U}, such that the mean stays in the allowed domain U :\ndP̃t+1(u) = e−ℓ η t (u) dPt(u) ∫\nRd e−ℓ η t (u ′) dPt(u′) , Pt+1 = ΠP(P̃t).\nTo see that Algorithm 3 implements this algorithm, we prove by induction that\nPt = N (wηt ,Σηt ).\nFor t = 1 this is clear, and if it holds for any t then it can be verified by comparing densities that P̃t+1 = N (wηt −ηΣηt+1gt,Σηt+1). Since it is well-known that the projection of a Gaussian N (µ,Σ) onto P is another Gaussian N (ν,Σ) with the same covariance matrix and mean ν ∈ U that minimizes 12(ν − µ)⊺Σ−1(ν − µ), it then follows that Pt+1 = N (w η t+1,Σ η t+1). For completeness we provide a proof of this last result in Lemma 10 of Appendix E. It now remains to bound the regret. Since P is convex, the Pythagorean inequality for KullbackLeibler divergence implies that\nKL(Q‖P̃t+1) ≥ KL(Q‖Pt+1) + KL(Pt+1‖P̃t+1) ≥ KL(Q‖Pt+1)\nfor all Q ∈ P. The following telescoping sum therefore gives us that\nKL(Q‖P1) ≥ T∑\nt=1\nKL(Q‖Pt)−KL(Q‖Pt+1) ≥ T∑\nt=1\nKL(Q‖Pt)−KL(Q‖P̃t+1)\n=\nT∑\nt=1\n− ln E Pt [e−ℓ η t (u)]− E Q [ℓηt (u)]. (10)\nThis may be interpreted as a regret bound in the space of distributions, which we will now relate to our regret of interest. If Mt = M fullt , then Lemma 9 implies that\n− ln E Pt [e−ℓ η t (u)] ≥ ℓηt (wηt )\nbecause wηt is the mean of Pt. Alternatively, if Mt = M diag t then Pt has diagonal covariance Σ η t , and we can use Lemma 9 again to draw the same conclusion. To control EQ[ℓ η t (u)], we may restrict attention (without loss of generality by a standard maximum entropy argument) to normal distributions Q = N (µ,D2Σ) with mean µ ∈ U and covariance Σ ≻ 0 (expressed relative to the prior variance D2). Then, using the cyclic property and linearity of the trace,\nE Q [ℓηt (u)] = −η(wt − µ)⊺gt + η2(w⊺tMtwt − 2µ⊺Mtwt + E Q [tr(u⊺Mtu)])\n= −η(wt − µ)⊺gt + η2(w⊺tMtwt − 2µ⊺Mtwt + tr(E Q [uu⊺]Mt)) = −η(wt − µ)⊺gt + η2(w⊺tMtwt − 2µ⊺Mtwt + tr((D2Σ+ µµ⊺)Mt)) = −η(wt − µ)⊺gt + η2 ( (µ−wt)⊺Mt(µ−wt) +D2 tr(ΣMt) ) = ℓηt (µ) + η 2D2 tr(ΣMt).\nFinally, it remains to work out\nKL(Q‖P1) = 1 2D2 ‖µ‖2 + 1 2 (− ln detΣ+ tr(Σ)− d) .\nWe have now bounded all the pieces in (10).

Theorem 7 above implies that any two η that are within a constant factor of each other will guarantee the same bound up to another constant factor. Since η is a continuous parameter, this suggests choosing a prior that is approximately uniform for ln η, which means it should have a density that looks like 1/η. Although Theorem 7 does not show it, there is never any harm in taking too many grid points, because grid points that are very close together will behave as a single point with combined prior mass. If we disregard computation, we would therefore like to use the prior discussed by Chernov and Vovk (2010), which is very close to uniform on ln η and has density\nπ(η) = C\nη log22(5DGη) ,\nwhere we include the factor 5DG to make the prior invariant under rescalings of the problem, and C is a normalizing constant that makes the prior integrate to 1.

    "abstractText" : "In online convex optimization it is well known that objective functions with curvature are much easier than arbitrary convex functions. Here we show that the regret can be significantly reduced even without curvature, in cases where there is a stable optimum to converge to. More precisely, the regret of existing methods is determined by the norms of the encountered gradients, and matching worst-case performance lower bounds tell us that this cannot be improved uniformly. Yet we argue that this is a rather pessimistic assessment of the complexity of the problem. We introduce a new parameter-free algorithm, called MetaGrad, for which the gradient norms in the regret are scaled down by the distance to the (unknown) optimum. So when the optimum is reasonably stable over time, making the algorithm converge, this new scaling leads to orders of magnitude smaller regret even when the gradients themselves do not vanish. MetaGrad does not require any manual tuning, but instead tunes a learning rate parameter automatically for the data. Unlike all previous methods with provable guarantees, its learning rates are not monotonically decreasing over time, but instead are based on a novel aggregation technique. We provide two versions of MetaGrad. The first maintains a full covariance matrix to guarantee the sharpest bounds for problems where we can afford update time quadratic in the dimension. The second version maintains only the diagonal. Its linear cost in the dimension makes it suitable for large-scale problems.",
