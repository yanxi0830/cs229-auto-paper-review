      "text" : "The classic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, generally attributed to the early work of Robbins (1952), poses a generic online decision scenario in which an agent must make a sequence of choices from a fixed set of options. After each decision is made, the agent receives some feedback in the form of a loss (or gain) associated with her choice, but no information is provided on the outcomes of alternative options. The agent’s goal is to minimize the total loss over time, and the agent is thus faced with the balancing act of both experimenting with the menu of choices while also utilizing the data gathered in the process to improve her decisions. The MAB framework is not only mathematically elegant, but useful for a wide range of applications including medical experiments design (Gittins, 1996), automated poker playing strategies (Van den Broeck et al., 2009), and hyperparameter tuning (Pacula et al., 2012).\nEarly MAB results relied on stochastic assumptions (e.g., IID) on the loss sequence (Gittins et al., 2011; Lai and Robbins, 1985; Auer et al., 2002). As researchers began to establish non-stochastic, worst-case guarantees for sequential decision problems such as prediction with expert advice (Littlestone and Warmuth, 1994), a natural question arose as to whether similar guarantees were possible for the bandit setting. The pioneering work of Auer, Cesa-Bianchi, Freund, and Schapire (2003) answered this in the affirmative by showing that their algorithm EXP3 possesses nearly-optimal regret bounds with matching lower bounds. Attention later turned to the bandit version of online linear optimization, and several associated guarantees were published the following decade (McMahan and Blum, 2004; Flaxman et al., 2005; Dani and Hayes, 2006; Dani et al., 2008; Abernethy et al., 2012).\nNearly all proposed methods have relied on a particular algorithmic blueprint; they reduce the bandit problem to the full-information setting, while using randomization to make decisions and to estimate the losses. A well-studied family of algorithms for the full-information setting is Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL), which optimizes the objective function of the following form:\narg min x∈K\n〈L, x〉+ λR(x) (1)\nwhere K is the decision set, L is (an estimate of) the cumulative loss vector, and R is a regularizer, a convex function with suitable curvature to stabilize the objective. The choice of regularizer R is critical to the algorithm’s performance. For example, the EXP3 algorithm (Auer, 2003) regularizes with the entropy function and achieves a nearly optimal regret bound when K is the probability sim-\nar X\niv :1\n51 2.\n04 15\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n4 D\nec 2\n01 5\nplex. For a general convex set, however, other regularizers such as self-concordant barrier functions (Abernethy et al., 2012) have tighter regret bounds.\nAnother class of algorithms for the full information setting is Follow the Perturbed Leader (FTPL) (Kalai and Vempala, 2005) whose foundations date back to the earliest work in adversarial online learning (Hannan, 1957). Here we choose a distribution D on RN , sample a random vector Z ∼ D, and solve the following linear optimization problem\narg min x∈K\n〈L+ Z, x〉 (2)\nFTPL is computationally simpler than FTRL due to the linearity of the objective, but it is analytically much more complex due to the randomness. For every different choice of D, an entirely new set of techniques had to be developed (Devroye et al., 2013; Van Erven et al., 2014). Rakhlin et al. (2012) and Abernethy et al. (2014) made some progress towards unifying the analysis framework. Their techniques, however, are limited to the full-information setting.\nIn this paper, we propose a new analysis framework for the multi-armed bandit problem that unifies the regularization and perturbation algorithms. The key element is a new kind of smoothness property, which we call differential consistency. It allows us to generate a wide class of both optimal and near-optimal algorithms for the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem. We summarize our main results:\n1. We show that regularization via the Tsallis entropy leads to the state-of-the-art adversarial MAB algorithm, matching the minimax regret rate of Audibert and Bubeck (2009) with a tighter constant. Interestingly, our algorithm fully generalizes EXP3.\n2. We show that a wide array of well-studied noise distributions lead to near-optimal regret bounds (matching those of EXP3). Furthermore, our analysis reveals a strikingly simple and appealing sufficient condition for achieving O( √ T ) regret: the hazard rate of the\nnoise distribution must be bounded by a constant in the tail region. We conjecture that this requirement is in fact both necessary and sufficient."

      "text" : "Let us now introduce the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem. On each round t = 1, . . . , T , a learner must choose a distribution pt ∈ ∆N over the set of N available actions. The adversary (Nature) chooses a loss vector gt ∈ [−1, 0]N . The learner plays action it sampled according to pt and suffers the loss gt,it . The learner observes only a single coordinate gt,it and receives no information as to the values gt,j for j 6= it. This limited information feedback is what makes the bandit problem much more challenging than the full-information setting in which the entire gt is observed.\nThe learner’s goal is to minimize the regret. Regret is defined to be the difference in the realized loss and the loss of the best fixed action in hindsight:\nRegretT := max i∈[N ] T∑ t=1 (gt,i − gt,it).

      "text" : "We study a particular algorithmic template described in Framework 1, which is a slight variation of the Gradient Based Prediction Algorithm (GBPA) of Abernethy et al. (2014). Note that the algorithm (i) maintains an unbiased estimate of the cumulative losses Ĝt, (ii) updates Ĝt by adding a singleround estimate ĝt, and (iii) uses the gradient of a convex function Φ̃ as sampling distribution pt. The choice of Φ̃ is flexible, it must be a differentiable convex function such that its gradient is always a probability distribution.\nFramework 1 may appear restrictive but it has served as the basis for much of the published work on adversarial MAB algorithms (Auer et al., 2003; Kujala and Elomaa, 2005; Neu and Bartók, 2013) mainly for two reasons. First, the GBPA framework encompasses all FTRL and FTPL algorithms, which are the core techniques for sequential prediction algorithms (Abernethy et al., 2014). Second, although there is some flexibility, any unbiased estimation scheme would require some kind of inverse-probability scaling. Information theory tells us that the unbiased estimates of a quantity that is observed with only probabilty p must necessarily involve fluctuations that scale as O(1/p).\nFramework 1: Gradient-Based Prediction Alg. (GBPA) Template for Multi-Armed Bandits. GBPA(Φ̃): Φ̃ is a differentiable convex function such that∇Φ̃ ∈ ∆N and ∇iΦ̃ > 0 for all i.

Define Φ(G) ≡ maxiGi so that we can write the expected regret of GBPA(Φ̃) as ERegretT = Φ(GT )− ∑T t=1〈∇Φ̃(Ĝt−1), gt〉.\nThen, the expected regret of GBPA(Φ̃) can be written as:\nERegretT ≤ Φ̃(0)− Φ(0)︸ ︷︷ ︸ overestimation penalty\n+Ei1,...,it−1 [\nΦ(ĜT )− Φ̃(ĜT )︸ ︷︷ ︸ underestimation penalty + T∑ t=1 Eit [DΦ̃(Ĝt, Ĝt−1)|Ĝt−1]︸ ︷︷ ︸ divergence penalty ] ,\n(4) where the expectations are over the sampling of it.\nProof. Let Φ̃ be a valid convex function for GBPA. Consider GBPA(Φ̃) run on the loss sequence g1, . . . , gT . The algorithm produces a sequence of estimated losses ĝ1, . . . , ĝT . Now consider GBPA-FI(Φ̃), which is GBPA(Φ̃) run with the full information on the deterministic loss sequence ĝ1, . . . , ĝT (there is no estimation step, and the learner updates Ĝt directly). The regret of this run can be written as\nΦ(ĜT )− ∑T t=1〈∇Φ̃(Ĝt−1), ĝt〉 (5)\nand Φ(GT ) ≤ Φ(ĜT ) by the convexity of Φ. Hence, Equation 5 is an upper bound the regret. The rest of the proof is a fairly well-known result in online learning literature; see, for example, (CesaBianchi and Lugosi, 2006, Theorem 11.6) or (Abernethy et al., 2014, Section 2). For completeness, we included the full proof in Appendix A."

      "heading" : "2.2 A New Kind of Smoothness",
      "text" : "What has emerged as a guiding principle throughout machine learning is that the stability of an algorithm leads to performance guarantees—that is, small modifications of the input data should not\ndramatically alter the output. In the context of GBPA, algorithm’s output (prediction in each time step) is by definition the dervative ∇Φ̃, and its stability corresponds to the Lipschitz-continuity of the gradient. Abernethy et al. (2014) proved that a uniform bound the norm of∇2Φ̃ directly gives a regret guarantee for the full-information setting.\nIn the bandit setting, however, a uniform bound on ∇2Φ̃ is insufficient; the regret (Lemma 2.1) involves terms of the form DΦ̃(Ĝt−1 + ĝt, Ĝt−1), where the incremental quantity ĝt can scale as large as the inverse of the smallest probability of p(Ĝt−1). What is needed is a stronger notion of the smoothness that bounds∇2Φ̃ in correspondence with∇Φ̃, and we propose the following definition: Definition 2.2 (Differential Consistency). For constants γ,C > 0, we say that a convex function Φ̃(·) is (γ,C)-differentially-consistent if for all G ∈ (−∞, 0]N ,\n∇2iiΦ̃(G) ≤ C(∇iΦ̃(G))γ .\nIn other words, the rate in which we decrease pi should approach 0 as pi approaches 0. This gurantees that the algorithm continues to explore. We now prove a generic bound that we will use in the following two sections to derive regret guarantees.\nTheorem 2.3. Suppose Φ̃ is (γ,C)-differentially-consistent for constants C, γ > 0. Then divergence penalty at time t in Lemma 2.1 can be upper bounded as:\nEit [DΦ̃(Ĝt, Ĝt−1)|Ĝt−1] ≤ C\n2 N∑ i=1 ( ∇iΦ̃(Ĝt−1) )γ−1 .\nProof. For the sake of clarity, we drop the subscripts; we use Ĝ to denote the cumulative estimate Ĝt−1, ĝ to denote the marginal estimate ĝt = Ĝt − Ĝt−1, and g to denote the true loss gt. Note that by definition of Algorithm 1, ĝ is a sparse vector with one non-zero and non-positive coordinate ĝit = gt,i/∇iΦ̃(Ĝ). Plus, it is conditionally independent given Ĝ. For a fixed it, Let\nh(r) := DΦ̃(Ĝ+ rĝ/‖ĝ‖, Ĝ) = DΦ̃(Ĝ+ reit , Ĝ), so that h′′(r) = (ĝ/‖ĝ‖)>∇2Φ̃ ( Ĝ+ tĝ/‖ĝ‖ ) (ĝ/‖ĝ‖) = e>it∇ 2Φ̃ ( Ĝ− teit ) eit . Now we write:\nEit [DΦ̃(Ĝ+ ĝ, Ĝ)|Ĝ] = ∑N i=1 P[it = i] ∫ ‖ĝ‖ 0 ∫ s 0 h′′(r) dr ds\n= ∑N i=1∇iΦ̃(Ĝ) ∫ ‖ĝ‖ 0 ∫ s 0 e>i ∇2Φ̃ ( Ĝ− rei ) ei dr ds\n≤ ∑N i=1∇iΦ̃(Ĝ) ∫ ‖ĝ‖ 0 ∫ s 0 C ( ∇iΦ̃(Ĝ− rei) )γ dr ds\n≤ ∑N i=1∇iΦ̃(Ĝ) ∫ ‖ĝ‖ 0 ∫ s 0 C ( ∇iΦ̃(Ĝ) )γ dr ds\n= C ∑N i=1 ( ∇iΦ̃(Ĝ) )1+γ ∫ ‖ĝ‖ 0 ∫ s 0 dr ds\n= C2 ∑N i=1 ( ∇iΦ̃(Ĝ) )γ−1 g2i .\nThe first inequality is by the supposition. The second inequality is due to the convexity of Φ̃ which guarantees that∇i is an increasing function in the i-th coordinate; this step critically depends on the loss-only assumption that g is always non-positive."

      "heading" : "3 A Minimax Bandit Algorithm via Tsallis Smoothing",
      "text" : "Auer et al. (2003) proved that their EXP3 algorithm achieves O( √ TN logN) regret and that any multi-armed bandit algorithm suffers Ω( √ TN) regret. A few years later, Audibert and Bubeck (2009) resolved this gap with Implicitly Normalized Forecaster (INF), which later was shown to be equivalent to Mirror Descent (Audibert et al., 2011) on the probability simplex. EXP3 corresponds to INF with potential function ψ(x) = exp(ηx), while using ψ(x) = (−ηx)−q with q > 1 gives an optimal algorithm that has regret at most 2 √ 2TN (Bubeck and Cesa-Bianchi, 2012, Theorem 5.7).\nWhat we present in this section is essentially a reformulation of a particular subfamily of INF, which includes INF with the above two potential functions. Our reformulation leads to a very simple and intuitive analysis based on differential consistency, and a natural interpolation between the two seemingly unrelated potential functions.\nLet us first note that EXP3 is an instance of GBPA where the potential function Φ̃(·) is the Fenchel conjugate of the Shannon entropy. For any p ∈ ∆N , the (negative) Shannon entropy is defined as H(p) := ∑ i pi log pi, and its Fenchel conjugate is H\n?(G) = supp∈∆N {〈p,G〉 − ηH(p)}. In fact, we have a closed-form expression for the supremum: H?(G) = 1η log ( ∑ i exp(ηGi)) . By inspecting the gradient of the above expression, it is easy to see that EXP3 chooses the distribution pt = ∇H?(G) every round. Now we will replace the Shannon entropy with the Tsallis entropy1 (Tsallis, 1988), defined as:\nSα(p) = 1\n1− α\n( 1−\nN∑ i=1 pαi\n) for 0 < α < 1.\nInterestingly, the Shannon entropy is an asymptotic special case of the Tsallis entropy, i.e.,\nSα(·)→ H(·) as α→ 1.\nTheorem 3.1. Let Φ̃(G) = maxp∈∆N {〈p,G〉 − ηSα(p)}. Then the GBPA(Φ̃) has regret at most\nERegret ≤ ηN 1−α − 1 1− α︸ ︷︷ ︸\noverestimation penalty\n+ NαT\n2ηα︸ ︷︷ ︸ divergence penalty . (6)\nBefore proving the theorem, we note that it immediately recovers the EXP3 upper bound as a special case α → 1. An easy application of L’Hôpital’s rule shows that as α → 1, N\n1−α−1 1−α → logN and Nα/α → N . Choosing η = √\n(N logN)/T , we see that the right-hand side of (6) tends to 2 √ TN logN . However the choice α → 1 is clearly not the optimal choice, as we show in the following statement, which directly follows from the theorem once we see that N1−α− 1 < N1−α.\nCorollary 3.2. For any α ∈ (0, 1), if we choose η = √\nT (1−α) 2α N α− 12 then we have\nERegret ≤ √\n2TN α(1−α) .\nIn particular, the choice of α = 12 gives a regret of no more than 2 √\n2TN , recovering (Bubeck and Cesa-Bianchi, 2012, Theorem 5.7).\nProof of Theorem 3.1. We will bound each penalty term in Lemma 2.1. Since Sα is non-positive, the underestimation penalty is upper bounded by 0 and the overestimation penalty is at most (−minSα). The minimum of Sα occurs at (1/N, . . . , 1/N). Hence,\n(overestimation penalty) ≤ − η 1− α\n( 1−\nN∑ i=1 1 Nα\n) ≤ ηN\n1−α − 1 1− α . (7)\nNow it remains to upper bound the divergence penalty. Straightforward calculus gives\n∇2Sα(p) = ηαdiag(pα−21 , . . . , p α−2 N ).\nLet I∆N (·) be the function where I∆N (x) = 0 for x ∈ ∆N and I∆N (x) =∞ for x /∈ ∆N . Define a function Ŝα(·) := Sα(·) + I∆N (·), which is the convex conjugate of Φ̃. Following the setup of Penot (1994), ∇2Sα(p) is a sub-hessian of Ŝα(p). We now apply Proposition 3.2 of the same reference. Let (pG, G) be a pair such that ∇Φ̃(G) = pG. Since ∇2Sα(p) is invertible, it follows that (∇2Sα(pG))−1 is a super-hessian of Φ̃ at G. Hence, for any G,\n∇2Φ̃(G) (ηα)−1diag ( (pG) 2−α 1 , . . . , (pG) 2−α N (G) ) .\n1More precisely, the function we give here is the negative Tsallis entropy according to its original definition.\nThat is, Φ̃ is (2− α, (ηα)−1)-differentially-consistent, and thus applying Theorem 2.3 gives\nDΦ̃(Ĝt, Ĝt−1) ≤ (2ηα) −1 N∑ i=1 ( pi(Ĝt−1) )1−α .\nSince the 1α -norm and the 1 1−α -norm are dual to each other, we can apply Hölder’s inequality to any probability distribution p1, . . . , pN and obtain\nN∑ i=1 p1−αi = N∑ i=1 p1−αi · 1 ≤ ( N∑ i=1 p 1−α 1−α i )1−α( N∑ i=1 1 1 α )α = (1)1−αNα = Nα.\nSo, the divergence penalty is at most (2ηα)−1Nα, which completes the proof."

By Bertsekas (1973), we can swap the order of differentiation and expectation:\n∇Φ̃(G;D) = E Z1,...,ZN iid∼D ei∗ , where i∗ = arg max i=1,...,N {Gi + Zi}. (9)\nEven if the function is not differentiable everywhere, the swapping is still possible with any subgradient under some mild conditions. Hence, the ties between coordinates (which happen with probability zero anyways) can be resolved in an arbitrary manner.

Despite the fact that perturbation-based algorithms provide a natural randomized decision strategy, they have seen little applications mostly because they are hard to analyze. But one should expect general results to be within reach: the EXP3 algorithm, for example, can be viewed through the lens of perturbations, where the noise is distributed according to the Gumbel distribution. Indeed, an early result of Kujala and Elomaa (2005) showed that a near-optimal MAB strategy comes about through the use of exponentially-distributed noise, and the same perturbation strategy has more recently been utilized in the work of Neu and Bartók (2013) and Kocák et al. (2014). However, a more general understanding of perturbation methods has remained elusive. For example, would Gaussian noise be sufficient for a guarantee? What about, say, the Weibull distribution?"

Suppose we scale the perturbation Z by η > 0, i.e., we add ηZi to each coordinate. It is easy to see that E[maxi=1,...,n ηXi] = ηE[maxi=1,...,nXi]. For the divergence penalty, let Fη be the CDF of the scaled random variable. Observe that Fη(t) = F (t/η) and thus fη(t) = 1ηf(t/η). Hence, the hazard rate scales by 1/η, which completes the proof.\nLemma 4.3. The divergence penalty of the GBPA with Φ̃(G) = EZ1,...,Zn∼D maxi{Gi + ηZi} is at most N(suphD) each round.\nProof. Recall the gradient expression in Equation 10.

Follow the Perturbed Leader Algorithm with distributions in Table 1 (restricted to a certain range of parameters), combined with Geometric Resampling (Section 4.1) withM = √ NT , has an expected regret of order O( √ TN logN).\nTable 1 provides the two terms we need to bound. We derive the third column of the table in Appendix C using Extreme Value Theory (Embrechts et al., 1997). Note that our analysis in the proof of Lemma 4.3 is quite tight; the only place we have an inequality is where we upper bound the hazard rate. It is thus reasonable to pose the following conjecture: Conjecture 4.5. If a distribution D has a monotonically increasing hazard rate hD(x) that does not converge as x→ +∞ (e.g., Gaussian), then there is a sequence of losses that will incur at least a linear regret.\nThe intuition is that if adversary keeps incurring a high loss for the i-th arm, then with high probability G̃j∗ − Gi will be large. So, the expectation in Equation 11 will be dominated by the hazard function evaluated at large values of G̃j∗ −Gi.\nAcknowledgments. J.

Then define Y as X conditioned on X ≥ 1. That is, Y has CDF, for y > 0:\nG(y) = P (X ≥ 1 + y|X > 1) = F (1 + y)− F (1) 1− F (1)\nand density g(y) = f(1 + y)/(1 − F (1)), y > 0. So the hazard rate hY (y) is g(y)/(1 − G(y)) = f(1 + y)/(1− F (1 + y)) = hX(1 + y). Therefore,\nsup y>0 hY (y) = sup x>1 hX(x)\nwhich makes the hazard rate of Y now bounded. This we have proved the lemma below.\nLemma B.2. If a hazard function of X is bounded for x > 1 and blows up only for small values of x then we can condition on X > 1 to define a new random variable whose hazard rate is now bounded.\nThe same technique can be applied for any arbitrary constant other than 1, but for the family of random variables we considered, it suffices to condition on X ≥ 1."
