      "text" : "Sparse learning has emerged as an effective approach to alleviate model overfitting when feature dimension outnumbers training sample. Given a set of training samples{(xi, yi)}Ni=1 in which xi ∈ Rd is the feature representation and yi ∈ R the corresponding label, the following sparsity-constrained `2-norm regularized loss minimization problem is often considered in high-dimensional analysis:\nmin ‖w‖0≤k\nP (w) := 1\nN N∑ i=1 l(w>xi, yi) + λ 2 ‖w‖2. (1.1)\nHere l(·; ·) is a convex loss function, w ∈ Rd is the model parameter vector and λ controls the regularization strength. For example, the squared loss l(a, b) = (b− a)2 is used in linear regression\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n00 11\n9v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n1 Ju\nand the hinge loss l(a, b) = max{0, 1 − ab} in support vector machines. Due to the presence of cardinality constraint ‖w‖0 ≤ k, the problem (1.1) is simultaneously non-convex and NP-hard in general, and thus is challenging for optimization. A popular way to address this challenge is to use proper convex relaxation, e.g., `1 norm (Tibshirani, 1996) and k-support norm (Argyriou et al., 2012), as an alternative of the cardinality constraint. However, the convex relaxation based techniques tend to introduce bias for parameter estimation.\nIn this paper, we are interested in algorithms that directly minimize the non-convex formulation in (1.1). Early efforts mainly lie in compressed sensing for signal recovery, which is a special case of (1.1) with squared loss. Among others, a family of the so called Iterative Hard Thresholding (IHT) methods (Blumensath & Davies, 2009; Foucart, 2011) have gained significant interests and they have been witnessed to offer the fastest and most scalable solutions in many cases. More recently, IHT-style methods have been generalized to handle generic convex loss functions (Beck & Eldar, 2013; Yuan et al., 2014; Jain et al., 2014) as well as structured sparsity constraints (Jain et al., 2016). The common theme of these methods is to iterate between gradient descent and hard thresholding to maintain sparsity of solution while minimizing the objective value.\nAlthough IHT-style methods have been extensively studied, the state-of-the-art is only designed for the primal formulation (1.1). It remains an open problem to investigate the feasibility of solving the original NP-hard/non-convex formulation in a dual space that might potentially further improve computational efficiency. To fill this gap, inspired by the recent success of dual methods in regularized learning problems, we systematically build a sparse duality theory and propose an IHT-style algorithm along with its stochastic variant for dual optimization. Overview of our contribution. The core contribution of this work is two-fold in theory and algorithm. As the theoretical contribution, we have established a novel sparse Lagrangian duality theory for the NP-hard/non-convex problem (1.1) which to the best of our knowledge has not been reported elsewhere in literature. We provide in this part a set of sufficient and necessary conditions under which one can safely solve the original non-convex problem through maximizing its concave dual objective function. As the algorithmic contribution, we propose the dual IHT (DIHT) algorithm as a super-gradient method to maximize the non-smooth dual objective. In high level description, DIHT iterates between dual gradient ascent and primal hard thresholding pursuit until convergence. A stochastic variant of DIHT is proposed to handle large-scale learning problems. For both algorithms, we provide non-asymptotic convergence analysis on parameter estimation error, sparsity recovery, and primal-dual gap as well. In sharp contrast to the existing analysis for primal IHT-style algorithms, our analysis is not relying on Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) conditions and thus is less restrictive in real-life high-dimensional statistical settings. Numerical results on synthetic datasets and machine learning benchmark datasets demonstrate that dual IHT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art primal IHT algorithms in accuracy and efficiency. The theoretical and algorithmic contributions of this paper are highlighted in below:\n• Sparse Lagrangian duality theory: we established a sparse saddle point theorem (Theorem 1), a sparse mini-max theorem (Theorem 2) and a sparse strong duality theorem (Theorem 3).\n• Dual optimization: we proposed an IHT-style algorithm along with its stochastic extension for non-smooth dual maximization. These algorithms have been shown to converge at the rate of 1 ln 1 in dual parameter estimation error and 1 2 ln 1 2\nin primal-dual gap (see Theorem 4 and Theorem 5). These guarantees are invariant to RIP conditions which are required by virtually all the primal IHT-style methods without using relaxed sparsity levels.\nNotation. Before continuing, we define some notations to be used. Let x ∈ Rd be a vector and F be an index set. We use HF (x) to denote the truncation operator that restricts x to the set F . Hk(x) is a truncation operator which preserves the top k (in magnitude) entries of x and sets the remaining to be zero. The notation supp(x) represents the index set of nonzero entries of x. We conventionally define ‖x‖∞ = maxi |[x]i| and define xmin = mini∈supp(x) |[x]i|. For a matrix A, σmax(A) (σmin(A)) denotes its largest (smallest) singular value. Organization. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In §2 we briefly review some relevant work. In §3 we develop a Lagrangian duality theory for sparsity-constrained minimization problems. The dual IHT-style algorithms along with convergence analysis are presented in §4. The numerical evaluation results are reported in §5.1. Finally, the concluding remarks are made in §6. All the technical proofs are deferred to the appendix sections."

      "text" : "For generic convex objective beyond quadratic loss, the rate of convergence and parameter estimation error of IHT-style methods were established under proper RIP (or restricted strong condition number) bound conditions (Blumensath, 2013; Yuan et al., 2014, 2016). In (Jain et al., 2014), several relaxed variants of IHT-style algorithms were presented for which the estimation consistency can be established without requiring the RIP conditions. In (Bahmani et al., 2013), a gradient support pursuit algorithm is proposed and analyzed. In large-scale settings where a full gradient evaluation on all data becomes a bottleneck, stochastic and variance reduction techniques have been adopted to improve the computational efficiency of IHT (Nguyen et al., 2014; Li et al., 2016; Chen & Gu, 2016).\nDual optimization algorithms have been widely used in various learning tasks including SVMs (Hsieh et al., 2008) and multi-task learning (Lapin et al., 2014). In recent years, stochastic dual optimization methods have gained significant attention in large-scale machine learning (Shalev-Shwartz & Zhang, 2013a,b). To further improve computational efficiency, some primal-dual methods are developed to alternately minimize the primal objective and maximize the dual objective. The successful examples of primal-dual methods include learning total variation regularized model (Chambolle & Pock, 2011) and generalized Dantzig selector (Lee et al., 2016). More recently, a number of stochastic variants (Zhang & Xiao, 2015; Yu et al., 2015) and parallel variants (Zhu & Storkey, 2016) were developed to make the primal-dual algorithms more scalable and efficient."

      "text" : "In this section, we establish weak and strong duality theory that guarantees the original non-convex and NP-hard problem in (1.1) can be equivalently solved in a dual space. The results in this part build the theoretical foundation of developing dual IHT methods.\nFrom now on we abbreviate li(w >xi) = l(w >xi, yi). The convexity of l(w >xi, yi) implies that\nli(u) is also convex. Let l ∗ i (αi) = maxu {αiu− li(u)} be the convex conjugate of li(u) and F ⊆ R be the feasible set of αi. According to the well-known expression of li(u) = maxαi∈F {αiu− l∗i (αi)}, the problem (1.1) can be reformulated into the following mini-max formulation:\nmin ‖w‖0≤k\n1\nN N∑ i=1 max αi∈F {αiw>xi − l∗i (αi)}+ λ 2 ‖w‖2. (3.1)\nThe following Lagrangian form will be useful in analysis:\nL(w,α) = 1\nN N∑ i=1 ( αiw >xi − l∗i (αi) ) + λ 2 ‖w‖2,\nwhere α = [α1, ..., αN ] ∈ FN is the vector of dual variables. We now introduce the following concept of sparse saddle point which is a restriction of the conventional saddle point to the setting of sparse optimization.\nDefinition 1 (Sparse Saddle Point). A pair (w̄, ᾱ) ∈ Rd×FN is said to be a k-sparse saddle point for L if ‖w̄‖0 ≤ k and the following holds for all ‖w‖0 ≤ k, α ∈ FN :\nL(w̄, α) ≤ L(w̄, ᾱ) ≤ L(w, ᾱ). (3.2)\nDifferent from the conventional definition of saddle point, the k-sparse saddle point only requires the inequality (3.2) holds for any arbitrary k-sparse vector w. The following result is a basic sparse saddle point theorem for L. Throughout the paper, we will use f ′(·) to denote a sub-gradient (or super-gradient) of a convex (or concave) function f(·), and use ∂f(·) to denote its sub-differential (or super-differential).\nTheorem 1 (Sparse Saddle Point Theorem). Let w̄ ∈ Rd be a k-sparse primal vector and ᾱ ∈ FN be a dual vector. Then the pair (w̄, ᾱ) is a sparse saddle point for L if and only if the following conditions hold:\n(a) w̄ solves the primal problem in (1.1);\n(b) ᾱ ∈ [∂l1(w̄>x1), ..., ∂lN (w̄>xN )];\n(c) w̄ = Hk ( − 1λN ∑N i=1 ᾱixi ) .\nProof. A proof of this result is given in Appendix A.1.\nRemark 1. Theorem 1 shows that the conditions (a)∼(c) are sufficient and necessary to guarantee the existence of a sparse saddle point for the Lagrangian form L. This result is different from from the traditional saddle point theorem which requires the use of the Slater Constraint Qualification to guarantee the existence of saddle point.\nRemark 2. Let us consider P ′(w̄) = 1N ∑N\ni=1 ᾱixi +λw̄ ∈ ∂P (w̄). Denote F̄ = supp(w̄). It is easy to verify that the condition (c) in Theorem 1 is equivalent to\nHF̄ (P ′(w̄)) = 0, w̄min ≥\n1 λ ‖P ′(w̄)‖∞.\nThe following sparse mini-max theorem guarantees that the min and max in (3.1) can be safely switched if and only if there exists a sparse saddle point for L(w,α).\nTheorem 2 (Sparse Mini-Max Theorem). The mini-max relationship\nmax α∈FN min ‖w‖0≤k L(w,α) = min ‖w‖0≤k max α∈FN L(w,α) (3.3)\nholds if and only if there exists a sparse saddle point (w̄, ᾱ) for L.\nProof. A proof of this result is given in Appendix A.2.\nThe sparse mini-max result in Theorem 2 provides sufficient and necessary conditions under which one can safely exchange a min-max for a max-min, in the presence of sparsity constraint. The following corollary is a direct consequence of applying Theorem 1 to Theorem 2.\nCorollary 1. The mini-max relationship\nmax α∈FN min ‖w‖0≤k L(w,α) = min ‖w‖0≤k max α∈FN L(w,α)\nholds if and only if there exist a k-sparse primal vector w̄ ∈ Rd and a dual vector ᾱ ∈ FN such that the conditions (a)∼(c) in Theorem 1 are satisfied.\nThe mini-max result in Theorem 2 can be used as a basis for establishing sparse duality theory. Indeed, we have already shown the following:\nmin ‖w‖0≤k max α∈FN L(w,α) = min ‖w‖0≤k P (w).\nThis is called the primal minimization problem and it is the min-max side of the sparse mini-max theorem. The other side, the max-min problem, will be called as the dual maximization problem with dual objective function D(α) := min‖w‖0≤k L(w,α), i.e.,\nmax α∈FN D(α) = max α∈FN min ‖w‖0≤k L(w,α). (3.4)\nThe following Lemma 1 shows that the dual objective function D(α) is concave and explicitly gives the expression of its super-differential.\nLemma 1. The dual objective function D(α) is given by\nD(α) = 1\nN N∑ i=1 −l∗i (αi)− λ 2 ‖w(α)‖2,\nwhere w(α) = Hk ( − 1Nλ ∑N i=1 αixi ) . Moreover, D(α) is concave and its super-differential is given by\n∂D(α) = 1\nN [w(α)>x1 − ∂l∗1(α1), ..., w(α)>xN − ∂l∗N (αN )].\nParticularly, if w(α) is unique at α and {l∗i }i=1,...,N are differentiable, then ∂D(α) is unique and it is the super-gradient of D(α).\nProof. A proof of this result is given in Appendix A.3.\nBased on Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, we are able to further establish a sparse strong duality theorem which gives the sufficient and necessary conditions under which the optimal values of the primal and dual problems coincide.\nTheorem 3 (Sparse Strong Duality Theorem). Let w̄ ∈ Rd is a k-sparse primal vector and ᾱ ∈ FN be a dual vector. Then ᾱ solves the dual problem in (3.4), i.e., D(ᾱ) ≥ D(α), ∀α ∈ FN , and P (w̄) = D(ᾱ) if and only if the pair (w̄, ᾱ) satisfies the conditions (a)∼(c) in Theorem 1.\nProof. A proof of this result is given in Appendix A.4.\nWe define the sparse primal-dual gap PD(w,α) := P (w)−D(α). The main message conveyed by Theorem 3 is that the sparse primal-dual gap reaches zero at the primal-dual pair (w̄, ᾱ) if and only if the conditions (a)∼(c) in Theorem 1 hold.\nThe sparse duality theory developed in this section suggests a natural way for finding the global minimum of the sparsity-constrained minimization problem in (1.1) via maximizing its dual problem in (3.4). Once the dual maximizer ᾱ is estimated, the primal sparse minimizer w̄ can then\nbe recovered from it according to the prima-dual connection w̄ = Hk ( − 1λN ∑N i=1 ᾱixi ) as given in the condition (c). Since the dual objective function D(α) is shown to be concave, its global maximum can be estimated using any convex/concave optimization method. In the next section, we present a simple projected super-gradient method to solve the dual maximization problem."

Therefore, smooth optimization methods are not directly applicable here and we resort to sub-gradient-type methods to solve the non-smooth dual maximization problem in (3.4)."

      "text" : "The Dual Iterative Hard Thresholding (DIHT) algorithm, as outlined in Algorithm 1, is essentially a projected super-gradient method for maximizing D(α). The procedure generates a sequence of prima-dual pairs (w(0), α(0)), (w(1), α(1)), . . . from an initial pair w(0) = 0 and α(0) = 0. At the t-th iteration, the dual update step S1 conducts the projected super-gradient ascent in (4.1) to update α(t) from α(t−1) and w(t−1). Then in the primal update step S2, the primal variable w(t) is constructed from α(t) using a k-sparse truncation operation in (4.2).\nWhen a batch estimation of super-gradient D′(α) becomes expensive in large-scale applications, it is natural to consider the stochastic implementation of DIHT, namely SDIHT, as outlined in Algorithm 2. Different from the batch computation in Algorithm 1, the dual update step S1 in Algorithm 2 randomly selects a block of samples (from a given block partition of samples) and update their corresponding dual variables according to (4.3). Then in the primal update step S2.1,\nwe incrementally update an intermediate accumulation vector w̃(t) which records − 1λN ∑N i=1 α (t) i xi as a weighted sum of samples. In S2.2, the primal vector w(t) is updated by applying k-sparse truncation on w̃(t). The SDIHT is essentially a block-coordinate super-gradient method for the dual problem. Particularly, in the extreme case m = 1, SDIHT reduces to the batch DIHT. At the opposite extreme end with m = N , i.e., each block contains one sample, SDIHT becomes a stochastic coordinate-wise super-gradient method.\nThe dual update (4.3) in SDIHT is much more efficient than DIHT as the former only needs to access a small subset of samples at a time. If the hard thresholding operation in primal update becomes a bottleneck, e.g., in high-dimensional settings, we suggest to use SDIHT with relatively smaller number of blocks so that the hard thresholding operation in S2.2 can be less frequently called.\nAlgorithm 1: Dual Iterative Hard Thresholding (DIHT)\nInput : Training set {xi, yi}Ni=1.

Since (t)P ≤ (t) PD always holds, the convergence rates in Theorem 4 are applicable to the primal sub-optimality as well. An interesting observation is that these convergence results on (t) P are not relying on the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) (or restricted strong condition number) which is required in most existing analysis of IHT-style algorithms (Blumensath & Davies, 2009; Yuan et al., 2014). In (Jain et al., 2014), several relaxed variants of IHT-style algorithms are presented for which the estimation consistency can be established without requiring the RIP conditions. In contrast to the RIP-free sparse recovery analysis in (Jain et al., 2014), our Theorem 4 does not require the sparsity level k to be relaxed.\nFor SDIHT, we can establish similar non-asymptotic convergence results as summarized in the following theorem.\nTheorem 5.

A proof of this result is given in Appendix A.6.\nRemark 4. Theorem 5 shows that, up to scaling factors, the expected or high probability iteration complexity of SDIHT is almost identical to that of DIHT. The scaling factor m appeared in t2 and t3 reflects a trade-off between the decreased per-iteration cost and the increased iteration complexity."

We can observe from this group of curves that DIHT consistently achieves lower parameter estimation error and higher rate of successful support recovery than IHT and HTP.

For news20 dataset, all of the 19, 996 samples are used as training data (d N).\nWe evaluate the algorithm efficiency of DIHT and SDIHT by comparing their running time against three primal baseline algorithms: IHT, HTP and gradient hard thresholding with stochastic variance reduction (SVR-GHT) Li et al. (2016). We first run IHT by setting its convergence criterion to be |P (w (t))−P (w(t−1))| P (w(t))\n≤ 10−4 or maximum number of iteration is reached. After that we test the time cost spend by other algorithms to make the primal loss reach P (w(t)). The parameter update step-size of all the considered algorithms is tuned by grid search. The parameter γ is set to be 0.25. For the two stochastic algorithms SDIHT and SVR-GHT we randomly partition the training data into |B| = 10 mini-batches.\nFigure 5.2 shows the running time curves on both datasets under varying sparsity level k and regularization strength λ = 0.002, 0.0002. It is obvious that under all tested (k, λ) configurations\n1https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html\non both datasets, DIHT and SDIHT need much less time than the primal baseline algorithms, IHT, HTP and SVR-GHT to reach the same primal sub-optimality.

      "text" : "In this paper, we systematically investigate duality theory and algorithms for solving the sparsityconstrained minimization problem which is NP-hard and non-convex in its primal form. As a theoretical contribution, we develop a sparse Lagrangian duality theory which guarantees strong duality in sparse settings, under mild sufficient and necessary conditions. This theory opens the gate to solve the original NP-hard/non-convex problem equivalently in a dual space. We then propose DIHT as a first-order method to maximize the non-smooth dual concave formulation. The algorithm is characterized by dual super-gradient ascent and primal hard thresholding. To further improve iteration efficiency in large-scale settings, we propose SDIHT as a block stochastic variant of DIHT. For both algorithms we have proved sub-linear primal-dual gap convergence rate when the primal loss is smooth, without assuming RIP-style conditions. Based on our theoretical findings and numerical results, we conclude that DIHT and SDIHT are theoretically sound and computationally attractive alternatives to the conventional primal IHT algorithms, especially when the sample size is smaller than feature dimensionality."

Therefore when t ≥ t2, the event supp(w(t)) = supp(w̄) occurs with probability at least 1− δ.\nSimilar to the proof arguments of Theorem 4(b) we can further show that when t ≥ 4t2, with probability at least 1− δ/2\n‖α(t) − ᾱ‖ ≤ λN̄ 2σmax(X) ,\nwhich then leads to\n(t) PD ≤ c0\n( 1 + σmax(X, k)\nµλN\n) ‖α(t) − ᾱ‖.\nSince t ≥ t3, from the arguments in part(a) and Lemma 6 we get that ‖α(t) − ᾱ‖ ≤ c0 ( 1+ σmax(X,k)\nµλN ) holds with probability at least 1− δ/2. Let us consider the following events:\n• A: the event of (t)PD ≤ ;\n• B: the event of ‖α(t) − ᾱ‖ ≤ λN̄2σmax(X) ; • C: the event of ‖α(t) − ᾱ‖ ≤ c0 ( 1+ σmax(X,k)\nµλN ) . When t ≥ max{4t2, t3}, we have the following holds:\nP(A) ≥ P(A | B)P(B) ≥ P(C | B)P(B) ≥ (1− δ/2)2 ≥ 1− δ.\nThis proves the desired bound."

As far as we know, the existing IHT-style methods are designed for sparse minimization in primal form. It remains open to explore duality theory and algorithms in such a non-convex and NP-hard problem setting. In this paper, we bridge this gap by establishing a duality theory for sparsity-constrained minimization with `2-regularized loss function and proposing an IHT-style algorithm for dual maximization. Our sparse duality theory provides a set of sufficient and necessary conditions under which the original NP-hard/non-convex problem can be equivalently solved in a dual formulation. The proposed dual IHT algorithm is a supergradient method for maximizing the non-smooth dual objective. An interesting finding is that the sparse recovery performance of dual IHT is invariant to the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP), which is required by virtually all the existing primal IHT algorithms without sparsity relaxation. Moreover, a stochastic variant of dual IHT is proposed for large-scale stochastic optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of dual IHT algorithms to the state-of-the-art primal IHT-style algorithms in model estimation accuracy and computational efficiency.",
