      "text" : "A useful strategy to deal with complex classification scenarios is the “divide and conquer” approach. The mixture of experts (MOE) technique makes use of this strategy by joinly training a set of classifiers, or experts, that are specialized in different regions of the input space. A global model, or gate function, complements the experts by learning a function that weights their relevance in different parts of the input space. Local feature selection appears as an attractive alternative to improve the specialization of experts and gate function, particularly, for the case of high dimensional data. Our main intuition is that particular subsets of dimensions, or subspaces, are usually more appropriate to classify instances located in different regions of the input space. Accordingly, this work contributes with a regularized variant of MoE that incorporates an embedded process for local feature selection using L1 regularization, with a simultaneous expert selection. The experiments are still pending. Keywords: Mixture of experts, local feature selection, embedded feature selection, regularization."

This is particularly relevant in the case of high dimensional spaces, where the common presence of noisy or irrelevant features might obscure the detection of particular class patterns. Specifically, our approach takes advantage of the linear nature of each local expert and gate function in the classical MoE formulation [17], meaning that L1 regularization can be directly applied. Below, we first briefly describe the classical MoE formulation for classification. Afterwards, we discuss the proposed modification to the MoE model that provides embedded feature selection."

      "text" : "In the context of supervised classification, there is available a set of N training examples, or instance-label pairs (xn, yn), representative of the domain data (x, y), where xn ∈ <D and yn ∈ C. Here C is a discrete set of Q class labels {c1, ..., cQ}. The goal is to use training data to find a function f that minimizes a loss function which scores the quality of f to predict the true underlying relation between x and y. From a probabilistic point of view [4], a useful approach to find f is using a conditional formulation:\nf(x) = arg max ci∈C\np(y = ci|x).\nIn the general case of complex relations between x and y, a useful strategy consists of approximating f through a mixture of local functions. This is similar to the case of modeling a mixture distribution [34] and it leads to the MoE model.\nWe decompose the conditional likelihood p(y|x) as:\np(y|x) = K∑ i=1 p(y,mi|x) = K∑ i=1 p(y|mi, x) p(mi|x), (1)\nwhere Equation (1) represents a MoE model with K experts mi. Figure (1) shows a schematic diagram of the MoE approach. The main idea is to obtain local models in such a way that they are specialized in a particular region of the data. In Figure (1), x corresponds to the input instance, p(y|mi, x) is the expert function, p(mi|x) is the\ngating function, and p(y|x) is the weighted sum of the experts. Note that the output of each expert model is weighted by the gating function. This weight can be interpreted as the relevance of expert mi for the classification of input instance x. Also note that the gate function has K outputs, one for each expert. There are K expert functions that have Q components, one for each class.\nThe traditional MoE technique uses multinomial logit models, also known as softmax functions [4], to represent the gate and expert functions. An important characteristic of this model is that it forces competition among its components. In MoE, such components are expert functions for the gates and class-conditional functions for the experts. The competition in soft-max functions enforces the especialization of experts in different areas of the input space [41].\nUsing multinomial logit models, a gate function is defined as:\np(mi|x) = exp(νTi x)∑K j=1 exp(ν T j x)\n(2)\nwhere i ∈ {1, . . . , K} refers to the set of experts and νi ∈ <D is a vector of model parameters. Component νij of vector νi models the relation between the gate and dimension j of input instance x.\nSimilarly, an expert function is defined as:\np(y = cl|x,mi) = exp(ωTlix)∑M j=1 exp(ω T jix)\n(3)\nwhere ωli depends on class label cl and expert i. In this way, there are a total of Q×K vectors ωli. Component ωlij of vector ωli models the relation between expert function i and dimension j of input instance x.\nThere are several methods to find the value of the hidden parameters νij and ωlij [26]. An attractive alternative is to use the EM algorithm. In the case of MoE, the EM formulation augments the model by introducing a set of latent variables, or responsibilities, indicating the expert that generates each instance. Accordingly, the EM iterations consider an expectation step that estimates expected values for responsibilities, and a maximization step that updates the values of parameters νij and ωlij. Specifically, the posterior probability of the responsibility Rin assigned by the gate function to expert mi for an instance xn is given by [26]:\nRin = p(mi|xn, yn) (4)\n= p(yn|xn,mi) p(mi|xn)∑K j=1 p(yn|xn,mj) p(mj|xn)\nConsidering these responsibilities and Equation (1), the expected complete log-\nlikelihood 〈Lc〉 used in the EM iterations is [26]:\n〈Lc〉 = N∑ n=1 K∑ i=1 Rin [log p(yn|xn,mi) + log p(mi|xn)] (5)"

      "text" : "To embed a feature selection process in the MoE approach, we use the fact that in Equations (2) and (3) the multinomial logit models for gate and experts functions contain linear relations for the relevant parameters. This linearity can be straightforwardly used in feature selection by considering that a parameter component νij or ωlij\nwith zero value implies that dimension j is irrelevant for gate function p(mi|x) or expert model p(y|mi, x), respectively. Consequently, we propose to penalize complex models using L1 regularization. Similar consideration is used in the work of [29] but in the context of unsupervised learning. The idea is to maximize the likelihood of data while simultaneously minimizing the number of parameter components νij and ωlij different from zero. Considering that there are Q classes, K experts, and D dimensions, the\nexpected L1 regularized log-likelihood 〈 LRc 〉 is given by:\n〈 LRc 〉 = 〈Lc〉 − λν K∑ i=1 D∑ j=1 |νij| − λω Q∑ l=1 K∑ i=1 D∑ j=1 |ωlij| . (6)\nTo maximize Equation (6) with respect to model parameters, we use first the standard fact that the likelihood function in Equation (5) can be decomposed in terms of independent expressions for gate and expert models [26]. In this way, the maximization step of the EM based solution can be performed independently with respect to gate and expert parameters [26]. In our problem, each of these optimizations has an extra term given by the respective regularization term in Equation (6). To handle this case, we observe that each of these optimizations is equivalent to the expression to solve a regularized logistic regression [20]. As shown in [20], this problem can be solved by using a coordinate ascent optimization strategy [37] given by a sequential two-step approach that first models the problem as an unregularized logistic regression and afterwards incorporates the regularization constraints.\nIn summary, we handle Equation (6) by using a EM based strategy that at each step solves the maximation with respect to model parameters by decomposing this problem in terms of gate and expert parameters. Each of these problems is in turn solved using the strategy proposed in [20]. Next, we provide details of this procedure.\nOptimization of the unregularized log-likelihood In this case, we solve the unconstrained log-likelihood given by Equation (5). First, we optimize the log-likelihood with respect to vector ωli. The maximization of the expected log-likelihood 〈Lc〉 implies deriving Equation (5) with respect to ωli:\n∂ ∑N\nn=1 ∑K i=1Rin [log p(yn|xn,mi) ]\n∂ωli = 0, (7)\nand applying the derivate, we have:\n− N∑ n=1 Rin (p(yn|xn,mi)− yn)xn = 0. (8)\nIn this case, the classical technique of least-squares can not be directly applied because of the soft-max function in p(yn|xn,mi). Fortunately, as described in [18] and later in [26], Equation (8) can be approximated by using a transformation that implies inverting the soft-max function. Using this transformation, Equation (8) is equivalent to an optimization problem that can be solved using a weighted least squares technique [4]:\nmin ωli\n∑N n=1Rin ( ωTlixn − log yn )2 (9)\nA similar derivation can be performed with respect to vectors νi. Again deriving Equation (5), in this case with respect to parameters νij and applying the transformation suggested in [18], we obtain:\nmin νi\n∑N n=1 ( νTi xn − logRin )2 (10)\n(11)\nOptimization of the regularized likelihood Following the procedure of [20], we add the regularization term to the optimization problem given by Equation (9), obtaining an expression that can be solved using quadratic programming [35]:\nmin ωli\n∑N n=1Rin ( log yn − ωTlixn )2 subject to: ||ωli||1 ≤ λω (12)\nSimilarly, we can also obtain a standard quadratic optimization problem to find\nparameters νij :\nmin νi\n∑N n=1 ( logRin − νTi xn )2 subject: to ||νi||1 ≤ λν (13)\nA practical advantage of using quadratic programming is that most available optimization packages can be utilized to solve it [6]. Specifically, in the case of T iterations, there are a total of T ∗K ∗ (Q+ 1) convex quadratic problems related to the maximization step of the EM algorithm. To further reduce this computational load, we slightly modify this maximization by applying the following two-steps scheme:\n• Step-1: Solve K quadratic problems to find gate parameters νij assuming that\neach expert uses all the available dimensions. In this case, there are T − 1 iterations.\n• Step-2: Solve K ∗ (Q + 1) quadratic problems to find expert parameters ωlij applying the feature selection process. In this case, there is a single iteration.\nUsing the previous scheme we reduce from T ∗K ∗(Q+1) to K ∗(T +1)+K ∗(Q+1) the number of quadratic problems that we need to solve in the maximization step of the EM algorithm. In our experiments, we do not notice a drop in performance by using this simplification, but we are able to increase processing speed in one order of magnitude.\nIn summary, starting by assigning random values to the relevant parameters νij and\nωlij, our EM implementation consists of iterating the following two steps:\n• Expectation: estimating responsabilities for each expert using Equation (4), and\nthen estimating the outputs of gate and experts using Equations (2) and (3).\n• Maximization: updating the values of parameters νij and ωlij in Equations (12)\nand (13) by solving K ∗ (T + 1) + K ∗ (Q + 1) quadratic problems according to the approximation described above in Step-1 and Step-2."

      "heading" : "2. Expert Selection",
      "text" : "The MoE o RMoE assumes that all the gate functions affects to every data. But for example in object detection, we can assume that there are some group of objects i.e. group of vehicles, animals, kitchen stuff, where each group is assigned to a gate function. We think that considering all groups of objects can confuse the classifiers. Therefore we propose to select a subset of gates function according to each data. We denominate this idea as a “expert selection”.\nRecalling that the likelihood in regular mixture of experts is:\nL = N∏ n=1 K∏ i=1 p(yn|xn,mi)p(mi|xn) (14)\nNow, in order to select a gate, we change the multinomial logit representation of\nthe gate function (Equation 2) in this way:\np(mi|xn) = expµin(ν T i x)∑K\nj=1 expµjn(ν T j x)\n(15)\nwhere all the components of Equation 2 remain the same, except µ. The variable µin ∈ {0, 1}K is the vector of model parameters of the expert selector. It depends on data xn and expert i, where i ∈ {1, . . . , K} for the set of expert gates. When µin = 1/0, it indicates that the gate i is relevant/irrelevant for data n. In the case of µin = 0, the value is constant and we can say that the data n is ignorant about expert i and assign a constant value. In this way, it is done the expert selection.\nIn order to use EM algorithm, we show the expected log-likelihood by considering the responsabilities, i.e. the posteriori probability of experts and the respective regularization terms with the addition of the term corresponding to the expert selector:\n〈Lc〉 = N∑ n=1 K∑ i=1 Rin [log p(yn|xn,mi) + log p(mi|xn)]\n−λν K∑ i=1 D∑ j=1 |νij| − λω Q∑ l=1 K∑ i=1 D∑ j=1 |ωlij| − P (µ) (16)\nThe penalization P depends on the regularization norm, mainly 0-norm or 1-norm.\nNow, we define the posteriori probability of the gates mi as:\nRin = p(yn|xn,mi)p(mi|xn)∑K j=1 p(yn|xn,mj) p(mj|xn)\n(17)\nNext, we repeat the strategy of Lee et al. by first optimizing the unregularized expected log-likelihood and then, adding the restriction. In order to facilitate the calculations, we define some auxiliary variables. As the derivative is linear in the sum, we calculate the contribution of a single data and call it as E ′:\nE ′ = −log K∑ k=1 p(yn|xn,mk) p(mk|xn) (18)\nWe solve this process using an EM algorithm, where in the E-step, we calculate the responsabilities in this case by using the equation 17. In the M-step, we assume the responsabilities as known and we find the optimal parameters ν, ω and µ.\nSince the use of the responsability values, the term p(yn|xn,mk) can be evaluated separatevely and then the parameter ω can be optimized using the equation used in RMoE. In the case of p(mk|xn), by fixing the parameter µ, we can optimize the parameter ν.\nWe use some notations in order to facilitate the calculus: the term p(yn|xn,mk) as gnk , p(mk|xn) as hkn and exp(µinνixn) as zi, we derive the equation respect to νin for having:\n∂E ′ ∂νi = ∂E ′ ∂zi ∂zi ∂νi ∂E ′ ∂νi = [ K∑ k=1 ∂E ′ ∂hk ∂hk ∂zi ] ∂zi ∂νi\n(19)\nNow we have three terms and we evaluate the derivative over each one :\n∂E ′ ∂hk =\n∂ − log ∑K\nj=1 gjhj\n∂hk ∂E ′ ∂hk = −gk∑K j=1 gjhj ∂E ′\n∂hk = −Rkn hk (20)\n∂hk ∂zi\n= ∂ exp(hk)∑K j=1 exp(hj)\n∂zi ∂hk ∂zi = δkihi − hihk (21)\n∂zli ∂νi = ∂µiνix\n∂νi ∂zli ∂νi = µix\nWe integrate these elements for obtain:\n∂E ′ ∂νi = ( K∑ k=1 Rkn hk (δkihi − hihk) ) µix ∂E ′ ∂νi = (Rin − hi)µix (22)\nBy considering all the data, the regularization term and applying the trick of Bishop\nby taking the logarithms of the outputs and equaling to zero, we have:\nmin νi\n∑N n=1 ( (log(Rin)− νTi µinxn )2 subject: to ||νi||1 ≤ λν (23)\nIn this case it is a modified version of equation 13 and we can apply a QP package to solve it. Finally, we fix the parameters ν and ω for optimizing the parameter µ. The\nregularization over the parameter of expert selector has originally norm 0; on the other hand, it can be relaxed bu considering norm 1. We state both approaches:"

In the training phase, we require to solve this optimization N times. And in the test phase, it is necessary to solve this optimization problem for each test data.\nBy using norm 0 or 1, we can find the parameters of the expert selector. All the process is summarized as an EM algorithm where in the M-step, first, we freeze ν and ω and find µ; then we freeze µ and iterate for finding the local optimum ν and ω; then in the E-step, we find the responsabilities Rin using the new parameters ν, ω and µ. In the beginning, we initialize all parameters randomly. In the following section, we will detail the results of our experiments."

The mixture of experts (MOE) technique makes use of this strategy by joinly training a set of classifiers, or experts, that are specialized in different regions of the input space. A global model, or gate function, complements the experts by learning a function that weights their relevance in different parts of the input space. Local feature selection appears as an attractive alternative to improve the specialization of experts and gate function, particularly, for the case of high dimensional data. Our main intuition is that particular subsets of dimensions, or subspaces, are usually more appropriate to classify instances located in different regions of the input space. Accordingly, this work contributes with a regularized variant of MoE that incorporates an embedded process for local feature selection using L1 regularization, with a simultaneous expert selection. The experiments are still pending.",
