    "abstractText" : "There is an obvious need for improving the per­ formance and accuracy of a Bayesian network as new data is observed. Because of errors in model construction and changes in the dynamics of the domains, we cannot afford to ignore the infor­ mation in new data. While sequential update of parameters for a fixed structure can be accom­ plished using standard techniques, sequential up­ date of network structure is still an open problem. In this paper, we investigate sequential update of Bayesian networks were both parameters and structure are expected to change. We introduce a new approach that allows for the flexible ma­ nipulation of the tradeoff between the quality of the learned networks and the amount of informa­ tion that is maintained about past observations. We formally describe our approach including the necessary modifications to the scoring functions for learning Bayesian networks, evaluate its effec­ tiveness through and empirical study, and extend it to the case of missing data.",
