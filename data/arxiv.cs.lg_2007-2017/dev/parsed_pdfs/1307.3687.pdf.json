INTRODUCTION\nOnline reviews are more and more important factors for customers to decide whether to buy a product or service in online markets. Due to this reason, online review systems have become battle fields for companies to compete with each other by hiring “Internet Water Mercenaries”, which are also known as paid spammers, to post favorable reviews about their products/services and negative reviews about their competitors’. These fake reviews disturb customers’ judgments on the quality of products/services and ruin companies’ reputation. Hence, an always important problem in online review systems is how to accurately obtain the truth of both reviewers (e.g., the reviewer is a spammer or non-spammer) and items (e.g., the product/service is good or bad) according to unreliable online reviews.\nIn previous studies[10], [1], most of the works ignore the function of the underlying topology of ORS. The topology of an online review system is a bipartite graph representing which reviewers can review which items. Many works explicitly or implicitly assume that reviewers can review all the other items, such as the example shown in Fig. 1(a). In fact, a reviewer can only review a subset of items in real-world, which results in constrained connections for each reviewer in the topology. The constrained connections may be because of either the reviewer’s narrow range of interests or the reviewer’s limited attention capacity (that he cannot afford to review all other items). The constrained connections can affect the performance of jointly estimating the truth of reviewers and items. For example, let us consider a simplest online review system that consists of three reviewers and one item. If we assume the majority of reviewers are non-spammers (that is true in real-world), then in the case of Fig. 1(b), from this topology and reviews by each reviewer we can infer with high confidence that the item is probably good and the bottom reviewer is likely to be a spammer. However, in the case of (c), we cannot obtain a high confidence conclusion because we do not know the reviews of the top reviewer.\nThe simple example tells us that different topologies of\nORS along with unreliable reviews contain different amounts of information for jointly estimating the truth of reviewers and items. Actually, connections between reviewers and items act as constraints in such systems. They constrain the joint probability distribution of the truth of reviewer-item pairs they connect. For example, a non-spammer usually gives good (bad) items good (bad) reviews with high probability, which indicates that the truth of a reviewer and the truth of an item he reviewed are related. Hence the topology of the ORS yields a set of constraints that the truth of reviewers and items must obey, and these constraints help to reduce the uncertainty of parameters in the system.\nIn order to compare the amounts of information contained in different topologies (and reviews), we calculate the Bayesian Cramér Rao lower bound (BCRLB) of maximum a posteriori estimator (MAPE) in such systems for different bipartite graph models. We find that BCRLB varies for different topologies. This indicates that for some topologies the truth become much difficult to be estimated by any MAPEs."

      "text" : "Following the existing works[7], [5], [6], we assume that there are a set of reviewers V and a set of items I in an online review system. Each item i ∈ I is associated with a binary label zi ∈ {±1}, which is considered to be a random variable representing the quality of item i, e.g., zi = +1 if item i is good; zi = −1 if i is bad. Each reviewer can choose items to review. A review represents the reviewer’s attitude to an item. If we use rui ∈ {±1} to denote u’s review to i, then rui = +1 (or rui = −1) means that reviewer u considers item i to be good (or bad). However, reviewers are not always accurate to review items, and we use θu ∈ [0, 1] to represent the probability that the reviewer can give correct reviews, i.e., θu = P (rui = zi). In practice, it is reasonable to assume that the majority of reviewers have θu > 0.5. This is achieved by\nputting a prior distribution on θu. A nature choice of such a prior is the beta distribution, i.e., P (θu) ∝ θα−1u (1− θu)β−1, where α > β.\nBe different from previous works, in this work we assume that a reviewer can not freely choose which items to review. The reasons may be the reviewer’s narrow range of interests, limited attention capacity, and so on. If reviewer u can review item i, we connect u and i by an edge (u, i). This forms a bipartite graph G(V, I, E), where E is the set of edges. Furthermore, we use Iu to denote the set of items that u can review, and we use Vi to denote the set of reviewers who can review i.\nTo make the aforementioned model more general, we assume that items to be reviewed by reviewers are chosen independently with replacement constrained by graph G1. This forms a collection of n review samples R = {r1, r2, · · · , rn} where rk denotes the k-th sample representing some reviewer u gives some item i a review rui. Since items are chosen with replacement, we may observe that reviewer u reviews item i many times. We use nxui to represent the number of times u gives i a review x in the samples R. Note that nxui satisfies ∑\nu∈V\n∑\ni∈I\n∑\nx∈{±1} n x ui = n.\nOur goal is to study how G can affect the estimation accuracy when using R to estimate θ = {θu}u∈V and z = {zi}i∈I ."

      "text" : "A convenient way to estimate parameters of the previous model is by considering θ as parameters and z as hidden variables[3]. David and Skene[3] presented an expectation maximization (EM) approach to maximize the likelihood. Here we propose to maximize the posteriori of θ which can include the priori information of θ. That is,\nmax logP (θ|R) = max log ∑\nz\nP (θ, z|R). (1)\nE-Step: In the E-Step, we need to calculate the probability of hidden variables given the other variables P (z|R, θ), which can be factorized to ∏\ni P (zi|R·i, θ). Here R·i ⊆ R denotes the reviews in the samples that are related to item i. If we denote each factor by µi(zi), then we can obtain\nµi(zi) ≡P (zi|R·i, θ) = P (R·i|zi, θ)P (zi|θ)\nP (R·i|θ) (2)\n∝P (zi) ∏\nu∈Vi\nP (Rui|zi, θu) (3)\n=P (zi) ∏\nu∈Vi\nP (rui = zi|zi, θu)n zi ui (4)\n× P (rui = −zi|zi, θu)n −zi ui (5)\n=P (zi) ∏\nu∈Vi\nθ n zi ui u (1 − θui)n −zi ui .

(10)\nHere, Ru· is the set of reviews given by reviewer u. The E-step and M-step of the EM algorithm implicitly defines an estimator of θ, i.e., θ̂MAP = EM(R). Since R is related to G, then θ̂MAP is also related to G. To understand how G can affect the MAP estimator, we go to study the Mean Squared Errors of θ̂MAP = {θ̂u}u∈V ."

(217) in Van Trees’ book [9, Page 73] and obtain the following relationship\nMSE(θ̂u) ≥ [J−1]uu, (11)\nwhere\nJuv = −E [ ∂2 logP (θ|R) ∂θu∂θv ]\n(12)\nis the element (u, v) of Fisher information matrix J . The above relationship requires that θ̂MAP is weakly unbiased[9, Chapter 2], which is unknown for the MAP estimator defined by EM algorithm. However, it is known that under general conditions, for large n, the posterior distribution of θ can be approximated by normal distribution[2], [9], [4], [8]\nP (θ|R) → N (θ̂MAP, I(θ̂MAP)−1) as n → ∞,\nwhere I(θ̂MAP) is the observed Fisher information matrix, and each element (u, v) of I(θ̂MAP) is defined by\n[I(θ̂MAP)]uv = − ∂2 logP (θ|R)\n∂θu∂θv\n∣ ∣ ∣ ∣\nθ=θ̂MAP\n.\nThe above conclusion tells us that θ̂MAP defined by the EM algorithm is a consistent estimator of θ with covariance matrix determined by I. For different G’s, the estimator θ̂MAP will have different covariance matrices. We can compare the estimation errors by evaluating I’s on different bipartite graphs. In the following, we find that I is a diagonal matrix and it can be efficiently computed in combining with the EM procedure."

Accuracy describes the fraction of items that can be corrected inferred.\nThe results are shown in Fig. 2.

In each figure, we generated review samples of different sizes (500 ≤ |R| ≤ 5000), and show accuracy of inferring items averaged over 100 experiments respectively. We observe that when |R| increases, the accuracy also increases and approaches 1. This confirms that the MAPE estimator is asymptotically unbiased. For different graph models, we observe that the accuracy on Grnd is larger than the other two models. This indicates that constrained connections will make the inference performance poor. However, the accuracy curves\non GiPA and GriPA are approximately the same. This indicates that more constrained may not always decrease accuracy. To distinguish the difference of different constrained connections clearly, we study their difference of BCRLBs."

The RMSE decreases approximately with rate 1/n over all the graphs. For different graphs, when n is large (we do not consider BCRLB for small n, because MAPE is biased when n is small), RMSE on GriPA has the largest lower bound, then comes GiPA and RMSE on Grnd has the lowest lower bound. This indicates, when more constraints are added on graphs, the RMSE of any MAPEs will always become worse."
