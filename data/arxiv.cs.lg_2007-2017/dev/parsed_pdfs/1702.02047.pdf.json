      "text" : "The classical model of teaching [15,7] formulates the following interaction protocol between a teacher and a student:\n– Both of them agree on a “classification-rule system”, formally given by a concept class L. – In order to teach a specific concept L ∈ L, the teacher presents to the student a teaching set, i.e., a set T of labeled examples so that L is the only concept in L that is consistent with T . – The student determines L as the unique concept in L that is consistent with T .\nGoldman and Mathias [8] pointed out that this model of teaching is not powerful enough, since the teacher is required to make any consistent learner successful. A challenge is to model powerful teacher/student interactions without enabling unfair “coding tricks”. Intuitively, the term “coding trick” refers to any form of undesirable collusion\nbetween teacher and learner, which would reduce the learning process to a mere decoding of a code the teacher sent to the learner. There is no generally accepted definition of what constitutes a coding trick, in part because teaching an exact learner could always be considered coding to some extent: the teacher presents a set of examples which the learner “decodes” into a concept.\nIn this paper, we adopt the notion of “valid teacher/learner pair” introduced by [8]. They consider their model to be intuitively free of coding tricks while it provably allows for a much broader class of interaction protocols than the original teaching model. In particular, teaching may thus become more efficient in terms of the number of examples in the teaching sets. Further definitions of how to avoid unfair coding tricks have been suggested [18], but they were less stringent than the one proposed by Goldman and Mathias. The latter simply requests that, if the learner hypothesizes concept L upon seeing a sample set S of labeled examples, then the learner will still hypothesize L when presented with any sample set S ∪ S′, where S′ contains only examples labeled consistently with L. A coding trick would then be any form of exchange between the teacher and the learner that does not satisfy this definition of validity.\nThe model of recursive teaching [18,11], which is free of coding tricks according to the Goldman-Mathias definition, has recently gained attention because its complexity parameter, the recursive teaching dimension (RTD), has shown relations to the VCdimension and to sample compression [3,4,12,16], when focusing on finite concept classes. Below though we will give examples of rather simple infinite concept classes with infinite RTD, suggesting that the RTD is inadequate for addressing the complexity of teaching infinite classes.\nIn this paper, we introduce a model called preference-based teaching, in which the teacher and the student do not only agree on a classification-rule system L but also on a preference relation (a strict partial order) imposed on L. If the labeled examples presented by the teacher allow for several consistent explanations (= consistent concepts) in L, the student will choose a concept L ∈ L that she prefers most. This gives more flexibility to the teacher than the classical model: the set of labeled examples need not distinguish a target concept L from any other concept in L but only from those concepts L′ over which L is not preferred.3 At the same time, preference-based teaching yields valid teacher/learner pairs according to Goldman and Mathias’s definition. We will show that the new model, despite avoiding coding tricks, is quite powerful. Moreover, as we will see in the course of the paper, it often allows for a very natural design of teaching sets.\nAssume teacher and student choose a preference relation that minimizes the worstcase number M of examples required for teaching any concept in the class L. This number M is then called the preference-based teaching dimension (PBTD) of L. In particular, we will show the following:\n(i) Recursive teaching is a special case of preference-based teaching where the preference relation satisfies a so-called “finite-depth condition”. It is precisely this additional condition that renders recursive teaching useless for many natural and apparently\n3 Such a preference relation can be thought of as a kind of bias in learning: the student is “biased” towards concepts that are preferred over others, and the teacher, knowing the student’s bias, selects teaching sets accordingly.\nsimple infinite concept classes. Preference-based teaching successfully addresses these shortcomings of recursive teaching, see Section 3. For finite classes, PBTD and RTD are equal.\n(ii) A wide collection of geometric and algebraic concept classes with infinite RTD can be taught very efficiently, i.e., with low PBTD. To establish such results, we show in Section 4 that spanning sets can be used as preference-based teaching sets with positive examples only — a result that is very simple to obtain but quite useful.\n(iii) In the preference-based model, linear sets over N0 with origin 0 and at most k generators can be taught with k positive examples, while recursive teaching with a bounded number of positive examples was previously shown to be impossible and it is unknown whether recursive teaching with a bounded number of positive and negative examples is possible for k ≥ 4. We also give some almost matching upper and lower bounds on the PBTD for other classes of linear sets, see Section 6.\n(iv) The PBTD of halfspaces in Rd is upper-bounded by 6, independent of the dimensionality d (see Section 7), while its RTD is infinite.\n(v) We give full characterizations of concept classes that can be taught with only one example (or with only one example, which is positive) in the preference-based model (see Section 8).\nBased on our results and the naturalness of the teaching sets and preference relations used in their proofs, we claim that preference-based teaching is far more suitable to the study of infinite concept classes than recursive teaching.\nParts of this paper were published in a previous conference version [5]."

      "text" : "N0 denotes the set of all non-negative integers and N denotes the set of all positive integers. A concept class L is a family of subsets over a universe X , i.e., L ⊆ 2X where 2X denotes the powerset of X . The elements of L are called concepts. A labeled example is an element of X ×{−,+}. We slightly deviate from this notation in Section 7, where our treatment of halfspaces makes it more convenient to use {−1, 1} instead of {−,+}, and in Section 8, where we perform Boolean operations on the labels and therefore use {0, 1} instead of {−,+}. Elements of X are called examples. Suppose that T is a set of labeled examples. Let T+ = {x ∈ X : (x,+) ∈ T } and T− = {x ∈ X : (x,−) ∈ T }. A set L ⊆ X is consistent with T if it includes all examples in T that are labeled “+” and excludes all examples in T that are labeled “−”, i.e, if T+ ⊆ L and T− ∩ L = ∅. A set of labeled examples that is consistent with L but not with L′ is said to distinguish L from L′. The classical model of teaching is then defined as follows.\nDefinition 1 ([15,7]). A teaching set for a concept L ∈ L w.r.t. L is a set T of labeled examples such that L is the only concept in L that is consistent with T , i.e., T distinguishes L from any other concept in L. Define TD(L,L) = inf{|T | : T is a teaching set for L w.r.t. L}. i.e., TD(L,L) is the smallest possible size of a teaching set for L w.r.t. L. If L has no finite teaching set w.r.t. L, then TD(L,L) = ∞. The number TD(L) = supL∈LTD(L,L) ∈ N0 ∪ {∞} is called the teaching dimension of L.\nFor technical reasons, we will occasionally deal with the number TDmin(L) = infL∈LTD(L, L), i.e., the number of examples needed to teach the concept from L that is easiest to teach.\nIn this paper, we will examine a teaching model in which the teacher and the student do not only agree on a classification-rule system L but also on a preference relation, denoted as ≺, imposed on L. We assume that ≺ is a strict partial order on L, i.e., ≺ is asymmetric and transitive. The partial order that makes every pair L 6= L′ ∈ L incomparable is denoted by ≺∅. For every L ∈ L, let\nL≺L = {L′ ∈ L : L′ ≺ L}\nbe the set of concepts over which L is strictly preferred. Note that L≺∅L = ∅ for every L ∈ L.\nAs already noted above, a teaching set T of L w.r.t. L distinguishes L from any other concept in L. If a preference relation comes into play, then T will be exempted from the obligation to distinguish L from the concepts in L≺L because L is strictly preferred over them anyway.\nDefinition 2. A teaching set for L ⊆ X w.r.t. (L,≺) is defined as a teaching set for L w.r.t. L \\ L≺L. Furthermore define\nPBTD(L,L,≺) = inf{|T | : T is a teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,≺)} ∈ N0 ∪ {∞} .\nThe number PBTD(L,≺) = supL∈L PBTD(L,L,≺) ∈ N0∪{∞} is called the teaching dimension of (L,≺).\nDefinition 2 implies that\nPBTD(L,L,≺) = TD(L,L \\ L≺L) . (1)\nLet L 7→ T (L) be a mapping that assigns a teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,≺) to every L ∈ L. It is obvious from Definition 2 that T must be injective, i.e., T (L) 6= T (L′) if L and L’ are distinct concepts from L. The classical model of teaching is obtained from the model described in Definition 2 when we plug in the empty preference relation ≺∅ for ≺. In particular, PBTD(L,≺∅) = TD(L).\nWe are interested in finding the partial order that is optimal for the purpose of teaching and we aim at determining the corresponding teaching dimension. This motivates the following notion:\nDefinition 3. The preference-based teaching dimension of L is given by\nPBTD(L) = inf{PBTD(L,≺) : ≺ is a strict partial order on L} .\nA relation R′ on L is said to be an extension of a relation R if R ⊆ R′. The order-extension principle states that any partial order has a linear extension [10]. The following result (whose second assertion follows from the first one in combination with the order-extension principle) is pretty obvious:\nLemma 1. 1. Suppose that ≺′ extends ≺. If T is a teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,≺), then T is a teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,≺′). Moreover PBTD(L,≺′) ≤ PBTD(L, ≺).\n2. PBTD(L) = inf{PBTD(L,≺) : ≺ is a strict linear order on L}.\nRecall that Goldman and Mathias [8] suggested to avoid coding tricks by requesting that any superset S of a teaching set for a concept L remains a teaching set, if S is consistent with L. This property is obviously satisfied in preference-based teaching. A preference-based teaching set needs to distinguish a concept L from all concepts in L that are preferred over L. Adding more labeled examples from L to such a teaching set will still result in a set distinguishing L from all concepts in L that are preferred over L.\nPreference-based teaching with positive examples only. Suppose that L contains two concepts L,L′ such that L ⊂ L′. In the classical teaching model, any teaching set for L w.r.t. L has to employ a negative example in order to distinguish L from L′. Symmetrically, any teaching set for L′ w.r.t. L has to employ a positive example. Thus classical teaching cannot be performed with one type of examples only unless L is an antichain w.r.t. inclusion. As for preference-based teaching, the restriction to one type of examples is much less severe, as our results below will show.\nA teaching set T for L ∈ L w.r.t. (L,≺) is said to be positive if it does not make use of negatively labeled examples, i.e., if T− = ∅. In the sequel, we will occasionally identify a positive teaching set T with T+. A positive teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,≺) can clearly not distinguish L from a proper superset of L in L. Thus, the following holds:\nLemma 2. Suppose that L 7→ T+(L) maps each L ∈ L to a positive teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,≺). Then ≺ must be an extension of ⊃ (so that proper subsets of a set L are strictly preferred over L) and, for every L ∈ L, the set T+(L) must distinguish L from every proper subset of L in L.\nDefine\nPBTD+(L,L,≺) = inf{|T | : T is a positive teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,≺)} . (2)\nThe number PBTD+(L,≺) = supL∈L PBTD+(L,L,≺) (possibly ∞) is called the positive teaching dimension of (L,≺). The positive preference-based teaching dimension of L is then given by\nPBTD+(L) = inf{PBTD+(L,≺) : ≺ is a strict partial order on L} . (3)\nMonotonicity. A complexity measure K that assigns a numberK(L) ∈ N0 to a concept class L is said to be monotonic if L′ ⊆ L implies that K(L′) ≤ K(L). It is well known (and trivial to see) that TD is monotonic. It is fairly obvious that PBTD is monotonic, too:\nLemma 3. PBTD and PBTD+ are monotonic.\nAs an application of monotonicity, we show the following result:\nLemma 4. For every finite subclass L′ of L, we have PBTD(L) ≥ PBTD(L′) ≥ TDmin(L′).\nProof. The first inequality holds because PBTD is monotonic. The second inequality follows from the fact that a finite partially ordered set must contain a minimal element. Thus, for any fixed choice of ≺, L′ must contain a concept L′ such that L′≺L′ = ∅. Hence,\nPBTD(L′,≺) ≥ PBTD(L′,L′,≺) (1)= TD(L′,L′\\L′≺L′) = TD(L′,L′) ≥ TDmin(L′) .\nSince this holds for any choice of ≺, we get PBTD(L′) ≥ TDmin(L′), as desired."

      "heading" : "3 Preference-based versus Recursive Teaching",
      "text" : "The preference-based teaching dimension is a relative of the recursive teaching dimension. In fact, both notions coincide on finite classes, as we will see shortly. We first recall the definitions of the recursive teaching dimension and of some related notions [18,11].\nA teaching sequence for L is a sequence of the form S = (Li, di)i≥1 where L1,L2,L3, . . . form a partition of L into non-empty sub-classes and, for every i ≥ 1, we have that\ndi = sup L∈Li\nTD ( L,L \\ ∪i−1j=1Lj ) . (4)\nIf, for every i ≥ 1, di is the supremum over all L ∈ Li of the smallest size of a positive teaching set for L w.r.t. ∪j≥iLj (and di = ∞ if some L ∈ Li does not have a positive teaching set w.r.t. ∪j≥iLj), then S is said to be a positive teaching sequence for L. The order of a teaching sequence or a positive teaching sequence S (possibly ∞) is defined as ord(S) = supi≥1 di. The recursive teaching dimension of L (possibly ∞) is defined as the order of the teaching sequence of lowest order for L. More formally, RTD(L) = infS ord(S) where S ranges over all teaching sequences for L. Similarly, RTD+(L) = infS ord(S), where S ranges over all positive teaching sequences for L. Note that the following holds for every L′ ⊆ L and for every teaching sequence S = (Li, di)i≥1 for L′ such that ord(S) = RTD(L′):\nRTD(L) ≥ RTD(L′) = ord(S) ≥ d1 = sup L∈L1 TD(L,L′) ≥ TDmin(L′) . (5)\nNote an important difference between PBTD and RTD: while RTD(L) ≥ TDmin (L′) for all L′ ⊆ L, in general the same holds for PBTD only when restricted to finite L′, cf. Lemma 4. This difference will become evident in the proof of Lemma 6.\nThe depth of L ∈ L w.r.t. a strict partial order imposed on L is defined as the length of the longest chain in (L,≺) that ends with the ≺-maximal element L (resp. as ∞ if there is no bound on the length of these chains). The recursive teaching dimension is related to the preference-based teaching dimension as follows:\nLemma 5. RTD(L) = inf≺ PBTD(L,≺) and RTD+(L) = inf≺ PBTD+(L,≺) where ≺ ranges over all strict partial orders on L that satisfy the following “finitedepth condition”: every L ∈ L has a finite depth w.r.t. ≺.\nThe following is an immediate consequence of Lemma 5 and the trivial observation that the finite-depth condition is always satisfied if L is finite:\nCorollary 1. PBTD(L) ≤ RTD(L), with equality if L is finite.\nWhile PBTD(L) and RTD(L) refer to the same finite number when L is finite, there are classes for which RTD is finite and yet larger than PBTD, as Lemma 6 will show. Generally, for infinite classes, the gap betweenPBTD andRTD can be arbitrarily large:\nLemma 6. There exists an infinite class L∞ of VC-dimension 1 such that PBTD+ (L∞) = 1 and RTD(L∞) = ∞. Moreover, for every k ≥ 1, there exists an infinite class Lk such that PBTD+(Lk) = 1 and RTD(Lk) = k.\nProof. We first show that there exists a class of VC-dimension 1, say L∞, such that PBTD+(L∞) = 1 while RTD(L∞) = ∞. To this end, let L∞ be the family of closed half-intervals over [0, 1), i.e., L∞ = {[0, a] : 0 ≤ a < 1}. We first prove that PBTD+(L∞) = 1. Consider the preference relation given by [0, b] ≺ [0, a] iff a < b. Then, for each 0 ≤ a < 1, we have\nPBTD([0, a],L∞,≺) (1) = TD([0, a], {[0, b] : 0 ≤ b ≤ a}) = 1\nbecause the single example (a,+) suffices for distinguishing [0, a] from any interval [0, b] with b < a.\nIt was observed by [12] already that RTD(L∞) = ∞ because every teaching set for some [0, a] must contain an infinite sequence of distinct reals that converges from above to a. Thus, using Equation (5) with L′ = L, we have RTD(L∞) ≥ TDmin(L∞) = ∞.\nNext we show that, for every k ≥ 1, there exists a class, say Lk, such that PBTD+ (Lk) = 1 while RTD(Lk) = k. To this end, let X = [0, 2). For each a ∈ [0, 1), fix a binary representation ∑ n≥1 αn2\n−n of a, where αn ∈ {0, 1} are binary coefficients, and for all i = 1, . . . , k, let 1 ≤ ai < 2 be given by ai = 1 + ∑ n≥0 αkn+i2 −kn+i.4\nLet A be the set of all a ∈ [0, 1) such that if ∑n≥1 αn2−n is the binary representation of a fixed earlier, then for all i ∈ {1, . . . , k}, there is some n ≥ 0 for which αnk+i 6= 0. Finally, let Ia = [0, a] ∪ {a1, . . . , ak} ⊆ X and let Lk = {Ia : 0 ≤ a < 1 ∧ a ∈ A}. Clearly PBTD+(Lk) = 1 because, using the preference relation given by Ib ≺ Ia iff a < b, we can teach Ia w.r.t. Lk by presenting the single example (a,+) (the same strategy as for half-intervals). Moreover, note that Ia is the only concept in Lk that contains a1, . . . , ak, i.e., {a1, . . . , ak} is a positive teaching set for Ia w.r.t. Lk. It follows that RTD(Lk) ≤ TD(Lk) ≤ k. It remains to show that RTD(Lk) ≥ k. To this end, we consider the subclass L′k consisting of all concepts Ia such that a ∈ A and a has only finitely many 1’s in its binary representation (αn)n∈N, i.e., all but finitely\n4 Note that, for a = m 2N\nwith m,N ∈ N, there are two binary representations. We can pick either one to define the αn and ai values.\nmany of the αn are zero. Pick any concept Ia ∈ L′k. Let T be any set of at most k − 1 examples labeled consistently according to Ia. At least one of the positive examples a1, . . . , ak must be missing, say ai is missing. Let Ja,i be the set of indices given by Ja,i = {n ∈ N0 : αkn+i = 0}. The following observations show that there exists some a′ ∈ X \\ {a} such that Ia′ is consistent with T .\n– When we set some (at least one but only finitely many) of the bits αkn+i with n ∈ Ja,i from 0 to 1 (while keeping fixed the remaining bits of the binary representation of a), then we obtain a number a′ 6= a such that Ia′ is still consistent with all positive examples in T (including the example (a,+) which might be in T ).\n– Note that Ja,i is an infinite set. It is therefore possible to choose the bits that are set from 0 to 1 in such a fashion that the finitely many bit patterns represented by the numbers in T− ∩ [1, 2) are avoided.\n– It is furthermore possible to choose the bits that are set from 0 to 1 in such a fashion that the resulting number a′ is as close to a as we like so that Ia′ is also consistent with the negative examples from T− ∩ [0, 1) and a′ ∈ A.\nIt follows from this reasoning that no set with less than k examples can possibly be a teaching set for Ia. Since this holds for an arbitrary choice of a, we may conclude that RTD(Lk) ≥ RTD(L′k) ≥ TDmin(L′k) = k."

      "text" : "The main purpose of this section is to relate positive preference-based teaching to “spanning sets” and “closure operators”, which are well-studied concepts in the computational learning theory literature. Let L be a concept class over the universe X . We say that S ⊆ X is a spanning set of L ∈ L w.r.t. L if S ⊆ L and any set in L that contains S must contain L as well.5 In other words, L is the unique smallest concept in L that contains S. We say that S ⊆ X is a weak spanning set of L ∈ L w.r.t. L if S ⊆ L and S is not contained in any proper subset of L in L.6 We denote by I(L) (resp. I ′(L)) the smallest number k such that every concept L ∈ L has a spanning set (resp. a weak spanning set) w.r.t. L of size at most k. Note that S is a spanning set of L w.r.t. L iff S distinguishes L from all concepts in L except for supersets of L, i.e., iff S is a positive teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,⊃). Similarly, S is a weak spanning set of L w.r.t. L iff S distinguishes L from all its proper subsets in L (which is necessarily the case when S is a positive teaching set). These observations can be summarized as follows:\nI ′(L) ≤ PBTD+(L) ≤ PBTD+(L,⊃) ≤ I(L) . (6)\nThe last two inequalities are straightforward. The inequality I ′(L) ≤ PBTD+(L) follows from Lemma 2, which implies that no concept L can have a preference-based\n5 This generalizes the classical definition of a spanning set [9], which is given w.r.t. intersectionclosed classes only. 6 Weak spanning sets have been used in the field of recursion-theoretic inductive inference under the name “tell-tale sets” [2].\nteaching set T smaller than its smallest weak spanning set. Such a set T would be consistent with some proper subset of L, which is impossible by Lemma 2.\nSuppose L is intersection-closed. Then ∩L∈L:S⊆LL is the unique smallest concept in L containing S. If S ⊆ L0 is a weak spanning set of L0 ∈ L, then ∩L∈L:S⊆LL = L0 because, on the one hand, ∩L∈L:S⊆LL ⊆ L0 and, on the other hand, no proper subset of L0 in L contains S. Thus the distinction between spanning sets and weak spanning sets is blurred for intersection-closed classes:\nLemma 7. Suppose that L is intersection-closed. Then I ′(L) = PBTD+(L) = I(L).\nExample 1. Let Rd denote the class of d-dimensional axis-parallel hyper-rectangles (= d-dimensio- nal boxes). This class is intersection-closed and clearly I(Rd) = 2. Thus PBTD+(Rd) = 2.\nA mapping cl : 2X → 2X is said to be a closure operator on the universe X if the following conditions hold for all sets A,B ⊆ X :\nA ⊆ B ⇒ cl(A) ⊆ cl(B) and A ⊆ cl(A) = cl(cl(A)) .\nThe following notions refer to an arbitrary but fixed closure operator. The set cl(A) is called the closure of A. A set C is said to be closed if cl(C) = C. It follows that precisely the sets cl(A) with A ⊆ X are closed. With this notation, we observe the following lemma.\nLemma 8. Let C be the set of all closed subsets of X under some closure operator cl, and let L ∈ C. If L = cl(S), then S is a spanning set of L w.r.t. C.\nProof. Suppose L′ ∈ C and S ⊆ L′. Then L = cl(S) ⊆ cl(L′) = L′. For every closed set L ∈ L, let scl(L) denote the size (possibly ∞) of the smallest set S ⊆ X such that cl(S) = L. With this notation, we get the following (trivial but useful) result:\nTheorem 1. Given a closure operator, let C[m] be the class of all closed subsets C ⊆ X with scl(C) ≤ m. Then PBTD+(C[m]) ≤ PBTD+(C[m],⊃) ≤ m. Moreover, this holds with equality provided that C[m] \\ C[m− 1] 6= ∅.\nProof. The inequality PBTD+(C[m],⊃) ≤ m follows directly from Equation (6) and Lemma 8. Pick a concept C0 ∈ C[m] such that scl(C0) = m. Then any subset S of C0 of size less than m spans only a proper subset of C0, i.e., cl(S) ⊂ C0. Thus S does not distinguish C0 from cl(S). However, by Lemma 2, any preference-based learner must strictly prefer cl(S) over C0. It follows that there is no positive teaching set of size less than m for C0 w.r.t. C[m].\nMany natural classes can be cast as classes of the form C[m] by choosing the universe and the closure operator appropriately; the following examples illustrate the usefulness of Theorem 1 in that regard.\nExample 2. Let\nLINSETk = {〈G〉 : (G ⊂ N) ∧ (1 ≤ |G| ≤ k)}\nwhere 〈G〉 = {∑ g∈G a(g)g : a(g) ∈ N0 } . In other words, LINSETk is the set of all\nnon-empty linear subsets of N0 that are generated by at most k generators. Note that the mapping G 7→ 〈G〉 is a closure operator over the universe N0. Since obviously LINSETk \\ LINSETk−1 6= ∅, we obtain PBTD+(LINSETk) = k.\nExample 3. Let X = R2 and let Ck be the class of convex polygons with at most k vertices. Defining cl(S) to be the convex closure of S, we obtain C[k] = Ck and thus PBTD+(Ck) = k.\nExample 4. Let X = Rn and let Ck be the class of polyhedral cones that can be generated by k (or less) vectors in Rn. If we take cl(S) to be the conic closure of S ⊆ Rn, then C[k] = Ck and thus PBTD+(Ck) = k."

The relation trcl(RT ) is asymmetric (which clearly implies that RT is asymmetric\ntoo).\nIf T is admissible, then trcl(RT ) is transitive and asymmetric, i.e., trcl(RT ) is a strict partial order on L.

For each concept class L, the following holds:\nPBTD(L) = inf T ord(T ) and PBTD+(L) = inf T+ ord(T+)\nwhere T ranges over all mappings that are admissible for L and T+ ranges over all positive mappings that are admissible for L.\nProof. We restrict ourselves to the proof for PBTD(L) = infT ord(T ) because the equation PBTD+(L) = infT+ ord(T+) can be obtained in a similar fashion. We first prove that PBTD(L)≤ infT ord(T ). Let T be an admissible mapping for L. It suffices to show that, for every L ∈ L, T (L) is a teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,≺T ). Suppose L′ ∈ L\\{L} is consistent with T (L). Then (L′, L) ∈ RT and thus L′ ≺T L. It follows that ≺T prefers L over all concepts L′ ∈ L \\ {L} that are consistent with T (L). Thus T is a teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,≺T ), as desired.\nWe now prove that infT ord(T ) ≤ PBTD(L). Let ≺ be a strict partial order on L and let T be a mapping such that, for every L ∈ L, T (L) is a teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,≺). It suffices to show that T is admissible for L. Consider a pair (L′, L) ∈ RT . The definition of RT implies that L′ 6= L and that L′ is consistent with T (L). Since T (L) is a teaching set w.r.t. (L,≺), it follows that L′ ≺ L. Thus, ≺ is an extension of RT . Since ≺ is transitive, it is even an extension of trcl(RT ). Because ≺ is asymmetric, trcl(RT ) must be asymmetric, too. It follows that T is admissible."

      "text" : "Some work in computational learning theory [1,6,17] is concerned with learning semilinear sets, i.e., unions of linear subsets of Nk for some fixed k ≥ 1, where each linear set consists of exactly those elements that can be written as the sum of some constant vector c and a linear combination of the elements of some fixed set of generators, see Example 2. While semi-linear sets are of common interest in mathematics in general, they play a particularly important role in the theory of formal languages, due to Parikh’s theorem, by which the so-called Parikh vectors of strings in a context-free language always form a semi-linear set [13].\nA recent study [6] analyzed computational teaching of classes of linear subsets of N (where k = 1) and some variants thereof, as a substantially simpler yet still interesting special case of semi-linear sets. In this section, we extend that study to preference-based teaching.\nWithin the scope of this section, all concept classes are formulated over the universe X = N0. Let G = {g1, . . . , gk} be a finite subset of N. We denote by 〈G〉 resp. by 〈G〉+ the following sets:\n〈G〉 =    k∑\ni=1\naigi : a1, . . . , ak ∈ N0    and 〈G〉+ =    k∑\ni=1\naigi : a1, . . . , ak ∈ N    .\nWe will determine (at least approximately) the preference-based teaching dimension of the following concept classes over N0:\nLINSETk = {〈G〉 : (G ⊂ N) ∧ (1 ≤ |G| ≤ k)} . CF-LINSETk = {〈G〉 : (G ⊂ N) ∧ (1 ≤ |G| ≤ k) ∧ (gcd(G) = 1)} . NE-LINSETk = {〈G〉+ : (G ⊂ N) ∧ (1 ≤ |G| ≤ k)} .\nNE-CF-LINSETk = {〈G〉+ : (G ⊂ N) ∧ (1 ≤ |G| ≤ k) ∧ (gcd(G) = 1)} .\nA subset of N0 whose complement in N0 is finite is said to be co-finite. The letters “CF” in CF-LINSET mean “co-finite”. The concepts in LINSETk have the algebraic structure of a monoid w.r.t. addition. The concepts in CF-LINSETk are also known as “numerical semigroups” [14]. A zero coefficient aj = 0 erases gj in the linear combination ∑k i=1 aigi. Coefficients from N are non-erasing in this sense. The letters “NE” in “NE-LINSET” mean “non-erasing”. The shift-extension L′ of a concept class L over the universe N0 is defined as follows: L′ = {c+ L : (c ∈ N0) ∧ (L ∈ L)} . (7)\nThe following bounds on RTD and RTD+ (for sufficiently large values of k)7 are known from [6]:\nRTD+ RTD LINSETk = ∞ ? CF-LINSETk = k ∈ {k − 1, k} NE-LINSET′k = k + 1 ∈ {k − 1, k, k + 1}\nHere NE-LINSET′k denotes the shift-extension of NE-LINSETk . The following result shows the corresponding bounds with PBTD in place of RTD:\nTheorem 2. The bounds in the following table are valid:\nPBTD+ PBTD LINSETk = k ∈ {k − 1, k} CF-LINSETk = k ∈ {k − 1, k} NE-LINSETk ∈ [k − 1 : k] ∈ [⌊ k−1 2 ⌋ : k ] NE-CF-LINSETk ∈ [k − 1 : k] ∈ [⌊ k−1 2 ⌋ : k ]\n7 For instance, RTD+(LINSETk) = ∞ holds for all k ≥ 2 and RTD(LINSETk) = ? (where “?” means “unknown”) holds for all k ≥ 4."

      "heading" : "7 Preference-based Teaching of Halfspaces",
      "text" : "In this section, we study preference-based teaching of halfspaces. We will denote the all-zeros vector as 0. The vector with 1 in coordinate i and with 0 in the remaining coordinates is denoted as ei. The dimension of the Euclidean space in which these vectors reside will always be clear from the context. The sign of a real number x (with value 1 if x > 0, value −1 if x < 0, and value 0 if x = 0) is denoted by sign(x).\nSuppose that w ∈ Rd \\ {0} and b ∈ R. The (positive) halfspace induced by w and b is then given by\nHw,b = {x ∈ Rd : w⊤x+ b ≥ 0} . Instead of Hw,0, we simply write Hw. Let Hd denote the class of d-dimensional Euclidean halfspaces:\nHd = {Hw,b : w ∈ Rd \\ {0} ∧ b ∈ R} .\nSimilarly, H0d denotes the class of d-dimensional homogeneous Euclidean halfspaces:\nH0d = {Hw : w ∈ Rd \\ {0}} .\nLet Sd−1 denote the (d − 1)-dimensional unit sphere in Rd. Moreover S+d−1 = {x ∈ Sd−1 : xd > 0} denotes the “northern hemisphere”. If not stated explicitly otherwise, we will represent homogeneous halfspaces with normalized vectors residing on the unit sphere. We remind the reader of the following well-known fact:\nRemark 1. The orthogonal group in dimension d (i.e., the multiplicative group of orthogonal (d× d)-matrices) acts transitively on Sd−1 and it conserves the inner product.\nWe now prove a helpful lemma, stating that each vector w∗ in the northern hemisphere may serve as a representative for some homogeneous halfspace Hu in the sense that all other elements of Hu in the northern hemisphere have a strictly smaller d-th component than w∗. This will later help to teach homogeneous halfspaces with a preference that orders vectors by the size of their last coordinate.\nLemma 11. Let d ≥ 2, let 0 < h ≤ 1 and let Rd,h = {w ∈ Sd−1 : wd = h}. With this notation the following holds. For every w∗ ∈ Rd,h, there exists u ∈ Rd \\ {0} such that\n(w∗ ∈ Hu) ∧ (∀w ∈ (S+d−1 ∩Hu) \\ {w∗} : wd < h) . (9)\nProof. For h = 1, the statement is trivial, since Rd,1 = {ed}. So let h < 1. Because of Remark 1, we may assume without loss of generality that the vector\nw∗ ∈ Rd,h equals (0, . . . , 0, √ 1− h2, h). It suffices therefore to show that, with this choice of w∗, the vector u = (0, . . . , 0, w∗d,−w∗d−1) satisfies (9). Note that w ∈ Hu iff 〈u,w〉 = w∗dwd−1 −w∗d−1wd ≥ 0. Since 〈u,w∗〉 = 0, we have w∗ ∈ Hu. Moreover, it follows that\nS+d−1 ∩Hu = { w ∈ S+d−1 :\nwd−1 wd ≥ w ∗ d−1 w∗d > 0\n} .\nIt is obvious that no vector w ∈ S+d−1 ∩Hu can have a d-th component wd exceeding w∗d = h and that setting wd = h = w ∗ d forces the settings wd−1 = w ∗ d−1 = √ 1− h2 and w1 = . . . = wd−2 = 0. Consequently, (9) is satisfied, which concludes the proof. With this lemma in hand, we can now prove an upper bound of 2 for the preference-\nbased teaching dimension of the class of homogeneous halfspaces, independent of the underlying dimension d.\nTheorem 3. PBTD(H01) = TD(H01) = 1 and, for every d ≥ 2, we have PBTD(H0d) ≤ 2. Proof. Clearly, PBTD(H01) = TD(H01) = 1 since H01 consists of the two sets {x ∈ R\n: x ≥ 0} and {x ∈ R : x ≤ 0}. Suppose now that d ≥ 2. Let w∗ be the target weight vector (i.e., the weight vector that has to be taught). Under the following conditions, we may assume without loss of generality that w∗d 6= 0:\n– For any 0 < s1 < s2, the student prefers any weight vector that ends with s2 zero coordinates over any weight vector that ends with only s1 zero coordinates. – If the target vector ends with (exactly) s zero coordinates, then the teacher presents only examples ending with (at least) s zero coordinates.\nIn the sequel, we specify a student and a teacher such that these conditions hold, so that we will consider only target weight vectors w∗ with w∗d 6= 0. The student has the following preference relation:\n– Among the weight vectors w with wd 6= 0, the student prefers vectors with larger values of |wd| over those with smaller values of |wd|.\nThe teacher will use two examples. The first one is chosen as { (−ed,−) if w∗d > 0 (ed,−) if w∗d < 0 .\nThis example reveals whether the unknown weight vector w∗ ∈ Sd−1 has a strictly positive or a strictly negative d-th component. For reasons of symmetry, we may assume\nthat w∗d > 0. We are now precisely in the situation that is described in Lemma 11. Given w∗ and h = w∗d , the teacher picks as a second example (u,+) where u ∈ Rd \\ {0} has the properties described in the lemma. It follows immediately that the student’s preferences will make her choose the weight vector w∗.\nThe upper bound of 2 given in Theorem 3 is tight, as is stated in the following lemma.\nLemma 12. For every d ≥ 2, we have PBTD(H0d) ≥ 2. Proof. We verify this lemma via Lemma 4, by providing a finite subclass F of H02 such that TDmin(F) = 2. Let F = {Hw : 0 6= w ∈ {−1, 0, 1}2}. It is easy to verify that each of the 8 halfspaces in F has a teaching dimension of 2 with respect to F . This example can be extended to higher dimensions in the obvious way.\nWe thus conclude that the class of homogeneous halfspaces has a preference-based teaching dimension of 2, independent of the dimensionality d ≥ 2. Corollary 2. For every d ≥ 2, we have PBTD(H0d) = 2.\nBy contrast, we will show next that the recursive teaching dimension of the class of homogeneous halfspaces grows with the dimensionality.\nTheorem 4. For any d ≥ 2, TD(H0d) = RTD(H0d) = d+ 1. Proof. Assume by normalization that the target weight vector has norm 1, i.e., it is taken from Sd−1. Remark 1 implies that all weight vectors in Sd−1 are equally hard to teach. It suffices therefore to show that TD(He1 ,H0d) = d+ 1.\nWe first show that TD(He1 ,H0d) ≤ d + 1. Define u = − ∑d\ni=2 ei. We claim that T = {(ei,+) : 2 ≤ i ≤ d} ∪ {(u,+), (e1,+)} is a teaching set for He1 w.r.t. H0d. Consider any w ∈ Sd−1 such that Hw is consistent with T . Note that wi = 〈ei, w〉 ≥ 0 for all i ∈ {2, . . . , d} and 〈u,w〉 = −∑di=2 wi ≥ 0 together imply that wi = 0 for all i ∈ {2, . . . , d} and therefore w = ±e1. Furthermore, w1 = 〈w, e1〉 ≥ 0, and so w = e1, as required.\nNow we show that TD(He1 ,H0d) ≥ d + 1 holds for all d ≥ 2. It is easy to see that two examples do not suffice for distinguishing e1 ∈ R2 from all weight vectors in S1. In other words, TD(He1 ,H02) ≥ 3. Suppose now that d ≥ 3. It is furthermore easy to see that a teaching set T which distinguishes e1 from all weight vectors in Sd−1 must contain at least one positive example u that is orthogonal to e1. The inequality TD(He1 ,H0d) ≥ d + 1 is now obtained inductively because the example (u,+) ∈ T leaves open a problem that is not easier than teaching e1 w.r.t. the (d− 2)-dimensional sphere {x ∈ Sd−1 : x ⊥ u}.\nWe have thus established that the class of homogeneous halfspaces has a recursive teaching dimension growing linearly with d, while its preference-based teaching dimension is constant. In the case of general (i.e., not necessarily homogeneous) ddimensional halfspaces, the difference between RTD and PBTD is even more extreme. On the one hand, by generalizing the proof of Lemma 6, it is easy to see that RTD(Hd) = ∞ for all d ≥ 1. On the other hand, we will show in the remainder of this section that PBTD(Hd) ≤ 6, independent of the value of d.\nWe will assume in the sequel (by way of normalization) that an inhomogeneous halfspace has a bias b ∈ {±1}. We start with the following result:\nLemma 13. Let w∗ ∈ Rd be a vector with a non-trivial d-th componentw∗d 6= 0 and let b∗ ∈ {±1} be a bias. Then there exist three examples labeled according to Hw∗,b∗ such that the following holds. Every weight-bias pair (w, b) consistent with these examples satisfies b = b∗, sign(wd) = sign(w∗d) and\n{ |wd| ≥ |w∗d| if b∗ = −1 |wd| ≤ |w∗d| if b∗ = +1 . (10)\nProof. Within the proof, we use the label “1” instead of “+” and the label “−1” instead of “−”. The pair (w, b) denotes the student’s hypothesis for the target weight-bias pair (w∗, b∗). The examples shown to the student will involve the unknown quantities w∗ and b∗. Each example will lead to a new constraint on w and b. We will see that the collection of these constraints reveals the required information. We proceed in three stages:\n1. The first example is chosen as (0, b∗). The pair (w, b) can be consistent with this example only if b = −1 in the case that b∗ = −1 and b ∈ {0, 1} in the case that b∗ = 1. 2. The next example is chosen as a2 = − 2b ∗\nw∗ d · ed and labeled “−b∗”. Note that 〈w∗,a2〉+ b∗ = −b∗. We obtain the following new constraint:\n〈w,a2〉+ b =    −2wdw∗ d + ∈{0,1}︷︸︸︷ b < 0 if b∗ = 1 +2wdw∗ d\n+ b︸︷︷︸ =−1\n≥ 0 if b∗ = −1 .\nThe pair (w, b) with b = b∗ if b∗ = −1 and b ∈ {0, 1} if b∗ = 1 can satisfy the above constraint only if the sign of wd equals the sign of w∗d .\n3. The third example is chosen as the example a3 = − b ∗\nw∗ d · ed with label “1”. Note that 〈w∗,a3〉∗ + b∗ = 0. We obtain the following new constraint:\n〈w,a3〉 = − b∗wd w∗d + b ≥ 0 .\nGiven that w is already constrained to weight vectors satisfying sign(wd) = sign( w∗d), we can safely replace wd/w ∗ d by |wd|/|w∗d|. This yields |wd|/|w∗d| ≤ b if b∗ = 1 and |wd|/|w∗d| ≥ −b if b∗ = −1. Since b is already constrained as described in stage 1 above, we obtain |wd|/|w∗d| ≤ b ∈ {0, 1} if b∗ = 1 and |wd|/|w∗d| ≥ −b = 1 if b∗ = −1. The weight-bias pair (w, b) satisfies these constraints only if b = b∗ and if (10) is valid.\nThe assertion of the lemma is immediate from this discussion.\nTheorem 5. PBTD(Hd) ≤ 6.\nProof. As in the proof of Lemma 13, we use the label “1” instead of “+” and the label “−1” instead of “−”. As in the proof of Theorem 3, we may assume without loss\nof generality that the target weight vector w∗ ∈ Rd satisfies w∗d 6= 0. The proof will proceed in stages. On the way, we specify six rules which determine the preference relation of the student.\nStage 1 is concerned with teaching homogeneous halfspaces given by w∗ (and b∗ = 0). The student respects the following rules:\nRule 1: She prefers any pair (w, 0) over any pair (w′, b) with b 6= 0. In other words, any homogeneous halfspace is preferred over any non-homogeneous halfspace.\nRule 2: Among homogeneous halfspaces, her preferences are the same as the ones that were used within the proof of Theorem 3 for teaching homogeneous halfspaces.\nThus, if b∗ = 0, then we can simply apply the teaching protocol for homogeneous halfspaces. In this case, w∗ can be taught at the expense of only two examples.\nStage 1 reduces the problem to teaching inhomogeneous halfspaces given by (w∗, b∗) with b∗ 6= 0. We assume, by way of normalization, that b∗ ∈ {±1}, but note that w∗ can now not be assumed to be of unit (or any other fixed) length.\nIn stage 2, the teacher presents three examples in accordance with Lemma 13. It follows that the student will take into consideration only weight-bias pairs (w, b) such that the constraints b = b∗, sign(wd) = sign(w∗d) and (10) are satisfied. The following rule will then induce the constraint wd = w∗d:\nRule 3: Among the pairs (w, b) such that wd 6= 0 and b ∈ {±1}, the student’s preferences are as follows. If b = −1 (resp. b = 1), then she prefers vectors w with a smaller (resp. larger) value of |wd| over those with a larger (resp. smaller) value of |wd|.\nThanks to Lemma 13 and thanks to Rule 3, we may from now on assume that b = b∗ and wd = w∗d. In the sequel, let w ∗ be decomposed according to w∗ = (w∗d−1, w ∗ d) ∈\nR d−1 ×R. We think of wd−1 as the student’s hypothesis for w∗d−1. Stage 3 is concerned with the special case where w∗d−1 = 0. The student will automatically set wd−1 = 0 if we add the following to the student’s rule system:\nRule 4: Given that the values for wd and b have been fixed already (and are distinct from 0), the student prefers weight-bias pairs with wd−1 = 0 over any weight-bias pair with wd−1 6= 0.\nStage 3 reduces the problem to teaching (w∗, b∗) with fixed non-zero values for wd and b∗ (known to the student) and with w∗d−1 6= 0. Thus, essentially, only w∗d−1 has still to be taught. In the next stage, we will argue that the problem of teaching w∗d−1 is equivalent to teaching a homogeneous halfspace.\nIn stage 4, the teacher will present only examples a such that ad = − b ∗\nw∗ d so that the contribution of the d-th component to the inner product of w∗ and a cancels with the bias b∗. Given this commitment for ad, the first d− 1 components of the examples can be chosen so as to teach the homogeneous halfspace Hw∗\nd−1 . According to Theorem 3,\nthis can be achieved at the expense of two more examples. Of course the student’s preferences must match with the preferences that were used in the proof of this theorem:\nRule 5: Suppose that the values of wd and b have been fixed already (and are distinct from 0) and suppose that wd−1 6= 0. Then the preferences for the choice of wd−1 match with the preferences that were used in the protocol for teaching homogeneous halfspaces.\nAfter stage 4, the student takes into consideration only weight-bias pairs (w, b) such that wd = w∗d , b = b\n∗ and Hwd−1 = Hw∗d−1 . However, since we had normalized the bias and not the weight vector, this does not necessarily mean that wd−1 = w∗d−1. On the other hand, the two weight vectors already coincide modulo a positive scaling factor, say wd−1 = s ·w∗d−1 for some s > 0 . (11) In order to complete the proof, it suffices to teach the L1-norm of w∗d−1 to the student (because (11) and ‖wd−1‖1 = ‖w∗d−1‖1 imply that wd−1 = w∗d−1). The next (and final) stage serves precisely this purpose.\nAs for stage 5, we first fix some notation. For i = 1, . . . , k − 1, let βi = sign(w∗i ). Note that (11) implies that βi = sign(wi). Let L = ‖w∗d−1‖1 denote the L1-norm of w\n∗ d−1. The final example is chosen as a6 = (β1, . . . , βd−1,−(L+b∗)/w∗d) and labeled\n“1”. Note that\n〈w∗,a6〉+ b∗ = |w∗1 |+ . . .+ |w∗d−1| − L = 0 .\nGiven that βi = sign(wi), wd = w∗d and b = b ∗, the student can derive from a6 and its label the following constraint on wd−1:\n〈w,a6〉+ b = |w1|+ . . .+ |wd−1| − L ≥ 0 .\nIn combination with the following rule, we can now force the constraint ‖wd−1‖1 = L: Rule 6: Suppose that the values of wd and b have been fixed already (and are distinct\nfrom 0) and suppose that Hwd−1 has already been fixed. Then, among the vectors representing Hwd−1 , the ones with a smaller L1-norm are preferred over the ones with a larger L1-norm.\nAn inspection of the six stages reveals that at most six examples altogether were shown to the student (three in stage 2, two in stage 4, and one in stage 5). This completes the proof of the theorem.\nNote that Theorems 3 and 5 remain valid when we allow w to be the all-zero vector, which extends H0d by {Rd} and Hd by {Rd, ∅}. Rd will be taught with a single positive example, and ∅ with a single negative example. The student will give the highest preference to Rd, the second highest to ∅, and among the remaining halfspaces, the student’s preferences stay the same.\n8 Classes with PBTD or PBTD+ Equal to One\nIn this section, we will give complete characterizations of (i) the concept classes with a positive preference-based teaching dimension of 1, and (ii) the concept classes with\na preference-based teaching dimension of 1. Throughout this section, we use the label “1” to indicate positive examples and the label “0” to indicate negative examples.\nLet I be a (possibly infinite) index set. We will consider a mapping A : I × I → {0, 1} as a binary matrix A ∈ {0, 1}I×I . A is said to be lower-triangular if there exists a linear ordering ≺ on I such that A(i, i′) = 0 for every pair (i, i′) such that i ≺ i′.\nWe will occasionally identify a set L ⊆ X with its indicator function by setting L(x) = 1[x∈L]. For each M ⊆ X , we define\nM ⊕ L = (L \\M) ∪ (M \\ L)\nand M ⊕ L = {M ⊕ L : L ∈ L} .\nFor T ⊆ X × {0, 1}, we define similarly\nM ⊕ T = {(x, ȳ) : (x, y) ∈ T and x ∈ M} ∪ {(x, y) ∈ T : x /∈ M} .\nMoreover, given M ⊆ X and a linear ordering ≺ on L, we define a linear ordering ≺M on M ⊕ L as follows:\nM ⊕ L′ ≺M M ⊕ L ⇐⇒ M ⊕ (M ⊕ L′)︸ ︷︷ ︸ =L′ ≺ M ⊕ (M ⊕ L)︸ ︷︷ ︸ =L .\nLemma 14. With this notation, the following holds. If the mapping L ∋ L 7→ T (L) ⊆ X×{0, 1} assigns a teaching set toL w.r.t. (L,≺), then the mappingM⊕L ∋ M⊕L 7→ M ⊕ T (L) ⊆ X × {0, 1} assigns a teaching set to M ⊕ L w.r.t. (M ⊕ L,≺M ).\nSince this result is rather obvious, we skip its proof. We say that L and L′ are equivalent if L′ = M ⊕ L for some M ⊆ X (and this\nclearly is an equivalence relation). As an immediate consequence of Lemma 14, we obtain the following result:\nLemma 15. If L is equivalent to L′, then PBTD(L) = PBTD(L′).\nThe following lemma provides a necessary condition for a concept class to have a preference-based teaching dimension of one.\nLemma 16. Suppose thatL ⊆ 2X is a concept class of PBTD1. Pick a linear ordering ≺ on L and a mapping L ∋ L 7→ (xL, yL) ∈ X × {0, 1} such that, for every L ∈ L, {(xL, yL)} is a teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,≺). Then\n– either every instance x ∈ X occurs at most once in (xL)L∈L – or there exists a concept L∗ ∈ L that is preferred over all other concepts in L and xL∗ is the only instance from X that occurs twice in (xL)L∈L.\nProof. Since the mapping T must be injective, no instance can occur twice in (xL)L∈L with the same label. Suppose that there exists an instance x ∈ X and concepts L ≺ L∗ such that x = xL = xL∗ and, w.l.o.g., yL = 1 and yL∗ = 0. Since {(x, 1)} is a teaching\nset for L w.r.t. (L,≺), every concept L′ ≻ L (including the ones that are preferred over L∗) must satisfy L′(x) = 0. For analogous reasons, every concept L′ ≻ L∗ (if any) must satisfy L′(x) = 1. A concept L′ ∈ L that is preferred over L∗ would have to satisfy L′(x) = 0 and L′(x) = 1, which is impossible. It follows that there can be no concept that is preferred over L∗.\nThe following result is a consequence of Lemmas 14 and 16.\nTheorem 6. If PBTD(L) = 1, then there exists a concept class L′ that is equivalent to L and satisfies PBTD(L′) = PBTD+(L′) = 1.\nProof. Pick a linear ordering ≺ on L and, for every L ∈ L, a pair (xL, yL) ∈ X × {0, 1} such that T (L) = {(xL, yL)} is a teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,≺).\nCase 1: Every instance x ∈ X occurs at most once in (xL)L∈L. Then choose M = {xL : yL = 0} and apply Lemma 14. Case 2: There exists a concept L∗ ∈ L that is preferred over all other concepts in L and xL∗ is the only instance from X that occurs twice in (xL)L∈L. Then choose M = {xL : yL = 0 ∧ L 6= L∗} and apply Lemma 14. With this choice, we obtain M ⊕ T (L) = {(xL, 1)} for every L ∈ L \\ {L∗}. Since L∗ is preferred over all other concepts in L, we may teach L∗ w.r.t. (L,≺) by the empty set (instead of employing a possibly 0-labeled example).\nThe discussion shows that there is a class L′ that is equivalent to L and can be taught in the preference-based model with positive teaching sets of size 1 (or size 0 in case of L∗).\nWe now have the tools required for characterizing the concept classes whose positive PBTD equals 1.\nTheorem 7. PBTD+(L) = 1 if and only if there exists a mapping L ∋ L 7→ xL ∈ X such that the matrix A ∈ {0, 1}(L\\{∅})×(L\\{∅}) given by A(L,L′) = L′(xL) is lowertriangular.\nProof. Suppose first that PBTD+(L) = 1. Pick a linear ordering ≺ on L and, for every L ∈ L \\ {∅}, pick xL ∈ X such that {xL} is a positive teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,≺).8 If L ≺ L′ (so that L′ is preferred over L), we must have L′(xL) = 0. It follows that the matrix A, as specified in the theorem, is lower-triangular.\nSuppose conversely that there exists a mapping L ∋ L 7→ xL ∈ X such that the matrix A ∈ {0, 1}(L\\{∅})×(L\\{∅}) given by A(L,L′) = L′(xL) is lower-triangular, say w.r.t. the linear ordering ≺ on L \\ {∅}. Then, for every L ∈ L \\ {∅}, the singleton {xL} is a positive teaching set for L w.r.t. (L,≺) because it distinguishes L from ∅ (of course) and also from every concept L′ ∈ L \\ {∅} such that L′ ≻ L. If ∅ ∈ L, then extend the linear ordering ≺ by preferring ∅ over every other concept from L (so that ∅ is a positive teaching set for ∅ w.r.t. (L,≺)).\n8 Such an xL always exists, even if ∅ is a teaching set for L, because every superset of a teaching set for L that is still consistent withL is still a teaching set for L, cf. the discussion immediately after Lemma 1.\nIn view of Theorem 6, Theorem 7 characterizes every class L with PBTD(L) = 1 up to equivalence.\nLet Sg(X ) = {{x} : x ∈ X} denote the class of singletons over X and suppose that Sg(X ) is a sub-class of L and PBTD(L) = 1. We will show that only fairly trivial extensions of Sg(X ) with a preference-based dimension of 1 are possible.\nLemma 17. Let L ⊆ 2X be a concept class of PBTD 1 that contains Sg(X ). Let T be an admissible mapping for L that assigns a labeled example (xL, yL) ∈ X × {0, 1} to each L ∈ L. For b = 0, 1, let Lb = {L ∈ L : yL = b}. Similarly, let X b = {x ∈ X : y{x} ∈ Lb}. With this notation, the following holds: 1. If L ∈ L1 and L ⊂ L′ ∈ L, then L′ ∈ L1. 2. If L′ ∈ L0 and L′ ⊃ L ∈ L, then L ∈ L0. 3. |X 0| ≤ 2. Moreover if |X 0| = 2, then there exist q 6= q′ ∈ X such that X 0 =\n{q, q′} and x{q} = q′.\nProof. Recall that RT = {(L,L′) ∈ L×L : (L 6= L′)∧(L is consistent with T (L′))} and that RT (and even the transitive closure of RT ) is asymmetric if T is admissible.\n1. If L ∈ L1 and L ⊂ L′, then yL = 1 so that L′ is consistent with the example (xL, yL). It follows that (L′, L) ∈ RT . L′ ∈ L0 would similarly imply that (L,L′) ∈ RT so that RT would not be asymmetric. This is in contradiction with the admissibility of T .\n2. The second assertion in the lemma is a logically equivalent reformulation of the first assertion. 3. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that X 0 contains three distinct points, say q1, q2, q3. Since, for i = 1, 2, 3, T assigns a 0-labeled example to {qi}, at least one of the remaining two points is consistent with T ({qi}). Let G be the digraph with the nodes q1, q2, q3 and with an edge from qj to qi iff {qj} is consistent with T ({qi}). Then each of the three nodes has an indegree of at least 1. Digraphs of this form must contain a cycle so that trcl(RT ) is not asymmetric. This is in contradiction with the admissibility of RT . A similar argument holds if X 0 contains only two distinct elements, say q and q′. If neither x{q} = q′ nor x{q′} = q, then ({q′}, {q}) ∈ RT and ({q}, {q′}) ∈ RT so that RT is not asymmetric — again a contradiction to the admissibility of RT .\nWe are now in the position to characterize those classes of PBTD one that contain all singletons.\nTheorem 8. Suppose that L ⊆ 2X is a concept class that contains Sg(X ). Then PBTD(L) = 1 if and only if the following holds. Either L coincides with Sg(X ) or L contains precisely one additional concept, which is either the empty set or a set of size 2.\nProof. We start with proving “⇐”. It is well known that PBTD+(L) = 1 for L = Sg(X ) ∪ {∅}: prefer ∅ over any singleton set, set T (∅) = ∅ and, for every x ∈ X , set T ({x}) = {(x, 1)}. In a similar fashion, we can show that PBTD(L) = 1 for L = Sg(X )∪{{q, q′}} for any choice of q 6= q′ ∈ X . Prefer {q, q′} over {q} and {q′},\nrespectively. Furthermore, prefer {q} and {q′} over all other singletons. Finally, set T ({q, q′}) = ∅, T ({q}) = {(q′, 0)}, T ({q′}) = {(q, 0)} and, for every x ∈ X \\{q, q′}, set T ({x}) = {(x, 1)}.\nAs for the proof of “⇒”, we make use of the notions T, xL, yL,L0,L1,X 0,X 1 that had been introduced in Lemma 17 and we proceed by case analysis.\nCase 1: X 0 = ∅. Since X 0 = ∅, we have X = X 1. In combination with the first assertion in Lemma 17, it follows that L \\ {∅} = L1. We claim that no concept in L contains two distinct elements. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there is a concept L ∈ L such that |L| ≥ 2. It follows that, for every q ∈ L, x{q} = q and y{q} = 1 so that (L, {q}) ∈ RT . Moreover, there exists q0 ∈ L such that xL = q0 and yL = 1. It follows that ({q0}, L) ∈ RT , which contradicts the fact that RT is asymmetric. Case 2: X 0 = {q} for some q ∈ X . Set q′ = x{q} and note that y{q} = 0. Moreover, since X 1 = X \\ {q}, we have x{p} = p and y{p} = 1 for every p ∈ X \\ {q}. We claim that L cannot contain a concept L of size at least 2 that contains an element of X \\ {q, q′}. Assume for the sake of contradiction, that there is a set L such that |L| ≥ 2 and p ∈ L for some p ∈ X \\ {q, q′}. The first assertion in Lemma 17 implies that yL = 1 (because y{p} = 1 and {p} ⊆ L). Since all pairs (x, 1) with x 6= q are already in use for teaching the corresponding singletons, we may conclude that q ∈ L and T (L) = {(q, 1)}. This contradicts the fact that trcl(RT ) is asymmetric, because our discussion implies that (L, {p}), ({p}, {q}), ({q}, L) ∈ RT . We may therefore safely assume that there is no concept of size at least 2 in L that has a non-empty intersection with X \\ {q, q′}. Thus, except for the singletons, the only remaining sets that possibly belong to L are ∅ and {q, q′}. We still have to show that not both of them can belong to L. Assume for the sake of contradiction that ∅, {q, q′} ∈ L. Since ∅ is consistent with T ({q}) = {(q′, 0)}, we have (∅, {q}) ∈ RT . Clearly, y∅ = 0. Since {q} is consistent with every pair (x, 0) except for (q, 0), we must have x∅ = q. (Otherwise, we have ({q}, ∅) ∈ RT and arrive at a contradiction.) Let us now inspect the possible teaching sets for L = {q, q′}. Since {q, q′} is consistent with T ({q′}) = {(q′, 1)}, setting yL = 0 would lead to a contradiction. The example (q′, 1) is already in use for teaching {q′}. It is therefore necessary to set T (L) = {(q, 1)}. An inspection of the various teaching sets shows that (∅, {q}), ({q}, L), (L, {q′}), ({q′}, ∅) ∈ RT , which contradicts the fact that trcl(RT ) is asymmetric. Case 3: X 0 = {q, q′} for some q 6= q′ ∈ X . Note first that y{q} = y{q′} = 0 and y{p} = 1 for every p ∈ X \\ {q, q′}. We claim that ∅ /∈ L. Assume for the sake of contradiction that ∅ ∈ L. Then (∅, {q}), (∅, {q′}) ∈ RT since ∅ is consistent with the teaching sets for instances from X 0. But then, no matter how x in T (∅) = {(x, 0)} is chosen, at least one of the sets {q} and {q′} will be consistent with T (∅) so that at least one of the pairs ({q}, ∅) and ({q′}, ∅) belongs to RT . This contradicts the fact that RT must be asymmetric. Thus ∅ /∈ L, indeed. Now it suffices to show that L cannot contain a concept of size at least 2 that contains an element of X \\ {q, q′}. Assume\nfor the sake of contradiction that there is a set L ∈ L such that |L| ≥ 2 and p ∈ L for some p ∈ X \\ {q, q′}. Observe that (L, {p}) ∈ RT . Another application of the first assertion in Lemma 17 shows that yL = 1 (because y{p} = 1 and p ∈ L) and xL ∈ {q, q′} (because the other 1-labeled instances are already in use for teaching the corresponding singletons). It follows that one of the pairs ({q}, L) and ({q′}, L) belongs to RT . The third assertion of Lemma 17 implies that T (q) = {(q′, 0)} or T (q′) = {(q, 0)}. For reasons of symmetry, we may assume that T (q) = {(q′, 0)}. This implies that ({p}, {q}) ∈ RT . Let q′′ be given by T (q′) = {(q′′, 0)}. Note that either q′′ = q or q′′ ∈ X \\ {q, q′}. In the former case, we have that ({p}, {q′}) ∈ RT and in the latter case we have that ({q}, {q′}) ∈ RT . Since ({p}, {q}) ∈ RT (which was observed above already), we conclude that in both cases, ({p}, {q}), ({p}, {q′}) ∈ trcl(RT ). Combining this with our observations above that (L, {p}) ∈ RT and that one of the pairs ({q}, L) and ({q′}, L) belongs to RT , yields a contradiction to the fact that trcl(RT ) is asymmetric.\nCorollary 3. Let L ⊆ 2X be a concept class that contains Sg(X ). If PBTD(L) = 1, then RTD(L) = 1.\nProof. According to Theorem 8, eitherL coincides with Sg(X ) or L contains precisely one additional concept that is ∅ or a set of size 2. The partial ordering ≺ on L that is used in the first part of the proof of Theorem 8 (proof direction “⇐”) is easily compiled into a recursive teaching plan of order 1 for L.9\nThe characterizations proven above can be applied to certain geometric concept classes.\nConsider a class L, consisting of bounded and topologically closed objects in the d-dimensional Euclidean space, that satisfies the following condition: for every pair (A,B) ∈ Rd, there is exactly one object in L, denoted as LA,B in the sequel, such that A,B ∈ L and such that ‖A − B‖ coincides with the diameter of L. This assumption implies that |L\\Sg(Rd)| = ∞. By setting A = B, it furthermore implies Sg(Rd) ⊆ L. Let us prefer objects with a small diameter over objects with a larger diameter. Then, obviously, {A,B} is a positive teaching set for LA,B . Because of |L \\ Sg(Rd)| = ∞, L does clearly not satisfy the condition in Theorem 8, which is necessary for L to have a PBTD of 1. We may therefore conclude that PBTD(L) = PBTD+(L) = 2.\nThe family of classes with the required properties is rich and includes, for instance, the class of d-dimensional balls as well as the class of d-dimensional axis-parallel rectangles."

Our examples of algebraic and geometric concept classes demonstrate that preference-based teaching can be achieved very efficiently with naturally defined teaching sets and based on intuitive preference relations such as inclusion. We believe that further studies of the PBTD will provide insights into structural properties of concept classes that render them easy or hard to learn in a variety of formal learning models.\nWe have shown that spanning sets lead to a general-purpose construction for preference-based teaching sets of only positive examples. While this result is fairly obvious, it provides further justification of the model of preference-based teaching, since the teaching sets it yields are often intuitively exactly those a teacher would choose in the classroom (for instance, one would represent convex polygons by their vertices, as in Example 3). It should be noted, too, that it can sometimes be difficult to establish whether the upper bound on PBTD obtained this way is tight, or whether the use of negative examples or preference relations other than inclusion yield smaller teaching sets. Generally, the choice of preference relation provides a degree of freedom that increases the power of the teacher but also increases the difficulty of establishing lower bounds on the number of examples required for teaching.\nAcknowledgements.

We can extend L to a larger class, namely the shift-extension L′ of L, by allowing each of its concepts to be shifted by some constant which is taken from X :\nL′ = {c+ L : (c ∈ X ) ∧ (L ∈ L)} .\nThe next result states that this extension has little effect only on the complexity measures PBTD and PBTD+:\nLemma 18 (Shift Lemma). With the above notation and assumptions, the following holds:\nPBTD(L) ≤ PBTD(L′) ≤ 1+PBTD(L) and PBTD+(L) ≤ PBTD+(L′) ≤ 1+PBTD+(L) .\nProof. It suffices to verify the inequalities PBTD(L′) ≤ 1+PBTD(L) and PBTD+ (L′) ≤ 1 + PBTD+(L) because the other inequalities hold by virtue of monotonicity. Let T be an admissible mapping for L. It suffices to show that T can be transformed into an admissible mapping T ′ for L′ such that ord(T ′) ≤ 1+ord(T ) and such that T ′ is positive provided that T is positive. To this end, we define T ′ as follows:\nT ′(c+ L) = {(c,+)} ∪ {(c+ x, b) : (x, b) ∈ T (L)} .\nObviously ord(T ′) ≤ 1 + ord(T ). Note that c ∈ c+ L because of our assumption that 0 is contained in every concept in L. Moreover, since the admissibility of T implies\nthat L is consistent with T (L), the above definition of T ′(c+L) makes sure that c+L is consistent with T ′(c + L). It suffices therefore to show that the relation trcl(RT ′) is asymmetric. Consider a pair (c′ + L′, c + L) ∈ RT ′ . By the definition of RT ′ , it follows that c′ + L′ is consistent with T ′(c + L). Because of (c,+) ∈ T ′(c + L), we must have c′ ≤ c. Suppose that c′ = c. In this case, L′ must be consistent with T (L). Thus L′ ≺T L. This reasoning implies that (c′ + L′, c+ L) ∈ RT ′ can happen only if either c′ < c or (c′ = c) ∧ (L′ ≺T L). Since ≺T is asymmetric, we may now conclude that trcl(RT ′) is asymmetric, as desired. Finally note that, according to our definition above, the mapping T ′ is positive provided that T is positive. This concludes the proof."

PBTD+(NE-LINSETk) ≤ k.\nProof. We want to show that there is a preference relation for which k positive examples suffice to teach any concept in NE-LINSETk. To this end, let G = {g1, . . . , gℓ} be a generator set with ℓ ≤ k where g1 < . . . < gℓ. We use sum(G) = g1 + . . . + gℓ to denote the sum of all generators in G. We say that gi is a redundant generator in G if gi ∈ 〈 {g1, . . . , gi−1} 〉 . Let G∗ = {g∗1 , . . . , g∗ℓ∗} ⊆ G with g∗1 < . . . < g∗ℓ∗ be the set of non-redundant generators in G and let tuple(G) = (g∗1 , . . . , g ∗ ℓ∗) be the corresponding ordered sequence. Then G∗ is an independent subset of G generating the same linear set as G when allowing zero coefficients, i.e., we have 〈G∗〉 = 〈G〉 (although 〈G∗〉+ 6= 〈G〉+ whenever G∗ is a proper subset of G).\nTo define a suitable preference relation, let G, Ĝ be generator sets of size k or less with tuple(G) = (g∗1 , . . . , g ∗ ℓ∗) and tuple(Ĝ) = (ĝ ∗ 1 , . . . , ĝ ∗ ℓ̂∗ ). Let the student prefer G over Ĝ if any of the following conditions is satisfied:\nCondition 1: sum(G) > sum(Ĝ). Condition 2: sum(G) = sum(Ĝ) and tuple(G) is lexicographically greater than\ntuple (Ĝ) without having tuple(Ĝ) as prefix. Condition 3: sum(G) = sum(Ĝ) and tuple(G) is a proper prefix of tuple(Ĝ).\nTo teach a concept 〈G〉 ∈ NE-LINSETk with sum(G) = g and tuple(G) = (g∗1 , . . . , g ∗ ℓ∗), one uses the teaching set\nS = {(g,+), (g + g∗1 ,+), . . . , (g + g∗h∗ ,+)}\nwhere\nh = { ℓ∗ − 1 if G∗ = G ℓ∗ if G∗ ⊂ G .

Clearly 〈 Ĝ 〉 satisfies sum(Ĝ) =\ng since\n– concepts with larger generator sums are inconsistent with (g,+), and – concepts with smaller generator sums have a lower preference (compare with Con-\ndition 1 above).\nIt follows that g + g∗i ∈ 〈 Ĝ 〉 + is equivalent to g∗i ∈ 〈 Ĝ 〉 = 〈 Ĝ∗ 〉 . We conclude that the smallest generator in tuple(Ĝ) equals g∗1 since\n– a smallest generator in tuple(Ĝ) that is greater than g∗1 would cause an inconsistency with (g + g∗1 ,+), and – a smallest generator in tuple(Ĝ) that is smaller than g∗1 would have a lower preference (compare with Condition 2 above).\nAssume inductively that the i − 1 smallest generators in tuple(Ĝ) are g∗1 , . . . , g∗i−1. Since g∗i /∈ 〈 {g∗1 , . . . , g∗i−1} 〉 , we may apply a reasoning that is similar to the above reasoning concerning g∗1 and conclude that the i’th smallest generator in tuple(Ĝ) equals g∗i . The punchline of this discussion is that the sequence tuple(Ĝ) starts with g ∗ 1 , . . . , g ∗ h with h given by (12).

Note that the lower bound k− 1 in (8) is immediate from (14) and a monotonicity argument. This is because NE-LINSET′k ⊇ NE-CF-LINSET′k as well as LINSET′k ⊇ CF-LINSET′k ⊇ NE-CF-LINSET′k.

Similarly, PBTD+(NE-LINSETk ) ≥ k− 1 follows from (17) and a monotonicity argument. All remaining lower bounds in Theorem 2 are obtained from these observations by virtue of monotonicity.\nThe proof of Theorem 2 can therefore be accomplished by proving Lemma 20. It turns out that the proof of this lemma is quite involved. We will present in Section A.3 some theoretical prerequisites. Sections A.3 and A.3 are devoted to the actual proof of the lemma.\nSome Basic Concepts in the Theory of Numerical Semigroups Recall from Section 6 that 〈G〉 = {∑ g∈G a(g)g : a(g) ∈ N0 } . The elements of G are called generators of 〈G〉. A set P ⊂ N is said to be independent if none of the elements in P can be written as a linear combination (with coefficients from N0) of the remaining elements (so that〈 P ′ 〉 is a proper subset of 〈P 〉 for every proper subset P ′ of P ). It is well known [14] that independence makes generating systems unique, i.e., if P, P ′ are independent, then 〈P 〉 = 〈 P ′ 〉 implies that P = P ′. Moreover, for every independent set P , the following\nimplication is valid:\n(S ⊆ 〈P 〉 ∧ P 6⊆ S) ⇒ (〈S〉 ⊂ 〈P 〉) . (18)\nLet P = {a1, . . . , ak} be independent with a1 = minP . It is well known10 and easy to see that the residues of a1, a2, . . . , ak modulo a1 must be pairwise distinct\n10 E.g., see [14]\n(because, otherwise, we would obtain a dependence). If a1 is a prime and |P | ≥ 2, then the independence of P implies that gcd(P ) = 1. Thus the following holds:\nLemma 21. If P ⊂ N is an independent set of cardinality at least 2 and minP is a prime, then gcd(P ) = 1.\nIn the remainder of the paper, the symbols P and P ′ are reserved for denoting independent sets of generators.\nIt is well known that 〈G〉 is co-finite iff gcd(G) = 1 [14]. Let P be a finite (independent) subset of N such that gcd(P ) = 1. The largest number in N \\ 〈P 〉 is called the Frobenius number of P and is denoted as F (P ). It is well known [14] that\nF ({p, q}) = pq − p− q (19)\nprovided that p, q ≥ 2 satisfy gcd(p, q) = 1.\nProof of (13) The shift-extension of NE-CF-LINSETk is (by way of definition) the following class:\nNE-CF-LINSET′k = {c+〈P 〉+ : (c ∈ N0)∧(P ⊂ N)∧(|P | ≤ k)∧(gcd(P ) = 1)} . (20)\nIt is easy to see that this can be written alternatively in the form\nNE-CF-LINSET′k =   N + 〈P 〉 : N ∈ N0 ∧ P ⊂ N ∧ |P | ≤ k ∧ gcd(P ) = 1 ∧ ∑\np∈P\np ≤ N   \n(21) where N in (21) corresponds to c+ ∑ p∈P p in (20).\nFor technical reasons, we define the following subfamilies of NE-CF-LINSET′k.

We may conclude from (18) that 〈X〉 ⊂ 〈P 〉 and, therefore, L′ ⊂ L. Thus L′ is a proper subset of L which contains S. Note that (22) implies that N ≥ ∑ki=2 ai = ∑k−1 i=1 xi. If\ngcd(X) = 1, then L′ ∈ NE-CF-LINSET[N ] and we have an immediate contradiction to the above assumption (A). Otherwise, if gcd(X) ≥ 2, then we define L′′ = N + 〈 X ∪ {q(P )} 〉 . Note that S ⊆ L′ ⊆ L′′. Since q(P ) > F (P ), we have X ∪ {q(P )} ⊆ 〈P 〉 and, since q(P ) > maxP , we have P 6⊆ X ∪ {q(P )}. We may conclude from (18) that 〈 X ∪ {q(P )} 〉 ⊂ 〈P 〉 and, therefore, L′′ ⊂ L. Thus, L′′ is a proper subset of L which contains S. Because X = {a2, . . . , ak} and q(P ) is a prime that is greater than maxP , it follows that gcd(X ∪ {q(P )}) = 1. In combination with (22), it easily follows now that L′′ ∈ NE-CF-LINSET[N ]. Putting everything together, we arrive at a contradiction to the assumption (A). Case 2: X 6⊆ {a2, . . . , ak}. If ri = 0 for i = 1, . . . , k − 1, then each xi is a multiple of a. In this case, N +〈 a, q(P ) 〉 is a proper subset of L = N+〈P 〉 that is consistent with S, which yields\na contradiction. We may therefore assume that there exists i′ ∈ {1, . . . , k−1} such\nthat ri′ 6= 0. From the case assumption, X 6⊆ {a2, . . . , ak}, it follows that there must exist an index i′′ ∈ {1, . . . , k − 1} such that qi′′ ≥ 1 or tr i′′ /∈ {a2, . . . , ak}. For i = 1, . . . , k − 1, let q′i = min{qi, 1} and x′i = q′ia + tri . Note that q′i′′ = 1 iff qi′′ ≥ 1. Define L′′ = N + 〈 X ′ 〉 for X ′ = {a, x′1, . . . , x′k−1} and observe the following. First, the set L′′ clearly contains S. Second, the choice of x′1, . . . , x ′ k−1 implies that X ′ ⊆ 〈P 〉. Third, it easily follows from q′i′′ = 1 or tri′′ /∈ {a2, . . . , ak} that P 6⊆ {a, x′1, . . . , x′k−1}. We may conclude from (18) that 〈 X ′ 〉 ⊂ 〈P 〉 and, therefore,L′′ ⊂ L. Thus,L′′ is a proper subset of Lwhich containsS. Since ri′ 6= 0 and a is a prime, it follows that gcd(a, x′i′ ) = 1 and, therefore, gcd(X\n′) = 1. In combination with (22), it easily follows now that L′′ ∈ NE-CF-LINSET[N ]. Putting everything together, we obtain again a contradiction to the assumption (A).\nFor the sake of brevity, let L = NE-CF-LINSET′. Assume by way of contradiction that there exists a positive mapping T of order k that is admissible for Lk. We will pursue the following strategy:\n1. We define a set L ∈ Lk of the form L = N + p+ 〈1〉. 2. We define a second set L′ = N + 〈G〉 ∈ L that is (k,N)-special and consistent\nwith T+(L). Moreover, L′ \\ L = {N}.\nIf this can be achieved, then the proof will be accomplished as follows:\n– According to Lemma 22, T+(L′) must contain at least k examples (all of which are different from N ) for distinguishing L′ from all its proper subsets in Lk[N ]. – Since L′ is consistent with T+(L), the set T+(L′) must contain an example which distinguishes L′ from L. But the only example which fits this purpose is (N,+). – The discussion shows that T+(L′) must contain k examples in order to distinguish L′ from all its proper subsets in Lk plus one additional example, N , needed to distinguish L′ from L. – We obtain a contradiction to our initial assumption that T+ is of order k.\nWe still have to describe how our proof strategy can actually be implemented. We start with the definition of L. Pick the smallest prime p ≥ k+1. Then {p, p+1, . . . , p+ k} is independent. Let M = F ({p, p+1}) (19)= p(p+1)−p−(p+1). An easy calculation shows that k ≥ 2 and p ≥ k + 1 imply that M ≥ p + k. Let I = {p, p+ 1, . . . ,M}. Choose N large enough so that all concepts of the form\nN + 〈P 〉 where |P | = k, p = minP and P ⊆ I\nare (k,N)-special. With these choices of p and N , let L = N + p + 〈1〉. Note that N+p,N+p+1 ∈ T+(L) because, otherwise, one of the concepts N+p+1+〈1〉, N+ p + 〈2, 3〉 ⊂ L would be consistent with T+(L) whereas T+(L) must distinguish L from all its proper subsets in Lk. Setting A = {x : N + x ∈ T+(L)}, it follows that |A| = |T+(L)| ≤ k and p, p + 1 ∈ A. The set A is not necessarily independent but it contains an independent subset B such that p, p + 1 ∈ B and 〈A〉 = 〈B〉. Since M = F ({p, p+1}), it follows that any integer greater thanM is contained in 〈p, p+ 1〉. Since B is an independent extension of {p, p+1}, it cannot contain any integer greater\nthan M . It follows that B ⊆ I . Clearly, |B| ≤ k and gcd(B) = 1. We would like to transform B into another generating system G ⊆ I such that\n〈B〉 ⊆ 〈G〉, gcd(G) = 1 and |G| = k .\nIf |B| = k, we can simply set G = B. If |B| < k, then we make use of the elements in the independent set {p, p + 1, . . . , p + k} ⊆ I and add them, one after the other, to B (thereby removing other elements from B whenever their removal leaves 〈B〉 invariant) until the resulting set G contains k elements. We now define the set L′ by setting L′ = N + 〈G〉. Since G ⊆ I = {p, p+1, . . . ,M}, and p, p+1 ∈ G, it follows that p = minG, gcd(G) = 1 and min(L′ \\ {N}) is N + p. Thus, L′ \\ L = {N}, as desired. Moreover, since N had been chosen large enough, the set L′ is (k,N)-special. Thus L and L′ have all properties that are required by our proof strategy and the proof of (13) is complete.\nProof of (14), (15), (16) and (17) We make use of some well known (and trivial) lower bounds on TDmin:\nExample 5. For every k ∈ N, let [k] = {1, 2, . . . , k}, let 2[k] denote the powerset of [k] and, for all ℓ = 0, 1, . . . , k, let\n( [k]\nℓ\n) = {S ⊆ [k] : |S| = ℓ}\ndenote the class of those subsets of [k] that have exactly ℓ elements. It is trivial to verify that\nTDmin\n( 2[k] ) = k and TDmin\n(( [k]\nℓ\n)) = min{ℓ, k − ℓ} .\nIn view of PBTD+(LINSETk) = k, the next results show that negative examples are of limited help only as far as preference-based teaching of concepts from LINSETk is concerned:\nLemma 23. For every k ≥ 1 and for all ℓ = 0, . . . , k − 1, let\nLk = {〈k, p1, . . . , pk−1〉 : pi ∈ {k + i, 2k + i}} , Lk,ℓ = {{〈k, p1, . . . , pk−1〉 ∈ Lk : |{i : pi = k + i}| = ℓ} .\nWith this notation, the following holds:\nTDmin(Lk) ≥ k − 1 and TDmin(Lk,ℓ) ≥ min{ℓ, k − 1− ℓ} .\nProof. For k = 1, the assertion in the lemma is vacuous. Suppose therefore that k ≥ 2. An inspection of the generators k, p1, . . . , pk−1 with pi ∈ {k + i, 2k + i} shows that\nLk = {Lk,S : S ⊆ {k + 1, k + 2, . . . , 2k − 1}} Lk,ℓ = {Lk,S : (S ⊆ {k + 1, k + 2, . . . , 2k − 1}) ∧ (|S| = ℓ)}\nwhere Lk,S = {0, k} ∪ {2k, 2k+ 1, . . .} ∪ S .\nNote that the examples in {0, 1, . . . , k} ∪ {2k, 2k + 1, . . . , } are redundant because they do not distinguish between distinct concepts from Lk. The only useful examples are therefore contained in the interval {k + 1, k + 2, . . . , 2k − 1}. From this discussion, it follows that teaching the concepts of Lk (resp. of Lk,ℓ) is not essentially different from teaching the concepts of 2[k−1] ( resp. of ( [k−1]\nℓ\n)) . This completes the proof\nof the lemma because we know from Example 5 that TDmin(2[k−1]) = k − 1 and TDmin (( [k−1]\nℓ\n)) = min{ℓ, k − 1− ℓ}.\nWe claim now that the inequalities (14), (15) and (16) are valid, i.e., we claim that the following holds:\n1. PBTD(CF-LINSETk) ≥ k − 1. 2. PBTD(NE-CF-LINSETk) ≥ ⌊(k − 1)/2⌋. 3. PBTD(NE-CF-LINSET′k) ≥ k − 1.\nProof. For k = 1, the inequalities are obviously valid. Suppose therefore that k ≥ 2. 1. Since gcd(k, k + 1) = gcd(k, 2k + 1) = 1, it follows that Lk is a finite subclass\nof CF-LINSETk. Thus PBTD(CF-LINSETk) ≥ PBTD(Lk) ≥ TDmin(Lk) ≥ k − 1. 2. Define Lk[N ] = {N +L : L ∈ Lk} and Lk,ℓ[N ] = {N +L : L ∈ Lk,ℓ}. Clearly TDmin(Lk[N ]) = TDmin(Lk) and TDmin(Lk,ℓ[N ]) = TDmin(Lk,ℓ) holds for every N ≥ 0. It follows that the lower bounds in Lemma 23 are also valid for the classes Lk[N ] and Lk,ℓ[N ] in place of Lk and Lk,ℓ, respectively. Let\nN(k) = k2+(k−1−⌊(k−1)/2⌋)k+ k−1∑\ni=1\ni = k2+(k−1−⌊(k−1)/2⌋)k+1 2 (k−1)k .\n(23) It suffices to show that N(k)+Lk,⌊(k−1)/2⌋ is a finite subclass ofNE-CF-LINSETk. To this end, first note that\n〈k, p1, . . . , pk−1〉+ = k + k−1∑\ni=1\npi + 〈k, p1, . . . , pk−1〉 .\nCall pi “light” if pi = k + i and call it “heavy” if pi = 2k + i. Note that a concept L from N(k) + Lk,ℓ is of the general form\nL = N(k) + 〈k, p1, . . . , pk−1〉 (24)\nwith exactly ℓ light parameters among p1, . . . , pk−1. A straightforward calculation shows that, for ℓ = ⌊(k − 1)/2⌋, the sum k + ∑k−1i=1 pi equals the number N(k) as defined in (23). Thus, the concept L from (24) with exactly ⌊(k − 1)/2⌋ light parameters among {p1, . . . , pk−1} can be rewritten as follows:\nL = N(k) + 〈k, p1, . . . , pk−1〉 = 〈k, p1, . . . , pk−1〉+ .\nThis shows that L ∈ NE-CF-LINSETk. As L is a concept from N(k)+ Lk,⌊(k−1)/2⌋ in general form, we may conclude that N(k)+Lk,⌊(k−1)/2⌋ is a finite subclass of NE-CF-LINSETk, as desired. 3. The proof of the third inequality is similar to the above proof of the second one. It suffices to show that, for every k ≥ 2, there exists N ∈ N such that N + Lk is a subclass of NE-CF-LINSET′k. To this end, we set N = 3k\n2. A concept L from 3k2 + Lk is of the general form\nL = 3k2 + 〈k, p1, . . . , pk−1〉\nwith pi ∈ {k+ i, 2k+ i} (but without control over the number of light parameters). It is easy to see that the constant 3k2 is large enough so that L can be rewritten as\nL = 3k2 −  k + k−1∑\ni=1\npi  + 〈k, p1, . . . , pk−1〉+\nwhere 3k2 − ( k + ∑k−1 i=1 pi ) ≥ 0. This shows that L ∈ NE-CF-LINSET′k. As L is a concept from 3k2 + Lk in general form, we may conclude that 3k2 + Lk is a finite subclass of NE-CF-LINSET′k, as desired.\nWe conclude with the proof of the inequality (17).\nLemma 24. PBTD+(NE-LINSETk) ≥ PBTD+(NE-CF-LINSETk) ≥ k − 1.\nProof. The class NE-CF-LINSET1 contains onlyN, and soPBTD +(NE-CF-LINSET1) = 0. The class NE-CF-LINSET2 contains at least two members so that PBTD + (NE-CF-LINSET2) ≥ 1. Now assume k ≥ 3. Set\nN =\nk−1∑\ni=0\n(k + i)\nand\nL = 〈k, k + 1, . . . , 2k − 1〉+ = N+〈k, k + 1, . . . , 2k − 1〉 = {N}∪{N+k,N+k+1, . . .} .\nChoose and fix an arbitrary set S ⊆ L of size k − 2. It suffices to show S is not a weak spanning set for L w.r.t. NE-CF-LINSETk. If S does not contain N , then the set\nL′ = 〈N + k − 1, 1〉+ = L \\ {N}\nsatisfies S ⊂ L′ ⊂ L so that S cannot be a weak spanning set for L. Suppose therefore from now on that N ∈ S. We proceed by case analysis:\nCase 1: k = 3. Then N = 12, L = 12+ 〈3, 4, 5〉 = {12}∪ {15, 16, 17, . . .}. Moreover |S| = 1 so that S = {12}. Now the set L′ = 〈5, 7〉+ = 12 + 〈5, 7〉 satisfies S ⊂ L′ ⊂ L so that S cannot be a weak spanning set for L.\nCase 2: k = 4. Then N = 22, L = 22 + 〈4, 5, 6, 7〉 = {22} ∪ {26, 27, 28, . . .}. Moreover |S| = 2 so that S = {22} ∪ {26+ x} for some x ≥ 0. Let a = (x mod 4) ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}. It is easy to check that the set\nL′ =    22 + 〈4, 5, 13〉 if a ∈ {0, 1} 22 + 〈4, 7, 11〉 if a = 3 22 + 〈5, 6, 11〉 if x = a = 2 22 + 〈4, 5, 13〉 if x > a = 2\nsatisfies S ⊂ L′ ⊂ L so that S cannot be a weak spanning set for L. Case 3: k ≥ 5.\nThen the set S has the form S = {N} ∪ {N + k + x1, . . . , N + k + xk−3} for distinct integers x1, . . . , xk−3 ≥ 0. For i = 1, . . . , k − 3, let ai = (xi mod k) ∈ {0, . . . , k − 1}. The the set\nL′ = N + 〈 k, k + a1, . . . , k + ak−3, N − (k − 2)k − (a1 + . . .+ ak−3) 〉\nsatisfies S ⊂ L′ ⊂ L so that S cannot be a weak spanning set for L.\nIn any case, we came to the conclusion that a subset of L with only k − 2 elements cannot be a weak spanning set for L w.r.t. NE-CF-LINSETk."

Although the PBTD coincides with the well-known recursive teaching dimension (RTD) on finite classes, it is radically different on infinite ones: the RTD becomes infinite already for trivial infinite classes (such as half-intervals) whereas the PBTD evaluates to reasonably small values for a wide collection of infinite classes including classes consisting of so-called closed sets w.r.t. a given closure operator, including various classes related to linear sets over N0 (whose RTD had been studied quite recently) and including the class of Euclidean half-spaces. On top of presenting these concrete results, we provide the reader with a theoretical framework (of a combinatorial flavor) which helps to derive bounds on the PBTD.",
