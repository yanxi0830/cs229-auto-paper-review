      "text" : "In the general problem of matrix completion, we seek to recover a structured matrix from noisy and partial measurements. This problem class encompasses a wide range of practically important applications such as recommendation systems, recovering gene–protein interactions, and analyzing document collections in language processing, among others. In recent years, leveraging developments in sparse estimation and compressed sensing, there has been a surge of work on computationally tractable estimators with strong statistical guarantees, specifically for the setting where a subset of entries of a low–rank matrix are observed either deterministically, or perturbed by additive noise that is Gaussian Candes and Plan (2010), or more generally sub–Gaussian Keshavan et al. (2010b); Negahban and Wainwright (2012). While such a Gaussian noise model is amenable to the subtle statistical analyses required for the ill–posed problem of matrix completion, it is not always practically suitable for all data settings encountered in matrix completion problems. For instance, such a Gaussian error model might not be appropriate in recommender systems based on movie ratings that are either binary (likes or dislikes), or range over the integers one through five. The first question we ask in this paper is whether we can generalize the statistical estimators for matrix completion as well as their analyses to general noise models? Note that a noise model captures the uncertainty underlying the matrix measurements, and is thus an important component of the problem specification\ngiven any application; and it is thus vital for broad applicability of the class of matrix completion estimators to extend to general noise models.\nThough this might seem like a narrow technical, although important question, it is related to a broader issue. A Gaussian observation model implicitly assumes the matrix values are continuous– valued (and that they are thin–tail–distributed). But in modern applications, matrix data span the gamut of heterogeneous data–types, for instance, skewed–continuous, categorical–discrete including binary, count–valued, among others. This, thus gives rise to the second question of whether we can generalize the standard matrix completion estimators and statistical analyses, suited for thin– tailed continuous data, to more heterogeneous data–types? Note that there has been some recent work for the specific case of binary data by Davenport et al. (2012), but generalizations to other data–types and distributions is largely unexplored.\nThe recent line of work on matrix completion, moreover, enforces the constraint that the underlying matrix be either exactly or approximately low–rank. Aside from the low–rank constraints, further assumptions to eliminate overly “spiky” matrices are required for well–posed recovery under partial measurements Candes and Recht (2009). Early work provided generalization error bounds for various low–rank matrix completion algorithms, including algorithms based on nuclear norm minimization Candes and Recht (2009); Candes and Tao (2010); Candes and Plan (2010); Recht (2011), max–margin matrix factorization Srebro et al. (2004), spectral algorithms Keshavan et al. (2010a,b), and alternating minimization Jain et al. (2013). These work made stringent matrix incoherence assumptions to avoid “spiky” matrices. These assumptions have been made less stringent in more recent results Negahban and Wainwright (2012), which moreover extend the guarantees to approximately low–rank matrices. Such (approximate) low–rank structure is one instance of general structural constraints which are now understood to be necessary for consistent statistical estimation under high–dimensional settings (with very large number of parameters and very few observations). Note that the high–dimensional matrix completion problem is particularly ill–posed, since the measurements are typically both very local (e.g. individual matrix entries), and partial (e.g. covering a decaying fraction of entries of the entire matrix). However, the specific (approximately) low–rank structural constraint imposed in the past work on matrix completion does not capture the rich variety of other qualitatively different structural constraints such as row–sparseness, column–sparseness, or a superposition structure of low–rank plus elementwise sparseness, among others. For instance, in the classical introductory survey on matrix completion Laurent (2009), the authors discuss structural constraints of a contraction matrix, and a Euclidean distance matrix. Thus, the third question we ask in this paper is whether we can generalize the recent line of work on low–rank matrix completion to the more general structurally constrained case.\nIn this paper, we answer all of the three questions above in the affirmative, and provide a vastly unified framework for generalized matrix completion. We address the first two questions by considering a general matrix completion setting wherein observed matrix entries are sampled from any member of a rich family of natural exponential family distributions. Note that this family of distributions encompass a wide variety of popular distributions including Gaussian, Poisson, binomial, negative–binomial, Bernoulli, etc. Moreover, the choice of the exponential family distribution can be made depending on the form of the data. For instance, thin–tailed continuous data is typically modeled using the Gaussian distribution; count–data is modeled through an appropriate distribution over integers (Poisson, binomial, etc.), binary data through Bernoulli, categorical–discrete through multinomial, etc. We address the last question by considering general structural constraints upon the underlying matrix, as captured by a general regularization function R(.). Our general matrix\ncompletion setting thus captures heterogeneous noise–channels, for heterogeneous data–types, and heterogeneous structural constraints.\nIn a key contribution, we propose a simple regularized convex M–estimator for recovering the structurally constrained underlying matrix in this general setting; and moreover provide a unified and novel statistical analysis for our general matrix completion problem. Following a standard approach Negahban (2012), we (a) first showed that the negative log–likelihood of the subset of observed entries satisfies a form of Restricted Strong Convexity (RSC) (Definition 4); and (b) under this RSC condition, our proposed M–estimator satisfies strong statistical guarantees. We note that proving these individual components for our general matrix completion problem under general structural constraints required a fairly delicate and novel analysis, particularly the first component of showing the RSC condition, which we believe would be of independent interest. A key corollary of our general framework is matrix completion under sub–Gaussian samples and low–rank constraints, where we show that our theorem recovers results comparable to the existing literature Candes and Plan (2010); Keshavan et al. (2010b); Negahban and Wainwright (2012). Finally, we corroborate our theoretical findings via simulated experiments."

Matrices are denoted by capital letters, X, Θ, M , etc. For a matrix M , Mj and M (i) are the jth column and ith row of M respectively, and Mij denotes the (i, j)th entry of M . The transpose, trace, and rank of a matrix M are denoted by M †, tr(M), and rk(M), respectively. The inner product between two matrices is given by 〈X,Y 〉 = tr(X†Y ) =∑(i,j)XijYij .\nFor a matrix M ∈ Rm×n of rank r, with singular values σ1 ≥ σ2 ≥ . . . σr, commonly used matrix norms include the nuclear norm ‖M‖∗ = ∑ i σi, the spectral norm ‖M‖2 = σ1, the Frobenius\nnorm ‖M‖F = √∑ i σ 2 i , and the maximum norm ‖M‖max = max(i,j) Mij .\nGiven any matrix norm ‖ · ‖, the dual norm, ‖ · ‖∗ is given by ‖X‖∗ = sup‖Y ‖≤1〈X,Y 〉. Definition 1 (Natural Exponential Family). A distribution of a random variable X, in a normed vector space is said to belong to the natural exponential family, if its probability density function, characterized by the parameter Θ in the dual vector space, is given by:\nP (X|Θ) = h(X) exp ( 〈X,Θ〉 −G(Θ) ) ,\nwhere G(Θ) = log ∫ X h(X)e\n〈X,Θ〉dX, called the log–partition function, is strictly convex, and analytic.\nDefinition 2 (Bregman Divergence). Let φ : dom(φ) → R be a strictly convex function differentiable in the relative interior of dom(φ). The Bregman divergence (associated with φ) between x ∈ dom(φ) and y ∈ ri(dom(φ)) is defined as:\nBφ(x, y) = φ(x)− φ(y)− 〈∇φ(y), x− y〉.\nDefinition 3 (Subspace compatibility constants). Given a matrix norm R(.), we define the following maximum and minimum subspace compatibility constants of R(.) w.r.t the subspace M:\nΨ(M;R) = sup Θ∈M\\{0} R(Θ) ‖Θ‖F , Ψmin(R) = inf Θ 6={0} R(Θ) ‖Θ‖F .\nThus, ∀Θ ∈ M Ψmin(R)‖Θ‖F ≤ R(Θ) ≤ Ψ(M,R)‖Θ‖F .\nIn the rest of the paper, to avoid notational clutter, the dependence of Ψ and Ψmin on R is suppressed. Thus, Ψ(M;R) and Ψmin(R) are denoted as Ψ(M) and Ψmin, respectively. Definition 4 (Restricted Strong Convexity). A loss function L is said to satisfy Restricted Strong Convexity with respected to a subspace S, if for some µL > 0,\nL(Θ +∆)− L(Θ)− 〈∇L(Θ),∆〉 ≥ µL‖∆‖2F ,∀∆ ∈ S.\nDefinition 5 (Sub–Gaussian Distributions). A mean zero random variable X is said to have a sub– Gaussian distribution with parameter b if ∀ s > 0, the distribution satisfies E[esX ] ≤ es2b2/2. Further, if X is sub–Gaussian with parameter b and E[X] = 0, then Var(X) ≤ b2 (Vershynin (2010))."

Consider the random matrix X ∈ Rm×n, where each entry Xij is drawn independently from the corresponding distribution in (1); it can be seen that: P (X|Θ∗) = ∏\nij\n( h(Xij) exp ( XijΘ ∗ ij −G(Θ∗ij) ))\n= h(X) exp (〈X,Θ∗〉 −G(Θ∗)) , (2) where we overload the notation to denote G : Rm×n → R as G(Θ) = ∑ij G(Θij), and the base measure h(X) as h(X) = ∏ ij h(xij).\nUniformly Sampled Observations: In a “fully observed” setting, we would observe all the entries of the observation matrix X ∈ Rm×n. However, we consider a partially observed setting, where we observe entries over a subset of indices Ω ⊂ [m] × [n]. We assume a uniform sampling model, so that ∀ (i, j) ∈ Ω, i ∼ uniform([m]), j ∼ uniform([n]). (3) Note that, under the above described sampling scheme, an index (i, j) can be sampled multiple times, in such cases we include the multiple instances of (i, j) in Ω (and not just the unique indices in Ω). Given Ω, we define the following matrix PΩ(X) as\nPΩ(X) = ∑\n(i,j)∈Ω Xijeie\n† j.\nThe matrix completion task can then be stated as the estimation of Θ∗ from (Ω,PΩ(X)), where X ∼ P (X|Θ∗). As noted earlier, this problem is ill–posed in general.

      "text" : "We consider the standard matrix–completion setting where the distribution of the observation matrix X in (2) corresponds to its entries Xij being drawn independently from the other entries. Further, the probability of observing a specific entry Xij , under uniform sampling is independent of the noise channel or the distribution P (Xij |Θ∗ij). However, in some applications, it might be beneficial to have a sampling scheme involving dependencies; for instance, when a user gives a movie a bad rating, we might want to vary the sampling scheme to sample an entirely different region of the matrix. It would be interesting to extend the analysis of this paper to such a dependent sampling setting.\nThe form of the observation random matrix distribution in (2), given the individual observations in (1), can be seen to have connotations of multi–task learning: here recovering each individual matrix entry Θ∗ij together with its corresponding noise model forms a single task, and all these tasks can be performed jointly given the shared structural constraint on Θ∗. It would be interesting to generalize this to form a more general statistical framework for partial multi-task learning.\nWe use the general class of exponential family distributions as the underlying probabilistic model capturing the measurement uncertainties. The richness of the class of exponential family distributions has been used in other settings to provide general statistical frameworks. Kakade et al. (2010) provide a generalization of compressed sensing problem to general exponential family distributions. Note however that results from compressed sensing cannot be immediately extended to matrix completion case, since the sampling operator PΩ does not satisfy\nthe typical assumptions (restricted isometry or restricted eigenvalues) made in such settings; see (Candes and Recht, 2009) for additional discussion. There have been extensions of classical probabilistic PCA Tipping and Bishop (1999) from Gaussian noise models to exponential family distributions Collins et al. (2001); Mohamed et al. (2008); Gordon (2002). There have also been recent extensions of probabilistic graphical model classes, beyond Gaussian and Ising models, to multivariate extensions of exponential family distributions (Yang et al., 2012, 2013).\nMore complicated probabilistic models have also been proposed in the context of collaborative filtering Mnih and Salakhutdinov (2007); Salakhutdinov and Mnih (2008), but these typically involve non–convex optimization, and it is difficult to extend the rigorous statistical analyses of the form in this paper (and in the matrix completion literature) to these models."

      "text" : "As noted in the introduction, we consider the matrix completion setting with general structural constraints on the underlying target matrix Θ∗. To formalize the notion of such structural constraints, we follow (Negahban, 2012), and assume that Θ∗ satisfies Θ∗ ∈ M ⊆ M ⊂ Rm×n, for some subspace M ⊆ M, which contains parameter matrices that are structured similar to the target (the corresponding structural constraints such as low rankness, low rankness+sparsity etc); we also allow the flexibility of working with a superset M of the model subspace that is potentially easier to analyze. Moreover, we use their definition of a decomposable norm regularization function, R(.) : Rm×n → R+, which suitably captures these structural constraints: Assumption 1. (Decomposable Norm Regularizer) We assume that R(.) is a matrix norm, and is decomposable over (M,M⊥), i.e. if X ∈ M, Y ∈ M⊥, then,\nR(X + Y ) = R(X) +R(Y ). We provide some examples of such decomposable regularizers and structural constraint subspaces, and refer to (Negahban, 2012) for more examples and discussion. Example 1. Low–rank: This is a common structure assumed in numerous matrix estimation problems, particularly those in collaborative filtering, PCA, spectral clustering, etc. The corresponding structural constraint subspaces (M,M⊥) in this case correspond to a linear span of specific one–rank matrices; we discuss these in further detail in Section 3.2, where we derive a corollary of our general theorem to the specific case of recovery guarantees for low–rank constrained matrix completion. The nuclear norm R(Θ) = ‖Θ‖∗ = ∑ k σk, has been shown to be decomposable with respect to these constraint subspaces Fazel et al. (2001). Example 2. Block sparsity: Another important structural constraint for a matrix is block– sparsity, where each row is either all zeros or mostly non–zero, and the number of non–zero rows is small. The structural constraint subspaces in this case correspond to a linear span of specific Frobenius–norm–one matrices that are non–zero in a small subset of the rows (dependent on Θ∗); it has been shown that ℓ1/ℓq (q > 1) norms Negahban and Wainwright (2008); Obozinski et al. (2011) are decomposable with respect to such structural constraint subspaces. Recalling that Θ(i) is the ith row of Θ, the ℓ1/ℓq norm is defined as:\n‖Θ‖1,q = m∑\ni=1\n‖Θ(i)‖q = m∑\ni=1\n[( n∑\nj=1\n|Θij |q )1/q] .\nExample 3. Low–rank plus sparse: This structure is often used to model low–rank matrices which are corrupted by a sparse outlier noise matrix. The structural constraint subspaces corre-\nsponding to these consist of the linear span of weighted sum of specific rank–one matrices and sparse matrices with non–zero components on specified positions; and appropriate regularization function decomposable with respect to such structural constraints is the infimum convolution of the weighted nuclear norm with weighted elementwise ℓ1 norm, ‖M‖1,1 = ∑ ij |Mij | Candes et al. (2011); Yang and Ravikumar (2013): R(Θ) = inf{λ1‖S‖1,1 + λ2‖L‖∗ : Θ = S + L}.\nThe second assumption we make is on the curvature of the log–partition function. This is required to establish a form of RSC (Definition 4) for the loss function.\nAssumption 2. The second derivative of the log–partition function G : R → R has atmost an exponential decay, i.e,\n∇2G(u) ≥ e−η|u|, ∀ u ∈ R, for some η > 0 It can be verified that commonly used members of natural exponential family obey this assump-\ntion.\nFinally, we make an assumption to avoid “spiky” target matrices. As Candes and Recht (2009) show with numerous examples, low–rank and presumably other such structural constraints as above, by themselves are not sufficient for accurate recovery, in part due to the infeasibility of recovering overly “spiky” matrices with very few large entries. Early work Candes and Plan (2010); Keshavan et al. (2010a,b), assumed stringent matrix incoherence conditions to preclude such matrices, while more recent work Davenport et al. (2012); Negahban and Wainwright (2012), relax these assumptions to restricting the spikiness ratio, defined as follows:\nαsp(Θ) = √ mn‖Θ‖max ‖Θ‖F . (5)\nAssumption 3.

However, showing such an RSC condition for our general loss function over a subset of structured matrix entries involved some delicate arguments. Further, we provide a much simpler proof that moreover only required a low–spikiness condition rather than a multiplicative spikiness and structural constraint.

The observation matrices, X, are then sampled from the different members of exponential family distributions parameterized by Θ∗. For each n, we uniformly sample a subset Ω entries of the observation matrix X, and estimate Θ̂ from (6). Evaluation: For each member of the exponential family of distributions considered, we can measure the performance of our M–estimator in parameter space as ‖Θ̂−Θ∗‖2F ‖Θ∗‖2F , or in observation space using an appropriate error metric err(X̂,X), where X̂ is the maximum likelihood estimate of the recovered distribution, X̂ = argmaxXP (X|Θ̂) (we use RMSE, MAE in our plots). From our corollary, we require |Ω| = O(rn log n) samples for consistent recovery, so we plot the error metric against the the “normalized” sample size, |Ω|rn logn . For reasons of space, we only provide results for the error metric in observations space plotted against the the “normalized” sample size. The remainder of the results are provided in Appendix B. It can be seen from the plots that the error decays with increasing sample size, corroborating our consistency results; indeed |Ω| > 1.5rn log n samples suffice for the errors to decay to a very small value.

Such (approximate) low–rank structure is one instance of general structural constraints which are now understood to be necessary for consistent statistical estimation under high–dimensional settings (with very large number of parameters and very few observations). Note that the high–dimensional matrix completion problem is particularly ill–posed, since the measurements are typically both very local (e.g. individual matrix entries), and partial (e.g. covering a decaying fraction of entries of the entire matrix). However, the specific (approximately) low–rank structural constraint imposed in the past work on matrix completion does not capture the rich variety of other qualitatively different structural constraints such as row–sparseness, column–sparseness, or a superposition structure of low–rank plus elementwise sparseness, among others.

Recent works have proposed tractable estimators with strong statistical guarantees for the case where the underlying matrix is low–rank, and the measurements consist of a subset, either of the exact individual entries, or of the entries perturbed by additive Gaussian noise, which is thus implicitly suited for thin–tailed continuous data. Arguably, common applications of matrix completion require estimators for (a) heterogeneous data–types, such as skewed–continuous, count, binary, etc., (b) for heterogeneous noise models (beyond Gaussian), which capture varied uncertainty in the measurements, and (c) heterogeneous structural constraints beyond low–rank, such as block–sparsity, or a superposition structure of low–rank plus elementwise sparseness, among others. In this paper, we provide a vastly unified framework for generalized matrix completion by considering a matrix completion setting wherein the matrix entries are sampled from any member of the rich family of exponential family distributions; and impose general structural constraints on the underlying matrix, as captured by a decomposable norm regularizer R(.). We propose a simple convex regularized M–estimator for this generalized framework, and provide a unified and novel statistical analysis for this class of estimators. We finally corroborate our theoretical results on simulated datasets.",
