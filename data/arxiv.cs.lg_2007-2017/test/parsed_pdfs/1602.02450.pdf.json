      "text" : "Supervised learning is by far the most effective application of the machine learning paradigm. However, there is a growing need of decoupling the success of the field from its topmost framework, often unrealistic in practice. In fact while the amount of available data grows continuously, its relative training labels –often derived by human effort– become rare, and hence learning is performed with partially missing, aggregate-level and/or noisy labels. For this reason, weakly supervised learning (wsl) has attracted much research. In this work, we focus on binary classification under weak supervision. Traditionally, wsl problems are attacked by designing ad-hoc loss functions and optimization algorithms tied to the particular learning setting. Instead, we advocate to “do not reinvent the wheel” and present an unifying treatment. In summary, we show that, under a mild decomposability assumption,\nAny loss admitting a minimizing algorithm over fully labelled data, can also be minimized in wsl setting with provable generalization and noise robustness guarantees. Our proof is constructive: we show that a simple change in the input and of one line of code is sufficient."

      "text" : "We introduce linear-odd losses (lols), a definition that not does demand smoothness or convexity, but that a loss l is such that l(x)− l(−x) is linear. Many losses of practical interest are such, e.g. logistic and square. We prove a theorem reminiscent of Fisher-Neyman’s factorization [Lehmann and Casella, 1998] of the exponential family which lays the foundation of this work: it shows how empirical l-risk factors (Figure 1) in a label free term with another incorporating a sufficient statistic of the labels, the mean operator. The interplay of the two components is still apparent on newly derived generalization bounds, that also improve on known ones [Kakade et al., 2009]. Aside from factorization, the above linearity is known to guarantee convexity to certain losses used in learning on positive and unlabeled data (pu) in the recent [du Plessis et al., 2015].\nAn advantage of isolating labels comes from applications on wsl. In this scenario, training labels are only partially observable due to an unknown noise process [Garcıa-Garcıa and Williamson, 2011, Hernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2016]. For example, labels may be noisy [Natarajan et al., 2013], missing as with semi-supervision [Chapelle et al., 2006] and pu [du Plessis et al., 2015], or aggregated as it happens in multiple instance learning [Dietterich et al., 1997] and learning from label proportions (llp) [Quadrianto et al., 2009]. As the success of those areas shows, labels are not strictly needed for learning. However, most wsl methods implicitly assumes that labels must be recovered in training, as pointed out by [Joulin and Bach, 2012]. Instead, sufficiency supports a more principled two-step approach: (1) estimate the mean operator from weakly supervised data and (2) plug it into any lol and resort to known procedures for empirical risk minimization (erm). Thus, (1) becomes the only technical obstacle in adapting an algorithm, although often easy to surpass. Indeed, this approach unifies a growing body of literature [Quadrianto et al., 2009, Patrini et al., 2014, van Rooyen et al., 2015, Gao et al., 2016]. As a showcase, we implement (2) by adapting stochastic gradient descent (sgd) to wsl. The upgrade only require to transform input by a “double sample trick” and to sum the mean operator in the model update.\nFinally, we concentrate on learning with asymmetric label noise. We connect and extend previous work of [Natarajan et al., 2013, van Rooyen et al., 2015] by designing an unbiased mean operator estimator, for which we derive generalization bounds independent on the chosen lol and algorithm. Recent results [Long and Servedio, 2010] have shown that requiring the strongest form of robustness –on any possible noisy sample– rules out most losses commonly used, and have drifted research focus on non-convex [Stempfel and Ralaivola, 2009, Masnadi-Shirazi et al., 2010, Ding and Vishwanathan, 2010] or linear losses [van Rooyen et al., 2015]. Our approach is more pragmatic, as we show that any\nlols enjoy an approximate form of noise robustness which converges, on a data-dependent basis, to the strongest one. The mean operator is still central here, being the data-dependent quantity that shapes the bound. The theory is validated with experimental analysis, for which we call the adapted sgd as a black box.\nElements of this work appeared in an early version [Patrini et al., 2015], mostly interested in elucidating the connection between loss factorization and α-label differential privacy [Chaudhuri and Hsu, 2011].\nNext, Section 2 settles notations and background. Section 3 states the Factorization Theorem. Sections 4 and 5 focus on wsl and noisy labels. Section 6 discusses the paper. Proofs and additional results are given in Appendix."

      "text" : "We denote vectors in bold as x and 1{p} the indicator of p being true. We define [m] .= {1, . . . ,m} and [x]+ . = max(0, x). In binary classification, a learning sample S = {(xi, yi), i ∈ [m]} is a sequence of (observation, label) pairs, the examples, drawn from an unknown distribution D over X× Y, with X ⊆ Rd and Y = {−1, 1}. Expectation (or average) over (x, y) ∼ D (S) is denoted as ED (ES).\nGiven a hypothesis h ∈ H, h : X → R, a loss is any function l : Y× R → R. A loss gives a penalty l(y, h(x)) when predicting the value h(x) and the observed label is y. We consider margin losses, i.e. l(y, h(x)) = l(yh(x)) [Reid and Williamson, 2010], which are implicitly symmetric: l(yh(x)) = l(−y·(−h(x))). For notational convenience, we will often use a generic scalar argument l(x). Examples are 01 loss 1{x < 0}, logistic loss log(1 + e−x), square loss (1 − x)2 and hinge loss [1− x]+.\nThe goal of binary classification is to select a hypothesis h ∈ H that generalizes on D. That is, we aim to minimize the true risk on the 01 loss RD,01(h) . = ED[1{yh(x) < 0}]. In practice, we only learn from a finite learning sample S and thus minimize the empirical l-risk RS,l(h) . = ES[l(yh(x))] = 1 m ∑\ni∈[m] l(yih(xi)), where l is a tractable upperbound of 01 loss. Finally, we discuss the meaning of wsl –and in particular of weakly supervised binary classification. The difference with the above is at training time: we learn on a sample S̃ drawn from a noisy distribution D̃ that may flip, aggregate or suppress labels, while observations are the same. Still, the purpose of learning is unchanged: to minimize the true risk. A rigorous definition will not be relevant in our study."

      "text" : "Some background on the exponential family is to come. We can learn a binary classifier fitting a model in the conditional exponential family parametrized by θ: pθ(y|x) = exp(〈θ, yx〉−log ∑\ny∈Y exp〈θ, yx〉), with y random variable. The two terms in the exponent are the log-partition function and the sufficient statistic yixi, which fully summarizes one example (x, y). The Fisher-Neyman theorem [Lehmann and Casella, 1998, Theorem 6.5] gives a sufficient and necessary condition for sufficiency of a statistic T (y): the probability distribution factors in two functions, such that θ interacts with the y only through T :\npθ(y) = gθ(T (y))g ′(y) .\nIn our case, it holds that g′(y|x) = 1, T (y|x) = yx and gθ(·|x) = exp(〈θ, ·〉 − log ∑\ny∈Y exp(〈θ, yx〉), since the value of y is not needed to compute gθ. This shows how yx is indeed sufficient (for y). Now,\nunder the i.i.d. assumption, the log-likelihood of θ is (the negative of)\nm∑\ni=1\nlog ∑\ny∈Y ey〈θ,xi〉 −\nm∑\ni=1\n〈θ, yixi〉 (1)\n= m∑\ni=1\nlog ∑\ny∈Y ey〈θ,xi〉 −\nm∑\ni=1\nlog eyi〈θ,xi〉\n=\nm∑\ni=1\nlog\n( e〈θ,xi〉 + e−〈θ,xi〉\neyi〈θ,xi〉\n)\n= m∑\ni=1\nlog ( 1 + e−2yi〈θ,xi〉 ) . (2)\nStep (2) is true because y ∈ Y. At last, by At last, by re-parameterizing θ and normalizing, we obtain the empirical risk of logistic loss. Equation (1) shows how the loss splits into a linear term aggregating the labels and another, label free term. We translate this property for classification with erm, by transferring the ideas of sufficiency and factorization to a wide set of losses including the ones of [Patrini et al., 2014]."

      "text" : "The linear term just encountered in logistic loss integrates a well-studied statistical object.\nDefinition 1 The (empirical) mean operator of a learning sample S is µS . = ES [yx] .\nWe drop the S when clear by the context. The name mean operator, or mean map, is borrowed from the theory of Hilbert space embedding [Quadrianto et al., 2009]1. Its importance is due to the injectivity of the map –under conditions on the kernel– which is used in applications such as twosample and independence tests, feature extraction and covariate shift [Smola et al., 2007]. Here, µ will play the role of sufficient statistic for labels w.r.t. a set of losses.\nDefinition 2 A function T (S) is said to be a sufficient statistic for a variable z w.r.t. a set of losses L and a hypothesis space H when for any l ∈ L, any h ∈ H and any two samples S and S′ the empirical l-risk is such that\nRS,l(h)−RS′,f (h) does not depend on z ⇔ T (S) = T (S′) .\nThe definition is motivated by the one in Statistics, taking log-odd ratios [Patrini et al., 2014]. We aim to establish sufficiency of mean operators for a large set of losses. The next theorem is our main contribution.\nTheorem 3 (Factorization) Let H be the space of linear hypotheses. Assume that a loss l is such that lo(x) . = (l(x) − l(−x))/2 is linear. Then, for any sample S and hypothesis h ∈ H the empirical l-risk can be written as\nRS,l(h) = 1\n2 RS2x,l(h) + lo(h(µS)) ,\nwhere S2x . = {(xi, σ), i ∈ [m], ∀σ ∈ Y}.\n1We decide to keep the lighter notation of linear classifiers, but nothing should prevent the extension to nonparametric models, exchanging x with an implicit feature map h(x).\nProof We write RS,l(h) = ES[l(yh(x)) ] as\n1 2 ES\n[ l(yh(x)) + l(−yh(x)) + l(yh(x))− l(−yh(x)) ]\n= 1\n2 ES\n[∑\nσ∈Y l(σh(x))\n]\n+ ES\n[ lo(yh(x)) ]\n= 1\n2 ES2x\n[ l(σh(x)) ]\n+ ES\n[ lo(h(yx)) ] . (3)\nStep 3 is due to the definition of S2x and linearity of h. The Theorem follows by linearity of lo and expectation.\nFactorization splits l-risk in two parts. A first term is the l-risk computed on the same loss on the “doubled sample” S2x that contains each observation twice, labelled with opposite signs, and hence it is label free. A second term is a loss lo of h applied to the mean operator µS, which aggregates all sample labels. Also observe that lo is by construction an odd function, i.e. symmetric w.r.t. the origin. We call the losses satisfying the Theorem linear-odd losses.\nDefinition 4 A loss l is a-linear-odd (a-lol) when lo(x) = (l(x)− l(−x))/2 = ax, for any a ∈ R.\nNotice how this does not exclude losses that are not smooth, convex, or proper [Reid and Williamson, 2010]. The definition puts in a formal shape the intuition behind [du Plessis et al., 2015] for pu – although unrelated to factorization. From now on, we also consider H as the space linear hypotheses h(·) = 〈θ, ·〉. (Theorem 3 applies beyond lols and linear models; see Section 6.) As a consequence of Theorem 3, µ is sufficient for all labels.\nCorollary 5 The mean operator µ is a sufficient statistic for the label y with regard to lols and H.\n(Proof in A.1) The corollary is at the core of the applications in the paper: the single vector µ ∈ Rd summarizes all information concerning the linear relationship between y and x for losses that are lol (see also Section 6). Many known losses belong to this class; see Table 3. For logistic loss it holds that (Figure 1(a)):\nlo(x) = 1\n2 log\n1 + e−x\n1 + ex =\n1 2 log\ne− x 2 (e x 2 + e− x 2 )\ne x 2 (e− x 2 + e x 2 ) = −x 2\nThis “symmetrization” is known in the literature [Jaakkola and Jordan, 2000, Gao et al., 2016]. Another case of lol is unhinged loss l(x) = 1 − x [van Rooyen et al., 2015] –while standard hinge loss does not factor in a linear term.\nThe Factorization Theorem 3 generalizes [Patrini et al., 2014, Lemma 1] that works for symmetric proper losses (spls), e.g. logistic, square and Matsushita losses. Given a permissible generator l [Kearns and Mansour, 1996, Nock and Nielsen, 2009], i.e. dom(l) ⊇ [0, 1], l is strongly convex, differentiable and symmetric with respect to 1/2, spls are defined as l(x) = al + l\n⋆(−x)/bl, where l⋆ is the convex conjugate of l. Then, since l⋆(−x) = l⋆(x) − x:\nlo(x) = 1\n2\n(\nal + l⋆(−x)\nbl − al −\nl⋆(x)\nbl\n)\n= − x 2bl .\nA similar result appears in [Masnadi-Shirazi, 2011, Theorem 11]. A natural question is whether the classes spl and lol are equivalent. We answer in the negative.\nLemma 6 The exhaustive class of linear-odd losses is in 1-to-1 mapping with a proper subclass of even functions, i.e. le(x)− ax, with le any even function.\n(Proof in A.2) Interestingly, the proposition also let us engineer losses that always factor: choose any even function le with desired properties –it need not be convex nor smooth. The loss is then l(x) = le(x)−ax, with a to be chosen. For example, let le(x) = ρ|x|+1, with ρ > 0. l(x) = le(x)−ρx is a lol; furthermore, l upperbounds 01 loss and intercepts it in l(0) = 1. Non-convex l can be constructed similarly. Yet, not all non-differentiable losses can be crafted this way since they are not lols. We provide in B sufficient and necessary conditions to bound losses of interest, including hinge and Huber loss, by lols.\nFrom the optimization viewpoint, we may be interested in keeping properties of l after factorization. The good news is that we are dealing with the same l plus a linear term. Thus, if the property of interest is closed under summation with linear functions, then it will hold true. An example is convexity: if l is lol and convex, so is the factored loss.\nThe next Theorem sheds new light on generalization bounds on Rademacher complexity with linear hypotheses.\nTheorem 7 Assume l is a-lol and L-Lipschitz. Suppose Rd ⊇ X = {x : ‖x‖2 ≤ X < ∞} and H = {θ : ‖θ‖2 ≤ B < ∞}. Let c(X,B) .= maxy∈Y l(yXB) and θ̂ .= argminθ∈H RS,l(θ).

The\nAlgorithm 1 µsgd\nInput: S2x,µ , l ∈ lol; λ > 0; T > 0 m′ ← |S2x| θ0 ← 0 For any t = 1, . . . , T :\nPick it ∈ [m′] uniformly at random ηt ← (1 + λt)−1 Pick any v ∈ ∂l(yi〈θt,xi〉) θt+1 ← (1− ηtλ)θt − ηt(v +aµ/2 ) θt+1 ← min { θt+1, θt+1 √ λ−1/‖θt+1‖2) }\nOutput: θt+1\nformer expression displays the contribution of the non-linear part of the loss, keeping aside what is missing: a deviation of the empirical mean operator from its population mean. When µS is not known because of partial label knowledge, the choice of any estimator would affect the bound only through that norm discrepancy. The second expression highlights the interplay of the two loss components. c(X,B) is the only non-linear term, which may well be predominant in the bound for fast-growing losses, e.g. strongly convex. Moreover, we confirm that the linear-odd part does not change the complexity term and only affects the usual statistical penalty by a linear factor. A last important remark comes from comparing the bound with the one due to [Kakade et al., 2009, Corollary 4]. Our factor in front of the complexity term is ( √ 2 + 1)/4 ≈ 0.6 instead of 2, that is three times smaller. A similar statement may be derived for rkhs on top of [Bartlett and Mendelson, 2002, Altun and Smola, 2006]."

      "text" : "In the next two Sections we discuss applications to wsl. Recall that in this scenario we learn on S̃ with partially observable labels, but aim to generalize to D. Assume to know an algorithm that can only learn on S. By sufficiency (Corollary 5), a principled two-step approach to use it on S̃ is: (1) estimate µ from S̃; (2) run the algorithm with the lol computed on the estimated µ. This direction was explored by work on llp [Quadrianto et al., 2009, logistic loss] and [Patrini et al., 2014, spl] and in the setting of noisy labels [van Rooyen et al., 2015, unhinged loss] and [Gao et al., 2016, logistic loss]. The approach contrasts with ad-hoc losses and optimization procedures, often trying to recover the latent labels by coordinate descent and EM [Joulin and Bach, 2012]. Instead, the only difficulty here is to come up with a well-behaved estimator of µ –a statistic independent on both h and l. Thereom 7 then assures bounded l-risk and, in turn, true risk. On stricter conditions on l [Altun and Smola, 2006, Section 4] and [Patrini et al., 2014, Theorem 6] hold finite-sample guarantees.\nAlgorithm 1, µsgd, adapts sgd for weak supervision. For the sake of presentation, we work on a simple version of sgd based on subgradient descent with L2 regularization, inspired by PEGASO [Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2011]. Given µ changes are trivial: (i) construct S2x from S̃ and (ii) sum −aµ/2 to the subgradients of each example of S2x. In Section 6 upgrades proximal algorithms with the same minimal-effort strategy. The next Section shows an estimator of µ in the case of noisy labels and specializes µsgd. We also analyze the effect of noise through the lenses of Theorem 7 and discuss a non-standard notion of noise robustness."

The noise rates are label dependent\n2 by (p+, p−) ∈ [0, 1/2)2 respectively for positive and negative examples, that is, asymmetric label noise (aln) [Natarajan et al., 2013].\nOur first result builds on [Natarajan et al., 2013, Lemma 1] that provides a recipe for unbiased estimators of losses. Thanks to the Factorization Theorem 3, instead of estimating the whole l we act on the sufficient statistic:\nµ̂S . = ES [ y − (p− − p+) 1− p− − p+ x ] .

We have therefore obtained a good candidate as input for any algorithm implementing our 2-step approach, like µsgd. However, in the context of the literature, there is more. On one hand, the estimators of [Natarajan et al., 2013] may not be convex even when l is so, but this is never the case with lols; in fact, l(x)− l(−x) = 2ax may be seen as alternative sufficient condition to [Natarajan et al., 2013, Lemma 4] for convexity, without asking l differentiable, for the same reason in [du Plessis et al., 2015]. On the other hand, we generalize the approach of [van Rooyen et al., 2015] to losses beyond unhinged and to asymmetric noise. We now prove that any algorithm minimizing lols that uses the estimator in Equation 4 has a non-trivial generalization bound. We further assume that l is Lipschitz.\nTheorem 8 Consider the setting of Theorem 7, except that here θ̂ = argminθ∈H R̂S̃,l(θ). Then for any δ > 0, with probability at least 1− δ:\nRD,l(θ̂)− inf θ∈H\nRD,l(θ) ≤ (√ 2 + 1\n4\n)\n· XBL√ m +\n( c(X,B)L\n2 + 2|a|XB 1− p− − p+ √ d log d\n) √\n1 m log\n( 2\nδ\n)\n.\n(Proof in A.5) Again, the complexity term is tighter than prior work. [Natarajan et al., 2013, Theorem 3] proves a factor of 2L/(1 − p− − p+) that may even be unbounded due to noise, while our estimate shows a constant of about 0.6 < 2 and it is noise free. In fact, lols are such that noise affects only the linear component of the bound, as a direct effect of factorization. Although we are not aware of any other such results, this is intuitive: Rademacher complexity is computed regardless of sample labels and therefore is unchanged by label noise. Furthermore, depending on the loss, the effect of (limited) noise on generalization may be also be negligible since c(X,B) could be very large for losses like strongly convex. This last remark fits well with the property of robustness that we are about to investigate."

In particular, we demonstrate that every learner enjoys a distribution-dependent property of robustness against asymmetric label noise. No estimate of µ is involved and hence the theorem applies to any näıve supervised learner on S̃. We first refine the notion of robustness of [Ghosh et al., 2015, van Rooyen et al., 2015] in a weaker sense.\n2While being independent on the observation.\nDefinition 9 Let (θ⋆, θ̃⋆) respectively be the minimizers of (RD,l(θ), RD̃,l(θ)) in H. l is said ǫ-aln robust if for any D, D̃, R D̃,l(θ ⋆)−R D̃,l(θ̃ ⋆) ≤ ǫ.\nThe distance of the two minimizers is measured by empirical l-risk under expected label noise. 0-aln robust losses are also aln robust: in fact if R\nD̃,l(θ ⋆) = R D̃,l(θ̃ ⋆) then θ⋆ ∈ argmin θ R D̃,l(θ).\nAnd hence if R D̃,l(θ) has a unique global minimum, that will be θ\n⋆.

Then ‖θ⋆ − θ̃⋆‖22 ≤ 2ǫ/γ .\n(Proof in A.6) Unlike Theorem 8, this bound holds in expectation over the noisy risk RD̃,l. Its shape depends on the population mean operator, a distribution-dependent quantity. There are two immediate corollaries. When ‖µD‖2 = 0, we obtain optimality for all lols. The second corollary goes further, limiting the minimizers’ distance when losses are differentiable and strongly convex. But even more generally, under proper compactness assumptions on the domain of l, Theorem 10 tells us much more: in the case R\nD̃,l(θ) has a unique global minimizer, the smaller ‖µD‖2, the closer the minimizer on noisy data θ̃⋆ will be to the minimizer on clean data θ⋆. Therefore, assuming to know an efficient algorithm that computes a model not far from the global optimum θ̃⋆, that will be not far from θ⋆ either. This is true in spite of the presence of local minima and/or saddle points. [Long and Servedio, 2010] proves that no convex potential3 is noise tolerant, that is, 0-ALN robust. This is not a contradiction. To show the negative statement, the authors craft a case of D breaking any of those losses. And in fact that choice of D does not meet optimality in our bound, because ‖µD‖2 = 14 (18γ2 + 6γ + 1) > 0, with γ ∈ (0, 1/6). In contrast, we show that every element of the broad class of lols is approximately robust, as opposed to a worst-case statement. Finally, compare our ǫ-robustness to the one of [Ghosh et al., 2015]: RD,l(θ̃\n∗) ≤ (1 − 2max(p−, p+))−1RD,l(θ∗). Such bound, while relating the (non-noisy) l-risks, is not data-dependent and may be not much informative for high noise rates."

The next results are based on UCI datasets [Bache and Lichman, 2013]. We learn with logistic loss, without model’s intercept and set λ = 10−6 and T = 4 · 2m (4 epochs). We measure dclean and RD,01, injecting symmetric label noise p ∈ [0, 0.45) and averaging over 25 runs. Again, we consider the whole distribution so as to play with the ingredients of Theorem 10. Figure 3(a) confirms how the combined effect of p‖µD‖2 can explain most variation of dclean. While this is not strictly implied by Theorem 10 that only involves dnoisy, the observed behavior is expected. A similar picture is given in Figure 3(b) which displays the true risk RD,01 computed on the minimizer θ̃ ⋆ of S̃. From 3(a) and 3(b) we also deduce that large ‖µD‖2 is a good proxy for generalization with linear classifiers; see the relative difference between points at the same level of noise. Finally, we have also monitored µ\nD̃ . Figure 3(c) shows that large ‖µ D̃ ‖2 indicates small dclean as well. This remark can be useful in practice, when the norm can be accurately estimated from S̃, as opposite to p and µD, and used to anticipate the effect of noise on the task at hand.\nWe conclude with a systematic study of hold-out error of µsgd. The same datasets are now split in 1/5 test and 4/5 training sets once at random. In contrast with the previous experimental setting we perform cross-validation of λ ∈ 10{−3,...,+3} on 5-folds in the training set. We compare with vanilla sgd run on corrupted sample S̃ and measure the gain from estimating µ̂\nS̃ . The other parameters\nl, T, λ are the same for both algorithms; the learning rate η is untouched from [Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2011] and not tuned for µsgd. The only differences are in input and gradient update. Table 2 reports test error for sgd and its difference with µsgd, for a range of values of (p−, p+). µsgd beats systematically sgd with large noise rates, and still performs in pair with its competitor under low or null noise. Interestingly, in the presence of very intense noise p+ ≈ .5, while the contender is often doomed to random guess, µsgd still learns sensible models and improves up to 55% relatively to the error of sgd."

      "text" : "Mean and covariance operators The intuition behind the relevance of the mean operator becomes clear once we rewrite it as follows.\nLemma 11 Let π+ . = ES1{y > 0} be the positive label proportion of S. Then µS = CovS[x, y] + (2π+ − 1)ES[x] .\n(Proof in A.7) We have come to the unsurprising fact that –when observations are centered– the covariance CovS[x, y] is what we need to know about the labels for learning linear models. The rest of the loss may be seen as a data-dependent regularizer. However, notice how the condition ‖µD‖2 = 0 does not implies CovD[x, y] = 0, which would make linear classification hard and limit Theorem 10’s validity to degenerate cases. A kernelized version of this Lemma is given in [Song et al., 2009].\nThe generality of factorization Factorization is ubiquitous for any (margin) loss, beyond the theory seen so far. A basic fact of real analysis supports it: a function l is (uniquely) the sum of an even function le and an odd lo:\nl(x) = 1\n2 (l(x) + l(−x) + l(x)− l(−x)) = le(x) + lo(x) .\nOne can check that le and lo are indeed even and odd (Figure 1). This is actually all we need for the factorization of l.\nTheorem 12 (Factorization) For any sample S and hypothesis h the empirical l-risk can be written as\nRS,l(h) = 1\n2 ES\n[∑\nσ∈Y l(σh(x))\n]\n+ ES\n[ lo(yh(x)) ]\nwhere lo(·) is odd and le(·) .= ∑ σ∈Y l(σh(·)) is even and both uniquely defined.\nIts range of validity is exemplified by 01 loss, a non-convex discontinuous piece-wise linear function, which factors as\nle(x) = { 1 2 x 6= 0 1 otherwise , lo(x) = − 1 2 sign(x) .\nIt follows immediately that ES[lo(·)] is sufficient for y. However, lo is a function of model θ. This defeats the purpose a of sufficient statistic, which we aim to be computable from data only and it is the main reason to define lols. The Factorization Theorem 3 can also be stated for rkhs. To show that, notice that we satisfy all hypotheses of the Representer Theorem [Schölkopf and Smola, 2002].\nTheorem 13 Let h(x) : X → H be a feature map into a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (rkhs) H with symmetric positive definite kernel k : X× X → R, such that h : x → k(·,x). For any learning sample S, the empirical l-risk RS,l(h) with Ω : ||h||H → R+ regularization can be written as\n1 2 ES\n[∑\nσ∈Y l(σh(x))\n]\n+ ES\n[ lo(yh(x)) ] +Ω(||h||H)\nand the optimal hypothesis admits a representation of the form h(x) = ∑\ni∈[m] αik(x,xi).\nAll paper may be read in the context of non-parametric models, with the kernel mean operator as sufficient statistic. Finally, it is simple to show factorization for square loss for regression (C). This finding may open further applications of our framework.\nThe linear-odd losses of [du Plessis et al., 2015] This recent work in the context of pu shows how the linear-odd condition on a convex l allows one to derive a tractable, i.e. still convex, loss for learning with pu. The approach is conceptually related to ours as it isolates a label-free term in the loss, with the goal of leveraging on the unlabelled examples too. Interestingly, the linear term of their Equation 4 can be seen as a mean operator estimator like µ̂\n. = P(y = 1) · ES+ [x], where S+\nis the set of positive examples. Their manipulation of the loss is not equivalent to the Factorization Theorem 3 though, as explained with details in (D. Beside that, since we reason at the higher level of wsl, we can frame a solution for pu simply calling µsgd on µ̂ defined above or on estimators improved by exploiting results of [Patrini et al., 2014].\nLearning reductions Solving a machine learning problem by solutions to other learning problems is a learning reduction [Beygelzimer et al., 2015]. Our work does fit into this framework. Following [Beygelzimer et al., 2005], we define a wsl task as a triple (K,Y, l), with weakly supervised advice K, predictions space Y and loss l, and we reduce to binary classification (Y,Y, l). Our reduction is somehow simple, in the sense that Y does not change and neither does l. Although, Algorithm 1 modifies the internal code of the “oracle learner” which contrasts with the concept of reduction. Anyway, we could as well write subgradients as\n1\n2\n( ∂l(〈θt,xi〉) + ∂l(−〈θt,xi〉) + aµ ) ,\nwhich equals ∂l, and thus the oracle would be untouched.\nBeyond µsgd meta-µsgd is intimately similar to stochastic average gradient (sag) [Schmidt et al., 2013]. Let denote gi,te (θ) ∈ ∂le(yi〈θ,xi〉) if i = it (example i picked at time t), otherwise = gi,t−1e (θ). Define the same for lo accordingly. Then, sag’s model update is:\nθt+1 ← θt − η m\n∑\ni∈[m] gi,te (θ t)− η m\n∑\ni∈[m] gi,to (θ t) ,\nand recalling that aµS = ES[∂lo(θ)], µsgd’s update is\nθt+1 ← θt − η ∂lie(θt)− η\nm\n∑\ni∈[m] ∂lio(θ t) .\nFrom this parallel, the two algorithms appear to be variants of a more general sampling mechanism of examples and gradient components, at each step. More generally, stochastic gradient is just one suit of algorithms that fits into our 2-step learning framework. Proximal methods [Bach et al., 2012] are another noticeable example. The same modus operandi leads to a proximal step of the form:\nθt+1 ← proxΘ ( θt + η ( ∂RS2x,l(θ t) + a 2 µ ))\nwith proxg(x) = argminx′ g(x ′) + 12‖x − x′‖22) and Θ(·) the regularizer. Once again, the adaptation works by summing µ in the gradient step and changing the input to S2x.\nA better (?) picture of robustness The data-dependent worst-case result of [Long and Servedio, 2010], like any extreme-case argument, should be handled with care. It does not give the big picture for all data we may encounter in a real world, but only the most pessimistic. We present such a global view which appears better than expected: learning the minimizer from noisy data does not necessarily\nreduce convex losses to a singleton [van Rooyen et al., 2015] but depends on the mean operator for a large number of them (not necessarily linear, convex or smooth). Quite surprisingly, factorization also marries the two opposite views in one formula4:\nl(x) = 1\n2 ( l(x) + l(−x) ︸ ︷︷ ︸\n=const ⇒ 0-aln\n+ l(x)− l(−x) ︸ ︷︷ ︸\n=ax ⇒ ǫ-aln\n) .\nTo conclude, we have seen how losses factor in a way that we can isolate the contribution of supervision. This has several implications both on theoretical and practical grounds: learning theory, formal analysis of label noise robustness, and adaptation of algorithms to handle poorly labelled data. An interesting question is whether factorization would let one identify what really matters in learning that is instead completely unsupervised, and to do so with more complex models than the ones considered here, as for example deep architectures."

(27)\nWe could treat A1 by calling standard bounds based on Rademacher complexity on a sample with size 2m [Bartlett and Mendelson, 2002]. Indeed, since the complexity does not depend on labels, its value would be the same –modulo the change of sample size– for both S and S2x, as they are computed with same loss and observations. However, the special structure of S2x allows us to obtain a tighter\nstructural complexity term, due to some cancellation effect. The fact is proven by Lemma 14. In order to exploit it, we first observe that\nA1 ≤ 1\n2\n( RD2x,l(θ̂)−RS2x,l(θ̂)−RD2x,l(θ⋆) +RS2x,l(θ⋆) )\n≤ sup θ∈H |RD2x,l(θ)−RS2x,l(θ)|\nwhich by standard arguments [Bartlett and Mendelson, 2002] and the application of Lemma 14 gives a bound with probability at least 1− δ, δ > 0\nA1 ≤ 2L · R(H ◦ S2x) + c(X,B)L · √ 1\n4m log\n( 1\nδ\n)\n≤ L · √ 2 + 1√ 2 · BX√ 2m + c(X,B)L · √ 1 4m log ( 1 δ )\nwhere c(X,B) . = maxy∈Y l(yXB) and because 1 2 + 1 2 √ 1 2 − 1m < (√ 2+1√ 2 )\n, ∀m > 0.

(28)\nThis proves the first part of the statement. For the second one, we apply Lemma 15 that provides the probabilistic bound for the norm discrepancy of the mean operators. Consider that both statements are true with probability at least 1− δ/2. We write\nP\n({ RD,l(θ̂)−RD,l(θ⋆) ≤ (√ 2 + 1\n2\n)\n· XBL√ m + c(X,B)L 2 · √ 1 m log ( 2 δ ) + 2|a|B · ‖µD − µS‖2 }\n∧ { ‖µD − µS‖2 ≤ X · √ d\nm log\n( 2d\nδ\n)})\n≥ 1− δ/2− δ/2 = 1− δ ,\nand therefore with probability 1− δ\nRD,l(θ̂)−RD,l(θ⋆) ≤ (√ 2 + 1\n2\n)\n· XBL√ m + c(X,B)L 2 · √ 1 m log ( 2 δ ) + 2|a|XB · √ d m log ( 2d δ )\n=\n(√ 2 + 1\n2\n)\n· XBL√ m +\n( c(X,B)L\n2 + 2|a|XB\n√\nd log d\n) √\n1 m log\n( 2\nδ\n)\n.\nA.4 Unbiased estimator for the mean operator with asymmetric label noise\n[Natarajan et al., 2013, Lemma 1] provides an unbiased estimator for a loss l(x) computed on x of the form:\nl̂(y〈θ,xi〉) .= (1− p−y) · l(〈θ,xi〉) + py · l(−〈θ,xi〉)\n1− p− − p+\nWe apply it for estimating the mean operator instead of, from another perspective, for estimating a linear (unhinged) loss as in [van Rooyen et al., 2015]. We are allowed to do so by the very result of the Factorization Theorem, since the noise corruption has effect on the linear-odd term of the loss only. The estimator of the sufficient statistic of a single example yx is\nẑ . = 1− p−y + py 1− p− − p+ yx\n= 1− (p− − p+)y 1− p− − p+ yx = y − (p− − p+) 1− p− − p+ x ,\nand its average, i.e. the mean operator estimator, is\nµ̂S . = ES [ y − (p− + p+) 1− p− − p+ x ] ,\nsuch that in expectation over the noisy distribution it holds E D̃ [ẑ] = µD.

Let θ̂ = argminθ∈H R̂D̃,l(θ) and θ ⋆ = argminθ∈H RD,l(θ). We have\nRD,l(θ̂)−RD,l(θ⋆) = R̂D̃,l(θ̂)− R̂D̃,l(θ⋆) (30)\n= 1\n2 RD2x,l(θ̂) + a〈θ̂, µ̂D̃〉 −\n1 2 RD2x,l(θ ⋆)− a〈θ⋆, µ̂ D̃ 〉\n= 1\n2\n( RD2x,l(θ̂)−RD2x,l(θ⋆) ) + a〈θ̂ − θ⋆, µ̂ D̃ 〉\n= 1\n2\n( RS2x,l(θ̂)−RS2x,l(θ⋆) ) + a〈θ̂ − θ⋆, µ̂ D̃ 〉\n+ 1\n2\n( RD2x,l(θ̂)−RS2x,l(θ̂)−RD2x,l(θ⋆) +RS2x,l(θ⋆) ) } A1 . (31)\nStep 30 is due to unbiasedness shown in Section A.4. Again, rename Line 31 as A1, which this time is bounded directly by Theorem 7. Next, we proceed as within the proof of Theorem 7 but now exploiting the fact that 12RS2x,l(θ) = R̂S̃,l(θ)− a〈θ, µ̂D̃〉\nRD,l(θ̂)−RD,l(θ⋆) ≤ R̂S̃,l(θ̂)− R̂S̃,l(θ⋆) ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nA2\n+ a〈θ̂ − θ⋆, µ̂ D̃ − µ̂ S̃ 〉\n︸ ︷︷ ︸\nA3\n+A1 .\nNow, A2 is never more than 0 because θ̂ is the minimizer of R̂S̃,l(θ).

Finally, by a union bound we get that for any δ > 0 with probability 1− δ\nRD,l(θ̂)−RD,l(θ⋆) ≤ (√ 2 + 1\n2\n)\n· XBL√ m +\n( c(X,B)L\n2 + 2|a|XB 1− p+ − p− √ d log d\n) √\n1 m log\n( 2\nδ\n)\n."

Then ‖θ⋆ − θ̃⋆‖22 ≤ 2ǫ/γ .\nProof The proof draws ideas from [Manwani and Sastry, 2013]. Let us first assume the noise to be symmetric, i.e. p+ = p− = p. For any θ we have\nR D̃,l(θ ⋆)−R D̃,l(θ) = (1− p) (RD,l(θ⋆)−RD,l(θ))\n+ p (RD,l(θ ⋆)−RD,l(θ) + 2a〈θ⋆ − θ,µD〉) (33) ≤ (RD,l(θ⋆)−RD,l(θ)) + 4|a|Bp‖µD‖2 (34) ≤ 4|a|Bp‖µD‖2 . (35)\nWe are working with lols, which are such that l(x) = l(−x) + 2ax and therefore we can take Step 33. Step 34 follows from Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and bounded models. Step 35 is true because θ⋆ is the minimizer of RD,l(θ). We have obtained a bound for any θ and so for the supremum with regard to θ. Therefore:\nsup θ∈H\n(\nR D̃,l(θ ⋆)−R D̃,l(θ)\n)\n= R D̃,l(θ ⋆)−R D̃,l(θ̃) .\nTo lift the discussion to asymmetric label noise, risks have to be split into losses for negative and positive examples. Let RD+,l be the risk computed over the distribution of the positive examples D + and RD−,l the one of the negatives, and denote the mean operatorsµD+ ,µD− accordingly. Also, define the probability of positive and negative labels in D as π± = P(y = ±1). The same manipulations for\nthe symmetric case let us write\nR D̃,l(θ ⋆)−R D̃,l(θ) = π− ( RD−,l(θ ⋆)−RD−,l(θ) ) + π+ ( RD+,l(θ ⋆)−RD+,l(θ) )\n+ 2ap−π−〈θ⋆ − θ,µD−〉+ 2ap+π+〈θ⋆ − θ,µD+〉 ≤ (RD,l(θ⋆)−RD,l(θ)) + 2a〈θ⋆ − θ, p−µD− + p+µD+〉 ≤ 4|a|B · ‖p−π−µD− + p+π+µD+‖2 ≤ 4|a|Bmax(p−, p+) · ‖π−µD− + π+µD+‖2 = 4|a|Bmax(p−, p+) · ‖µD‖2 .\nThen, we conclude the proof by the same argument for the symmetric case. The first corollary is immediate. For the second, we first recall the definition of a function f strongly convex.\nDefinition 17 A differentiable function f(x) is γ-strongly convex if for all x, x′ ∈ Dom(f) we have\nf(x)− f(x′) ≥ 〈∇f(x′), x− x′〉+ γ 2 ‖x− x′‖22 .\nIf l is differentiable once and γ-strongly convex in the θ argument, so it the risk RD̃,l by composition with linear functions. Notice also that ∇R D̃,l(θ̃ ⋆) = 0 because θ̃⋆ is the minimizer. Therefore:\nǫ ≥ R D̃,l(θ ⋆)− R D̃,l(θ̃ ⋆)\n≥ 〈\n∇R D̃,l(θ̃\n⋆), θ⋆ − θ̃⋆ 〉 + γ\n2\n∥ ∥ ∥θ ⋆ − θ̃⋆ ∥ ∥ ∥ 2\n2\n≥ γ 2 ∥ ∥ ∥θ ⋆ − θ̃⋆ ∥ ∥ ∥ 2 2 ,\nwhich means that ∥ ∥ ∥θ ⋆ − θ̃⋆ ∥ ∥ ∥ 2\n2 ≤ 2ǫ γ ."

Suppose that it has asymptotes at ±∞, i.e. there exist c1, c2 ∈ R and d1, d2 ∈ R such that\nlim x→+∞ f(x)− c1x− d1 = 0, lim x→−∞ f(x)− c2x− d2 = 0\nthen there exists q ∈ R such that lo(x) ≤ c1+c22 x+ q .\nProof One can compute the limits at infinity of lo to get\nlim x→+∞\nlo(x) − c1 + c2\n2 x = d1 − d2 2\nand\nlim x→−∞\nlo(x)− c1 + c2\n2 x = d2 − d1 2 .\nThen q . = sup{lo(x)− c1+c22 x} < +∞ as lo is continuous. Thus lo(x)− c1+c2 2 x ≤ q.\nThe Lemma covers many cases of practical interest outside the class of lols, e.g. hinge, absolute and Huber losses. Exponential loss is the exception since lo(x) = −sinh(x) cannot be bounded. Consider now hinge loss: l(x) = [1 − x]+ is not differentiable in 1 nor proper [Reid and Williamson, 2010], however it is continuous with asymptotes at ±∞. Therefore, for any θ its empirical risk is bounded as\nRS,hinge(θ) ≤ 1\n2 RS2x,hinge(θ)−\n1 2 〈θ,µ〉+ q ,\nsince c1 = 0 and c2 = 1. An alternative proof of this result on hinge is provided next, giving the exact value of q = 1/2. The odd term for hinge loss is\nlo(x) = 1\n2 ([1− x]+ − [1 + x]+)\n= 1\n4 (−2x+ |1− x| − |1 + x|)\ndue to an arithmetic trick for the max function: max(a, b) = (a+ b)/2 + |b− a|/2.

Let prove that lo is bounded from above by a line.\nq = sup x∈R\n{lo(x)− c1x} < ∞ ,\nbecause lo is continuous. So for every x ∈ R\nlo(x) ≤ c1x+ q .\nIn particular we can take c1 as the angular coefficient of the line. ⇐) Vice versa we proceed by contradiction. Suppose that there exists q, q′ ∈ R such that lo is bounded from above by l(x) = q′x + q. Suppose in addition that the conditions on the asymptotes (36) and (37) are false.

The result of [du Plessis et al., 2015, Theorem 1] is immediate from the point of view of our theory: in fact, an odd function can be convex or concave only if it also linear. The resulting expression based on the fact l(x)− l(−x) = 2ax simplifies into\nE(x,y)∼D [l(y〈θ,x〉)] = aπ+E(x,y)∼D+ [y〈θ,x〉] + E(x,·)∼D [l(−〈θ,x〉)] = aπ+µD+ + E(x,·)∼D [l(−〈θ,x〉)] .\nwhere µD+ is a mean operator computed on positive examples only.

This holds true even for non-smooth, non-convex losses and in any rkhs. The first term is a (kernel) mean operator –the focal quantity of this work– which we characterize as the sufficient statistic for the labels. The result tightens known generalization bounds and sheds new light on their interpretation. Factorization has a direct application on weakly supervised learning. In particular, we demonstrate that algorithms like sgd and proximal methods can be adapted with minimal effort to handle weak supervision, once the mean operator has been estimated. We apply this idea to learning with asymmetric noisy labels, connecting and extending prior work. Furthermore, we show that most losses enjoy a data-dependent (by the mean operator) form of noise robustness, in contrast with known negative results.",
