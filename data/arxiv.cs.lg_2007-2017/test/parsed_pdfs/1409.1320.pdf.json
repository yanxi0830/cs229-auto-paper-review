      "text" : "Conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) and structured SVMs (SSVMs) (Taskar et al., 2003; Tsochantaridis et al., 2005) are standard tools for structured prediction in many important domains, such as computer vision (Nowozin & Lampert, 2011), natural language processing (Getoor & Taskar, 2007) and computational biology (e.g., Li et al., 2007; Sato & Sakakibara, 2005). However, many practical cases are not well handled by these tools, due to the presence of latent variables or partially labeled datasets. For example, one approach to image segmentation classifies each pixel into a predefined semantic category. While it is expensive to collect labels for every single pixel (perhaps even impossible for ambiguous regions), partially labeled data are relatively easy to ob-\nProceedings of the 31 st International Conference on Machine Learning, Beijing, China, 2014.

Examples also arise in natural language processing, such as semantic role labeling, where the semantic predictions are inherently coupled with latent syntactic relations (Naradowsky et al., 2012). However, accurate syntactic annotations are unavailable in many language resources.\nIn past few years, several solutions have been proposed to address hidden variable problems in structured prediction. Perhaps the most notable of these are hidden conditional random fields (HCRFs) (Quattoni et al., 2007) and latent structured SVMs (LSSVMs) (Yu & Joachims, 2009), which are derived from conditional random fields and structured SVMs, respectively. However, both approaches have several shortcomings. CRF-based models often perform worse than SSVM-based methods in practical datasets, especially when the number of training instances is small or the model assumptions are heavily violated (e.g., Taskar et al., 2003). On the other hand, LSSVM relies on a joint maximum a posteriori (MAP) procedure that assigns the hidden variables to deterministic values, and does not take into account their uncertainty. Unfortunately, this can produce poor predictions of the output variables even for exact models (Liu & Ihler, 2013). A better approach is to average over possible states, corresponding to a marginal MAP inference task (Koller & Friedman, 2009; Liu & Ihler, 2013) that marginalizes the hidden variables before optimizing over the output variables.\nContributions. We propose a novel structured SVM algorithm that takes into account the uncertainty of the hidden variables, by incorporating marginal MAP inference that “averages” over the possible hidden states. We show that our method performs significantly better than LSSVM and other state of art methods, especially when the uncertainty of the hidden variables is high. Our method also inherits the general advantages of structured SVMs and consistently outperforms HCRFs, especially when the training sample size is small. We also study the effect of different training algorithms under various models. In particular we show that gradient-based algorithms for our framework are much more efficient than for LSSVM, because\nar X\niv :1\n40 9.\n13 20\nv2 [\nst at\n.M L\n] 5\nS ep\n2 01\n4\nour objective function is smoother than that of LSSVM as it marginalizes, instead of maximizes, over the hidden variables. Finally, we propose a unified framework that includes both our and existing methods as special cases, and provide general insights on the choice of models and optimization algorithms for practitioners.\nWe organize the rest of the paper as follows. In Section 2, we introduce related work. We present background and notation in Section 3, and derive our marginal structured SVM in Section 4. The unified framework is proposed in Section 5. Learning and inference algorithms for the model are presented in Section 6. We report experimental results in Section 7 and conclude the paper in Section 8."

      "text" : "HCRFs naturally extend CRFs to include hidden variables, and have found numerous applications in areas such as object recognition (Quattoni et al., 2004) and gesture recognition (Wang et al., 2006). HCRFs have the same pros and cons as general CRFs; in particular, they perform well when the model assumptions hold and when there are enough training instances, but may otherwise perform badly. Alternatively, the LSSVM (Yu & Joachims, 2009) is an extension of structured SVM that handles hidden variables, with wide application in areas like object detection (Zhu et al., 2010), human action recognition (Wang & Mori, 2009), document-level sentiment classification (Yessenalina et al., 2010) and link prediction (Xu et al., 2013). However, LSSVM relies on a joint MAP procedure, and may not perform well when a non-trivial uncertainty exists in the hidden variables. Recently, Schwing et al. (2012) proposed an -extension framework for discriminative graphical models with hidden variables that includes both HCRFs and LSSVM as special cases.\nA few recent works also incorporate uncertainty over hidden variables explicitly into their optimization frameworks. For example, Miller et al. (2012) proposed a max margin min-entropy (M3E) model that minimizes an uncertainty measure on hidden variables while performing max-margin learning. They assume that minimizing hidden uncertainty will improve the output accuracy. This is valid in some applications, such as object detection, where reducing the uncertainty of object location can improve the category prediction. However, in cases like image segmentation, the missing labels may come from ambiguous regions, and maintaining that ambiguity can be important. In another work, Kumar et al. (2012) proposes a learning procedure that encourages agreement between two separate models – one for predicting outputs and another for representing the uncertainty over the hidden variables. They model the uncertainty of hidden variable during training, and rely on a joint MAP procedure during prediction.\nOur proposed method builds on recent work for marginal MAP inference (Koller & Friedman, 2009; Liu & Ihler, 2013), which averages over the hidden variables (or variables that are not of direct interest), and then optimizes over the output variables (or variables of direct interest). In many domains, marginal MAP can provide significant improvement over joint MAP estimation, which jointly optimizes hidden and output variables; recent examples include blind deconvolution in computer vision (Fergus et al., 2006; Levin et al., 2011) and relation extraction and semantic role labeling in natural language processing (Naradowsky et al., 2012). Unfortunately, marginal MAP tasks on graphical models are notoriously difficult; marginal MAP can be NP-hard even when the underlying graphical model is tree-structured (Koller & Friedman, 2009). Recently, Liu & Ihler (2013) proposed efficient variational algorithms that approximately solve marginal MAP. In our work, we use their mixed-product belief propagation algorithm as our inference component.\nSub-gradient decent (SGD) (Ratliff et al., 2007) and the concave-convex procedure (CCCP)(Yuille & Rangarajan, 2003) are two popular training algorithms for structured prediction problems. Generally, SGD is straightforward to implement and effective in practice, but may be slow to converge, especially on non-convex and non-smooth objective functions as arise in LSSVMs. CCCP is a general framework for minimizing non-convex functions by transforming the non-convex optimization into a sequence of convex optimizations by iteratively linearizing the nonconvex component of the objective. It has been applied widely in many areas of machine learning, particularly when hidden variables or missing data are involved. We explore both these training methods and compare them across the various models we consider."

      "text" : "In this section we review the background on structured prediction with hidden variables. Assume we have structured input-output pairs (x, y) ∈ X × Y , where X , Y are the spaces of the input and output variables. In many applications, this input-output relationship is not only characterized by (x, y), but also depends on some unobserved hidden or latent variables h ∈ H. Suppose (x, y, h) follows a conditional model,\np(y, h|x;w) = 1 Z(x;w) exp [wTφ(x, y, h)], (1)\nwhere φ(x, y, h) : X × Y × H → RD is a set of features which describe the relationships among the (x, y, h), and w ∈ RD are the corresponding weights, or model parameters. The function Z(x;w) is the normalization constant,\nor partition function, Z(x;w) = ∑ y,h exp [wTφ(x, y, h)].\nAssuming the weights w are known, the LSSVM of Yu & Joachims (2009) decodes the output variables y given input variables x by performing a joint maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference,\n[ỹ(w), h̃(w)] = argmax (y,h)∈Y×H\np(y, h|x)\n= argmax (y,h)∈Y×H\nwTφ(x, y, h).\nThis gives the optimal prediction of the (y, h)-pair, and one obtains a prediction on y by simply discarding the h component. Unfortunately, the optimal prediction for (y, h) jointly does not necessarily give an optimal prediction on y; instead, it may introduce strong biases even for simple cases (e.g., see Example 1 in Liu & Ihler (2013)). Intuitively, the joint MAP prediction is “overly optimistic”, since it deterministically assign the hidden variables to their most likely states; this approach is not robust to the inherent uncertainty in h, which may cause problems if that uncertainty is significant.\nTo address this issue, we use marginal MAP predictor,\nŷ(w) = argmax y∈Y ∑ h p(y, h|x;w)\n= argmax y∈Y log ∑ h exp [wTφ(x, y, h)], (2)\nwhich explicitly takes into account the uncertainty of the hidden variables. It should be noted that ŷ(w) is in fact the Bayes optimal prediction of y, measured by zero-one loss. The main contribution of this work is to introduce a novel structured SVM-based method for training the marginal MAP predictor, which significantly improves over previous methods."

      "text" : "In this section we derive our main method, the marginal structured SVM (MSSVM), which minimizes an upper bound of the empirical risk function. Assume we have a set of training instances S = {(x1, y1), · · · , (xn, yn)} ∈ (X × Y)n. The risk is measured by an user-specified empirical loss function ∆(yi, ŷi), which quantifies the difference between an estimator ŷi and the correct output yi. It is usually difficult to exactly minimize the loss function because it is typically non-convex and discontinuous with w (e.g., Hamming loss). Instead, one adopts surrogate upper bounds to overcome this difficulty.\nAssume ŷi(w) is the marginal MAP prediction on instance xi as defined in (2). We upper bound the empirical loss\nfunction ∆(yi, ŷi(w)) as follows,\n∆(yi, ŷi(w)) ≤ ∆(yi, ŷi(w)) + log ∑ h exp[wTφ(xi, ŷi(w)), h)]\n− log ∑ h exp[wTφ(xi, yi, h)]\n≤ max y\n{ ∆(yi, y) + log ∑ h exp [wTφ(xi, y, h)] }\n− log ∑ h exp [wTφ(xi, yi, h)],\nwhere the first inequality holds because ŷi(w) is the marginal MAP prediction (2), and the second because it jointly maxmizes two terms.\nMinimizing this upper bound over the training set with aL2 regularization, we obtain the following objective function for our marginal structured SVM,\n1 2 ‖w‖2 + C n∑ i=1 max y { ∆(yi, y) + log ∑ h exp[wTφ(xi, y, h)] }\n− C n∑\ni=1 log ∑ h exp [ wTφ(xi, yi, h) ] .

Note that the first part of the objective requires a lossaugmented marginal MAP inference, which marginalizes the hidden variables h and then optimizes over the output variables y, while the second part only requires a marginalization over the hidden variables. Both these terms and their gradients are intractable to compute on loopy graphical models, but can be efficiently approximated by mixedproduct belief propagation (Liu & Ihler, 2013) and sumproduct belief propagation (Wainwright & Jordan, 2008), respectively. We will discuss training algorithms for optimizing this objective in Section 6."

Similar temperature-based approaches have been used both in structured prediction (Hazan & Urtasun, 2010; Schwing et al., 2012) and in other problems, such as semi-supervised learning (Samdani et al., 2012; Dhillon et al., 2012).\nOne can show (Lemma 1 in supplement) that objective (5) is an upper bound of the empirical loss function ∆(yi, ŷi\nh(w)) over the training set, where the prediction ŷi h(w) is decoded by “annealed” marginal MAP,\nŷi h(w) = arg max y log ∑ h exp [wTφ(xi, y, h) h ] .\nThis framework includes a number of existing methods as special cases. It reduces to MSSVM in (3) if y → 0+ and h = 1, and LSSVM in (4) if y → 0+ and h → 0+. If we set y = h = 1, we obtain the loss-augmented likelihood objective in Volkovs et al. (2011), and further reduces to the standard likelihood objective of HCRFs if we assume ∆(yi, y) ≡ 0. Our framework also generalizes the -extension model by Schwing et al. (2012), which corresponds to the restriction that y = h. See Table 1 for a summarization of these model comparisons. In the sequel, we provide some general insights on selecting among these different models through our empirical evaluations."

Note that the variance parameters σh and σyh control the degree of uncertainty in the hidden variables and their importance for estimating the output variables y: the uncertainty of h is high for small values of σh, and the correlation between h and y is high when σyh is large.\nWe sample 20 training instances and 100 test instances from both the hidden chain MRF and 2D grid MRF. We set σx = σy = σh = 0.1, σyh = σyx = σhx = 2. Then, we train our MSSVM, LSSVM and HCRF models using both SGD and CCCP. Hamming loss is used in both training and evaluation. In our experiments, we always set the regularization weight C = 1. See Table 2 for the results across different algorithms. We can see that our MSSVM always achieves the highest accuracy when using either training algorithm. It is worth noting that LSSVM obtains a significantly better result using CCCP than SGD; this is mainly due to SGD’s difficulty converging on the piecewise linear objective of LSSVM.\nEmpirical Convergence of SGD and CCCP. Using subgradient descent with learning rate ηM = 0.02, we found that for our MSSVM, training error converged quickly (within 50 iterations). However, sub-gradient descent on the LSSVM would only converge using a much smaller learning rate (ηL = 0.001), and converged more slowly (usually after 250 iterations). This effect is mainly because the LSSVM hard-max makes the objective function nonsmooth, causing sub-gradient descent to be slow to converge. On the other hand, gradient descent on HCRFs converges more easily and quickly than either MSSVM or LSSVM, because its objective function is smoother. Figure 2 shows the oscillation during the iteration of (sub)gradient descent for each model, and empirically illustrates the convergence process.\nWe also observe CCCP converging faster than SGD (using smaller number of inference steps), especially for LSSVM, since CCCP transforms the complex piecewise linear objective into a sequence of easier convex sub-problems. In our empirical study, CCCP always converged well even using approximate inference and non-convex objectives.1 To provide a fair comparison, all methods are trained using the\n1However, it is challenging to provide rigorous convergence guarantees for the non-convex & intractable setting, and not really the focus of this paper.\nCCCP algorithm in the sequel.\nTraining Sample Size. We compared the influence of sample size for each method by ranging the training size from 22 to 210 (with a testing size of 500). The data are all simulated from a MRF on the 20-node hidden chain shown in Figure 1(a). We set σx = σy = σh = 0.1 and σyh = σyx = σhx = 2 as before.\nResults are shown in Figure 3. We found that our MSSVM always considerably outperforms LSSVM, and largely outperforms HCRFs when the training sample sizes are small. HCRFs perform worse than LSSVM for few training data, but outperform LSSVM as the training sample increases.\nOur experiment shows that MSSVM consistently outperforms HCRFs even with reasonably large training sets on a relatively simple toy model. Although the maximum likelihood estimator (as used in HCRFs) is generally considered asymptotically optimal if the model assumptions are correct, this assumes a sufficiently large training size, which may be difficult to acheive in practice. Given enough data (and the correct model), the HCRF should thus eventually improve, but this seems unrealistic in practice since most applications are likely to exhibit high dimensional parameters and relatively few training instances. Additional analysis of the test likelihood and prediction accuracy can be found in the supplement.\nUncertainty of Hidden Variables. We investigate the influence of uncertainty in the hidden variables for each method by adjusting the noise level σh, which controls the uncertainty of the hidden variables. We draw 20 training samples and 100 test samples from a MRF on a 40-node hidden chain shown in Figure 1(a), with fixed σx = σy = 0.1 and σyh = σyx = σhx = 2. For comparison, we also evaluate the performance of M3E (Miller et al., 2012) and\nModLat (Kumar et al., 2012). In accordance with our default setting C = 1, we use the default hyper-parameters in their package. We encourage people to carefully tune these hyper-parameters by cross-validation in future study.\nResults are shown in Table 3. We find that our MSSVM is competitive with LSSVM and M3E when the uncertainty in the hidden variables is low, and becomes significantly better than them as the uncertainty increases. Because LSSVM uses the joint MAP, it does not take into account this uncertainty. On the other hand, M3E explicitly tries to minimize this uncertainty, which can also mislead the prediction. Our MSSVM consistently outperforms HCRFs for moderate training sample sizes. Due to the limitations in current implementations of M3E and ModLat, we only provide their results on chain models."

For texture, we compute the 128- dimensional SIFT descriptor of the patch and vector quantize it into a 500-word codebook, learned by k-means clustering of all patches in the entire dataset. For color, we take 48-dimensional RGB color histogram for each patch.

We demonstrate that our MSSVM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both simulated and real-world datasets, especially when the uncertainty of hidden variables is large. Compared to the popular LSSVM, the objective function of our MSSVM is easier to optimize due to the smoothness of its objective function. We also provide a unified framework which includes our method as well as a spectrum of previous methods as special cases.\nAcknowlegements.

They model the uncertainty of hidden variable during training, and rely on a joint MAP procedure during prediction. Our proposed method builds on recent work for marginal MAP inference (Koller & Friedman, 2009; Liu & Ihler, 2013), which averages over the hidden variables (or variables that are not of direct interest), and then optimizes over the output variables (or variables of direct interest). In many domains, marginal MAP can provide significant improvement over joint MAP estimation, which jointly optimizes hidden and output variables; recent examples include blind deconvolution in computer vision (Fergus et al., 2006; Levin et al., 2011) and relation extraction and semantic role labeling in natural language processing (Naradowsky et al., 2012). Unfortunately, marginal MAP tasks on graphical models are notoriously difficult; marginal MAP can be NP-hard even when the underlying graphical model is tree-structured (Koller & Friedman, 2009).

We use the 2D-grid model as in Figure 1 (b), with local features φ(yi, xi) = eyi ⊗ xi and pairwise features φ(yi, yj) = eyi ⊗ eyj ∈ R5×5 as defined in Nowozin & Lampert (2011), where eyi is the unit normal vector with entry one on dimension yi and ⊗ is the outer product.",

MSSVM properly accounts for the uncertainty of hidden variables, and can significantly outperform the previously proposed latent structured SVM (LSSVM; Yu & Joachims (2009)) and other state-of-art methods, especially when that uncertainty is large. Our method also results in a smoother objective function, making gradient-based optimization of MSSVMs converge significantly faster than for LSSVMs. We also show that our method consistently outperforms hidden conditional random fields (HCRFs; Quattoni et al. (2007)) on both simulated and real-world datasets. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework that includes both our and several other existing methods as special cases, and provides insights into the comparison of different models in practice.",
