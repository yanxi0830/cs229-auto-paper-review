      "text" : "Bandwidth selection is arguably the most important aspect of nonparametric regression using smoothing kernels. It is well understood how the optimal bandwidth for regression depends on the sample size. Considering the one dimensional case, let\nYi = m(Xi) + ǫi, i = 1, . . . , n (1.1)\nwhere the Xis are independent and identically distributed, m : R → R is the unknown function to estimate, and ǫi ∼ N(0, σ2). Assuming m′′ is absolutely continuous and ∫ m′′(x)2dx < ∞, the risk of the Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression estimator with bandwidth h has the form\nR(m̂n,m) = c1h 4 + c2 nh + o(nh−1) + o(h4) (1.2)\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nwhere\nR(m̂n,m) = Em ∫ (m̂n(x)−m(x))2dx (1.3)\nis defined as the risk of the estimate m̂n on a sample of size n. Here c1 and c2 are constants that depend on the kernel and the distribution of X. The optimal bandwidth that minimizes (1.2) thus has order h∗ = O(n−1/5), which leads to the optimal minimax rate of convergence O(n−4/5); see Györfi et al. (2002). More generally, if we assume further smoothness of m so that the d-th derivative of m exists and is bounded, then the minimax rate n−2d/(2d+1) is achieved using local polynomial regression of order d−1 with a bandwidth of order h∗ = O(n−1/(2d+1)) (Fan & Gijbels, 1996). Thus, bandwidth selection is of the essence in nonparametric regression, and a large body of research has been devoted to this problem in various settings.\nThese classical results assume that a training data set of size n is given; the sample size n formally increases to infinity in the theoretical analysis. In an online setting, however, the data arrive sequentially, and the size of the data set is always changing. In this case the bandwidth needs to adapt somehow to the changing sample size. A simple variation of the classical methods would carry out a batch regression on the entire data set seen up to the current time T , with an appropriately sized bandwidth. However, this would require quadratic complexity O(T 2) to compute the estimates after T points are observed, and is prohibitive for large sample sizes. This motivates the problem studied in this paper—to develop computationally efficient estimators in the online setting that preserve the statistical efficiency of the classical batch estimators. We propose an algorithm for sequential regression that requires linear computational cost, and prove that the algorithm achieves the optimal minimax rate of convergence. The essential idea is to avoid recomputation by shrinking the bandwidth for each new observed data point. Our analysis assumes that the data are iid, and the algorithm assumes they are obtained sequentially.\nAlthough online local polynomial smoothing has not been previously studied, significant previous work has been devoted to related problems. Steland (2010) investigates a cross-validation scheme for sequential data and establishes theoretical results. However, this does not consider the cost of recomputing the entire model for each new bandwidth; performing leaveone-out cross-validation adds extra computation and would be impractical for many online settings. Kivinen et al. (2004) develop variants of stochastic gradient descent for online learning in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. The algorithms require linear computation cost at each step, and their RKHS analysis does not consider selection of tuning parameters for the kernel, or adaptation to the unknown smoothness of the regression function. A great deal of work has been carried out for the problem of adaptation in the classical batch setting. Fan & Gijbels (1995) consider using Residual Squares Criteria (RCS) for performing data-driven bandwidth selection; Ruppert et al. (1995) propose a plug-in bandwidth selection scheme for local linear kernel estimators. These are effective methods for adaptive estimation; however, they do not take into account the computational cost for online updating. The mixing expert framework has been a popular strategy for online prediction, and there is a rich literature on this topic (Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi, 2006). Results by Bunea & Nobel (2008) give oracle inequalities for regression in terms of generalized simplex combinations of a set of fixed estimators in the online setting. However, this analysis does not allow the experts to change over time, as we require with dynamically changing bandwidths. Further related work is discussed below.\nIn the following section we present the algorithm for sequential local polynomial regression. In Section 3 we outline a theoretical analysis of the risk achieved by this algorithm for both sequential density estimation (Theorem 3.2) and regression (Theorem 3.3). In Section 4 we briefly discuss the problem of adapting to unknown smoothness, using the expert mixing framework and also the extension to additive models. In Section 5 we present experimental results showing that our algorithm is comparable to the batch algorithm but much more computationally efficient, and adapts to unknown smoothness of the true function."

Among the various nonparametric re-\ngression methods, local polynomial regression enjoys strong minimax properties, and gracefully deals with the problem of boundary bias (Fan et al., 1993). Let {(X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), . . . } be an observation sequence according to the model given in equation (1.1). We assume that the pairs (Xi, Yi) are independent and identically distributed random variables. Throughout we assume for simplicity that the domain of m(x) is x ∈ [0, 1].

      "text" : "We first present the simplest version of the method. Recall that the kernel regression (Nadaraya-Watson) estimator in the batch setting is\nm̂n(x0) = ∑n i=1 Kh(Xi, x0)Yi∑n i=1 Kh(Xi, x0)\n(2.1)\nwhere h is the bandwidth. Under standard assumptions that the regression function is in a second-order Sobolev space, the bandwidth is chosen as h = c·n−1/5, and the estimator achieves the minimax rate of convergence R(m̂n,m) = O(n\n−4/5). Now, suppose the data arrive sequentially. Our sequential estimator takes the form\nm̃n(x0) = ∑n t=1 Kht(Xt, x0)Yt∑n t=1 Kht(Xt, x0)\n(2.2)\nwhere the bandwidth ht = c · t−1/5 is used only for the tth point. The algorithm incrementally computes the numerator and denominator, shrinking the bandwidth for each new term added. A corollary of our main technical result is that this estimator achieves the same rate of convergence as the Nadaraya-Watson estimator.\nThis result is surprising since the first examples in the sequence, (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), . . . , are assigned bandwidths ht = c · t−1/5 that are too large, introducing a bias in the estimate. However, our analysis shows that this bias is asymptotically “washed out.” To gain some intuition for how this happens, note that we can write the estimate as\nm̃n(x0) = 1 n\n∑n t=1 Kht(Xt, x0)Yt\n1 n ∑n t=1 Kht(Xt, x0) . (2.3)\nDefine f : R → [0, 1] to be the marginal probability density function of X. As we show below, the denominator is a consistent density estimate of f(x0), and moreover it attains the optimal rate of convergence. The early contributions to the series Kh1(X1, x0)Y1 + Kh2(X1, x0)Y2 + · · · are then effectively weighted by 1/nf̂(x0), which removes the bias they introduce as n increases."

To save computation, we allow a variable bandwidth in W . In other words, we select a new bandwidth hn+1 that only applies to (Xn+1, Yn+1).\nSpecifically, we propose the following sequential local polynomial regression algorithm. Let\nW̃n = diag{Kht(Xt, x0)}1≤t≤n where ht = c · t−1/(2d+1) is the bandwidth that would be asymptotically optimal with respect to a sample of size t, with c a constant. Our proposed online estimate after n samples are observed is then\nm̃n(x0) = e T 1 (X T n W̃nXn) −1XTn W̃nyn. (2.6)\nwhere e1 = (1, 0, . . . , 0).

Now, using (2.8) and the Woodbury formula for the inverse of a rankone matrix update,\n(A+ vvT )−1 = A−1 −A−1v(1 + vTA−1v)−1vTA−1, (2.9) we have that updating S−1n+1 given S −1 n has complexity O(d2). Similarly, updating\nXTn+1W̃ n+1yn+1\n=XTnW̃ nyn +Khn+1(Xn+1, x0)xn+1Yn+1 (2.10)\nhas O(d) cost. Therefore, the complexity of updating the estimate from a sample of size n to one of size n+1 at each point x0 in a grid G of size |G| is O(|G|d2), independent of n. However, the update cost in the batch setting is O(|G|(nd2+d3)) because changing the bandwidth forces re-evaluating equation (2.5)."

The backfitting algorithm is a type of coordinate descent or Gauss-Seidel procedure that iteratively computes the residuals for a variable j, and then smoothes those residuals to get a nonparametric estimate of the component function.\nIn our sequential setting, a complication comes from the fact that the residuals must be updated sequentially as well—for computational efficiency we cannot afford to compute the residuals over all of the previous data. Since the residuals for all of the p variables depend on one another, we update them iteratively using our sequential regression estimator until convergence.

In addition, we add a comparison to a batch estimator that does leave one out cross validation at each time step to choose the bandwidth constant from C. The first 50 samples are used to initialize the batch estimators.\nFigure 1 (first row) shows the average loss as a function of the sample size for the best sequential estimator (with optimal constant), the best batch estimator, and the batch cross-validation estimator for the functions. In each case, the best sequential estimator has very similar loss to the best batch estimator, which supports our theory showing that the sequential estimator achieves the same statistical rate of convergence as the classical batch algorithm. Note that in each case the average loss converges to around the noise level σ2 = .5. The middle row compares the fits of the se-\nquential, batch, and batch with cross validation, and indicates that the fits are comparable, and very close to the true function. The third row shows the standard errors for the sequential estimators running the simulations 100 times for each function.\nHere we study the estimator’s risk under unknown smoothness. We use the following parameterized set of functions: mα(x) = 2|0.5(x − 0.5)|α, x ∈ [0, 1] and let α = {1, 1.5, 2, 2.5}. At the point x0 = 0.5, the smoothness of the function mα is Hölder α continuous. We consider four “experts” of online kernel estimators using the parameter set α for their bandwidths: m̃α takes the variable bandwidth ht = 0.4× t−1/(2α+1). We use the Gaussian kernel Kh(u) = (2π) −1/2e−u 2/(2h2) for the estimator, and set the noise to be σ2 = 0.01. Although we have not included the analysis due to lack of space, it can be shown that our sequential estimator with shrinking bandwidths c · t−1/(2α+1) achieves\nthe minimax rate n−2/(2α+1) for this Hölder family of regression functions. The task here is to adapt to the unknown exponent α.\nFigure 2 shows the risk at the critical point x0 = 0.5 of the four experts under the four functions, having different degrees of smoothness. We run simulations for each of the functions 1000 times, and show a plot of the average risk as a function of sample size. For each true function mα, the expert with the correct α obtains the lowest risk for any sample size. This suppports the analysis in §4, showing the best expert has the highest weight when the experts are mixed together. As a result, the mixing expert framework of online estimators adapts to the unknown smoothness of the true function. While the sequential algorithm makes a tradeoff between performance and computational efficiency, its performance is quite comparable to that of the optimal batch estimator."

      "text" : "We proposed and analyzed an efficient sequential algorithm for local polynomial smoothing in nonparametric regression. The first contribution of this work is the online algorithm that shrinks the bandwidth for each new point that arrives. The second is the analysis showing that order d sequential local polynomial smoothing achieves the optimal minimax rate of convergence n−2d/2d+1. Finally, we show that exponential weight mixing of a family of such sequential estimators adapts to unknown smoothness at the optimal rate, and extended the algorithm to sequential backfitting for nonparametric additive models. Our experimental results confirm the theoretical analysis, and show that little loss in statistical efficiency is sacrificed by the computationally efficient online procedure. While we have shown adaptation to global smoothness, an interesting direction for future work is to consider sequential estimators that adapt to spatially inhomogeneous function classes. One promising direction is to adapt the variable bandwidth estimator of Lepski et al. (1997) to online regression for Besov spaces."
