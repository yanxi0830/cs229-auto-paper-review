      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Originally introduced in [8, 7], the offline/batch Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) stemmed from the augmented Lagrangian method, with its global convergence property established in [6, 9, 4]. Recent studies have shown that ADMM achieves a convergence rate of O(1/T ) [14, 12] (where T is number of iterations of ADMM), when the objective function is generally convex. Furthermore, ADMM enjoys a convergence rate of O(αT ), for some α ∈ (0, 1), when the objective function is strongly convex and smooth [13, 2]. ADMM has shown attractive performance in a wide range of real-world problems such as compressed sensing [18], image restoration [11], video processing, and matrix completion [10], etc.\nFrom the computational perspective, one drawback of ADMM is that, at every iteration, the method needs to compute an (empirical) expected loss function on all the training examples. The computational complexity is propositional to the number of training examples, which makes the original ADMM unsuitable for solving large-scale learning and big data mining problems. The online ADMM (OADMM) algorithm [17] was proposed to tackle the computational challenge. For OADMM, the objective function is replaced with an online function at every step, which only depends on a single training example. OADMM can achieve an average regret bound of O(1/ √ T ) for convex objective functions and O(log(T )/T ) for strongly convex objective functions. Interestingly, although the optimization of the loss function is assumed to be easy in the analysis of [17], it is actually not necessarily easy in practice. To address this issue, the stochastic ADMM algorithm was proposed, by linearizing the the online loss function [15, 16]. In stochastic ADMM algorithms, the online loss function is firstly uniformly drawn from all the loss functions associated with all the training examples. Then the loss function is replaced with its first order expansion at the current solution plus Bregman divergence from the current solution. The Bregman divergence is based on a simple proximal\n∗Department of Statistics and Biostatistics, Rutgers University, New Jersey 08854, USA. peilin.zhao@rutgers.edu †Department of Mathematics, Rutgers University, New Jersey 08854, USA. yookinwi@math.rutgers.edu ‡Department of Statistics and Biostatistics, Rutgers University, New Jersey 08854, USA. tzhang@stat.rutgers.edu §Department of Statistics and Biostatistics, Department of Computer Science, Rutgers University, New Jersey 08854, USA.\npingli@stat.rutgers.edu\nfunction, the half squared norm, so that the Bregman divergence is the half squared distance. In this way, the optimization of the loss function enjoys a closed-form solution. The stochastic ADMM achieves similar convergence rates as OADMM. Using half square norm as proximal function, however, may be a suboptimal choice. Our paper will address this issue.\nOur contribution. In the previous work [15, 16] the Bregman divergence is derived from a simple second order function, i.e., the half squared norm, which could be a suboptimal choice [3]. In this paper, we present a new family of stochastic ADMM algorithms with adaptive proximal functions, which can accelerate stochastic ADMM by using adaptive subgradient. We theoretically prove that the regret bounds of our methods are as good as those achieved by stochastic ADMM with the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms are confirmed by encouraging empirical evaluations on several real-world datasets.\nOrganization. Section 2 presents the proposed algorithms. Section 3 gives our experimental results. Section 4 concludes our paper. Additional proofs can be found in the supplementary material."

      "text" : "In this paper, we will study a family of convex optimization problems, where our objective functions are composite. Specially, we are interested in the following equality-constrained optimization task:\nmin w∈W,v∈V\nf((w⊤,v⊤)⊤) := Eξℓ(w, ξ) + ϕ(v), s.t. Aw +Bv = b, (1)\nwhere w ∈ Rd1 , v ∈ Rd2 , A ∈ Rm×d1 , B ∈ Rm×d2 , b ∈ Rm, W and V are convex sets. For simplicity, the notation ℓ is used for both the instance function value ℓ(w, ξ) and its expectation ℓ(w) = Eξℓ(w, ξ). It is assumed that a sequence of identical and independent (i.i.d.) observations can be drawn from the random vector ξ, which satisfies a fixed but unknown distribution. When ξ is deterministic, the above optimization becomes the traditional problem formulation of ADMM [1]. In this paper, we will assume the functions ℓ and ϕ are convex but not necessarily continuously differentiable. In addition, we denote the optimal solution of (1) as (w⊤∗ ,v ⊤ ∗ )\n⊤. Before presenting the proposed algorithm, we first introduce some notations. For a positive definite\nmatrix G ∈ Rd1×d1 , we define the G-norm of a vector w as ‖w‖G := √ w⊤Gw. When there is no ambiguity, we often use ‖ · ‖ to denote the Euclidean norm ‖ · ‖2. We use 〈·, ·〉 to denote the inner product in a finite dimensional Euclidean space. Let Ht be a positive definite matrix for t ∈ N. Set the proximal function φt(·), as φt(w) =\n1 2‖w‖2Ht = 1 2 〈w, Htw〉. Then the corresponding Bregman divergence for φt(w) is defined as\nBφt(w,u) = φt(w)− φt(u)− 〈∇φt(u),w − u〉 = 1\n2 ‖w− u‖2Ht ."

      "text" : "To solve the problem (1), a popular method is Alternating Direction Multipliers Method (ADMM). ADMM splits the optimizations with respect to w and v by minimizing the augmented Lagrangian:\nmin w,v\nLβ(w,v, θ) := ℓ(w) + ϕ(v) − 〈θ, Aw +Bv − b〉+ β\n2 ‖Aw +Bv − b‖2,\nwhere β > 0 is a pre-defined penalty. Specifically, the ADMM algorithm minimizes Lβ as follows\nwt+1 = argmin w Lβ(w,vt, θt), vt+1 = argmin v Lβ(wt+1,v, θt), θt+1 = θt − β(Awt+1 +Bvt+1 − b).\nAt each step, however, ADMM requires calculation of the expectation Eξℓ(w, ξ), which may be unrealistic or computationally too expensive, since we may only have an unbiased estimate of ℓ(w) or the expectation Eξℓ(w, ξ) is an empirical one for big data problem. To solve this issue, we propose to minimize the its following stochastic approximation:\nLβ,t(w,v, θ) = 〈gt,w〉+ ϕ(v) − 〈θ, Aw +Bv − b〉+ β 2 ‖Aw+ Bv − b‖2 + 1 η Bφt(w,wt),\nwhere gt = ℓ ′(wt, ξt) and Ht for φt = 1 2‖w‖2Ht will be specified later. This objective linearizes the ℓ(w, ξt) and adopts a dynamic Bregman divergence function to keep the new model near to the previous one. It is easy to see that this proposed approximation includes the one proposed by [15] as a special case when Ht = I. To minimize the above function, we followed the ADMM algorithm to optimize over w, v, θ sequentially, by fixing the others. In addition, we also need to update the Ht for Bφt at every step, which will be specified later. Finally the proposed Adaptive Stochastic Alternating Direction Multipliers Method (Ada-SADMM) is summarized in Algorithm 1.\nAlgorithm 1 Adaptive Stochastic Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (Ada-SADMM).\nInitialize: w1 = 0, u1 = 0, θ1 = 0, H1 = aI, and a > 0. for t = 1, 2, . . . , T do Compute gt = ℓ\n′(wt, ξt); Update Ht and compute Bφt ; wt+1 = argminw∈W Lβ,t(w,vt, θt); vt+1 = argminv∈V Lβ,t(wt+1,v, θt); θt+1 = θt − β(Awt+1 +Bvt+1 − b);\nend for"

      "text" : "In this subsection we will analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm for general Ht, t = 1, . . . , T . Specifically, we will provide an expected convergence rate of the iterative solutions. To achieve this goal, we firstly begin with a technical lemma, which will facilitate the later analysis.\nLemma 1. Let ℓ(w, ξt) and ϕ(w) be convex functions, and Ht be positive definite, for t ≥ 1. Then for Algorithm 1, we have the following inequality\nℓ(wt) + ϕ(vt+1)− ℓ(w)− ϕ(v) + (zt+1 − z)⊤F (zt+1) ≤ η‖gt‖2H∗t\n2 +\n1 η [Bφt(wt,w)− Bφt(wt+1,w)] + β 2 (‖Aw+ Bvt − b‖2 − ‖Aw +Bvt+1 − b‖2) + 〈δt,w−wt〉\n+ 1\n2β (‖θ − θt‖2 − ‖θ − θt+1‖2),\nwhere zt = (w ⊤ t ,v ⊤ t , θ ⊤ t ) ⊤, z = (w⊤,v⊤, θ⊤)⊤, δt = gt − ℓ′(wt), and F (z) = ((−A⊤θ)⊤, (−B⊤θ)⊤, (Aw + Bv − b)⊤)⊤.\nProof. Firstly, using the convexity of ℓ and the definition of δt, we can obtain\nℓ(wt)− ℓ(w) ≤ 〈ℓ′(wt),wt −w〉 = 〈gt,wt+1 −w〉+ 〈δt,w −wt〉+ 〈gt,wt −wt+1〉.\nCombining the above inequality with the relation between θt and θt+1 will derive\nℓ(wt)− ℓ(w) + 〈wt+1 −w,−A⊤θt+1〉 ≤ 〈gt,wt+1 −w〉+ 〈δt,w −wt〉+ 〈gt,wt −wt+1〉+ 〈wt+1 −w, A⊤[β(Awt+1 +Bvt+1 − b)− θt]〉 = 〈gt +A⊤[β(Awt+1 +Bvt − b)− θt],wt+1 −w〉\n︸ ︷︷ ︸\nLt\n+ 〈w −wt+1, βA⊤B(vt − vt+1)〉 ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nMt\n+〈δt,w −wt〉\n+ 〈gt,wt −wt+1〉 ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nNt\n.\nTo provide an upper bound for the first term Lt, taking D(u,v) = Bφt(u,v) = 12‖u − v‖2Ht and applying Lemma 1 in [15] to the step of getting wt+1 in the Algorithm 1, we will have\n〈ℓ(wt, ξt) +A⊤[β(Awt+1 +Bvt − b)− θt],wt+1 −w〉 ≤ 1\nη [Bφt(wt,w)− Bφt(wt+1,w)− Bφt(wt+1,wt)].\nTo provide an upper bound for the second term Mt, we can derive as follows\n〈w −wt+1, βA⊤B(vt − vt+1)〉 = β〈Aw −Awt+1, Bvt −Bvt+1〉 = β\n2 [(‖Aw +Bvt − b‖2 − ‖Aw+Bvt+1 − b‖2) + (‖Awt+1 +Bvt+1 − b‖2 − ‖Awt+1 +Bvt − b‖2)]\n≤ β 2 (‖Aw +Bvt − b‖2 − ‖Aw+Bvt+1 − b‖2) + 1 2β ‖θt+1 − θt‖2.\nTo drive an upper bound for the final term Nt, we can use Young’s inequality to get\n〈gt,wt −wt+1〉 ≤ η‖gt‖2H∗t\n2 + ‖wt −wt+1‖2Ht 2η = η‖gt‖2H∗t 2 + Bφt(wt,wt+1) η .\nReplacing the terms Lt, Mt and Nt with their upper bounds, we will get\nℓ(wt)− ℓ(w) + 〈wt+1 −w,−A⊤θt+1〉 ≤ 1\nη [Bφt(wt,w)− Bφtwt+1,w)] + η‖gt‖2H∗t 2 + 〈δt,w−wt〉\n+ β\n2 (‖Aw+Bvt − b‖2 − ‖Aw+Bvt+1 − b‖2) +\n1\n2β ‖θt+1 − θt‖2.\nDue to the optimality condition of the step of updating v in Algorithm 1, i.e., ∂vLβ,t(wt+1,vt+1, θt) and the convexity of ϕ, we have\nϕ(vt+1)− ϕ(v) + 〈vt+1 − v,−B⊤θt+1〉 ≤ 0.\nUsing the fact Awt+1 +Bvt+1 − b = (θt − θt+1)/β, we have\n〈θt+1 − θ, Awt+1 +Bvt+1 − b〉 = 1\n2β (‖θ − θt‖2− ‖θ − θt+1‖2− ‖θt+1 − θt‖2).\nCombining the above three inequalities and re-arranging the terms will conclude the proof.\nGiven the above lemma, now we can analyze the convergence behavior of Algorithm 1. Specifically, we provide an upper bound on the the objective value and the feasibility violation.\nTheorem 1. Let ℓ(w, ξt) and ϕ(w) be convex functions, and Ht be positive definite, for t ≥ 1. Then for Algorithm 1, we have the following inequality for any T ≥ 1 and ρ > 0:\nE[f(ūT )− f(u∗) + ρ‖Aw̄T +Bv̄T − b‖]\n≤ 1 2T\n(\nE\nT∑\nt=1\n[2\nη (Bφt(wt,w∗)− Bφt(wt+1,w∗)) + η‖gt‖2H∗t\n] + βD2v∗,B +\nρ2\nβ\n)\n. (2)\nwhere ūT = ( 1 T ∑T t=1 w ⊤ t , 1 T ∑T+1 t=2 v ⊤ t )⊤ , u∗ = (w⊤∗ ,v ⊤ ∗ ) ⊤, and (w̄T , v̄T ) = ( 1 T ∑T+1 t=2 wt, 1 T ∑T+1 t=2 vt), and Dv∗,B = ‖Bv∗‖.\nProof. For convenience, we denote u = (w⊤,v⊤)⊤, θ̄T = 1 T ∑T+1 t=2 θt, and z̄T = (w̄ ⊤ T , v̄ ⊤ T , θ̄ ⊤ T ) ⊤. With these notations, using convexity of ℓ(w) and ϕ(v) and the monotonicity of operator F (·), we have for any z:\nf(ūT )− f(u) + (z̄T − z)⊤F (z̄T ) ≤ 1\nT\nT∑\nt=1\n[f((w⊤t ,v ⊤ t+1) ⊤)− f(u) + (zt+1 − z)⊤F (zt+1)]\n= 1\nT\nT∑\nt=1\n[ℓ(wt) + ϕ(vt+1)− ℓ(w)− ϕ(v) + (zt+1 − z)⊤F (zt+1)].\nCombining this inequality with Lemma 1 at the optimal solution (w,v) = (w∗,v∗), we can derive\nf(ūT )− f(u∗) + (z̄T − z∗) ⊤ F (z̄T )\n≤ 1\nT\nT ∑\nt=1\n{1\nη [Bφt(wt,w∗)− Bφt(wt+1,w∗)] +\nη‖gt‖ 2 H∗t\n2 + 〈δt,w∗ −wt〉+\nβ 2 (‖Aw∗ +Bvt − b‖ 2\n− ‖Aw∗ +Bvt+1 − b‖ 2) +\n1\n2β (‖θ − θt‖\n2 − ‖θ − θt+1‖ 2) }\n≤ 1\nT\n{ T ∑\nt=1\n[1\nη [Bφt(wt,w∗)− Bφt(wt+1,w∗)] +\nη‖gt‖ 2 H∗t\n2 + 〈δt,w∗−wt〉\n] + β\n2 ‖Aw∗ +Bv1− b‖\n2 + 1\n2β ‖θ− θ1‖\n2 }\n≤ 1\nT\n{ T−1 ∑\nt=0\n[1\nη (Bφt(wt,w∗)− Bφt(wt+1,w∗)) +\nη‖gt‖ 2 H∗t\n2 + 〈δt,w∗ −wt〉\n] + β\n2 D\n2 v∗,B +\n1\n2β ‖θ − θ1‖\n2 }\n.\nBecause the above inequality is valid for any θ, it also holds in the ball Bρ = {θ : ‖θ‖ ≤ ρ}. Combining with the fact that the optimal solution must also be feasible, it follows that\nmax θ∈Bρ\n{f(ūT )− f(u∗) + (z̄T − z∗)⊤F (z̄T )}\n=max θ∈Bρ\n{f(ūT )− f(u∗) + θ̄⊤T (Aw∗ +Bv∗ − b)− θ⊤(Aw̄T +Bv̄T − b)}\n=max θ∈Bρ\n{f(ūT )− f(u∗)− θ⊤(Aw̄T +Bv̄T − b)} = f(ūT )− f(u∗) + ρ‖Aw̄T +Bv̄T − b‖.\nCombining the above two inequalities and taking expectation, we have\nE[f(ūT )− f(u∗) + ρ‖Aw̄T +Bv̄T − b‖]\n≤ 1 T E\n{ T∑\nt=1\n(1\nη [Bφt(wt,w∗)− Bφt(wt+1,w∗)] + η‖gt‖2H∗t 2 ) + 〈δt,w∗ −wt〉 ) + β 2 D2v∗,B + 1 2β ‖θ − θ1‖2 }\n≤ 1 2T\n{\nE\nT∑\nt=1\n[ 2\nη [Bφt(wt,w∗)− Bφt(wt+1,w∗)] + η‖gt‖2H∗t ] + βD 2 v∗,B +\nρ2\nβ\n}\n,\nwhere we used the fact Eδt = 0 in the last step. This completes the proof.\nThe above theorem allows us to derive regret bounds for a family of algorithms that iteratively modify the proximal functions φt in attempt to lower the regret bounds. Since the rate of convergence is still dependent on Ht and η, next we are going to choose appropriate positive definite matrix Ht and the constant η to optimize the rate of convergence."

In particular, we set the penalty parameter γ = ν = 1/n, where n is the number of training examples, and the trade-off parameter β = 1. In addition, we set the step size parameter ηt = 1/(γt) for SADMM according to the theorem 2 in [15]. Finally, the smooth parameter a is set as 1, and the step size for adaptive stochastic ADMM algorithms are searched from 2[−5:5] using cross validation.\nAll the experiments were conducted with 5 different random seeds and 2 epochs (2n iterations) for each dataset. All the result were reported by averaging over these 5 runs. We evaluated the learning performance by measuring objective values, i.e., f(u), and test error rates on the test datasets.

Secondly, compared with Ada-SADMMdiag, Ada-SADMMfull achieves slightly smaller objective values on most of the datasets, which indicates full matrix is slightly more informative than the diagonal one. Thirdly, the central column provides test error rates of three algorithms, where we observe that the two adaptive algorithms achieve significantly smaller or comparable test error rates at 0.25-th epoch than SADMM at 2-th epoch.\n1http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/data.html 2http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets\nThis observation indicates that we can terminate the two adaptive algorithms earlier to save time and at the same time achieve similar performance compared with SADMM. Finally, the right column shows the running time of three algorithms, which shows that during the learning process, the Ada-SADMMfull is significantly slower while the Ada-SADMMdiag is overall efficient compared with SADMM. In summary, the Ada-SADMMdiag algorithm achieves a good trade-off between the efficiency and effectiveness.\nTable 2 summarizes the performance of all the compared algorithms over the 6 datasets, from which we can make similar observations.

The traditional ADMM algorithm needs to compute, at each iteration, an (empirical) expected loss function on all training examples, resulting in a computational complexity proportional to the number of training examples. To reduce the time complexity, stochastic ADMM algorithms were proposed to replace the expected function with a random loss function associated with one uniformly drawn example plus a Bregman divergence. The Bregman divergence, however, is derived from a simple second order proximal function, the half squared norm, which could be a suboptimal choice. In this paper, we present a new family of stochastic ADMM algorithms with optimal second order proximal functions, which produce a new family of adaptive subgradient methods. We theoretically prove that their regret bounds are as good as the bounds which could be achieved by the best proximal function that can be chosen in hindsight. Encouraging empirical results on a variety of real-world datasets confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.",
