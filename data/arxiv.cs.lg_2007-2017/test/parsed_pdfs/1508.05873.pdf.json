INTRODUCTION\nADAPTIVE filtering algorithms are widely used to addresssystem identification problems in applications such as adaptive noise cancellation, echo cancellation, active noise control, and distributed learning [1]–[5]. Due to physical characteristics, some problems require the imposition of nonnegativity constraints on the parameters to estimate in order to avoid uninterpretable results [6]. Over the last decades, nonnegativity as a physical constraint has been studied extensively (see, e.g., the nonnegative least-squares [7]–[10] and the nonnegative matrix factorization [11]–[15]).\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) under Grants 61471251 and 61101217, in part by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province under Grant BK20131164, and in part by the Jiangsu Overseas Research and Training Program for University Prominent Young and Middle-Aged Teachers and Presents.

Its convergence behavior was analyzed in [16], [17]. The NNLMS algorithm is a fixed-point iteration scheme based on the Karush-KuhnTucker (KKT) optimality conditions. The NNLMS algorithm updates the parameter estimate from streaming data at each time instant and is suitable for online system identification. Variants of the NNLMS algorithm were proposed in [18] and [19] to address specific robustness and convergence issues of NNLMS algorithm.\nIn certain practical contexts, it has been shown that adaptive algorithms with weight updates based on higher order moments of the estimation error may have better mean-square error (MSE) convergence properties than the LMS algorithm. This is the case, for instance, of the least mean fourth (LMF) algorithm, whose weight update is proportional to the third power of the estimation error. The LMF algorithm was proposed in [20], where it was verified that it could outperform the LMS algorithm in the presence of non-Gaussian measurement noise. This desirable property has led to a series of studies about the convergence behaviors of the LMF algorithm and some of its variants [21]–[31]. Recently, a nonnegative LMF (NNLMF) algorithm was proposed in [32] to improve the performance of the NNLMS algorithm under non-Gaussian measurement noise. It was shown in [32] that, when compared to the NNLMS algorithm, the NNLMF algorithm can lead to faster convergence speed and equivalent steady-state performance, and to improved steady-state performance for the same convergence speed. The results shown in [32] were exclusively based on Monte Carlo simulations. Nevertheless, they clearly show that there is interest in better understanding the convergence properties of the NNLMF algorithm. To this moment, there has been no study of the stochastic behavior of the NNLMF algorithm.\nThis paper provides a first statistical analysis of the NNLMF algorithm behavior. We derive an analytical model for the algorithm behavior for slow learning and Gaussian inputs. Based on statistical assumptions typical to the analysis of adaptive algorithms, we derive recursive analytical expressions for the mean-weight behavior and for the excess MSE. The high order nonlinearities imposed on the weight update by the third error power and by the non-negativity constraints result in a difficult mathematical analysis, requiring novel approximations not usually employed in adaptive filter analyses.

It is known that the study of the stability of the LMF algorithm is relatively complex [22], [23]. This complexity increases for the NNLMF algorithm. The stability region of the NNLMF algorithm is studied in this paper through simulations, where it is explored how the algorithm stability depends on the step-size and on the initialization of the adaptive weights. A theoretical stability study could not accommodated in this work, as is left for a future work.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we describe the system model and provide an overview of the NNLMS and NNLMF algorithms. In Section III, we introduce the statistical assumptions used in the analysis of the NNLMF algorithm. The mean and mean-square analyses are performed in Sections IV and V, respectively. Simulation results validate the analysis in Section VI. Finally, Section VII concludes the paper.\nIn the sequel, normal font letters are used for scalars, boldface lowercase letters for vectors, and boldface uppercase letters for matrices.

(10)\nSubstituting (9) into (10) yields w̃i(n+1) = w̃i(n)+µu(n−i) { [w̃i(n)+w ∗ i ]e 2(n) } e(n). (11)\nBy employing (1) and (9), the estimation error e(n) can be equivalently expressed in terms of w̃(n) in the following form:\ne(n) = z(n) +w∗>u(n)−w>(n)u(n) = z(n)− w̃>(n)u(n) (12)\nwhere w̃(n) = w(n) − w∗. Expression (9) implies that the term [w̃i(n) + w∗i ]e\n2(n) in (11) is of fourth-order in w̃i(n). This makes the analysis significantly more difficult than that of the LMS or LMF algorithm.\nTo make the problem tractable, we linearize the nonlinear term\nf [w̃i(n)] = [w ∗ i + w̃i(n)]e 2(n) (13)\nvia a first-order Taylor expansion as done in [18]. Taking first the derivative of f [w̃i(n)] with respect to w̃i(n), we have\n∂f [w̃i(n)]\n∂w̃i(n) = e2(n)− 2e(n)u(n− i)[w∗i + w̃i(n)]. (14)\nConsidering that w̃i(n) fluctuates around E{w̃i(n)}, we approximate the high-order stochastic term f [w̃i(n)] at time instant n by its first-order Taylor expansion about E{w̃i(n)}.

(20)\nExpressions in (19) and (20) can be easily written in vector form as follows:\nx(n) = [x0(n), x1(n), · · · , xM−1(n)]>\n=D2eE(n)w ∗ + 2DeE(n)Du(n)DE{w̃(n)}\n× [w∗ + E{w̃(n)}] (21) s(n) = [s0(n), s1(n), · · · , sM−1(n)]>\n=D2eE(n)1− 2DeE(n)Du(n)[w ∗ + E{w̃(n)}] (22)\nwhere\neE(n) = [eE,0(n), eE,1(n), · · · , eE,M−1(n)]>\n= e(n)1−Du(n)[E{w̃(n)} − w̃(n)].

(26)\nTaking expectations of both sides of (24) yields\nE{w̃(n+ 1)} = E{w̃(n)} − µE{p(n)}+ µE{q(n)}. (27)\nNext, we need to calculate E{p(n)} and E{q(n)} to express (27) in an explicit form.

(32)\nDefine ri as the ith column vector of the input vector correlation matrix R = E { u(n)u>(n) } . Using assumptions A.1)– A.5), it is shown in Appendices A and B that the expected values of (30) and (31) can be approximated by\nE{pi,a(n)} = E { u(n− i)e2E,i(n)w∗i w̃>(n)u(n) } ' 3Tr { RE{w̃(n)}E { w̃>(n) }} E { w̃>(n) } riw ∗ i\n+ σ2zE { w̃>(n) } riw ∗ i (33)\nE{pi,b(n)} = E { u(n− i)e2E,i(n)w̃i(n)w̃>(n)u(n) } ' 3Tr { RE{w̃(n)}E { w̃>(n) }} E { w̃>(n) } riE{w̃i(n)}\n+ σ2zE { w̃>(n) } riE{w̃i(n)} (34)\nwhere σ2z = E { z2(n) } denotes the variance of the measurement noise. It is also shown in Appendix A that w̃>E,i(n)u(n) can be approximated by w̃>(n)u(n). Using this approximation in (16) yields\neE,i(n) ' z(n)− w̃>(n)u(n). (35)\nSubstituting (35) into (32), we have\npi,c(n) = 2[w ∗ i + E{w̃i(n)}]u2(n− i)w̃>(n)u(n)\n× [E{w̃i(n)} − w̃i(n)]z(n) − 2[w∗i + E{w̃i(n)}]u2(n− i) [ w̃>(n)u(n) ]2 × [E{w̃i(n)} − w̃i(n)]. (36)\nThen, using assumptions A.2) A.3) and A.5), the expected value of (36) becomes\nE{pi,c(n)} = −2[w∗i + E{w̃i(n)}]E { u2(n− i) [ w̃>(n)u(n) ]2} × E { [E{w̃i(n)} − w̃i(n)]\n} = 0 (37)\ndue to the last expectation. Therefore, we have\nE{pi(n)} = E{pi,a(n)}+ E{pi,b(n)}. (38)\nIts vector form is consequently given by\nE{p(n)} = E{pa(n)}+ E{pb(n)} (39)\nwhere E{pa(n)} = 3Tr { RE{w̃(n)}E { w̃>(n) }} Dw∗RE{w̃(n)}\n+ σ2zDw∗RE{w̃(n)} (40) E{pb(n)} = 3Tr { RE{w̃(n)}E { w̃>(n) }} DE{w̃(n)}\n×RE{w̃(n)}+ σ2zDE{w̃(n)}RE{w̃(n)}.

(42)\nFrom (26), we directly find that the ith entry of q(n) can be written as\nqi(n) = u(n− i) { e2E,i(n)w ∗ i\n+ 2eE,i(n)u(n− i)[w∗i + E{w̃i(n)}]E{w̃i(n)} + { e2E,i(n)− 2eE,i(n)u(n− i)[w∗i + E{w̃i(n)}] } × w̃i(n) } z(n). (43)\nUsing (16), we rewrite the above equation as\nqi(n) = qi,a(n) + qi,b(n)− qi,c(n) + qi,d(n) (44)\nwhere qi,a(n) = u(n− i) [ z(n)− w̃>E,i(n)u(n) ]2 w∗i z(n) (45)\nqi,b(n) = u(n− i) [ z(n)− w̃>E,i(n)u(n) ]2 w̃i(n)z(n) (46)\nqi,c(n) = 2 [ z(n)− w̃>E,i(n)u(n) ] u2(n− i) × [w∗i + E{w̃i(n)}]w̃i(n)z(n) (47) qi,d(n) = 2 [ z(n)− w̃>E,i(n)u(n) ] u2(n− i)\n× [w∗i + E{w̃i(n)}]E{w̃i(n)}z(n). (48)\nUsing assumptions A.1)–A.4) as well as the approximation E{w̃i(n)w̃j(n)} ' E{w̃i(n)}E{w̃j(n)},∀i, j, for the reason that the mean weight behavior is usually not sensitive in such kind of approximation (see [16] and [18] for detailed explanation), we have\nE{qi,a(n)} ' −2E { z2(n)u(n− i)w̃>E,i(n)u(n) } w∗i\n= −2σ2zw∗i E { w̃>(n) } ri (49)\nE{qi,b(n)} ' −2E { z2(n)u(n− i)w̃>E,i(n)u(n)E{w̃i(n)} } = −2σ2zw∗i E { w̃>(n) } ri (50)\nE{qi,c(n)} ' 2σ2zE { u2(n− i)[w∗i + E{w̃i(n)}] } × E{w̃i(n)} (51)\nE{qi,d(n)} = 2σ2zE { u2(n− i)[w∗i + E{w̃i(n)}] } × E{w̃i(n)}. (52)\nConsequently, (44) leads to\nE{qi(n)} = E{qi,a(n)}+ E{qi,b(n)} − E{qi,c(n)}+ E{qi,d(n)} ' −2σ2z [w∗i + E{w̃i(n)}]E { w̃>(n) } ri (53)\nwhich can be written in matrix form as\nE{q(n)} = −2σ2zD[w∗+E{w̃(n)}]RE{w̃(n)}. (54)\nFinally, using (42) and (54) in (27), we obtain\nE{w̃(n+ 1)} = E{w̃(n)} − 3µ σ2zD[w∗+E{w̃(n)}]RE{w̃(n)}\n− 3µTr { RE{w̃(n)}E { w̃>(n) }} D[w∗+E{w̃(n)}]RE{w̃(n)}.\n(55)\n5 Expression (55) predicts the mean weight behavior of the NNLMF algorithm. It will be used to compute the secondorder moment in the next section.\nIn the case that the input to the system is a zero-mean white noise, i.e., R = σ2uI with σ 2 u = E { u2(n) } , (55) reduces to\nE{w̃(n+ 1)} = E{w̃(n)} − 3µσ2zσ2uD[w∗+E{w̃(n)}]E{w̃(n)}\n− 3µσ4uTr { E{w̃(n)}E { w̃>(n) }} D[w∗+E{w̃(n)}]E{w̃(n)}\n= E{w̃(n)} − 3µσ2zσ2uDE{w̃(n)}[w∗ + E{w̃(n)}] − 3µσ4u‖E { w̃(n) } ‖2DE{w̃(n)}[w∗ + E{w̃(n)}].

This approximation is reasonable as Ξ(n) is a function of fourth-order products of elements of w̃(n), whose values can be obtained from infinitely many different vectors w̃(n). In [21], the expected value of Ξ(n) for zero-mean Gaussian inputs has been approximated using assumptions A.4) and A.5) by\nE{Ξ(n)} ' 3Tr{RK(n)}RK(n). (77)\nUsing (77) in (75) yields\nΘ2(n) ' −3Tr{RK(n)}[DE{w̃(n)} +Dw∗ ]RK(n).

(79)\nIt was shown in [16] that E { Du(n)w̃(n)w̃ >(n)Du(n) } ' R ◦K(n). Since\nDw̃(n)u(n)u >(n)Dw̃(n) =Du(n)w̃(n)w̃ >(n)Du(n) (80)\nwe can approximate (79) by\nΘ3(n) 'R ◦K(n) +DE{w̃(n)}RDw∗ +Dw∗RDE{w̃(n)} +Dw∗RDw∗ . (81)\nΘ4(n): Substituting (8) into (71) and using assumption A.3), (71) can be written by\nΘ4(n) = 15E {[ u>(n)w̃(n) ]2 Dw(n)u(n)u >(n)Dw(n) } = 15E {[ u>(n)w̃(n) ]2 Du(n)w(n)w >(n)Du(n)\n} = 15E { Du(n) [ w̃(n) +w∗ ] u>(n)w̃(n)\n× w̃>(n)u(n)[w̃(n) +w∗]>Du(n) }\n= 15[Θ4a(n) +Θ4b(n) +Θ4c(n) +Θ4d(n)] (82)\nwhere\nΘ4a(n) = E { Du(n)w ∗u>(n)w̃(n)w̃>(n)u(n)w∗>Du(n) } (83)\nΘ4b(n) = E { Du(n)w ∗u>(n)w̃(n)u>(n)w̃(n)w̃>(n)Du(n) } (84)\nΘ4c(n) = E { Du(n)w̃(n)w̃ >(n)u(n)w̃>(n)u(n)w∗>Du(n) } (85)\nΘ4d(n) = E { Du(n)w̃(n)w̃ >(n)u(n)u>(n)w̃(n)w̃>(n)Du(n) } .(86)\nWe find that the above quantities,Θ4a(n)–Θ4d(n), correspond to equations (45)–(48) in [16], respectively, which have been\ncomputed under assumptions A.1)–A.5). Therefore, the results obtained in [16] can be used directly here, yielding Θ4a(n) 'Dw∗ { 2RK(n)R+ Tr{RK(n)}R } Dw∗ (87)\nΘ4b(n) 'Dw∗ { 2RK(n)R+ Tr{RK(n)}R } DE{w̃(n)}(88)\nΘ4c(n) 'DE{w̃(n)} { 2RK(n)R+ Tr{RK(n)}R } Dw∗(89)\nΘ4d(n) ' { 2RK(n)R+ Tr{RK(n)}R } ◦K(n).

(91)\nΘ5(n): The term Θ5(n) contains higher order moments of w̃(n) and u(n). Computing this term also requires approximations. One approximation that preserves the second order moments is to split the expectation as E { [u>(n)w̃(n)]4 } E { Dw(n)u(n)u >(n)Dw(n) }\n. The intuition behind this approximation is that each element of the matrix Dw(n)u(n)u>(n)Dw(n) corresponds to only one of the M2 terms of the sum [u>(n)w̃(n)]2, which tends to reduce their correlation for reasonably large M . Moreover, we shall assume that u>(n)w̃(n) is zero-mean Gaussian to simplify the evaluation of the above expectations. This assumption becomes more valid as M increases (by the Central Limit theorem) and tends to be reasonable for practical values of M . Under these assumptions, we have\nΘ5(n) = E { [u>(n)w̃(n)]4 } E { Dw(n)u(n)u >(n)Dw(n) } = 3 ( E {[ u>(n)w̃(n) ]2})2 Θ3(n)\n= 3 ( Tr{RK(n)} )2{ R ◦K(n) +DE{w̃(n)}RDw∗\n+Dw∗RDE{w̃(n)} +Dw∗RDw∗ } . (92)\nΘ6(n): Using the same assumptions used to calculate Θ5(n), Θ6(n) in (73) can be approximated by\nΘ6(n) = E { [u>(n)w̃(n)]6 } E { Dw(n)u(n)u >(n)Dw(n) } = 15 ( E {[ u>(n)w̃(n) ]2})3 Θ3(n)\n= 15 ( Tr{RK(n)} )3{ R ◦K(n) +DE{w̃(n)}RDw∗\n+Dw∗RDE{w̃(n)} +Dw∗RDw∗ } . (93)\nFinally, using Θ1(n) through Θ6(n) in (62) and (63) , we obtain\nΦ1(n) ' − 3 { σ2z + Tr{RK(n)} }{ K(n)R[DE{w̃(n)} +Dw∗ ]\n+[DE{w̃(n)} +Dw∗ ]RK(n) }\n(94)\n7 and\nΦ2(n) '{ E { z6(n) } + 45σ2z ( Tr{RK(n)} )2 + 15 ( Tr{RK(n)} )3} × { R ◦K(n) +DE{w̃(n)}RDw∗\n+Dw∗RDE{w̃(n)} +Dw∗RDw∗ }\n+15E { z4(n) }{ Dw∗Υ(n)Dw∗ +Dw∗Υ(n)DE{w̃(n)}\n+DE{w̃(n)}Υ(n)Dw∗ + Υ(n) ◦K(n) } .\n(95)\nSubstituting (94) and (95) into (61) we obtain a recursive analytical model for the behavior of K(n), which can then be used in (59) to predict the EMSE behavior for the NNLMF algorithm. Note that E { z4(n) } and E { z6(n) } depend on the statistical distribution of the noise z(n). For instance, if z(n) is zero-mean Gaussian, then E { z4(n) } = 3σ4z and\nE { z6(n) } = 15σ6z ."

      "text" : "This section presents simulations in the context of system identification with nonnegativity constraints to illustrate the accuracy of the models derived in Sections IV and V. The impulse response w∗ of the unknown system was given by [0.8, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2.0.1,−0.1,−0.3,−0.6]>. The initial weight w(0) was made equal to a vector ψ0 drawn from the uniform distribution U([0; 1]) and kept the same for all realizations. Both w∗ and ψ0 are shown in Fig. 2. The input was either a zero-mean white Gaussian signal of unit power, or a correlated signal obtained by filtering a zero-mean white Gaussian noise with variance 34 through a first-order system H(z) = 1/(1 − 0.5z−1), which yields a correlated input with unit variance. The above simulation setups are the same as those in [16]. The measurement noise was either uniformly distributed in [−5, 5] (SNR = −9.2 dB) or a binary sequence with samples randomly drawn from the set {2,−2} (SNR = −6 dB). All mean weights and EMSE curves were obtained by averaging over 200 independent realizations.\nFigs. 3 and 4 show the mean weight behavior for white and correlated inputs, respectively, and µ = 2 × 10−5 was chosen for slow learning. An excellent match can be verified between the behavior predicted by the proposed model and that obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. Figs. 5 and 6 show the EMSE (in dB) behavior for the same example. Here again one can verify an excellent match between theory and simulation results.\nThe theoretical models presented in this paper predict the stochastic behavior of the NNLMF algorithm under the assumption of convergence. It is well known that the convergence of both the LMF and NNLMS algorithms depends on the step-size as well as on the weight initialization. This is because higher-order moments of the weights in the update equations lead to coupled nonlinear oscillation systems. This is also the case for the NNLMF algorithm. The stability analysis for the LMF algorithm is relatively complex [22], [23], and this complexity increases for the NNLMF algorithm. Thus, the\n1\ntheoretical stability study is left for future work. We present in the following some simulation results that illustrate the dependence of the NNLMF algorithm stability on the stepsize and on the adaptive weights initialization.\nDefining d = w̃>(0)w̃(0) as a measure of the distance between the initial weight vector and the weight vector of the unknown system, we experimentally determined the regions for which the EMSE of the NNLMF algorithm diverges. To vary d, the initial weight vector was set to w(0) = kψ0 in this simulation so that d = [kψ0 − w∗]>[kψ0 − w∗]. We varied µ from 0.1× 10−5 to 2.1× 10−5 with step 0.2× 10−5 and d from 2 to 102 with step 10. For the sake of convenience, we marked the experimentally observed test results of the algorithm in the µ − d plane to illustrate convergence and divergence regions, as well as the transition between them. The divergence or convergence of the NNLMF algorithm in each point (µ, d) was tested by more than 1000 independent realizations of 5×105 input samples. The obtained results are shown in Figs. 7 and 8 for white and correlated input signals, respectively. Notice that these convergence and divergence regions are just statistically observed results under the given simulation conditions. It is clear from these figures that the use of larger step-sizes requires some information that permits a better initialization of the weight vector."

      "text" : "The NNLMF algorithm can outperform the NNLMS algorithm when the measurement noise is non-Gaussian. This paper studied the mean and second-moment behavior of adaptive weights of the the NNLMF algorithm for stationary Gaussian input signals and slow learning. The analysis was based on typical statistical assumptions and has led to a recursive model for predicting the algorithm behavior. Simulation results have shown an excellent matching between the simulation results and the behavior predicted by the theoretical models. As the stability conditions for the NNLMF algorithm for convergence is difficult to determine analytically, we have shown through\nsimulations that it depends on both the step-size value and on the initialization of the weights. A theoretical stability analysis will be a topic for future work."
