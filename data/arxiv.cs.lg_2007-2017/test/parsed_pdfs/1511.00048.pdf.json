      "text" : "The multi-armed bandit is the simplest class of problems that exhibit the exploration/exploitation dilemma. In each time step the learner chooses one of K actions and receives a noisy reward signal for the chosen action. A learner’s performance is measured in terms of the regret, which is the (expected) difference between the rewards it actually received and those it would have received (in expectation) by choosing the optimal action.\nPrior work on the regret criterion for finite-armed bandits has treated all actions uniformly and has aimed for bounds on the regret that do not depend on which action turned out to be optimal. I take a different approach and ask what can be achieved if some actions are given special treatment. Focussing on worst-case bounds, I ask whether or not it is possible to achieve improved worst-case regret for some actions, and what is the cost in terms of the regret for the remaining actions. Such results may be useful in a variety of cases. For example, a company that is exploring some new strategies might expect an especially small regret if its existing strategy turns out to be (nearly) optimal.\nThis problem has previously been considered in the experts setting where the learner is allowed to observe the reward for all actions in every round, not only for the action actually chosen. The earliest work seems to be by Hutter and Poland [2005] where it is shown that the learner can assign a prior weight to each action and pays a worst-case regret of O(\n√−n log ρi) for expert i where ρi is the prior belief in expert i and n is the horizon. The uniform regret is obtained by choosing ρi = 1/K , which leads to the well-known O( √ n logK) bound achieved by the exponential weighting algorithm [Cesa-Bianchi, 2006]. The consequence of this is that an algorithm can enjoy a constant regret with respect to a single action while suffering minimally on the remainder. The problem was studied in more detail by Koolen [2013] where (remarkably) the author was able to exactly describe the pareto regret frontier when K = 2.\nOther related work (also in the experts setting) is where the objective is to obtain an improved regret against a mixture of available experts/actions [Even-Dar et al., 2008, Kapralov and Panigrahy, 2011]. In a similar vain, Sani et al. [2014] showed that algorithms for prediction with expert advice\ncan be combined with minimal cost to obtain the best of both worlds. In the bandit setting I am only aware of the work by Liu and Li [2015] who study the effect of the prior on the regret of Thompson sampling in a special case. In contrast the lower bound given here applies to all algorithms in a relatively standard setting.\nThe main contribution of this work is a characterisation of the pareto regret frontier (the set of achievable worst-case regret bounds) for stochastic bandits.\nLet µi ∈ R be the unknown mean of the ith arm and assume that supi,j µi − µj ≤ 1. In each time step the learner chooses an action It ∈ {1, . . . ,K} and receives reward gIt,t = µi + ηt where ηt is the noise term that I assume to be sampled independently from a 1-subgaussian distribution that may depend on It. This model subsumes both Gaussian and Bernoulli (or bounded) rewards. Let π be a bandit strategy, which is a function from histories of observations to an action It. Then the n-step expected pseudo regret with respect to the ith arm is\nRπµ,i = nµi − E n ∑\nt=1\nµIt ,\nwhere the expectation is taken with respect to the randomness in the noise and the actions of the policy. Throughout this work n will be fixed, so is omitted from the notation. The worst-case expected pseudo-regret with respect to arm i is\nRπi = sup µ Rπµ,i . (1)\nThis means that Rπ ∈ RK is a vector of worst-case pseudo regrets with respect to each of the arms. Let B ⊂ RK be a set defined by\nB =\n\n\n\nB ∈ [0, n]K : Bi ≥ min\n\n\n\nn, ∑\nj 6=i\nn\nBj\n\n\n\nfor all i\n\n\n\n. (2)\nThe boundary of B is denoted by δB. The following theorem shows that δB describes the pareto regret frontier up to constant factors.\nTheorem There exist universal constants c1 = 8 and c2 = 252 such that:\nLower bound: for ηt ∼ N (0, 1) and all strategies π we have c1(Rπ +K) ∈ B Upper bound: for all B ∈ B there exists a strategy π such that Rπi ≤ c2Bi for all i\nObserve that the lower bound relies on the assumption that the noise term be Gaussian while the upper bound holds for subgaussian noise. The lower bound may be generalised to other noise models such as Bernoulli, but does not hold for all subgaussian noise models. For example, it does not hold if there is no noise (ηt = 0 almost surely).\nThe lower bound also applies to the adversarial framework where the rewards may be chosen arbitrarily. Although I was not able to derive a matching upper bound in this case, a simple modification of the Exp-γ algorithm [Bubeck and Cesa-Bianchi, 2012] leads to an algorithm with\nRπ1 ≤ B1 and Rπk . nK\nB1 log\n(\nnK B21\n)\nfor all k ≥ 2 ,\nwhere the regret is the adversarial version of the expected regret. The details may be found in the Appendix.\nThe new results seem elegant, but disappointing. In the experts setting we have seen that the learner can distribute a prior amongst the actions and obtain a bound on the regret depending in a natural way on the prior weight of the optimal action. In contrast, in the bandit setting the learner pays an enormously higher price to obtain a small regret with respect to even a single arm. In fact, the learner must essentially choose a single arm to favour, after which the regret for the remaining arms has very limited flexibility. Unlike in the experts setting, if even a single arm enjoys constant worst-case regret, then the worst-case regret with respect to all other arms is necessarily linear."

Define Ti(t) to be the number of times action i has been chosen after time step t and µ̂i,s to be the empirical estimate of µi from the first s times action i was sampled. This means that µ̂i,Ti(t−1) is the empirical estimate of µi at the start of the tth round. I use the convention that µ̂i,0 = 0. Since the noise model is 1-subgaussian we have\n∀ε > 0 P {∃s ≤ t : µ̂i,s − µi ≥ ε/s} ≤ exp ( −ε 2\n2t\n)\n. (3)\nThis result is presumably well known, but a proof is included in Appendix E for convenience. The optimal arm is i∗ = argmaxi µi with ties broken in some arbitrary way. The optimal reward is µ∗ = maxi µi. The gap between the mean rewards of the jth arm and the optimal arm is ∆j = µ∗ − µj and ∆ji = µi − µj . The vector of worst-case regrets is Rπ ∈ RK and has been defined already in Eq. (1). I write Rπ ≤ B ∈ RK if Rπi ≤ Bi for all i ∈ {1, . . . ,K}. For vector Rπ and x ∈ R we have (Rπ + x)i = Rπi + x."

      "text" : "Before proving the main theorem I briefly describe the features of the regret frontier. First notice that if Bi = √ n(K − 1) for all i, then\nBi = √ n(K − 1) = ∑\nj 6=i\n√ n/(K − 1) = ∑\nj 6=i\nn\nBj .\nThus B ∈ B as expected. This particular B is witnessed up to constant factors by MOSS [Audibert and Bubeck, 2009] and OC-UCB [Lattimore, 2015], but not UCB [Auer et al., 2002], which suffers Rucbi ∈ Ω( √ nK logn).\nOf course the uniform choice of B is not the only option. Suppose the first arm is special, so B1 should be chosen especially small. Assume without loss of generality that B1 ≤ B2 ≤ . . . ≤ BK ≤ n. Then by the main theorem we have\nB1 ≥ K ∑\ni=2\nn\nBi ≥\nk ∑\ni=2\nn Bi ≥ (k − 1)n Bk .\nTherefore\nBk ≥ (k − 1)n\nB1 . (4)\nThis also proves the claim in the abstract, since it implies that BK ≥ (K − 1)n/B1. If B1 is fixed, then choosing Bk = (k − 1)n/B1 does not lie on the frontier because\nK ∑\nk=2\nn\nBk =\nK ∑\nk=2\nB1 k − 1 ∈ Ω(B1 logK)\nHowever, if H = ∑K k=2 1/(k − 1) ∈ Θ(logK), then choosing Bk = (k − 1)nH/B1 does lie on the frontier and is a factor of logK away from the lower bound given in Eq. (4). Therefore up the a logK factor, points on the regret frontier are characterised entirely by a permutation determining the order of worst-case regrets and the smallest worst-case regret.\nPerhaps the most natural choice of B (assuming again that B1 ≤ . . . ≤ BK) is\nB1 = n p and Bk = (k − 1)n1−pH for k > 1 .\nFor p = 1/2 this leads to a bound that is at most √ K logK worse than that obtained by MOSS and\nOC-UCB while being a factor of √ K better for a select few.\nAssumptions\nThe assumption that ∆i ∈ [0, 1] is used to avoid annoying boundary problems caused by the fact that time is discrete. This means that if ∆i is extremely large, then even a single sample from this arm can cause a big regret bound. This assumption is already quite common, for example a worst-case regret of Ω( √ Kn) clearly does not hold if the gaps are permitted to be unbounded. Unfortunately there is no perfect resolution to this annoyance. Most elegant would be to allow time to be continuous with actions taken up to stopping times. Otherwise you have to deal with the discretisation/boundary problem with special cases, or make assumptions as I have done here."

On the other hand, the total number of pulls for arms j for which Zi ≥ ∆̄ji/2 is at most n. (b) follows by bounding τji in expectation using Lemma 6. (c) follows from basic calculus and because for j ∈ A we have ∆̄ji ≥ √ 1/ni.

      "text" : "In a recent technical report I demonstrated empirically that MOSS suffers sub-optimal problemdependent regret in terms of the minimum gap [Lattimore, 2015]. Specifically, it can happen that\nRmossµ,i∗ ∈ Ω ( K\n∆min logn\n)\n, (6)\nwhere ∆min = mini:∆i>0 ∆i. On the other hand, the order-optimal asymptotic regret can be significantly smaller.

(6) and is asymptotically order-optimal [Lai and Robbins, 1985]. The problem is that MOSS explores only enough to obtain minimax regret, but sometimes obtains minimax regret even when a more conservative algorithm would do better. It is worth remarking that this effect is harder to observe than one might think. The example given in the afforementioned technical report is carefully tuned to exploit this failing, but still requires n = 109 and K = 103 before significant problems arise. In all other experiments MOSS was performing admirably in comparison to UCB.\nAll these problems can be avoided by modifying UCB rather than MOSS. The cost is a factor of O( √ log n). The algorithm is similar to Algorithm 1, but chooses the action that maximises the following index.\nIt = argmax i µ̂i,Ti(t−1) +\n√\n(2 + ε) log t Ti(t− 1) − √ logn ni ,\nwhere ε > 0 is a fixed arbitrary constant.\nTheorem 7.

Also note that the 4 appearing in the square root of the unbalanced MOSS algorithm is due to the fact that I am not assuming rewards are bounded in [0, 1] for which the variance is at most 1/4.

      "text" : "I have shown that the cost of favouritism for multi-armed bandit algorithms is rather serious. If an algorithm exhibits a small worst-case regret for a specific action, then the worst-case regret of the remaining actions is necessarily significantly larger than the well-known uniform worst-case bound of Ω( √ Kn). This unfortunate result is in stark contrast to the experts setting for which there exist algorithms that suffer constant regret with respect to a single expert at almost no cost for the remainder. Surprisingly, the best achievable (non-uniform) worst-case bounds are determined up to a permutation almost entirely by the value of the smallest worst-case regret.\nThere are some interesting open questions. Most notably, in the adversarial setting I am not sure if the upper or lower bound is tight (or neither). It would also be nice to know if the constant factors can be determined exactly asymptotically, but so far this has not been done even in the uniform case. For the stochastic setting it is natural to ask if the OC-UCB algorithm can also be modified. Intuitively one would expect this to be possible, but it would require re-working the very long proof."

Here I prove the claim that\nE π µkTk(n)− Eπµ1Tk(n) ≤ nεk\n√\nEπµ1Tk(n) .\nThe result follows along the same lines as the proof of the lower bounds given by Auer et al. [1995]. Let {Ft}nt=1 be a filtration where Ft contains information about rewards and actions chosen up to time step t. So gIt,t and 1{It = i} are measurable with respect to Ft. Let P1 and Pk be the measures on F induced by bandit problems µ1 and µk respectively. Note that Tk(n) is a Fn-measurable random variable bounded in [0, n]. Therefore\nE π µkTk(n)− Eπµ1Tk(n)\n(a) ≤ n sup A |P1(A) − P2(A)|\n(b) ≤ n √ 1\n2 KL(P1, Pk) ,\nwhere the supremum in (a) is taken over all measurable sets (this is the total variation distance) and (b) follows from Pinsker’s inequality. It remains to compute the KL divergence. Let P1,t and Pk,t be the conditional measures on the tth reward. By the chain rule for the KL divergence we have\nKL(P1, Pk) = n ∑\nt=1\nEP1 KL(P1,t, Pk,t) (a) = 2ε2k\nn ∑\nt=1\nEP11{It = k} = 2ε2kEπµ1Tk(n) ,\nwhere (a) follows by noting that if It 6= k, then the distribution of the rewards at time step t is the same for both bandit problems µ1 and µk. For It = k we have the difference in means is (µk)k−(µ1)k = εk and since the distributions are Gaussian the KL divergence is 2ε2k. For Bernoulli random noise the KL divergence is also Θ(ε2k) provided (µk)k ≈ (µ1)k ≈ 1/2 and so a similar proof works for this case. See the work by Auer et al. [1995] for an example."

A Note on Constants The constants in the statement of Theorem 2 can be improved by carefully tuning all thresh-holds, but the proof would grow significantly and I would not expect a corresponding boost in practical performance. In fact, the reverse is true, since the “weak” bounds used in the proof would propagate to the algorithm. Also note that the 4 appearing in the square root of the unbalanced MOSS algorithm is due to the fact that I am not assuming rewards are bounded in [0, 1] for which the variance is at most 1/4. It is possible to replace the 4 with 2+ ε for any ε > 0 by changing the base in the peeling argument in the proof of Lemma 4 as was done by Bubeck [2010] and others.",
