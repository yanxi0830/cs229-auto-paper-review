      "text" : "Regularization by the ℓ1-norm has attracted a lot of interest in recent years in machine learning, statistics and signal processing. In the context of least-square linear regression, the problem is usually referred to as the Lasso (Tibshirani, 1994). Much of the early effort has been dedicated to algorithms to solve the optimization problem efficiently. In particular, the Lars algorithm of Efron et al. (2004) allows to find the entire regularization path (i.e., the set of solutions for all values of the regularization parameters) at the cost of a single matrix inversion.\nMoreover, a well-known justification of the regularization by the ℓ1-norm is that it leads to sparse solutions, i.e., loading vectors with many zeros, and thus performs model selection. Recent works (Zhao & Yu, 2006; Yuan & Lin,\n1\n2007; Zou, 2006; Wainwright, 2006) have looked precisely at the model consistency of the Lasso, i.e., if we know that the data were generated from a sparse loading vector, does the Lasso actually recover it when the number of observed data points grows? In the case of a fixed number of covariates, the Lasso does recover the sparsity pattern if and only if a certain simple condition on the generating covariance matrices is verified (Yuan & Lin, 2007). In particular, in low correlation settings, the Lasso is indeed consistent. However, in presence of strong correlations, the Lasso cannot be consistent, shedding light on potential problems of such procedures for variable selection. Adaptive versions where data-dependent weights are added to the ℓ1-norm then allow to keep the consistency in all situations (Zou, 2006).\nIn this paper, we first derive a detailed asymptotic analysis of sparsity pattern selection of the Lasso estimation procedure, that extends previous analysis (Zhao & Yu, 2006; Yuan & Lin, 2007; Zou, 2006), by focusing on a specific decay of the regularization parameter. We show that when the decay is proportional to n−1/2, where n is the number of observations, then the Lasso will select all the variables that should enter the model (the relevant variables) with probability tending to one exponentially fast with n, while it selects all other variables (the irrelevant variables) with strictly positive probability. If several datasets generated from the same distribution were available, then the latter property would suggest to consider the intersection of the supports of the Lasso estimates for each dataset: all relevant variables would always be selected for all datasets, while irrelevant variables would enter the models randomly, and intersecting the supports from sufficiently many different datasets would simply eliminate them. However, in practice, only one dataset is given; but resampling methods such as the bootstrap are exactly dedicated to mimic the availability of several datasets by resampling from the same unique dataset (Efron & Tibshirani, 1998). In this paper, we show that when using the bootstrap and intersecting the supports, we actually get a consistent model estimate, without the consistency condition required by the regular Lasso. We refer to this new procedure as the Bolasso (bootstrap-enhanced least absolute shrinkage operator). Finally, our Bolasso framework could be seen as a voting scheme applied to the supports of the bootstrap Lasso estimates; however, our procedure may rather be considered as a consensus combination scheme, as we keep the (largest) subset of variables on which all regressors agree in terms of variable selection, which is in our case provably consistent and also allows to get rid of a potential additional hyperparameter.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we present the asymptotic analysis of model selection for the Lasso; in Section 3, we describe the Bolasso algorithm as well as its proof of model consistency, while in Section 4, we illustrate our results on synthetic data, where the true sparse generating model is known, and data from the UCI machine learning repository. Sketches of proofs can be found in Appendix A.\n2\nNotations For a vector v ∈ Rp, we let denote ‖v‖2 = (v ⊤v)1/2 the ℓ2-norm, ‖v‖∞ = maxi∈{1,...,p} |vi| the ℓ∞-norm and ‖v‖1 = ∑p\ni=1 |vi| the ℓ1-norm. For a ∈ R, sign(a) denotes the sign of a, defined as sign(a) = 1 if a > 0, −1 if a < 0, and 0 if a = 0. For a vector v ∈ Rp, sign(v) ∈ Rp denotes the the vector of signs of elements of v.\nMoreover, given a vector v ∈ Rp and a subset I of {1, . . . , p}, vI denotes the vector in RCard(I) of elements of v indexed by I.

      "text" : "In this section, we detail the asymptotic behavior of the Lasso estimate ŵ, both in terms of the difference in norm with the population value w (i.e., regular consistency) and of the sign pattern sign(ŵ), for all asymptotic behaviors of the regularization parameter µn. Note that information about the sign pattern includes information about the support, i.e., the indices i for which ŵi is different from zero; moreover, when ŵ is consistent, consistency of the sign pattern is in fact equivalent to the consistency of the support.\nWe now consider five mutually exclusive possible situations which explain various portions of the regularization path (we assume (A1-3)); many of these results appear elsewhere (Yuan & Lin, 2007; Zhao & Yu, 2006; Fu & Knight, 2000; Zou, 2006; Bach, 2007) but some of the finer results presented below are new (see Section 2.4).\n1. If µn tends to infinity, then ŵ = 0 with probability tending to one.\n2. If µn tends to a finite strictly positive constant µ0, then ŵ converges in probability to the unique global minimum of 12 (w−w)\n⊤Q(w−w)+µ0‖w‖1. Thus, the estimate ŵ never converges in probability to w, while the sign pattern tends to the one of the previous global minimum, which may or may not be the same as the one of w.2\n3. If µn tends to zero slower than n −1/2, then ŵ converges in probability to w\n(regular consistency) and the sign pattern converges to the sign pattern of the global minimum of 12v ⊤Qv+v⊤ J sign(wJ)+‖vJc‖1. This sign pattern is equal to the population sign vector s = sign(w) if and only if the following consistency condition is satisfied:\n‖QJcJQ −1 JJ sign(wJ)‖∞ 6 1. (2)\nThus, if Eq. (2) is satisfied, the probability of correct sign estimation is tending to one, and to zero otherwise (Yuan & Lin, 2007).\n2Here and in the third regime, we do not take into account the pathological cases where the sign pattern of the limit in unstable, i.e., the limit is exactly at a hinge point of the regularization path.\n4\n4. If µn = µ0n −1/2 for µ0 ∈ (0,∞), then the sign pattern of ŵ agrees on\nJ with the one of w with probability tending to one, while for all sign patterns consistent on J with the one of w, the probability of obtaining this pattern is tending to a limit in (0, 1) (in particular strictly positive); that is, all patterns consistent on J are possible with positive probability. See Section 2.4 for more details.\n5. If µn tends to zero faster than n −1/2, then ŵ is consistent (i.e., converges\nin probability to w) but the support of ŵ is equal to {1, . . . , p} with probability tending to one (the signs of variables in Jc may be negative or positive). That is, the ℓ1-norm has no sparsifying effect.\nAmong the five previous regimes, the only ones with consistent estimates (in norm) and a sparsity-inducing effect are µn tending to zero and µnn\n1/2 tending to a limit µ0 ∈ (0,∞] (i.e., potentially infinite). When µ0 = +∞, then we can only hope for model consistent estimates if the consistency condition in Eq. (2) is satisfied. This somewhat disappointing result for the Lasso has led to various improvements on the Lasso to ensure model consistency even when Eq. (2) is not satisfied (Yuan & Lin, 2007; Zou, 2006). Those are based on adaptive weights based on the non regularized least-square estimate. We propose in Section 3 an alternative way which is based on resampling.\nIn this paper, we now consider the specific case where µn = µ0n −1/2 for µ0 ∈ (0,∞), where we derive new asymptotic results. Indeed, in this situation, we get the correct signs of the relevant variables (those in J) with probability tending to one, but we also get all possible sign patterns consistent with this, i.e., all other variables (those not in J) may be non zero with asymptotically strictly positive probability. However, if we were to repeat the Lasso estimation for many datasets obtained from the same distribution, we would obtain for each µ0, a set of active variables, all of which include J with probability tending to one, but potentially containing all other subsets. By intersecting those, we would get exactly J.\nHowever, this requires multiple copies of the samples, which are not usually available. Instead, we consider bootstrapped samples which exactly mimic the behavior of having multiple copies. See Section 3 for more details.\n2.4 Model Consistency with Exact Root-n Regularization\nDecay\nIn this section we present detailed new results regarding the pattern consistency for µn tending to zero exactly at rate n −1/2 (see proofs in Appendix A):\nProposition 1 Assume (A1-3) and µn = µ0n −1/2, µ0 > 0. Then for any sign pattern s ∈ {−1, 0, 1}p such that sJ = sign(wJ), P(sign(ŵ) = s) tends to a limit ρ(s, µ0) ∈ (0, 1), and we have:\nP(sign(ŵ) = s)− ρ(s, µ0) = O(n −1/2 logn).\n5\nProposition 2 Assume (A1-3) and µn = µ0n −1/2, µ0 > 0. Then, for any pattern s ∈ {−1, 0, 1}p such that sJ 6= sign(wJ), there exist a constant A(µ0) > 0 such that\nlogP(sign(ŵ) = s) 6 −nA(µ0) +O(n −1/2).\nThe last two propositions state that we get all relevant variables with probability tending to one exponentially fast, while we get exactly get all other patterns with probability tending to a limit strictly between zero and one. Note that the results that we give in this paper are valid for finite n, i.e., we could derive actual bounds on probability of sign pattern selections with known constants that explictly depend on w, Q and PXY ."

The n pairs (xki , y k i ), i = 1, . . . , n, are sampled uniformly at random with replacement from the n original pairs in (X,Y ). The sampling of the nm pairs of observations is independent. In other words, we defined the distribution of the ghost sample (X ∗ , Y ∗ ) by sampling n points with replacement from (X,Y ), and, given (X,Y ), the m ghost samples are independently sampled i.i.d. from the distribution of (X ∗ , Y ∗ ).\nThe asymptotic analysis from Section 2 suggests to estimate the supports Jk = {j, ŵ k j 6= 0} of the Lasso estimates ŵ\nk for the bootstrap samples, k = 1, . . . ,m, and to intersect them to define the Bolasso model estimate of the support: J =\n⋂m k=1 Jk. Once J is selected, we estimate w by the unregularized\nleast-square fit restricted to variables in J . The detailed algorithm is given in Algorithm 1. The algorithm has only one extra parameter (the number of bootstrap samples m). Following Proposition 3, log(m) should be chosen growing with n asymptotically slower than n. In simulations, we always use m = 128 (except in Figure 3, where we exactly study the influence of m).\nNote that in practice, the Bolasso estimate can be computed simultaneously for a large number of regularization parameters because of the efficiency of the Lars algorithm (which we use in simulations), that allows to find the entire regularization path for the Lasso at the (empirical) cost of a single matrix inversion (Efron et al., 2004). Thus computational complexity of the Bolasso is O(m(p3 + p2n)).\nThe following proposition (proved in Appendix A) shows that the previous algorithm leads to consistent model selection.\nProposition 3 Assume (A1-3) and µn = µ0n −1/2, µ0 > 0.

Note that the previous bound is true whether the condition in Eq. (2) is satisfied or not, but could be improved on if we suppose that Eq. (2) is satisfied.

We then selected the first Card(J) = r variables and sampled non zero loading vectors as follows: (a) sample each loading from independent standard normal distributions, (b) rescale those to unit magnitude, (c) rescale those by a scaling which is uniform at random between 13 and 1 (to ensure minj∈J |wj | > 1/3). Finally, we chose a constant noise level σ equal to 0.1 times (E(w⊤X)2)1/2, and the additive noise ε is normally distributed with zero mean and variance σ2. Note that the joint distribution on (X,Y )\n7\nthus defined satisfies with probability one (with respect to the sampling of the covariance matrix) assumptions (A1-3).\nIn Figure 1, we sampled two distributions PXY with p = 16 and r = 8 relevant variables, one for which the consistency condition in Eq. (2) is satisfied (left), one for which it was not satisfied (right). For a fixed number of sample n = 1000, we generated 256 replications and computed the empirical frequencies of selecting any given variable for the Lasso as the regularization parameter µ varies. Those plots show the various asymptotic regimes of the Lasso detailed in Section 2. In particular, on the right plot, although no µ leads to perfect selection (i.e., exactly variables with indices less than r = 8 are selected), there is a range where all relevant variables are always selected, while all others are selected with probability within (0, 1).\nIn Figure 2, we plot the results under the same conditions for the Bolasso (with a fixed number of bootstrap replications m = 128). We can see that in the Lasso-consistent case (left), the Bolasso widens the consistency region, while in the Lasso-inconsistent case (right), the Bolasso “creates” a consistency region.\n8\nIn Figure 3, we selected the same two distributions and compared the probability of exactly selecting the correct support pattern, for the Lasso, and for the Bolasso with varying numbers of bootstrap replications (those probabilities are computed by averaging over 256 experiments with the same distribution). In Figure 3, we can see that in the Lasso-inconsistent case (right), the Bolasso indeed allows to fix the unability of the Lasso to find the correct pattern. Moreover, increasing m looks always beneficial; note that although it seems to contradict the asymptotic analysis in Section 3 (which imposes an upper bound for consistency), this is due to the fact that not selecting (at least) the relevant variables has very low probability and is not observed with only 256 replications.\nFinally, in Figure 4, we compare various variable selection procedures for linear regression, to the Bolasso, with two distributions where p = 64, r = 8 and varying n. For all the methods we consider, there is a natural way to select exactly r variables with no free parameters (for the Bolasso, we select the most stable pattern with r elements, i.e., the pattern which corresponds to most values of µ). We can see that the Bolasso outperforms all other variable selection methods, even in settings where the number of samples becomes of the order of the number of variables, which requires additional theoretical analysis, subject of ongoing research. Note in particular that we compare with bagging of least-square regression (Breiman, 1996a) followed by a thresholding of the loading vector, which is another simple way of using bootstrap samples: the Bolasso provides a more efficient way to use the extra information, not for usual stabilization purposes (Breiman, 1996b), but directly for model selection. Note finally, that the bagging of Lasso estimates requires an additional parameter and is thus not tested."

In Table 1, we consider data randomly generated as in Section 4.1 (with p = 32, r = 8, n = 64), where the true model is known to be composed of a sparse loading vector, while in Table 2, we consider regression datasets from the UCI machine learning repository.

Second, the same technique can be applied to similar settings than least-square regression with the ℓ1-norm, namely regularization by block ℓ1-norms (Bach, 2007) and other losses such as general convex classification losses.

The proofs rely on the well-known property of the Lasso optimization problems, namely that if the sign pattern of the solution is\n11\nknown, then we can get the solution in closed form.\nA.1 Optimality Conditions\nWe let denote ε = Y −Xw ∈ Rn, Q = X ⊤ X/n ∈ Rp×p and q = X ⊤ ε/n ∈ Rp. First, we can equivalently rewrite Eq. (1) as:\nmin w∈Rp\n1 2 (w − w) ⊤Q(w − w)− q⊤(w − w) + µn‖w‖1. (3)\nThe optimality conditions for Eq.

The main idea behind the results is to consider that (Q, q) are distributed according to their limiting distributions, obtained from the law of large numbers and the central limit theorem, i.e., Q converges to Q a.s. and n1/2q is asymptotically normally distributed with mean zero and covariance matrix σ2Q. When assuming this, Propositions 1 and 2 are straightforward. The main effort is to make sure that we can safely replace (Q, q) by their limiting distributions. The following lemmas give sufficient conditions for correct estimation of the signs of variables in J and for selecting a given pattern s (note that all constants could be expressed in terms of Q and w, details are omitted here):\nLemma 1 Assume (A2) and ‖Q − Q‖2 6 λmin(Q)/2.

Then sign(ŵ) = sign(w).\nThose two lemmas are interesting because they relate optimality of certain sign patterns to quantities from which we can derive concentration inequalities.\n12\nA.2 Concentration Inequalities\nThroughout the proofs, we need to provide upper bounds on the following quantities P(‖Q−1/2q‖2 > α) and P(‖Q− Q‖2 > η). We obtain, following standard arguments (Boucheron et al., 2004): if α < C9 and η < C10 (where C9, C10 > 0 are constants),\nP(‖Q−1/2q‖2 > α) 6 4p exp ( − nα 2\n2pC9\n)\n.\nP(‖Q− Q‖2 > η) 6 4p 2 exp\n(\n− nη 2\n2p2C10\n)\n.\nWe also consider multivariate Berry-Esseen inequalities (Bentkus, 2003); the probability P(n1/2q ∈ C) can be estimated as P(t ∈ C) where t is normal with mean zero and covariance matrix σ2Q. The error is then uniformly (for all convex sets C) upperbounded by:\n400p1/4n−1/2λmin(Q) −3/2 E|ε|3‖X‖32 = C11n −1/2.\nA.3 Proof of Proposition 1\nBy Lemma 2, for any given A, and n large enough, the probability that the sign is different from s is upperbounded by\nP\n(\n‖Q−1/2q‖2> A(logn)1/2\nn1/2\n) + P ( ‖Q−Q‖2> A(logn)1/2\nn1/2\n)\n+P {t /∈ C(s, µ0(1− α))} + 2C11n −1/2,\nwhere C(s, β) is the set of t such that (a) ‖QJcJQ −1 JJ tJ−tJc−βQJcJQ −1 JJsJ‖∞ 6\nβ and (b) for all i ∈ J\\J, si [ Q−1JJ (tJ − βsJ) ] i > 0. Note that here α = O((log n)n−1/2) tends to zero and that we have: P {t /∈ C(s, µ0(1 − α))} 6 P {t /∈ C(s, µ0)}+O(α). All terms (ifA is large enough) are thusO((log n)n\n−1/2). This shows that P(sign(ŵ) = sign(w)) > ρ(s, µ0) + O((log n)n\n−1/2) where ρ(s, µ0) = P {t ∈ C(s, µ0)} ∈ (0, 1)–the probability is strictly between 0 and 1 because the set and its complement have non empty interiors and the normal distribution has a positive definite covariance matrix σ2Q. The other inequality can be proved similarly. Note that the constant in O((log n)n−1/2) depends on µ0 but by carefully considering this dependence on µ0, we could make the inequality uniform in µ0 as long as µ0 tends to zero or infinity at most at a logarithmic speed (i.e., µn deviates from n\n−1/2 by at most a logarithmic factor). Also, it would be interesting to consider uniform bounds on portions of the regularization path.\nA.4 Proof of Proposition 2\nFrom Lemma 1, the probability of not selecting any of the variables in J is upperbounded by P(‖Q−1/2q‖2 > C1 − µnC2) + P(‖Q − Q‖2 > λmin(Q)/2), which is straightforwardly upper bounded (using Section A.2) by a term of the required form.\n13\nA.5 Proof of Proposition 3\nIn order to simplify the proof, we made the simplifying assumption that the random variables X and ε have compact supports. Extending the proofs to take into account the looser condition that ‖X‖2 and ε2 have non uniformly infinite cumulant generating functions (i.e., assumption (A1)) can be done with minor changes. The probability that\n⋂m k=1 Jk is different from J is upper bounded by\nthe sum of the following probabilities:\n(a) Selecting at least variables in J: the probability that for the k-th replication, one index in J is not selected, each of them which is upper bounded by P(‖Q−1/2q∗‖2 > C1/2)+ P(‖Q−Q ∗‖2 > λmin(Q)/2), where q ∗ corresponds to the ghost sample; as common in theoretical analysis of the bootstrap, we relate q∗ to q as follows: P(‖Q−1/2q∗‖2 > C1/2) 6 P(‖Q\n−1/2(q∗ − q)‖2 > C1/4) + P(‖Q −1/2q‖2 > C1/4) (and similarly for P(‖Q−Q ∗‖2 > λmin(Q)/2)). Because we have assumed that X and ε have compact supports, the bootstrapped variables have also compact support and we can use concentration inequalities (given the original variables X, and also after expectation with respect toX). Thus the probability for one bootstrap replication is upperbounded by Be−Cn where B and C are strictly positive constants. Thus the overall contribution of this part is less than mBe−Cn.\n(b) Selecting at most variables in J: the probability that for all replications, the set J is not exactly selected (note that this is not tight at all since on top of the relevant variables which are selected with overwhelming probability, different additional variables may be selected for different replications and cancel out when intersecting).\nOur goal is thus to bound E { P(J∗ 6= J|X)m } . By previous lemmas, we\nhave that P(J∗ 6= J|X) is upper bounded by P ( ‖Q−1/2q∗‖2 > A(logn)1/2\nn1/2 |X\n)\n+\nP\n(\n‖Q−Q∗‖2 > A(logn)1/2\nn1/2 |X\n)\n+P(t∗ /∈ C(µ0)|X)+2C11n −1/2+O( logn\nn1/2 ), where\nnow, given X,Y , t∗ is normally distributed with mean n1/2q and covariance matrix 1n ∑n i=1 ε 2 ixix ⊤ i .\nThe first two terms and the last two ones are uniformly O( log n n1/2\n) (if A is large enough). We then have to consider the remaining term. We have C(µ0) = {t\n∗ ∈ R\np, ‖QJcJQ −1 JJ t∗ J − t∗ Jc − µ0QJcJQ −1 JJ\nsJ‖∞ 6 µ0}. By Hoeffding’s inequality, we can replace the covariance matrix that depends on X and Y by σ2Q, at cost O(n−1/2). We thus have to bound P(n1/2q + y /∈ C(µ0)|q) for y normally distributed and C(µ0) a fixed compact set. Because the set is compact, there exist constants A,B > 0 such that, if ‖n1/2q‖2 6 α for α large enough, then P(n1/2q + y /∈ C(µ0)|q) 6 1 − Ae −Bα2 . Thus, by truncation, we obtain a bound of the form: E { P(J∗ 6= J|X)m } 6 (1−Ae−Bα 2\n+F logn n1/2 )m +Ce−Bα 2 6\nexp(−mAe−Bα 2 +mF logn n1/2 )+Ce−Bα 2 , where we have used Hoeffding’s inequality to upper bound P(‖n1/2q‖2 > α). By minimizing in closed form with respect to e−Bα 2 , i.e., with e−Bα 2\n= F logn An1/2 + log(mA/C)mA , we obtain the desired inequality.\n14"
