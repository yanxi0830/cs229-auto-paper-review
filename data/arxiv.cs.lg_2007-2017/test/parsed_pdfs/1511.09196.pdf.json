      "text" : "In the classic group testing problem which was first introduced by Dorfman [10], there is a set of n items including at most d defective items. The purpose of this problem is to find the defective items with the minimum number of tests. Every test consists of some items and each test is positive if it includes at least one defective item. Otherwise, the test is negative. There are two types of algorithms for the group testing problem, adaptive and non-adaptive. In adaptive algorithm, the outcome of previous tests can be used in the future tests and in non-adaptive algorithm all tests perform at the same time and the defective items are obtained by considering the results of all tests.\nRegarding some extensions of classical group testing, we can refer to group testing on graphs, complex group testing, additive model, inhibitor model, etc. (see [11, 12, 16] for more information). Aigner [1] proposed the problem of group testing on graphs, in which we look for one defective edge of the given graph G by performing the minimum adaptive tests, where each test is an induced subgraph of the graph G and the test is positive in the case of involving the defective edge.\nIn the present paper, the problem of non-adaptive group testing on graphs was considered by assuming that there is one defective subgraph (not necessarily induced subgraph) of G isomorphic to a graph H and our purpose is to find the defective subgraph with minimum number of non-adaptive tests. Each test F is an induced subgraph of G and the test result is positive if and only if F includes at least one\nedge of the defective subgraph. This is a generalization of the problem of nonadaptive learning a hidden subgraph studied in [2, 3]. In the problem of learning hidden graph, the graph G is a complete graph. In other words, let H be a family of labeled graphs on the set V = {1, 2, ..., n}. In this problem the goal is to reconstruct a hidden graph H ∈ H by minimum number of tests, where a test F ⊂ V is positive if the subgraph of H induced by F , contains at least one edge. Otherwise the test is negative.\nThe problem of learning a hidden graph was emphasized in some models as follows:\nK-vertex model : In this model, each test has at most k vertices. Additive model : Based on this model, the result of each test F is the number of edges of H induced by F . This model is mainly utilized in bioinformatics and was studied in [7, 13].\nShortest path test : In this model, each test u, v indicates the length of the shortest path between u and v in the hidden graph and if no path exists, return ∞. More information about this model and the result is given in [20]. Further, this model is regarded as a canonical model in the evolutionary tree literature [15, 17, 21].\nThere are various families of hidden graphs to study. However, a large number of recent studies have focused on hamiltonian cycles and matchings [3, 6, 14], stars and cliques [2], graph of bounded degree [7, 13], general graphs [5, 7] . Here, we present a short survey of known results on these problems by using adaptive and non-adaptive algorithms.\nGrebinski and Kucherov [14] suggested an adaptive algorithm to learn a hidden Hamiltonian cycle by 2nlgn tests, which achieves the information lower bound for the number of tests needed. Further, Chang et al.[8] could improve their results to (1 + o(1))n log n.\nAlon et al. [3] proposed an upper bound (12 + o(1)) ( n 2 )\non learning a hidden matching using non-adaptive tests. Bouvel et al. [7] developed an adaptive algorithm to learn a hidden matching with at most (1+o(1))n log n tests. In addition, Change et al. [8] improved their result to (1 + o(1))n logn2 .\nAlon and Asodi [2] developed an upper bound O(n log2 n) on learning a hidden clique using non-adaptive tests. Also they proved an upper bound k3 log n on learning a hidden K1,k using non-adaptive tests. Bouvel et al. [7] presented two adaptive algorithms to learn hidden star and hidden clique with at most 2n tests. Change et al. [8] improved their results on learning hidden star and hidden clique to (1+o(1))n and n+ log n, respectively.\nGrebinski and Kucherov [13] gave tight bound of θ(dn) and θ( n 2\nlogn) non-adaptive tests on learning a hidden d-degree-bounded and general graphs in additive model, respectively. Angluin and Chen [5] proved that a hidden general graph can be identified in 12mlogn tests through using adaptive algorithm where m (unknown) is the number of edges in the hidden graph. This bound is tight up to a constant factor for classes of non-dense graphs.\nGroup testing can be implemented in finding pattern in data, DNA library screening, and so on (see [11, 12, 18, 19] for an overview of results and more applications). Learning hidden graph, especially hamiltonian cycle and matchings, is mostly applied in genome sequencing, DNA physical mapping, chemical reactions\nand molecular biology (see [5, 8, 14, 22] for more information about these applications). Regarding the present study, the main motive behind investigating the problem of non-adaptive group testing on graphs is the application of this problem in chemical reactions. In chemical reactions, we are dealing with a set of chemicals, some pairs of which may involve a reaction. Moreover, before testing, we know some pairs have no reaction. When some chemicals are combined in one test, a reaction takes place if and only if at least one pair of the chemicals reacts in the test. The present study aimed to identify which pairs are reacted using as few tests as possible. Therefore, we can reformulate this problem as follows. Suppose that there are n vertices and two vertices u and v are adjacent if and only if two chemicals u and v may involve a reaction. The reaction of each pair of the chemicals indicates a defective edge and finding all there types of pairs is equal to find the defective subgraph. As we know some pairs have no reaction, the graph G is not necessarily a complete graph."

We denote the maximum degree of H by ∆ = ∆(H). Also, G[X] denotes the subgraph of G induced by X ∩V (G) and for any vertex v ∈ G, NH(v) stands for the set of neighbours of the vertex v in the graph H. Hereafter, we assume that the subgraph H has no isolated vertex, because in the problem of group testing on graphs, just edges are defective."

      "text" : "For 1 ≤ l ≤ t, let Fl be a random test obtained by choosing each vertex of V (G) independently with probability p. For simplicity of notation we write Fi as an induced subgraph of G on vertices of Fi.\nThroughout this paper, let H1,H2, . . . ,Hm be all the subgraphs of G isomorphic to H. Let C be a random t×m matrix such that for any l and j, where 1 ≤ j ≤ m and 1 ≤ l ≤ t, if E(Fl ∩ Hj) 6= ∅, then Clj = 1; otherwise, Clj = 0. The lth row of this matrix corresponds to the test Fl and the jth column corresponds to the subgraph Hj. For any i, j, l, where 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ m and 1 ≤ l ≤ t, define the event Ali,j to be the set of all matrices C such that Cli = Clj. Also, define the event Ai,j to be the set of all matrices C such that for every l, 1 ≤ l ≤ t, we have Cli = Clj. In other words, if the event Ali,j occurs, then the test Fl cannot distinguish between Hi and Hj. Also, if the event Ai,j occurs, then for every l such that 1 ≤ l ≤ t, the test Fl cannot distinguish between Hi and Hj. So if in the matrix C each pair of columns is different, then none of the bad events Ai,j occur and we can find the defective subgraph. So we would like to bound the probability that none of the bad events Ai,j occur. In such cases, when there is some relatively small amount of dependence between events, one can use a powerful generalization of the union bound, known as the Lovász Local Lemma. The main device in establishing the Lovász Local Lemma\nis a graph called the dependency graph. Let A1, A2, . . . , An be events in an arbitrary probability space. A graph D = (V,E) on the set of vertices V = {1, 2, . . . , n} is a dependency graph for events A1, A2, . . . , An if for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n the event Ai is mutually independent of all the events {Aj : {i, j} /∈ E}. We state the Lovász Local Lemma as follows.\nLemma A. [4] (Lovász Local Lemma, Symmetric Case). Suppose that A1, A2, . . . , An are events in a probability space with Pr(Ai) ≤ p for all i. If the maximum degree in the dependency graph of these events is d, and if ep(d+ 1) ≤ 1, then\nPr (\nn ⋂\ni=1\nAi\n)\n> 0,\nwhere e is the basis of the natural logarithm.\nTo find the maximum degree in the dependency graph of the events Ai,j, we define the parameter rG(H) as follows. Set rG(H,Hi) is the number of subgraphs of G isomorphic to H have common vertex with Hi, i.e., rG(H,Hi) = |{Hj : 1 ≤ j ≤ m, j 6= i, V (Hi) ∩ V (Hj) 6= ∅}|. Also, define\nrG(H) = max 1≤i≤m rG(H,Hi).\nIn Theorem 1, we show that in the aforementioned random matrix each pair of columns is different with positive probability. More precisely, in this theorem, we prove there is a t×m matrix C such that for every i and j, there is a number l such that 1 ≤ l ≤ t and Cli 6= Clj . It happens if E(Fl ∩ Hi) = ∅, E(Fl ∩ Hj) 6= ∅ or E(Fl ∩Hi) 6= ∅, E(Fl ∩Hi) = ∅. So if Hi is the defective subgraph, then for every non-defective subgraph Hj, there exists a test Fl such that E(Fl∩Hi) 6= E(Fl∩Hj). So all the tests F1, . . . , Ft can distinguish between the defective subgraph Hi and every non-defective subgraphHj. Therefore, by this matrix we can find the defective subgraph.\nTheorem 1. Let H be the defective subgraph of G and H1,H2, . . . ,Hm be all the subgraphs of G isomorphic to H. There are t induced subgraph F1, . . . , Ft of G such that for each pair of Hi and Hj, at least one of F1, . . . , Ft can distinguish between Hi and Hj, where k = |E(H)|, ∆ = ∆(H),\nt = 1 +\n⌈\nln(4erG(H)) + lnm\nln 11−Pk,∆\n⌉\n,\nPk,∆ = 1\n2k∆\n( 1− 12∆ )2∆−1\n( 1− √\n1 2k∆\n( 1− 12∆ )∆−1\n)2∆−2\n, and e is the basis of the\nnatural logarithm.\nIn order to prove Theorem 1, first we should find the probability that tests F1, F2, . . . , Ft, distinguish between each pair of subgraphs Hi and Hj. Thus, finding the upper bound for the probability of occurring the bad event Ai,j is essential.\nAccordingly, we should find the lower bound of probability that the random test Fl can distinguish between two subgraphs Hi and Hj.\nIn the next theorem, based on some following lemmas, we show that the probability of distinguishing between Hi and Hj has the minimum value whenever V (Hi) = V (Hj) and |E(Hi) \\ E(Hj)| = 1.\nTheorem 2. Let k = |E(H)| and ∆ = ∆(H). For every 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ m and 1 ≤ l ≤ t, we have\nPr (\nAli,j\n)\n≥ 2p2(1− p)2∆(1− ǫ), (1)\nwhere p = √ ǫ k (1− ǫ)∆−1 .\nLemma 1. Let T be a graph with n vertices, k edges, and maximum degree ∆. Pick, randomly and independently, each vertex of T with probability p, where p = √\nǫ k (1− ǫ k )(∆−1). If F is the set of all chosen vertices, then T [F ] has no edges, with\nprobability at least 1− ǫ.\nTo prove this lemma, we need high probability variation of Lovász Local Lemma.\nLemma B. [9] Let B1, B2, . . . , Bk be events in a probability space. Suppose that each event Bi is independent of all the events Bj but at most d. For 1 ≤ i ≤ k and\n0 < ǫ < 1, if Pr(Bi) ≤ ǫ k (1− ǫ k )d, then Pr\n( k ⋂\ni=1\nBi\n)\n> 1− ǫ.\nProof of Lemma 1. Let E(T ) = {e1, e2, . . . , ek}. For 1 ≤ i ≤ k, we define Bi to be the event that ei ∈ E(T [F ]), so Pr(Bi) = p\n2. Since vertices are chosen randomly and independently, the event Bi is independent of the event Bj if and only if edges ei and ej have no common vertex. So the maximum degree of the dependency graph\nis at most 2(∆− 1). Since p2 ≤ ǫ k\n(\n1− ǫ k\n)2(∆−1) , by Lemma B, Pr\n( k ⋂\ni=1\nBi\n)\n> 1− ǫ.\nHence, T [F ] has no edges, with probability at least 1− ǫ.\nTo find the probability of distinguishing between Hi and Hj and then prove Theorem 2, we consider following three cases,\ncase 1: V (Hi) = V (Hj), |E(Hi) \\ E(Hj)| = 1.\ncase 2: |V (Hi) \\ V (Hj)| ≥ 1.\ncase 3: The induced subgraph on V (Hi)− V (Hj) has at least one edge.\nLemma 2. If V (Hi) = V (Hj) and |E(Hi) \\E(Hj)| = 1, then\nPr ( E(Fl ∩Hi) 6= ∅, E(Fl ∩Hj) = ∅ ) ≥ p2(1− p)2∆(1− ǫ),\nwhere p = √ ǫ k (1− ǫ)∆−1.\nProof. Let e = {u, v} ∈ E(Hi) \\ E(Hj). Consider the induced subgraph H ′ of G, where V (H ′) = V (Hj) \\ ( u ∪ v ∪NHj (u) ∪NHj(v) ) . Note that if u, v ∈ Fl and Hj ∩ Fl has no edges of Hj, then E(Fl ∩Hi) 6= ∅ and E(Fl ∩Hj) = ∅. Also, one can see that u, v ∈ Fl and Hj[Fl] has no edges if the following events hold\n1. u, v ∈ Fl,\n2. NHj (u) ∩ Fl = ∅ and NHj (v) ∩ Fl = ∅,\n3. H ′[Fl] has no edges.\nIt is straightforward to check that the aforementioned events are independent. Also, one can see that the event u, v ∈ Fl occurs with probability p\n2. Since |NHj (u) ∪ NHj (v)| ≤ 2∆,\nPr ( NHj (u) ∩ Fl = ∅, NHj (v) ∩ Fl = ∅ ) =\nPr ( Fl ∩ ( NHj(u) ∪NHj (v) \\ {u, v} ) = ∅ ) ≥ (1− p)2∆.\nSet E(H ′) = k′. If k′ = 0, then Fl∩H ′ has no edges. So Pr\n(\nE(Fl∩H ′) = ∅\n)\n= 1. Suppose that k′ ≥ 1. Since k ≥ k′, we have p2 = ǫ\nk (1−ǫ)2∆−2 ≤ ǫ k′ (1− ǫ k′ )2∆−2. Each\nvertex of the induced subgraph H ′ is chosen with probability p. So by Lemma 1, the induced subgraph on Fl ∩ V (H\n′) has no edges, with probability at least 1 − ǫ. In other words, Pr ( E(Fl ∩H ′) = ∅ )\n≥ 1− ǫ. Since the events are independent, we have\nPr ( E(Fl ∩Hi) 6= ∅, E(Fl ∩Hj) = ∅ ) ≥ p2(1− p)2∆(1− ǫ),\nas desired.\nLemma 3. If |V (Hi) \\ V (Hj)| ≥ 1, then\nPr ( E(Fl ∩Hi) 6= ∅, E(Fl ∩Hj) = ∅ ) ≥ p2(1− p)∆(1− ǫ),\nwhere p = √ ǫ k (1− ǫ)∆−1.\nProof. Since H has no isolated vertex, there exists at least one edge e = {u, v} ∈ E(Hi) \\E(Hj). Let v ∈ V (Hi)∩V (Hj) and u ∈ V (Hi) \\V (Hj). Suppose that H\n′ is an induced subgraph of Hj, where V (H ′) = V (Hj) \\ (v ∪N(v)). Set |E(H ′)| = k′. Similar to the proof of Lemma 2, E(Fl∩Hi) 6= ∅ and E(Fl∩Hj) = ∅ if the following independent events hold\n1. u, v ∈ Fl,\n2. NHj (v) ∩ Fl = ∅,\n3. H ′[Fl] has no edges.\nSince |NHj (v)| ≤ ∆, the probability that NHj (v) ∩ Fl = ∅ is at least (1 − p) ∆.\nThe rest of proof is similar to Lemma 2, so\nPr ( E(Fl ∩Hi) 6= ∅, E(Fl ∩Hj) = ∅ ) ≥ p2(1− p)∆(1− ǫ),\nas desired.\nLemma 4. If the induced subgraph on V (Hi) \\ V (Hj) has at least one edge, then\nPr ( E(Fl ∩Hi) 6= ∅, E(Fl ∩Hj) = ∅ ) ≥ p2(1− ǫ),\nwhere p = √ ǫ k (1− ǫ)∆−1.\nProof. Let e = (u, v) ∈ E(Hi) \\ E(Hj). If the following independent events hold\n1. u, v ∈ Fl,\n2. Hj[Fl] has no edges,\nthen E(Fl∩Hi) 6= ∅ and E(Fl∩Hj) = ∅. Since p 2 = ǫ k (1− ǫ)2∆−2 ≤ ǫ k\n(\n1− ǫ k\n)2∆−2 ,\nby Lemma 1, Pr (E(Fl ∩Hj) = ∅) ≥ 1− ǫ. Also one can see that\nPr ( E(Fl ∩Hi) 6= ∅ ) ≥ Pr ( e ∈ E(Fl) ) = Pr(u, v ∈ Fl) = p 2.\nConsequently, Pr ( E(Fl ∩Hi) 6= ∅, E(Fl ∩Hj) = ∅ ) ≥ p2(1− ǫ).\nProof of Theorem 2. Let E(Hi)∩E(Hj) = {f1, f2, . . . , fr} and E(Hi) \\E(Hj) = {e1, e2, . . . , ek−r}. As previously(at the first of this paper ) mentioned, the event A l i,j occurs if and only if E(Fl∩Hi) 6= ∅, E(Fl∩Hj) = ∅ or E(Fl∩Hj) 6= ∅, E(Fl∩Hi) = ∅. It is easy to check that\nPr (\nAli,j\n) = Pr ( E(Fl∩Hi) 6= ∅, E(Fl∩Hj) = ∅ ) +Pr ( E(Fl∩Hj) 6= ∅, E(Fl∩Hi) = ∅ ) .\nIn the following we prove Pr(E(Fl ∩Hi) 6= ∅, E(Fl ∩Hj) = ∅) ≥ p 2(1− p)2∆(1− ǫ) and with the completely similar proof we can prove Pr(E(Fl∩Hj) 6= ∅, E(Fl∩Hi) = ∅) ≥ p2(1− p)2∆(1− ǫ).\nIt is easy to check, for every 1 ≤ q ≤ k − r,\nPr ( E(Fl ∩Hi) 6= ∅, E(Fl ∩Hj) = ∅ ) ≥ Pr ( eq ∈ E(Fl ∩Hi), E(Fl ∩Hj) = ∅ ) .\nSo to find the lower bound for this probability, we need to consider the following three cases,\ncase 1: V (Hi) = V (Hj), |E(Hi) \\ E(Hj)| = 1.\nBy Lemma 2, it is clear\nPr ( E(Fl ∩Hi) 6= ∅, E(Fl ∩Hj) = ∅ ) ≥ p2(1− p)2∆(1− ǫ).\ncase 2: |V (Hi) \\ V (Hj)| ≥ 1.\nBy Lemma 3, we have\nPr ( E(Fl ∩Hi) 6= ∅, E(Fl ∩Hj) = ∅ ) ≥ p2(1−p)∆(1− ǫ) ≥ p2(1−p)2∆(1− ǫ).\ncase 3: The induced subgraph on V (Hi)− V (Hj) has at least one edge.\nBy Lemma 4,\nPr ( E(Fl ∩Hi) 6= ∅, E(Fl ∩Hj) = ∅ ) ≥ p2(1− ǫ) ≥ p2(1− p)2∆(1− ǫ).\nSo for every 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ m and 1 ≤ l ≤ t, Pr (\nAli,j\n)\n≥ 2p2(1− p)2∆(1− ǫ).\nIn order to prove Theorem 1, we present an upper bound for the probability of occurring the bad events Ai,j for every 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ m.\nTheorem 3. Let k = |E(H)| and ∆ = ∆(H). For every 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ m, we have\nPr(Ai,j) ≤ (1− Pk,∆) t, (2)\nwhere Pk,∆ = 1\n2k∆\n( 1− 12∆ )2∆−1\n( 1− √\n1 2k∆\n( 1− 12∆ )∆−1\n)2∆−2\n.\nProof. Since F1,F2, . . . ,Ft ⊂ V (G) are chosen randomly and independently, the events A1i,j, . . . , A t i,j are mutually independent. So\nPr(Ai,j) = Pr(A l i,j) t.\nBy the definition of Ali,j and Theorem 2, we have Pr ( Ali,j ) ≥ 2p2(1− p)2∆(1 − ǫ). Acoording to p = √\nǫ k (1− ǫ)∆−1, we set ǫ = 3∆ to almostly maximazie the lower\nbound of good events Ali,j. So Pr ( Ali,j ) ≥ Pk,∆, where\nPk,∆ = 6\nk∆\n(\n1− 3\n∆\n)2∆−1 (\n1−\n√\n3\nk∆\n(\n1− 3\n∆\n)∆−1 )2∆\n.\nTherefore, Pr(Ai,j) = Pr(A l i,j) t ≤ (1− Pk,∆) t.\nNow, we can prove Theorem 1. Proof of Theorem 1. By Theorem 3, for every 1 ≤ i 6= j ≤ m, Pr(Ai,j) ≤ (1−Pk,∆) t. Now we prove that if t > ln(4erG(H))+lnm\nln 1 1−Pk,∆\n, then by Lovász Local Lemma,\nwith positive probability no event Ai,j occurs. We construct the dependency graph whose vertices are the events Ai,j , where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m. Two events Ai,j and Ai′,j′ are adjacent if and only if ( V (Hi)∪V (Hj) )\n∩ (\nV (Hi′)∪V (Hj′) )\n6= ∅. Remember that rG(H) = max i rG(H,Hi), where rG(H,Hi)\nis the number of subgraphs of G isomorphic to H including common vertex with Hi. For the fixed Ai,j , there are at most rG(H) subgraph Hi′ isomorphic to H such that V (Hi) ∩ V (Hi′) 6= ∅. We can choose Hj′ with m − 1 ways. So it is easy to check that the maximum degree in the dependency graph is at most 4rG(H)(m−1). Accordingly, if\nt > ln(4erG(H)) + lnm\nln 11−Pk,∆ ,\nthen e (1− Pk,∆) t ( 4rG(H)(m− 1) + 1 ) < 1, and by Lovász Local Lemma\nPr ( ⋂\ni,j\nAi,j\n)\n> 0.\nTherefore, if t = 1 + ⌈ ln(4erG(H))+lnm ln 1\n1−Pk,∆\n⌉, then with positive probability no event Ai,j\noccurs. Thus, there is t tests F1,F2, . . . ,Ft that can distinguish between each pair of Hi and Hj.\nWe can obtain t = 1 + ⌈ 2 lnm ln 1\n1−Pk,∆\n⌉ if we use union bound. In fact the Lovász\nLocal Lemma is better when the dependencies between events are rare. Based on this theorem there are t tests which distinguish between each pair of Hi and Hj with positive probability. However, an algorithm is essential to find these tests with high probability if we are interested in finding these tests.\nTheorem 4. Let H be the defective subgraph of G with k edges. If t = ln m\n2\nδ\nln 1 1−Pk,∆\n,\nwe can find this defective subgraph by t tests with probability at least 1 − δ, where\n∆ = ∆(H) and Pk,∆ = 1\n2k∆\n( 1− 12∆ )2∆−1\n( 1− √\n1 2k∆\n( 1− 12∆ )∆−1\n)2∆−2\n.\nProof. For events Ai,j where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ m, by Theorem 3 and union bound we know Pr ( ⋃ Ai,j ) ≤ m2(1 − Pk,∆) t. Thus, this upper bound becomes close to zero if t is large enough. It is easy to check if t = ln m 2 δ\nln 1 1−Pk,∆\n, then m2(1 − Pk,∆) t = δ. In\nother words, we can distinguish between each pair of Hi and Hj with probability at least 1− δ if we choose tests randomly and independently.\nFor simplicity suppose m, the number of subgraph isomorphic to H, is more than n. Suppose for big m, δ = 1\nm . Therefore, we can find the defective subgraph\nwith 3 lnm ln 1\n1−Pk,∆\ntests with high probability."

The present study aimed to present a generalization of this problem. Graphs G and H were considered, by assuming that G includes exactly one defective subgraph isomorphic to H . The purpose is to find the defective subgraph by performing the minimum non-adaptive tests, where each test is an induced subgraph of the graph G and the test is positive in the case of involving at least one edge of the defective subgraph H . We present an upper bound for the number of non-adaptive tests to find the defective subgraph by using the symmetric and high probability variation of Lovász Local Lemma. Finally, we present a nonadaptive randomized algorithm to find defective subgraph by at most 3 2 times of this upper bound with high probability.",
