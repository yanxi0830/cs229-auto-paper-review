      "text" : "Semi-supervised learning is a special type of learning which uses labelled as well as unlabelled data for training [7]. In reality, the amount of labelled data is much less compared to the unlabelled data. This makes this type of learning a powerful tool for processing the huge amount of data available nowadays. The present work focuses on graph based semi-supervised learning [7, 9, 10, 18]. Consider a (weighted) graph in which nodes belong to one of K classes and the true class of a few nodes is given. An edge and its weight of the graph indicate a similarity and similarity degree, respectively, between two nodes. Thus, such graph is called the similarity graph. We assume that the (weighted) similarity graph is known. Semi-supervised learning aims at using the true class information of few labelled nodes and the structure of the graph to estimate the class of each of the remaining nodes.\nGraph based semi-supervised learning finds application in recommendation systems [9], classification of web pages into categories [16], person name disambiguation [14], etc. Being of practical importance, graph based semi-supervised learning has been widely studied. Most methods formulate the learning as an optimization problem for feature vectors and then solve it iteratively or by deriving closed form solutions. The problem assumes smoothness of node features across the graph and penalizes the deviation of a feature from the true class of a node in case the true class is known. Iterative solutions become computationally intensive because they involve matrix operations which grow in size as a polynomial with the graph size, though the growth can be linear or quasi-linear in the case of sparse graphs. In [2] the authors have formulated a generalized optimization problem which gives as important particular cases: Standard Laplacian [17], Normalised Laplacian [15] and PageRank [1] algorithms.\nIn the present work, starting from the generalized formulation of [2], we propose two approaches for the computation of the feature vectors. The first approach is based on iteration of an affine map. A key element of the affine map iteration is sparse matrix-vector multiplication, which has several very efficient parallel implementations.\nThe second approach belongs to the class of Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms. The concept of sampling as in reinforcement learning is useful because it provides room for developing distributed computing schemes which reduce cost of per iterate computation, a crucial advantage in large problems. The realm of reinforcement learning is similar to semi-supervised learning in that the labelled data is suggestive but not exact. Borkar et al. [5] have developed a sampling based reinforcement learning scheme for the PageRank algorithm. At each step of the iteration, a node is sampled uniformly from all the nodes. A neighbour of the sampled node is chosen according to the conditional probability of the neighbour given the sampled node. The stationary probability of the sampled node is then updated using a stochastic approximation of the ODE involving stationary distribution and the PageRank matrix. This approach can be implemented in a distributed setting and hence the requirement of the entire adjacency matrix being known locally can also be relaxed, since information regarding only a neighbourhood is required.\nThe rest of the article is organised as follows: Section 2 gives the algorithms, Section 3 proves their convergence, Section 4 details the experimental results and Section 5 concludes with some observations."

The aim of the semi-supervised learning problem is to find F.k such that it is close to the labelling function and it varies smoothly over the graph. The class of node i is calculated from F using the following relation. Node i belongs to class k if\nFik > Fij ∀ j 6= k.\nThe optimization problem associated with the above stated requirements can be written as: Minimize\nQ(F ) = 2 K∑ k=1 FT.kD σ−1LDσF.k + µ K∑ k=1 (F.k − Y.k)TD2σ−1(F.k − Y.k),\nwhere L = D − A is the Standard Laplacian of the similarity graph.

The first order optimality condition gives the following solution to this problem:\nF.k = (1− α)(I − αB)−1Y.k,\nwhere B = D−σADσ−1 and α = 22+µ for µ > 0 [2]. Rearranging the terms of the closed form solution gives the power iteration based algorithm:\nAlgorithm 1: F t+1 = αBF t + (1− α)Y,\nwhere F t is the estimate of F after t ≥ 0 iterations. In each iteration, the feature values for all the nodes are updated for all the classes. This algorithm is henceforth referred to as the power iteration algorithm. Note that the (sparse) matrix-vector multiplication BF t is the bottleneck of Algorithm 1. There is a number of very efficient parallel implementations of the matrix-vector multiplications.

Iteration (2) is a stochastic approximation algorithm that can be analyzed using the ‘ODE’ (for Ordinary Differential Equation’) approach which treats the discrete time algorithm as a noisy discretization (or ‘Euler scheme’) of a limiting ODE with slowly decreasing step-size, decremented at just the right rate so that the errors due to discretization and noise are asymptotically negligible and the correct asymptotic behavior of the ODE is replicated [6]. See p. 74-75, Chapter 6 of ibid. for a precise statement. In particular, if the ODE has a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium, the algorithm converges to it with probability one under mild conditions stated in ibid. which are easily verified in the present case. Let π = [π(1), .., , π(d)]T\ndenote the stationary distribution under Q̃. Let Γ = diag(π(1), ..., π(d)).

Hence Algorithm 2 converges to the correct value of the feature matrix F . Note the key role of the factor α in ensuring the contraction property.\nIf we consider round robin sampling, the results of [6], Section 4.2 on sample complexity become applicable here. In particular, we conclude that at time n, the probability of remaining within a prescribed small neighborhood of x∗ after n+ τ iterates (where τ can be prescribed in\nterms of problem parameters) remains greater than 1−O ( e C∑ t≥n η 2 t ) .

Class information of the nodes named above is available to the algorithms. We use the decreasing step size 12+bt/100c .\nAlgorithms 1 and 2 provide µ and σ as two parameters that can be varied. For different values of these parameters, Algorithm 1 was run for 500 iterations and then the class of each node was found. This was done 3 times for each value of µ and σ and then the average error across the 3 classifications was calculated. The average error is shown in Figure1 (a). Figure1(b) shows the same information for the values of σ corresponding to the Standard Laplacian (σ = 1), Normalised Laplacian (σ = 0.5) and PageRank (σ = 0).\nFor further experiments, we will be considering the value σ = 0.5 and µ = 1. According to Figure1 this is a good choice of the parameters. This choice of the parameters can also be backed up by the results from [3] and [15]. Note that σ = 0.5 corresponds to the Normalised Laplacian algorithm. The difference in performance for σ’s can be understood by taking the analogy of a random walk on the graph starting from the labelled node of the cluster [3]. In general, if there is a node that is connected to the labelled node of two clusters, one of which is denser with the labelled node having degree higher than the other labelled node and the other cluster is less dense or smaller, then the PageRank algorithm tends to classify it into the smaller cluster while the Standard Laplacian classifies it into the denser cluster.\nThe convergence of classification function for the two algorithms can be seen in Figure2, Figure3, Figure4. It can also be seen that the classification function for the sampling algorithm converges to the same values as the classification function for the power iteration algorithm.\nLes Miserables graph has interesting nodes like Woman2, Tholomyes and Mlle Baptistine among others which are connected to multiple labelled nodes. Since the class density and the class sizes for different nodes is different, these nodes get classified into different classes for different values of σ. The node Woman2 is connected to the labelled nodes Cosette, Valjean and Javert(which belongs to class Thenardier). As seen in the Figure3, the classification function values for these nodes/classes is higher compared to the other 3 classes.

Division by average degree makes the two methods comparable in computational cost. As can be seen, the two methods are comparable in terms of accuracy as well as the computational cost for attaining a given accuracy.\nIt is interesting to observe that if one would like to obtain quickly a very rough classification, the sampling algorithm might be preferable.

Two nodes with the highest degree from each class were chosen as the labelled nodes while the remaining nodes were unlabelled. It is known that choosing high degree nodes as labelled nodes is beneficial [3]. A Gaussian mixture graph with 500 nodes was created with the above parameters. Figure7(a) shows the graph with the nodes coloured according to their class - nodes of class 1 are shown in pink, class 2 in green and Class 3 in red. Figure7(b) shows the classes that the nodes were classified into using the sampling based algorithm. Nodes classified into Class 1 are shown in pink, Class 2 in green and Class 3 in red. Shown in yellow are the nodes that were wrongly classified. The nodes that are misclassified lie either on the boundary of two classes or are surrounded completely by nodes of the neighbouring class as seen in Figure7(b).

Gaussian mixture graphs with 10000 nodes were generated and the distributed sampling scheme was applied to them. The error decreases as the number of iterations increase, till it converges to a constant value.

The node is classified to its correct class by this technique as well. The idea behind its working is that an unlabelled incoming node will not change the classification function of the other nodes very much. In fact, it will hardly change the values for nodes that are multiple hops away. So selecting nodes as described in this experiment is sufficient to get a good estimate of the classification function. Indeed, this technique is much faster than the MCMC technique because we do not select nodes from the entire graph, but only from 1-hop neighbors."

      "text" : "We now consider a dynamic graph in which nodes can enter and leave the graph. It has been demonstrated that the sampling algorithm can classify new incoming nodes. A dynamic Stochastic Block Model with multiple classes is taken. Stochastic block models [8, 12] have been found to be closer to reality than classical models such as preferential attachment, in applications such as social networks and there is a growing interest in them. Intuitively, they have relatively denser subnetworks which are interconnected to each other through weak ties. A node is connected with another node of the same class with probability pin and node from a different class with probability pout; pin >> pout. In the present work we introduce an extension of the Stochastic Block Model to the dynamic setting. Specifically, there is a Poisson arrival of nodes into the graph with rate λarr. The class of the arriving node is chosen according to a pre-specified probability distribution. Each node stays in the graph for a random time that is exponentially distributed with mean µdep after which it leaves. The maximum number of nodes in the graph is limited to K, i.e., nodes arriving when the number of nodes in the graph is K do not become a part of the graph. This system can be modelled as a M/M/K/K queue. As a result, irrespective of the number of nodes that the graph has initially, the average the number of nodes in the graph will reach a steady state value given by λarrµdep .\nSimulations were performed for various values of λarr and µdep with different number of nodes\nRR n° 8767"

Misclassified nodes are shown in yellow.\nFigure 7: Gaussian Mixture Graphs\nduring initialisation. The graph had 3 classes and an incoming node could belong to either of the classes with equal probability. K = 1000, λarr = 1/(2× 104) and µdep = 1/107 was chosen. Therefore, λarrµdep = 500. Two nodes with the maximum degree from each class were chosen as the labelled nodes during initialization. K steps were considered as one iteration. Figure13, Figure14 and Figure15 show the evolution of %error and the size of the graph for initial graph size of 500, 600 and 400 respectively. The step size for these simulations was kept constant at 1/1000 so that the algorithm does not lose its tracking ability. This is common practice in tracking applications. Since a constant stepsize ηt ≡ η > 0 does not satisfy the condition ∑ t η 2 t <∞, one cannot claim convergence with probability one even in the stationary environment. Instead, one has the weaker claim that the asymptotic probability of the iterates not being in a small neighborhood of the desired limit is small, i.e., O(η) ([6], Chapter 9). The problem with using decreasing stepsize in time-varying environment can be explained as follows. With the interpretation of stochastic approximation as a noisy discretization of the ODE, one views the step-size as a time step, whence it dictates the time scale on which the algorithm moves. A decreasing step-size schedule begins with high step-sizes and slowly decreases it to zero, thus beginning with a fast time scale for rapid exploration at the expense of larger errors, ending with slower and slower time scales that exploit the problem structure ensuring more better error suppression and graceful convergence. For tracking applications, the environment is non-stationary, thus the decreasing step-size scheme loses its tracking ability once the algorithmic time scale becomes slower than that of the environment. A judiciously chosen constant step-size avoids this problem at the expense of some accuracy. In our algorithms, the Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue λ of the matrix αB is the key factor dictating the convergence rate, hence the tracking scheme will work well if λarr, µdep << λ.\nThe number of misclassified nodes is higher in the stochastic block model (3-7%) than in the Gaussian mixture model. Most of these errors are because node of one class is connected to the labelled node of some other class. Error in some other nodes is because the classification function value is very close for 2 out of the 3 classes. It was also observed that on increasing cluster density, the average error decreases in steady state since some nodes which got wrongly classified by being close to an influential node in some other cluster now will have more neighbors\nInria"

Similarly, Figure17 shows the effect of decreasing the departure rate to µdep = 1/108 while keeping λarr = 1/(2 × 104). For both these cases, the number of nodes in steady state should be 5000. It can be seen that the decrease in error is much more smoother in this case as compared to Figure13(b),Figure14(b) and Figure15(b) which is indicative of the slowly varying size of the graph.\nDuring the experiment, the number of labelled nodes from each cluster were kept constant. In case a labelled node left, then a neighbour of the leaving node belonging to the same cluster was randomly chosen as the labelled node. If this wasn’t done, the misclassification error became as high as 70% in some cases. This can be reasoned as being due to the absence of labelled nodes resulting in increase in cluster size of other clusters. A similar effect was observed if the number of labelled nodes in one cluster was much more compared to the others.\nTo better understand how the departure of a labelled node effects the error, we performed tests with graphs in which the labelled nodes were permanent, i.e., the labelled nodes did not leave. Figure18 shows the variation of error for this case. It can be seen that in this case, the variance in error after reaching steady state is much less as compared to Figure13(a), Figure14(a) and Figure15(a)."

The ability to track the feature vector of a new node that arrives during the simulation was tested. The sampling algorithm correctly classifies the new incoming node in considerably fewer iterations. This ability was then applied to a dynamic stochastic block model graph modelled based on M/M/K/K queue. It was demonstrated that the sampling algorithm can be applied to dynamically changing systems and still achieve a small error. The sampling algorithm can be implemented in a distributed manner unlike the power iteration algorithm and has very little per iterate computation, hence it should be the preferred methodology for very large graphs."

    "abstractText" : "Two approaches for graph based semi-supervised learning are proposed. The first approach is based on iteration of an affine map. A key element of the affine map iteration is sparse matrix-vector multiplication, which has several very efficient parallel implementations. The second approach belongs to the class of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. It is based on sampling of nodes by performing a random walk on the graph. The latter approach is distributed by its nature and can be easily implemented on several processors or over the network. Both theoretical and practical evaluations are provided. It is found that the nodes are classified into their class with very small error. The sampling algorithm’s ability to track new incoming nodes and to classify them is also demonstrated.

Les Approches Parallèles et Distribués pour l’Apprentissage Semi-supervisé Résumé : Deux approches pour l’apprentissage semi-supervisé basé sur le graphe de similarité sont proposés. La première approche est basée sur l’itération d’un opérateur affine. Un élément clé de l’itération de l’opérateur affine est la multiplication vecteur par matrice de type sparse, qui a plusieurs implémentations parallèles très efficaces. La seconde approche appartient à la classe des algorithmes de Monte-Carlo par chaînes de Markov (MCMC). Elle est basé sur un échantillonnage de noeuds en effectuant une marche aléatoire sur le graphe de similarité. Cette dernière approche est distribué par sa nature et peut être facilement mis en oeuvre sur plusieurs processeurs ou sur un réseau. Évaluations théoriques ainsi que pratiques sont fournis. On constate que les noeuds sont classés dans leurs classes avec très petite erreur. La capacité de l’algorithme MCMC de suivre les nouveaux noeuds arrivants online et de les classer est également démontré.
