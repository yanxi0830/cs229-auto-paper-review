      "text" : "G RAPHICAL models are a standard tool in image pro-cessing, computer vision, and many other fields. Exact inference and inference are often intractable, due to the high treewidth of the graph. Much previous work involves approximations of the likelihood. (Section 4). In this paper, we suggest that parameter learning can instead be done using “marginalization-based” loss functions. These directly quantify the quality of the predictions of a given marginal inference algorithm. This has two major advantages. First, approximation errors in the inference algorithm are taken into account while learning. Second, this is robust to model mis-specification. The contributions of this paper are, first, the general framework of marginalization-based fitting as implicit differentiation. Second, we show that the parameter gradient can be computed by “perturbation”– that is, by re-running the approximate algorithm twice with the parameters perturbed slightly based on the current loss. Third, we introduce the strategy of “truncated fitting”. Inference algorithms are based on optimization, where one iterates updates until some convergence threshold is reached. In truncated fitting, algorithms are derived to fit the marginals produced after a fixed number of updates, with no assumption of convergence. We show that this leads to significant speedups. We also derive a variant of this that can apply to likelihood based learning. Finally, experimental results confirm that marginalization based learning gives better results on difficult problems where inference approximations and model mis-specification are most significant."

(1)\nThis is defined with reference to a graph, with one node for each random variable. The first product in Eq. 1 is over the set of cliques c in the graph, while the second is over all individual variables. For example, the graph\nx1 x2\nx3 x4\nx5 x6\ncorresponds to the distribution\np(x) = 1\nZ ψ(x1, x2)ψ(x2, x3, x5)ψ(x3, x4)ψ(x5, x6) × ψ(x1)ψ(x2)ψ(x3)ψ(x4)ψ(x5)ψ(x6).\nEach function ψ(xc) or ψ(xi) is positive, but otherwise arbitrary. The factor Z ensures normalization. The motivation for these types of models is the Hammersley–Clifford theorem [1], which gives specific conditions under which a distribution can be written as in Eq. 1. Those conditions are that, first, each random variable is conditionally independent of all others, given its immediate neighbors and, secondly, that each configuration x has nonzero probability. Often, domain knowledge about conditional independence can be used to build a reasonable graph, and the factorized representation in an MRF reduces the curse of dimensionality encountered in modeling a high-dimensional distribution."

      "text" : "Suppose we have some distribution p(x|y), we are given some input y, and we need to guess a single output vector x∗. What is the best guess? The answer clearly depends on the meaning of “best”. One framework for answering this question is the idea of a Bayes estimator [3]. One must specify some utility function U(x,x′), quantifying how “happy” one is to have guessed x if the true output is x′. One then chooses x∗ to maximize the expected utility\nx∗ = argmax x\n∑\nx′\np(x′|y)U(x,x′).\nOne natural utility function is an indicator function, giving one for the exact value x′, and zero otherwise. It is easy to show that for this utility, the optimal estimate is the popular Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) estimate.\nTheorem. If U(x,x′) = I[x = x′], then\nx∗ = argmax x p(x|y).\nLittle can be said in general about if this utility function truly reflects user priorities. However, in highdimensional applications, there are reasons for skepticism. First, the actual maximizing probability p(x∗|y) in a MAP estimate might be extremely small, so much so that astronomical numbers of examples might be necessary before one could expect to exactly predict the true output. Second, this utility does not distinguish between a prediction that contains only a single error at some component xj , and one that is entirely wrong. An alternative utility function, popular for imaging problems, quantifies the Hamming distance, or the number of components of the output vector that are correct. Maximizing this results in selecting the most likely value for each component independently.\nTheorem. If U(x,x′) = ∑ i I[xi = x ′ i], then\nx∗i = argmax xi p(xi|y). (2)\nThis appears to have been originally called Maximum Posterior Marginal (MPM) inference [4], though it has been reinvented under other names [5]. From a computational perspective, the main difficulty is not performing the trivial maximization in Eq. 2, but rather computing the marginals p(xi|y). The marginal-based loss functions introduced in Section 4.2 can be motivated by the idea that at test time, one will use an inference method similar to MPM where one in concerned only with the accuracy of the marginals. The results of MAP and MPM inference will be similar if the distribution p(x|y) is heavily “peaked” at a single configuration x. Roughly, the greater the entropy of p(x|y), the more there is to be gained in integrating\nover all possible configurations, as MPM does. A few papers have experimentally compared MAP and MPM inference [6], [7]."

(3)\nensures normalization. Different sufficient statistics f(x) define different distributions. The exponential family is well understood in statistics. Accordingly, it is useful to note that a Markov random field (Eq. 1) is a member of the exponential family, with sufficient statistics consisting of indicator functions for each possible configuration of each clique and each variable [8], namely,\nf(X) = {I[Xc = xc]|∀c,xc} ∪ {I[Xi = xi]|∀i, xi}.\nIt is useful to introduce the notation θ(xc) to refer to the component of θ corresponding to the indicator function I[Xc = xc], and similarly for θ(xi). Then, the MRF in Eq. 1 would have ψ(xc) = eθ(xc) and ψ(xi) = e\nθ(xi). Many operations on graphical models can be more elegantly represented using this exponential family representation. A standard problem in the exponential family is to compute the mean value of f ,\nµ(θ) = ∑\nx\np(x; θ)f(x),\ncalled the “mean parameters”. It is easy to show these are equal to the gradient of the log-partition function.\ndA dθ = µ(θ).

To see this, note that, using a similar notation for indexing µ as for θ above,\nµ(xc; θ) = ∑\nX\np(X; θ)I[Xc = xc] = p(xc; θ).\nConditional distributions can be represented by thinking of the parameter vector θ(y;γ) as being a function of the input y, where γ are now the free parameters rather than θ.

Hence, the main technical issues in learning are which loss function to use and how to compute the gradient dL\ndθ .\nIn practice, we will usually be interested in fitting conditional distributions.

For readability, all proofs in this section are postponed to Appendix A. The relationship between the marginals and the logpartition function in Eq. 4 is key to defining approximate marginalization procedures. In Section 3.1, the exact variational principle shows that the (intractable) problem of computing the log-partition function can be converted to a (still intractable) optimization problem. To derive a tractable marginalization algorithm one approximates this optimization, yielding some approximate log-partition function Ã(θ). The approximate marginals are then taken as the exact gradient of Ã. We define the reverse mapping θ(µ) to return some parameter vector that yields that marginals µ. While this will in general not be unique [8, sec. 3.5.2], any two vectors that produce the same marginals µwill also yield the same distribution, and so p(x; θ(µ)) is unambiguous."

(9)\nThus, the partition function (Eq. 8) and marginals (Eq. 9) can both be obtained from solving the same optimization problem. This close relationship between the logpartition function and marginals is heavily used in the derivation of approximate marginalization algorithms. To compute approximate marginals, first, derive an approximate version of the optimization in Eq. 8. Next, take the exact gradient of this approximate partition function.

To create such a set F , instead of considering the set of mean vectors obtainable from any parameter vector (which characterizes M), consider a subset of tractable parameter vectors. The simplest way to achieve this to restrict consideration to parameter vectors θ with θ(xc) = 0 for all factors c.\nF = {µ′ : ∃θ,µ′ = µ(θ), ∀c, θ(xc) = 0}.\nIt is not hard to see that this corresponds to the set of fully-factorized distributions. Note also that this is (in non-treelike graphs) a non-convex set, since it has the same convex hull as M, but is a proper subset. So, the mean field partition function approximation is based on the optimization\nÃ(θ) = max µ∈F θ · µ+H(µ), (10)\n4 with approximate marginals corresponding to the maximizing vector µ, i.e.\nµ̃(θ) = argmax µ∈F θ · µ+H(µ).

This clearly can only increase the value of the approximate log-partition function. However, a further approximation is needed, as the entropy remains intractable to compute for an arbitrary mean vector µ. (It is not even defined for µ 6∈ M.) Thus, TRW further approximates the entropy with a tractable upper bound. Taken together, these two approximations yield a tractable upper bound on the log-partition function. Thus, TRW is based on the optimization problem\nÃ(θ) = max µ∈L θ · µ+ H̃(µ). (13)\nAgain, the approximate marginals are simply the maximizing vector µ, i.e.,\nµ̃(θ) = argmax µ∈L θ · µ+ H̃(µ).

However, L in general also contains unrealizable vectors (though on trees L = M).\nThus, the marginal vector returned by TRW may, in general, be inconsistent in the sense that no joint distribution yields those marginals. The entropy approximation used by TRW is\nH̃(µ) = ∑\ni\nH(µi)− ∑\nc\nρcI(µc), (16)\nwhere H(µi) = − ∑\nxi µ(xi) logµ(xi) is the univariate\nentropy corresponding to variable i, and\nI(µc) = ∑\nxc\nµ(xc) log µ(xc) ∏\ni∈c µ(xi) (17)\nis the mutual information corresponding to the variables in the factor c. The motivation for this approximation is that if the constants ρc are selected appropriately, this gives an upper bound on the true entropy.\nTheorem (TRW Entropy Bound). Let Pr(G) be a distribution over tree structured graphs, and define ρc = Pr(c ∈ G). Then, with H̃ as defined in Eq. 16,\nH̃(µ) ≥ H(µ).\nThus, TRW is maximizing an upper bound on the exact variational principle, under an expanded constraint set. Since both of these changes can only increase the maximum value, we have that Ã(θ) ≥ A(θ). Now, we consider how to actually compute the approximate log-partition function and associated marginals. Consider the message-passing updates\nmc(xi) ∝ ∑\nxc\\i\ne 1 ρc θ(xc)\n∏\nj∈c\\i\neθ(xj) ∏ d:j∈dmd(xj) ρd\nmc(xj) , (18)\nwhere “∝” is used as an assignment operator to means assigning after normalization.\nTheorem (TRW Updates).

Meltzer et al. show [9] that on certain graphs made up of monotonic chains, an appropriate ordering of messages does assure convergence. (The proof is essentially that under these circumstances, message passing is equivalent to coordinate ascent in the dual.)

Some previous work uses tree structured graphs where marginals may be computed exactly [12]. Of course, in high-treewidth graphs, the likelihood and its gradient will be intractable to compute exactly, due to the presence of the log-partition function A(θ) and marginals µ(θ). This has motivated a variety of approximations. The first is to approximate the marginals µ using Markov chain Monte Carlo [13], [14]. This can lead to high computational expense (particularly in the conditional case, where different chains must be run for each input). Contrastive Divergence [15] further approximates these samples by running the Markov chain for only a few steps, but started at the data points [16]. If the Markov chain is run long enough, these approaches can give an arbitrarily good approximation.

Then, the corresponding approximate marginals will emerge as the exact gradient of this surrogate loss. This “surrogate likelihood” [17] approximation appears to be the most widely used loss in imaging problems, with marginals approximated by either mean field [18], [19], TRW [20] or LBP [21], [22], [23], [24], [25]. However, the terminology of “surrogate likelihood” is not widespread and in most cases, only the gradient is computed, meaning the optimization cannot use line searches. If one uses a log-partition approximation that provides a bound on the true log-partition function, the\nsurrogate likelihood will then bound the true likelihood.

To obtain a bound on the true EM loss, care is required. For example, lowerbounding A(θ, z) using mean field, and upper-bounding A(θ) using TRW means a lower-bound on the true EM loss.

However, this conclusion is complicated by two issues. First, of course, the maximum likelihood solution is computationally intractable, motivating the approximations above. A second issue is that of model mis-specification. For many types of complex phenomena, we will wish to fit a model that is approximate in nature. This could be true because the conditional independencies asserted by the graph do not exactly hold, or because the parametrization of factors is too simplistic. These approximations might be made out of ignorance, due to a lack of knowledge about the domain being studied, or deliberately because the true model might have too many degrees of freedom to be fit with available data. In the case of an approximate model, no “true” parameters exist. The idea of marginal-based loss functions is to instead consider how the model will be used. If one will compute marginals at test-time – perhaps for MPM inference (Section 2.3) – it makes sense to maximize the accuracy of these predictions. Further, if one will use an approximate inference algorithm, it makes sense to optimize the accuracy of the approximate marginals.

All variables are binary. Parameters are generated by taking θ(xi) randomly from the interval [−1,+1] for all i and xi. Interaction parameters are taken as θ(xi, xj) = t when xi = xj , and θ(xi, xj) = −t when xi 6= xj , where t is randomly chosen from the interval [−1,+1] for all (i, j). Interactions θ(yi, yj) and θ(xi, yi) are chosen in the same way. To systematically study the effects of differing “amounts” of mis-specification, after generating data, we apply various circular shifts to x. Thus, the data no longer corresponds exactly the the structure of the graphical model being fit. Thirty-two different random distributions were created. For each, various quantities of data were generated\nby Markov chain Monte Carlo, with shifts introduced after sampling. The likelihood was fit using the closedform gradient (Sec. 4.1), while the logistic losses were trained using a gradient obtained via backpropagation (Sec. 7). Fig. 1 shows the mean test error (estimated on 1000 examples), while Fig. 2 shows example marginals. We see that the performance of all methods deteriorates with mis-specification, but the marginal-based loss functions are more resistant to these effects."

We have, by the vector chain rule, that\ndL dθ =\ndµT\ndθ\ndQ dµ . (23)\nA classic trick in scientific computing is to efficiently compute Jacobian-vector products by finite differences. The basic result is that, for any vector v,\ndµ\ndθT v = lim r→0\n1\nr\n( µ(θ + rv) − µ(θ) ) ,\nwhich is essentially just the definition of the derivative of µ in the direction of v. Now, this does not immediately seem helpful, since Eq. 23 requires dµ T\ndθ , not dµ dθT . How-\never, with variational methods, these are symmetric. The simplest way to see this is to note that\ndµ\ndθT =\nd\ndθT\n(\ndA\ndθ\n)\n= dA\ndθdθT .\nDomke [46] lists conditions for various classes of entropies that guarantee that A will be differentiable. Combining the above three equations, the loss gradient is available as the limit\ndL dθ = lim r→0 1 r ( µ(θ + r dQ dµ )− µ(θ) ) . (24)\nIn practice, of course, the gradient is approximated using some finite r. The simplest approximation, onesided differences, simply takes a single value of r in Eq. 24, rather than a limit. More accurate results at the\ncost of more calls to inference, are given using two-sided differences, with\ndL dθ ≈ 1 2r ( µ(θ + r dQ dµ )− µ(θ − r dQ dµ ) ) ,\nwhich is accurate to order o(r2). Still more accurate results are obtained with “four-sided” differences, with\ndL dθ ≈ 1 12r ( −µ(θ + 2r dQ dµ ) + 8µ(θ + r dQ dµ )\n− 8µ(θ − r dQ\ndµ ) + µ(θ − 2r\ndQ dµ ) ) ,\nwhich is accurate to order o(r4) [47]. Alg. 1 shows more explicitly how the loss gradient could be calculated, using two-sided differences. The issue remains of how to calculate the step size r. Each of the approximations above becomes exact as r → 0. However, as r becomes very small, numerical error eventually dominates. To investigate this issue experimentally, we generated random models on a 10×10 binary grid, with each parameter θ(xi) randomly chosen from a standard normal, while each interaction parameter θ(xi, xj) was chosen randomly from a normal with a standard deviation of s. In each case, a random value x was generated, and the “true” loss gradient was estimated by standard (inefficient) 2-sided finite differences, with inference re-run after each component of θ is perturbed independently. To this, we compare one, two, and four-sided perturbations. In all cases, the step size is, following Andrei [48], taken to be r = mǫ 1 3 ( 1+ ||θ||∞ ) /||dQ dµ\n||∞, where ǫ is machine epsilon, and m is a multiplier that we will vary. Note that the optimal power of ǫ will depend on the finite difference scheme; 13 is optimal for two-sided differences [49, Sec. 8.1]. All calculations take place in double-precision with\n9 Algorithm 1 Calculating dL dθ by perturbation (two-sided).\ninference run until marginals changed by a threshold of less than 10−15. Fig. 3 shows that using many-sided differences leads to more accuracy, at the cost of needing to run inference more times to estimate a single loss gradient. In the following experiments, we chose twosided differences with a multiplier of 1 as a reasonable tradeoff between accuracy, simplicity, and computational expense.

      "text" : "The previous methods for computing loss gradients are derived under the assumption that the inference optimization is solved exactly. In an implementation, of course, some convergence threshold must be used. Different convergence thresholds can be used in the learning stage and at test time. In practice, we have observed that too loose a threshold in the learning stage can lead to a bad estimated risk gradient, and learning\nterminating with a bad search direction. Meanwhile, a loose threshold can often be used at test time with few consequences. Usually, a difference of 10−3 in estimated marginals has little practical impact, but this can still be enough to prevent learning from succeeding [51]. It seems odd that the learning algorithm would spend the majority of computational effort exploring tight convergence levels that are irrelevant to the practical performance of the model. Here, we define the learning objective in terms of the approximate marginals obtained after a fixed number of iterations. To understand this, one may think of the inference process not as an optimization, but rather as a large, nonlinear function. This clearly leads to a well-defined objective function. Inputting parameters, applying the iterations of either TRW or mean field, computing predicted marginals, and finally a loss are all differentiable operations. Thus, the loss gradient is efficiently computable, at least in principle, by reverse-mode automatic differentiation (autodiff), an approach explored by Stovanov et al. [36], [52]. In preliminary work, we experimented with autodiff tools, but found these to be unsatisfactory for our applications for two reasons. Firstly, these tools impose a computational penalty over manually derived gradients. Secondly, autodiff stores all intermediate calculations, leading to large memory requirements. The methods derived below use less memory, both in terms of constant factors and big-O complexity. Nevertheless, some of these problems are issues with current implementations of reverse-mode autodiff, avoidable in theory. Both mean field and TRW involve steps where we first take a product of a set of terms, and then normalize. We define a “backnorm” operator, which is useful in taking derivatives over such operations, by\nbacknorm(g, c) = c⊙ (g − g · c).\nThis will be used in the algorithms here.

This is done by taking the predicted marginals, obtained after a fixed number of iterations, and plugging them into the entropy approximations used either for mean field (Eq. 12) or TRW (Eq. 16). The approximate entropy H̃ is then used in defining a truncated partition function as\nÃ(θ) = θ · µ(θ)− H̃(µ(θ)).\nAs we will see below, with too few inference iterations, using this approximation can cause the surrogate likelihood to diverge. To see why, imagine an extreme case where zero inference iterations are used. This results in the loss L(θ,x) = θ·(f(x)−µ0)+H̃(µ0),where µ0 are the\n11\ninitial marginals. As long as the mean of f(x) over the dataset is not equal to µ0, arbitrary loss can be achieved.

The main technical contribution of this paper is several methods for training based on the marginals predicted by a given approximate inference algorithm. These methods take into account model mis-specification and inference approximations. To combat computational complexity, we introduce “truncated” learning, where the inference algorithm only needs to be run for a fixed number of iterations. Truncation can also be applied, somewhat heuristically, to the surrogate likelihood. Among previous methods, we experimentally find the surrogate likelihood to outperform the pseudolikelihood or piecewise learning. By more closely reflecting the test criterion of Hamming loss, marginal-based loss functions perform still better, particularly on harder problems (Though the surrogate likelihood generally displays smaller train/test gaps.) Additionally marginalbased loss functions are more amenable to truncation, as the surrogate likelihood diverges with too few iterations.\n14"

By substitution of previous results, we can see that this reduces to an optimization over univariate marginals only.\nÃ(θ) = max {µ(xi)}\n∑\ni\n∑\nxi\nθ(xi)µ(xi) + ∑\nc\n∑\nxc\nθ(xc)µ(xc)\n− ∑\ni\n∑\nxi\nµ(xi) logµ(xi). (26)\nNow, form a Lagrangian, enforcing that ∑\nxj µ(xj) = 1.\nL = ∑\nj\n∑\nxj\nθ(xj)µ(xj) + ∑\nc\n∑\nxc\nθ(xc) ∏\ni∈c\nµ(xi)\n− ∑\nj\n∑\nxj\nµ(xj) log µ(xj) + ∑\nj\nλj(1 − ∑\nxj\nµ(xj)).\nSetting dL/dµ(xj) = 0, solving for µ(xj), we obtain\nµ(xj) ∝ exp ( θ(xj) + ∑\nc:j∈c\n∑\nxc\\j\nθ(xc) ∏\ni∈c\\j\nµ(xi) ) ,\nmeaning this is a local minimum. Normalizing by Z gives the result. Note that only a local maximum results since the mean-field objective is non-concave[8, Sec. 5.4]. Two preliminary results are needed to prove the TRW entropy bound.\nLemma. Let µG be the “projection” of µ onto a subgraph G, defined by\nµG = {µ(xi)∀i} ∪ {µ(xc)∀c ∈ G}.\nThen, for µ ∈ M,\nH(µG) ≥ H(µ).\nProof: First, note that, by Eq. 25, for µ ∈ M,\nH(µ) = −A∗(µ) = − inf θ (θ · µ−A(θ)).\nNow, the entropy of µG could be defined as an infimum only over the parameters θ corresponding to the cliques in G. Equivalently, however, we can define it as a constrained optimization\nH(µG) = − inf θ:θc=0 ∀c 6∈G\n( θ · µG −A(θ) ) .\nSince the infimum for H(µG) takes place over a more constrained set, but µ and µG are identical on all the\n16\ncomponents where θ may be nonzero, we have the result. Our next result is that the approximate entropy considered in Eq. 16 is exact for tree-structured graphs, when ρc = 1.\nLemma. For µ ∈ M for a marginal polytope M corresponding to a tree-structured graph,\nH(µ) = ∑\ni\nH(µi)− ∑\nc\nI(µc).\nProof: First, note that for any any tree structured distribution can be factored as\np(x) = ∏\ni\np(xi) ∏\nc\np(xc) ∏\ni∈c p(xi) .\n(This is easily shown by induction.) Now, recall our definition of H :\nH(µ) = − ∑\nx\np(x; θ(µ)) log p(x; θ(µ))\nSubstituting the tree-factorized version of p into the equation yields\nH(µ) = − ∑\nx\np(x; θ(µ)) log p(x; θ(µ))\n= − ∑\nx\n∑\ni\np(x; θ(µ)) log p(xi; θ(µ))\n− ∑\nx\n∑\nc\np(x; θ(µ)) log p(xc; θ(µ)) ∏\ni∈c p(xi; θ(µ))\n= − ∑\ni\n∑\nxi\nµ(xi) logµ(xi)\n− ∑\nc\n∑\nxc\nµ(xc) log µ(xc) ∏\ni∈c µ(xi)\nFinally, combining these two lemmas, we can show the main result, that the TRW entropy is an upper bound.\nTheorem (TRW Entropy Bound). Let Pr(G) be a distribution over tree structured graphs, and define ρc = Pr(c ∈ G). Then, with H̃ as defined in Eq. 16,\nH̃(µ) ≥ H(µ).\nProof: The previous Lemma shows that for any specific tree G,\nH(µG) ≥ H(µ).\nThus, it follows that\nH(µ) ≤ ∑\nG\nPr(G)H(µG)\n= ∑\nG\nPr(G) (\n∑\ni\nH(µi)− ∑\nc∈G\nI(µc) )\n= ∑\ni\nH(µi)− ∑\nc\nρcI(µc)\nTheorem (TRW Updates). Let ρc be as in the previous theorem. Then, if the updates in Eq. 18 reach a fixed point, the marginals defined by\nµ(xc) ∝ e 1 ρc θ(xc)\n∏\ni∈c\neθ(xi) ∏ d:i∈dmd(xi) ρd\nmc(xi) ,\nµ(xi) ∝ e θ(xi)\n∏\nd:i∈d\nmd(xi) ρd\nconstitute the global optimum of Eq. 13. Proof: The TRW optimization is defined by\nÃ(θ) = max µ∈L θ · µ+ H̃(µ).\nConsider the equivalent optimization\nmaxµ θ · µ+ H̃(µ)\ns.t. 1 = ∑\nxi\nµ(xi)\nµ(xi). = ∑\nxc\\i\nµ(xc)\nwhich makes the constraints of the local polytope explicit First, we form a Lagrangian, and consider derivatives with respect to µ, for fixed Lagrange multipliers.\nL =θ · µ+H(µ) + ∑\ni\nλi(1− ∑\nxi\nµ(xi))\n+ ∑\nc\n∑\nxi\nλc(xi) (\n∑\nxc\\i\nµ(xc)− µ(xi) )\ndL\ndµ(xc) =θ(xc) + ρc\n(\n∑\ni∈c\n( 1 + log ∑\nx′ i\nµ(xi,x ′ −i)\n)\n− 1− log µ(xc) ) + ∑\ni∈c\nλc(xi)\ndL\ndµ(xi) =θ(xi)− 1− logµ(xi)− λi −\n∑\nc:i∈c\nλc(xi)\nSetting these derivatives equal to zero, we can solve for the log-marginals in terms of the Lagrange multipliers:\nρc logµ(xc) =θ(xc) + ρc (\n∑\ni∈c\n( 1 + log ∑\nx′ i\nµ(xi,x ′ −i)\n) − 1 )\n+ ∑\ni∈c\nλc(xi)\nlogµ(xi) =θ(xi)− 1− λi − ∑\nc:i∈c\nλc(xi)\nNow, at a solution, we must have that µ(xi) = ∑\nxc\\i µ(xc). This leads first to the the constraint that\n17\nlogµ(xc) = 1\nρc θ(xc) +\n∑\ni∈c\n( 1 + logµ(xi) + 1\nρc λc(xi)\n)\n− 1\n= 1\nρc θ(xc) +\n∑\ni∈c\n( 1 + θ(xi)− 1− λi − ∑\nc:i∈c\nλc(xi)\n+ 1\nρc λc(xi)\n)\n− 1.\nNow, define the “messages” in terms of the Lagrange multipliers as\nmc(xi) = e − 1 ρc λc(xi).\nIf the appropriate values of the messages were known, then we could solve for the clique-wise marginals as\nµ(xc) ∝ e 1 ρc θ(xc)\n∏\ni∈c\neθ(xi) exp ( 1\nρc λc(xi)\n)\n× ∏\nd:i∈d\nexp ( −λd(xi)) )\n= e 1 ρc θ(xc)\n∏\ni∈c\neθ(xi) ∏ d:i∈dmd(xi) ρd\nmc(xi) .\nThe univiariate marginals are available simply as\nµ(xi) ∝ exp ( θ(xi)− ∑\nd:i∈d\nλd(xi) )\n= eθ(xi) ∏\nd:i∈d\nexp(−λd(xi) )\n= eθ(xi) ∏\nd:i∈d\nmd(xi) ρd .\nWe may now derive the actual propagation. At a valid solution, the Lagrange multipliers (and hence the messages) must be selected so that the constraints are satisfied. In particular, we must have that µ(xi) = ∑\nxc\\i µ(xc). From the constraint, we can derive con-\nstraints on neighboring sets of messages.\nµ(xi) = ∑\nxc\\i\nµ(xc)\neθ(xi) ∏\nd:i∈d\nmd(xi) ρd ∝\n∑\nxc\\i\ne 1 ρc θ(xc)\n× ∏\ni∈c\neθ(xi) ∏ d:i∈d md(xi) ρd\nmc(xi) (27)\nNow, the left hand side of this equation cancels one term from the product on line 27, except for the denominator of mc(xi). This leads to the constraint of\nmc(xi) ∝ ∑\nxc\\i\ne 1 ρc θ(xc)\n∏\nj∈c\\i\neθ(xj) ∏ d:j∈dmd(xj) ρd\nmc(xj) .\nThis is exactly the equation used as a fixed-point equation in the TRW algorithm."

Then db\ndai = pi ai b.\nNext, both mean-field and TRW involve steps where we first take a product of a set of terms, and then normalize. The following lemma is useful in dealing with such operations.\nLemma (Normalized Products). Suppose that bi = ∏\nj aij and ci = bi/ ∑ j aij . Then,\ndci dajk = ( Ii=j − ci ) cj ajk .\nCorollary. Under the same conditions,\ndL\ndajk = cj ajk ( dL dcj − ∑\ni\ndL dci ci ) .\nAccordingly, we find it useful to define the operator\nbacknorm(g, c) = c⊙ (g − g · c).\nThis can be used as follows. Suppose that we have calculated←−c = dL\ndc . Then, if we set←−ν = backnorm(←−c , c),\nand we have that dL dajk = ←−νj ajk\n. An important special case of this is where ajk =\nexp fjk. Then, we have simply that dLdfjk = ←−νj .\nAnother important special case is where ajk = f ρ jk.\nThen, we have that dajk dfjk = ρfρ−1jk , and so dL dfjk = ρ ←−νj fjk .\nTheorem. After execution of back mean field,\n←− θ (xi) = dL\ndθ(xi) and\n←− θ (xc) = dL\ndθ(xc) .\nProof sketch: The idea is just to mechanically differentiate each step of the algorithm, computing the derivative of the computed loss with respect to each intermediate quantity. First, note that we can re-write the main mean-field iteration as\nµ(xj) ∝ exp ( θ(xj) )\n∏\nc:j∈c\n∏\nxc\\j\nexp ( θ(xc) ∏\ni∈c\\j\nµ(xi) )) . (30)\nNow, suppose we have the derivative of the loss with respect to this intermediate vector of marginals ←−µj . We wish to “push back” this derivative on the values affecting these marginals, namely θ(xj), θ(xc) (for all c such that j ∈ c), and µ(xi) (for all i 6= j such that ∃c : {i, j} ∈ c). To do this, we take two steps: 1) Calculate the derivative with respect to the value on the righthand side of Eq. 30 before normalization. 2) Calculate the derivative of this un-normalized quantity with respect to θ(xj), θ(xc) and µ(xi). Now, define νj to be the vector of marginals produced by Eq. 30 before normalization. Then, by the discussion above, ←−νj = backnorm(←−µj ,µj). This completes step 1. Now, with ←−νj in hand, we can immediately calculate the backpropagation of ←−µj on θ as\n←− θ (xj) = ←−ν (xj).\nThis, follows from the fact that dL da = dL dea ea, where θ(xj) plays the role of a, and ea plays the role of ν(xj). Similarly, we can calculate that\ndL\ndθ(xc) ∏ i∈c\\j µ(xi) = ←−ν (xj).\nThus, since\ndθ(xc) ∏ i∈c\\j µ(xi)\ndθ(xc) =\n∏\ni∈c\\j\nµ(xi),\nwe have that\n←− θ (xc) = ←−ν (xj) ∏\ni∈c\\j\nµ(xi).\nSimilarly, for any xc that “matches” xi (in the sense that the same value xi is present as the appropriate component of xc),\ndθ(xc) ∏ k∈c\\j µ(xk)\ndµ(xi) = θ(xc)\n∏\nk∈c\\{i,j}\nµ(xk).\nFrom which we have\n←−µ (xi) = ∑\nxc\\i\n←−ν (xj)θ(xc) ∏\nk∈c\\{i,j}\nµ(xk),\nmeaning this is a local minimum. Normalizing by Z gives the result.\nTheorem. After execution of back TRW,\n←− θ (xi) = dL\ndθ(xi) and\n←− θ (xc) = dL\ndθ(xc) .\nProof sketch: Again, the idea is just to mechanically differentiate each step of the algorithm. Since the marginals are derived in terms of the messages, we\n19\nmust first take derivatives with respect to the marginalproducing steps. First, consider step 3, where predicted clique marginals are computed. Defining ←−ν (xc) = backnorm(←−µc, µc), we have that\n←− θ (xc) = 1\nρc\n←−ν (xc)\n←− θ (xi) = ∑\nxc\\i\n←−ν (xc)\n←−md(xi) = ρd − I[c = d]\nmd(xi)\n∑\nxc\\i\n←−ν\nNext, consider step 4, where predicted univariate marginals are computed. Defining, ←−ν (xi) = backnorm(←−µi, µi), we have\n←− θ (xi) = ←−ν (xi)\n←−md(xi) = ρd\n←−ν (xi) md(xi) .\nFinally, we consider the main propagation, in step 2. Here, we recompute the intermediate quantity\ns(xc) = e 1 ρc θ(xc)\n∏\nj∈c\\i\neθ(xj)\n∏\nd:j∈d\nmd(xj) ρd\nmc(xj) .\nAfter this, consider the step where when pair (c, i) is being updated. We first compute\ndL\ndm0c(ci) =\n←−ν (xi) mc(xi) ,\nwhere m0c(xi) is defined as the value of the marginal before normalization, and\n←−ν (xi) = backnorm(←−−mci,mci).\n(See the Normalized Products Lemma above.) Given this, we can consider the updates required to gradients of θ(xc), θ(xi) and md(xj) in turn. First, we have that the update to ←− θ (xc) should be\ndL\ndm0c(xi)\ndm0c(xi)\ndθ(xc)\n= ←−ν (xi)\nmc(xi)\n1\nρc s(xc),\nwhich is the update present in the algorithm.

This will be\n∑\nxi\ndL\ndm0c(xi)\ndm0c(xi) dmd(xj)\n= ∑\nxi\n←−ν (xi)\nmc(xi)\n∑\nxc\\{i,j}\nρd md(xj) s(xc)\n= ρd\nmd(xj)\n∑\nxc\\j\ns(xc) ←−ν (xi)\nmc(xi) .\nFinally, consider the update to ←−mc(xj), where j 6= i.
