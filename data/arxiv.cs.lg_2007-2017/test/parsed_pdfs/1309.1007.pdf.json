      "text" : "Concentration of measure inequalities are at the heart of statistical learning theory. Roughly speaking, concentration allows one to conclude that the performance of a (sufficiently “stable”) algorithm on a (sufficiently “close to iid”) sample is indicative of the algorithm’s performance on future data. Quantifying what it means for an algorithm to be stable and for the sampling process to be close to iid is by no means straightforward and much recent work has been motivated by these questions. It turns out that the various notions of stability are naturally expressed in terms of the Lipschitz continuity of the algorithm in question (Bousquet and Elisseeff, 2002; Kutin and Niyogi, 2002; Rakhlin et al., 2005; Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2010), while appropriate relaxations of the iid assumption are achieved using various kinds of strong mixing (Karandikar and Vidyasagar, 2002; Gamarnik, 2003; Rostamizadeh and Mohri, 2007; Mohri and Rostamizadeh, 2008; Steinwart and Christmann, 2009; Steinwart et al., 2009; Zou et al.; Mohri and Rostamizadeh, 2010; London et al., 2012, 2013; Shalizi and Kontorovich, 2013).\nAn elegant and powerful work-horse driving many of the aforementioned results is McDiarmid’s inequality (McDiarmid, 1989):\nP(|ϕ− Eϕ| > t) ≤ 2 exp ( − 2t 2\n∑n i=1 w 2 i\n)\n, (1)\nwhere ϕ is a real-valued function of the sequence of independent random variables X = (X1, . . . , Xn), such that\n|ϕ(x) − ϕ(x′)| ≤ wi (2)\nwhenever x and x′ differ only in the ith coordinate. Aside from being instrumental in proving PAC bounds (Boucheron et al., 2005), McDiarmid’s inequality has also found use in algorithmic stability results (Bousquet and Elisseeff, 2002). Non-iid extensions of (1) have also been considered (Marton, 1996; Rio, 2000; Chazottes et al., 2007; Kontorovich and Ramanan, 2008).\nThe distribution-free nature of McDiarmid’s inequality makes it an attractive tool in learning theory, but also imposes inherent limitations on its applicability. Chief among these limitations is the inability of (1) to provide risk bounds for unbounded loss functions. Even in the bounded case, if the Lipschitz condition (2) holds not everywhere but only with high probability — say, with a much larger constant on a small set of exceptions — the bound in (1) still charges the full cost of the worst-case constant. To counter this difficulty, Kutin (2002); Kutin and Niyogi (2002) introduced an extension of McDiarmid’s inequality to weakly difference-bounded functions and used it to analyze the risk of “almost-everywhere” stable algorithms. This influential result has been invoked in a number of recent papers (El-Yaniv and Pechyony, 2006; Mukherjee et al., 2006; Hush et al., 2007; Agarwal and Niyogi, 2009; Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2010; Rubinstein and Simma, 2012).\nHowever, the approach of Kutin and Niyogi entails some difficulties as well. These come in two flavors: analytical (complex statement and proof) and practical (conditions are still too restrictive in some cases); we will elaborate upon this in Section 3. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to the concentration of “almost-everywhere” or “average-case” Lipschitz functions. To this end, we introduce the notion of the subgaussian diameter of a metric probability space. The latter may be finite even when the metric diameter is infinite, and we show that this notion generalizes the more restrictive property of bounded differences.\nMain results. This paper’s principal contributions include defining the subgaussian diameter of a metric probability space and identifying its role in relaxing the bounded differences condition. In Theorem 1, we show that the subgaussian diameter can essentially replace the far more restrictive metric diameter in concentration bounds. This result has direct ramifications for algorithmic stability (Theorem 2). We furthermore extend our concentration inequality to non-independent processes (Theorem 3) and to other Orlicz norms (Theorem 4).\nOutline of paper. In Section 2 we define the subgaussian diameter and relate it to (weakly) bounded differences in Section 3. We state and prove the concentration inequality based on this notion in Section 4 and give an application to algorithmic stability in Section 5. We then give an extension to non-independent\ndata in Section 6 and discuss other Orlicz norms in Section 7. Conclusions and some open problems are presented in Section 8."

      "text" : "A metric probability space (X , ρ, µ) is a measurable space X whose Borel σalgebra is induced by the metric ρ, endowed with the probability measure µ. Our results are most cleanly presented when X is a discrete set but they continue to hold verbatim for Borel probability measures on Polish spaces. It will be convenient to write Eϕ = ∑\nx∈X P(x)ϕ(x) even when the latter is an integral. Random variables are capitalized (X), specified sequences are written in lowercase, the notation Xji = (Xi, . . . , Xj) is used for all sequences, and sequence concatenation is denoted multiplicatively: xjix k j+1 = x k i . We will frequently use the shorthand P(xji ) = ∏j k=i P(Xk = xk). Standard order of magnitude notation such as O(·) and Ω(·) will be used. A function ϕ : X → R is L-Lipschitz if\n|ϕ(x) − ϕ(x′)| ≤ Lρ(x, x′), x, x′ ∈ X .\nLet (Xi, ρi, µi), i = 1, . . . , n be a sequence of metric probability spaces. We define the product probability space\nXn = X1 ×X2 . . .×Xn\nwith the product measure\nµn = µ1 × µ2 × . . .× µn\nand ℓ1 product metric\nρn(x, y) =\nn ∑\ni=1\nρi(xi, yi), x, y ∈ Xn. (3)\nWe will denote partial products by\nX ji = Xi ×Xi+1 × . . .×Xj .\nWe write Xi ∼ µi to mean that Xi is an Xi-valued random variable with law µi — i.e., P(Xi ∈ A) = µi(A) for all Borel A ⊂ Xi. This notation extends naturally to sequences: Xn1 ∼ µn. We will associate to each (Xi, ρi, µi) the symmetrized distance random variable Ξ(Xi) defined by\nΞ(Xi) = ǫiρi(Xi, x′i), (4)\nwhere Xi, x ′ i ∼ µi are independent and ǫi = ±1 with probability 1/2, independent of Xi, x ′ i. We note right away that Ξ(Xi) is a centered random variable:\nE[Ξ(Xi)] = 0. (5)\nA real-valued random variable X is said to be subgaussian if it admits a σ > 0 such that\nEeλX ≤ eσ2λ2/2, λ ∈ R. (6)\nThe smallest σ for which (6) holds will be denoted by σ∗(X). We define the subgaussian diameter ∆SG(Xi) of the metric probability space (Xi, ρi, µi) in terms of its symmetrized distance Ξ(Xi):\n∆SG(Xi) = σ∗(Ξ(Xi)). (7)\nIf a metric probability space (X , ρ, µ) has finite diameter,\ndiam(X ) := sup x,x′∈X ρ(x, x′) < ∞,\nthen its subgaussian diameter is also finite:\nLemma 1.\n∆SG(X ) ≤ diam(X ).\nProof. Let Ξ = Ξ(X ) be the symmetrized distance. By (5), we have E[Ξ] = 0 and certainly |Ξ| ≤ diam(X ). Hence,\nEeλΞ ≤ exp((2 diam(X )λ)2/8) = exp(diam(X )2λ2/2),\nwhere the inequality follows from Hoeffding’s Lemma.\nThe bound in Lemma 1 is nearly tight in the sense that for every ε > 0 there is a metric probability space (X , ρ, µ) for which\ndiam(X ) < ∆SG(X ) + ε. (8)\nTo see this, take X to be an N -point space with the uniform distribution and ρ(x, x′) = 1 for all distinct x, x′ ∈ X . Taking N sufficiently large makes ∆SG(X ) arbitrarily close to diam(X ) = 1. We do not know whether diam(X ) = ∆SG(X ) can be achieved.\nOn the other hand, there exist unbounded metric probability spaces with finite subgaussian diameter. A simple example is (X , ρ, µ) with X = R, ρ(x, x′) = |x− x′| and µ the standard Gaussian probability measure dµ = (2π)−1/2e−x2/2dx. Obviously, diam(X ) = ∞. Now the symmetrized distance Ξ = Ξ(X ) is distributed as the difference (=sum) of two standard Gaussians: Ξ ∼ N(0, 2). Since EeλΞ = eλ 2 , we have\n∆SG(X ) = √ 2. (9)\nMore generally, the subgaussian distributions on R are precisely those for which ∆SG(R) < ∞."

      "text" : "McDiarmid’s inequality (1) suffers from the limitations mentioned above: it completely ignores the distribution and is vacuous if even one of the wi is infinite.1 In order to address some of these issues, Kutin (2002); Kutin and Niyogi (2002) proposed an extension of McDiarmid’s inequality to “almost everywhere” Lipschitz functions ϕ : Xn → R. To formalize this, fix an i ∈ [n] and let Xn1 ∼ µn and x′i ∼ µi be independent. Define X̃n1 = X̃n1 (i) by\nX̃j(i) =\n{\nXj , j 6= i x′i, j = i.\n(10)\nKutin and Niyogi define ϕ to be weakly difference-bounded by (b, c, δ) if\nP\n( |ϕ(X)− ϕ(X̃(i))| > b ) = 0 (11)\nand\nP\n( |ϕ(X)− ϕ(X̃(i))| > c ) < δ (12)\nfor all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. The precise result of Kutin (2002, Theorem 1.10) is somewhat unwieldy to state — indeed, the present work was motivated in part by a desire for simpler tools. Assuming that ϕ is weakly difference-bounded by (b, c, δ) with\nδ = exp(−Ω(n)) (13) and c = O(1/n), their bound states that\nP(|ϕ− Eϕ| ≥ t) ≤ exp(−Ω(nt2)) (14) for a certain range of t and n. As noted by Rakhlin et al. (2005), the exponential decay assumption (13) is necessary in order for the Kutin-Niyogi method to yield exponential concentration. In contrast, the bounds we prove here\n(i) do not require |ϕ(X)− ϕ(X̃)| to be everywhere bounded as in (11) (ii) have a simple statement and proof, and generalize to non-iid processes\nwith relative ease.\nWe defer the quantitative comparisons between (14) and our results until the latter are formally stated in Section 4.\nIn a different line of work, Bentkus (2008) considered an extension of Hoeffding’s inequality to unbounded random variables. His bound only holds for sums (as opposed to general Lipschitz functions) and the summands must be non-negative (i.e., unbounded only in the positive direction). An earlier notion of “effective” metric diameter in the context of concentration is that of metric space length (Schechtman, 1982). Another distribution-dependent refinement of diameter is the spread constant (Alon et al., 1998). Lecué and Mendelson (2013) gave minimax bounds for empirical risk minimization over subgaussian classes.\n1Note, though, that McDiarmid’s inequality is sharp in the sense that the constants in (1) cannot be improved in a distribution-free fashion."

      "text" : "McDiarmid’s inequality (1) may be stated in the notation of Section 2 as follows. Let (Xi, ρi, µi), i = 1, . . . , n be a sequence of metric probability spaces and ϕ : Xn → R a 1-Lipschitz function. Then\nP(|ϕ− Eϕ| > t) ≤ 2 exp ( − 2t 2\n∑n i=1 diam(Xi)2\n)\n. (15)\nWe defined the subgaussian diameter ∆SG(Xi) in Section 2, showing in Lemma 1 that it never exceeds the metric diameter. We also showed by example that the former can be finite when the latter is infinite. The main result of this section is that diam(Xi) in (15) can essentially be replaced by ∆SG(Xi): Theorem 1. If ϕ : Xn → R is 1-Lipschitz then Eϕ < ∞ and\nP(|ϕ− Eϕ| > t) ≤ 2 exp ( − t 2\n2 ∑n i=1 ∆ 2 SG (Xi)\n)\n.\nOur constant in the exponent is worse than that of (15) by a factor of 4; this appears to be an inherent artifact of our method.\nProof. The strong integrability of ϕ — and in particular, finiteness of Eϕ — follow from exponential concentration (Ledoux, 2001). The rest of the proof will proceed via the Azuma-Hoeffding-McDiarmid method of martingale differences. Define Vi = E[ϕ |X i1]− E[ϕ |X i−11 ] and expand\nE[ϕ |X i1] = ∑\nxn i+1∈X n i+1\nP(xni+1)ϕ(X i 1x n i+1)\nE[ϕ |X i−11 ] = ∑\nxn i ∈Xn i\nP(xni )ϕ(X i−1 1 x n i ).\nLet Ṽi be Vi conditioned on X i−1 1 ; thus,\nṼi = ∑\nxn i+1\nP(xni+1) ∑\nxi,x′i\nP(xi)P(x ′ i) ( ϕ(X i−11 xix n i+1)− ϕ(X i−11 x′ixni+1) ) .\nHence, by Jensen’s inequality, we have\nE[eλVi |X i−11 ] ≤ ∑\nxn i+1\nP(xni+1) ∑\ny,y′\nP(y)P(y′)eλ(ϕ(X i−1 1 yx n i+1)−ϕ(X i−1 1 y ′xni+1)).\nFor fixed X i−11 ∈ X i−11 and xni+1 ∈ Xni+1, define F : Xi → R by F (y) = ϕ(X i−11 yx n i+1), and observe that F is 1-Lipschitz with respect to ρi. Since et + e−t = 2 cosh(t) and cosh(t) ≤ cosh(s) for all |t| ≤ s, we have2\neλ(F (y)−F (y ′)) + eλ(F (y ′)−F (y)) ≤ eλρi(y,y′) + e−λρi(y,y′), 2An analogous symmetrization technique is employed in http://terrytao.wordpress.com/ 2009/06/09/talagrands-concentration-inequality as a variant of the “square and rearrange” trick.\nand hence\n∑\ny,y′∈Xi\nP(y)P(y′)eλ(F (y)−F (y ′)) (16)\n≤ 12\n\n\n∑\ny,y′\nP(y)P(y′)eλρi(y,y ′) +\n∑\ny,y′\nP(y)P(y′)e−λρi(y,y ′)\n\n\n= EeλΞ(Xi) ≤ exp(λ2∆2 SG (Xi)/2),\nwhere Ξ(Xi) is the symmetrized distance (4) and the last inequality holds by definition of subgaussian diameter (6,7). It follows that\nE[eλVi |X i−11 ] ≤ exp(λ2∆2SG(Xi)/2). (17)\nApplying the standard Markov’s inequality and exponential bounding argument, we have\nP(ϕ− Eϕ > t) = P ( n ∑\ni=1\nVi > t\n)\n≤ e−λtE [ n ∏\ni=1\neλVi\n]\n= e−λtE\n[\nn ∏\ni=1\nE[eλVi |X i−11 ] ]\n≤ e−λtE [ n ∏\ni=1\nexp(λ2∆2 SG (Xi)/2)\n]\n= exp\n(\n1 2 λ2\nn ∑\ni=1\n∆2 SG (Xi)− λt\n)\n. (18)\nOptimizing over λ and applying the same argument to Eϕ−ϕ yields our claim.\nLet us see how Theorem 1 compares to previous results on some examples. Consider Rn equipped with the ℓ1 metric ρ n(x, x′) = ∑\ni∈[n] |xi − x′i| and the standard Gaussian product measure µn = N(0, In). Let ϕ : R\nn → R be 1/nLipschitz. Then Theorem 1 yields (recalling the calculation in (9))\nP(|ϕ− Eϕ| > ε) ≤ 2 exp(−nε2/4), ε > 0, (19)\nwhereas the inequalities of McDiarmid (1) and Kutin-Niuyogi (14) are both uninformative since the metric diameter is infinite.\nFor our next example, fix an n ∈ N and put Xi = {±1,±n} with the metric ρi(x, x ′) = |x − x′| and the distribution µi(x) ∝ e−x 2\n. One may verify via a calculation analogous to (9) that ∆SG(Xi) ≤ √ 2. For independent Xi ∼ µi,\ni = 1, . . . , n, put ϕ(Xn1 ) = n −1 ∑n i=1 Xi. Then Theorem 1 implies that in this case the bound in (19) holds verbatim. On the other hand, ϕ is easily seen to be weakly difference-bounded by (1, 1/n, e−Ω(n)) and thus (14) also yields subgaussian concentration, albeit with worse constants. Applying (1) yields the much cruder estimate\nP(|ϕ− Eϕ| > ε) ≤ 2 exp(−2ε2)."

      "text" : "We refer the reader to (Bousquet and Elisseeff, 2002; Kutin and Niyogi, 2002; Rakhlin et al., 2005) for background on algorithmic stability and supervised learning. Our metric probability space (Zi, ρi, µi) will now have the structure Zi = Xi × Yi where Xi and Yi are, respectively, the instance and label space of the ith example. Under the iid assumption, the (Zi, ρi, µi) are identical for all i ∈ N (and so we will henceforth drop the subscript i from these). A training sample is S = Zn1 ∼ µn is drawn and a learning algorithm A inputs S and outputs a hypothesis f : X → Y. The hypothesis f = A(S) will be denoted by AS . In line with the previous literature, we assume that A is symmetric (i.e., invariant under permutations of S). The loss of a hypothesis f on an example z = (x, y) is defined by\nL(f, z) = ℓ(f(x), y),\nwhere ℓ : Y × Y → [0,∞) is the cost function. To our knowledge, all previous work required the loss to be bounded by some constant M < ∞, which figures explicitly in the bounds; we make no such restriction.\nIn the algorithmic stability setting, the empirical risk R̂n(A, S) is typically defined as\nR̂n(A, S) = 1\nn\nn ∑\ni=1\nL(AS , zi) (20)\nand the true risk R(A, S) as\nR(A, S) = Ez∼µ[L(AS , z)]. (21)\nThe goal is to bound the excess risk R(A, S)− R̂n(A, S). To this end, a myriad of notions of hypothesis stability have been proposed. A variant of uniform stability in the sense of Rakhlin et al. (2005) — which is slightly more general than the homonymous notion in Bousquet and Elisseeff (2002)— may be defined as follows. The algorithm A is said to be β-uniform stable if for all z̃ ∈ Z, the function ϕz̃ : Zn → R given by ϕz̃(z) = L(Az, z̃) is β-Lipschitz with respect to the Hamming metric on Zn:\n∀z̃ ∈ Z, ∀z, z′ ∈ Zn : |ϕz̃(z)− ϕz̃(z′)| ≤ β n ∑\ni=1\n1{zi 6=z′i}.\nWe define the algorithm A to be β-totally Lipschitz stable if the function ϕ : Zn+1 → R given by ϕ(zn+11 ) = L(Azn1 , zn+1) is β-Lipschitz with respect to the ℓ1 product metric on Zn+1:\n∀z, z′ ∈ Zn+1 : |ϕ(z)− ϕ(z′)| ≤ β n+1 ∑\ni=1\nρ(zi, z ′ i). (22)\nNote that total Lipschitz stability is stronger than uniform stability since it requires the algorithm to respect the metric of Z.\nLet us bound the bias of stable algorithms.\nLemma 2. Suppose A is a symmetric, β-totally Lipschitz stable learning algorithm over the metric probability space (Z, ρ, µ) with ∆SG(Z) < ∞. Then\nE[R(A, S)− R̂n(A, S)] ≤ 12β2∆2SG(Z).\nProof. Observe, as in the proof of (Bousquet and Elisseeff, 2002, Lemma 7), that for all i ∈ [n],\nE[R(A, S)− R̂n(A, S)] = EZn1 ,Z̃n1 [L(AZn1 , Z̃i)− L(AZ̃n1 , Z̃i)], (23)\nwhere Zn1 ∼ µn and Z̃ is generated from Z via the process defined in (10). For fixed i ∈ [n] and Zi−11 ,Zni+1, define\nWi(Zi, Z ′ i) = L(AZn1 , Z ′ i)− L(AZi−1\n1 Z′ i Zn i+1 , Z ′i)\nand note that (22) implies that |Wi(Zi, Z ′i)| ≤ βρ(Zi, Z ′i). Now rewrite (23) as\nE[R(A, S)− R̂n(A, S)] = ∑\nzi−11 ,z n i+1\nP(zi−11 )P(z n i+1)\n∑\nzi,z ′\ni\nP(zi)P(z ′ i)Wi(zi, z ′ i). (24)\nInvoking Jensen’s inequality and the argument in (16),\nexp\n\n\n∑\nzi,z ′\ni\nP(zi)P(z ′ i)Wi(zi, z ′ i)\n\n ≤ ∑\nzi,z ′\ni\nP(zi)P(z ′ i)e Wi(zi,z ′ i)\n= 12\n\n\n∑\nzi,z ′\ni\nP(zi)P(z ′ i)e Wi(zi,z ′ i) + ∑\nzi,z ′\ni\nP(zi)P(z ′ i)e −Wi(zi,z ′ i)\n\n\n≤ 12\n\n\n∑\nzi,z ′\ni\nP(zi)P(z ′ i)e βρ(zi,z ′ i) + ∑\nzi,z ′\ni\nP(zi)P(z ′ i)e −βρ(zi,z ′ i)\n\n\n≤ exp(12β 2∆2 SG (Z)).\nTaking logarithms yields the estimate ∑\nzi,z ′\ni\nP(zi)P(z ′ i)Wi(zi, z ′ i) ≤ 12β 2∆2 SG (Z), (25)\nwhich, after substituting (25) into (24), proves the claim.\nWe now turn to the Lipschitz continuity of the excess risk.\nLemma 3. Suppose A is a symmetric, β-totally Lipschitz stable learning algorithm and define the excess risk function ϕ : Zn → R by ϕ(z) = R(A, z) − R̂n(A, z). Then ϕ is 3β-Lipschitz. Proof. We examine the two summands separately. The definition (21) of R(A, ·) implies that the latter is β-Lipchitz since it is a convex combination of βLipschitz functions. Now R̂n(A, ·) defined in (20) is also a convex combination of β-Lipschitz functions, but because zi appears twice in L(Azn\n1 , zi), changing zi to\nz′i could incur a difference of up to 2βρ(zi, z ′ i). Hence, R̂n(A, ·) is 2β-Lipschitz. As Lipschitz constants are subadditive, the claim is proved.\nCombining Lemmas 2 and 3 with our concentration inequality in Theorem 1 yields the main result of this section:\nTheorem 2. Suppose A is a symmetric, β-totally Lipschitz stable learning algorithm over the metric probability space (Z, ρ, µ) with ∆SG(Z) < ∞. Then, for training samples S ∼ µn and ε > 0, we have\nP\n(\nR(A, S)− R̂n(A, S) > 12β 2∆2 SG (Z) + ε\n) ≤ exp ( − ε 2\n18β2∆2 SG (Z)n\n)\n.\nAs in Bousquet and Elisseeff (2002) and related results on algorithmic stability, we require β = O(1/n) for exponential decay. Bousquet and Elisseeff showed that this is indeed the case for some popular learning algorithms, albeit in their less restrictive definition of stability. We conjecture that many of these algorithms continue to be stable in our stronger sense and plan to explore this in future work."

      "text" : "In this section we generalize Theorem 1 to strongly mixing processes. To this end, we require some standard facts concerning the probability-theoretic notions of coupling and transportation (Lindvall, 2002; Villani, 2003, 2009). Given the probability measures µ, µ′ on a measurable space X , a coupling π of µ, µ′ is any probability measure on X ×X with marginals µ and µ′, respectively. Denoting by Π = Π(µ, µ′) the set of all couplings, we have\ninf π∈Π\nπ( { (x, y) ∈ X 2 : x 6= y } ) = 12\n∑\nx∈X\n|µ(x) − µ′(x)|\n= ‖µ− µ′‖ TV\n(26)\nwhere ‖·‖ TV\nis the total variation norm. An optimal coupling is one that achieves the infimum in (26); one always exists, though it may not be unique. Another elementary property of couplings is that for any two f, g : X → R and any coupling π ∈ Π(µ, µ′), we have\nEµf − Eµ′g = E(X,X′)∼π[f(X)− g(X ′)]. (27)\nIt is possible to refine the total variation distance between µ and µ′ so as to respect the metric of X . Given a space equipped with probability measures µ, µ′ and metric ρ, define the transportation cost3 distance Tρ(µ, µ ′) by\nTρ(µ, µ ′) = inf\nπ∈Π(µ,µ′) E(X,X′)∼πρ(X,X\n′).\nIt is easy to verify that Tρ is a valid metric on probability measures and that for ρ(x, x′) = 1{x 6=x′}, we have Tρ(µ, µ ′) = ‖µ− µ′‖ TV\n. As in Section 4, we consider a sequence of metric spaces (Xi, ρi), i = 1, . . . , n and their ℓ1 product (Xn, ρn). Unlike the independent case, we will allow nonproduct probability measures ν on (Xn, ρn). We will write Xn1 ∼ ν to mean that P(Xn1 ∈ A) = ν(A) for all Borel A ⊂ Xn. For 1 ≤ i ≤ j < k ≤ l ≤ n, we will use the shorthand\nP(xlk |xji ) = P ( X lk = x l k |Xji = x j i ) .\nThe notation P(Xji ) means the marginal distribution ofX j i . Similarly, P(X l k |X j i = xji ) will denote the conditional distribution. For 1 ≤ i < n, and xi1 ∈ X i1 , x′i ∈ Xi define\nτi(x i 1, x ′ i) = Tρni+1(P(X n i+1 |X i1 = xi1),P(Xni+1 |X i1 = xi−11 x′i)),\nwhere ρni+1 is the ℓ1 product of ρi+1, . . . ρn as in (3), and\nτ̄i = sup xi1∈X i 1 ,x ′ i ∈Xi\nτi(x i 1, x ′ i),\nwith τ̄n ≡ 0. In words, τi(xi1, x′i) measures the transportation cost distance between the conditional distributions induced on the “tail” Xni+1 given two prefixes that differ in the ith coordinate, and τ̄i is the maximal value of this quantity. Kontorovich (2007); Kontorovich and Ramanan (2008) discuss how to handle conditioning on measure-zero sets and other technicalities. Note that for product measures the conditional distributions are identical and hence τ̄i = 0.\nWe need one more definition before stating our main result. For the prefix xi−11 , define the conditional distribution\nνi(x i−1 1 ) = P\n( Xi |X i−11 = xi−11 )\nand consider the corresponding metric probability space (Xi, ρi, νi(xi−11 )). Define its conditional subgaussian diameter by\n∆SG(Xi |xi−11 ) = ∆SG(Xi, ρi, νi(xi−11 )) 3This fundamental notion is also known as the Wasserstein, Monge-Kantorovich, or earthmover distance; see Villani (2003, 2009) for an encyclopedic treatment. The use of coupling and transportation techniques to obtain concentration for dependent random variables goes back to Marton (1996); Samson (2000); Chazottes et al. (2007).\nand the maximal subgaussian diameter by\n∆̄SG(Xi) = sup xi−11 ∈X i−1 1 ∆SG(Xi |xi−11 ). (28)\nNote that for product measures, (28) reduces to the former definition (7). With these definitions, we may state the main result of this section.\nTheorem 3. If ϕ : Xn → R is 1-Lipschitz with respect to ρn, then\nP(|ϕ− Eϕ| > t) ≤ 2 exp ( − (t−∑i≤n τ̄i)2\n2 ∑ i≤n ∆̄ 2 SG (Xi)\n)\n, t > 0.\nObserve that we recover Theorem 1 as a special case. Since typically we will take t = εn, it suffices that ∑\ni≤n τ̄i = o(n) and ∑ i≤n ∆̄ 2 SG (Xi) = O(n) to\nensure a exponential bound with decay rate exp(−Ω(nε2)).\nProof. We begin by considering the martingale difference\nVi = E[ϕ |X i1 = xi1]− E[ϕ |X i−11 = xi−11 ]\nas in the proof of Theorem 1. More explicitly,\nVi = ∑\nxni+1\nP(xni+1 |xi1)ϕ(xi1xni+1)− ∑\nxni\nP(xni |xi−11 )ϕ(xi−11 xni )\n= ∑\nx′i\nP(x′i |xi−11 ) ∑\nxni+1\n[ P(xni+1 |xi1)ϕ(xi1xni+1)− P(xni+1 |xi−11 x′i)ϕ(xi−11 x′ixni+1) ] .\nDefine Ṽi to be Vi conditioned on X i−1 1 . Then\nṼi = ∑\nxi,x′i\nP(xi |X i−11 )P(x′i |X i−11 )· (29)\n∑\nxni+1\n[P(xni+1 |X i−11 xi)ϕ(X i−11 x′ixni+1)− P(xni+1 |X i−11 x′i)ϕ(X i−11 xixni+1)].\nLet π be an optimal coupling realizing the infimum in the transportation cost distance Tρn\ni+1 used to define τi(x i 1, x ′ i). Recalling (27), we have\n∑\nxni+1\n[ P(xni+1 |X i−11 xi)ϕ(X i−11 xixni+1)− P(xni+1 |X i−11 x′i)ϕ(X i−11 x′ixni+1) ]\n= E(Ẋn i+1 ,Ẍn i+1 )∼π\n[\nϕ(X i−11 xiẊ n i+1)− ϕ(X i−11 x′iẌni+1)\n]\n≤ E(Ẋn i+1 ,Ẍn i+1 )∼π\n\nϕ(X i−11 xiẊ n i+1)− ϕ(X i−11 x′iẊni+1) +\nn ∑\nj=i+1\nρj(Ẋj , Ẍj)\n\n\n≤ EẊn i+1 ∼P(· |Xi−11 xi)\n[\nϕ(X i−11 xiẊ n i+1)− ϕ(X i−11 x′iẊni+1)\n]\n+ τ̄i\n= F (xi)− F (x′i) + τ̄i, (30)\nwhere the first inequality holds by the Lipschitz property and the second by definition of τ̄i, and F : Xi → R is defined by\nF (y) = ∑\nxni+1\nP(xni+1 |X i−11 xi)ϕ(X i−11 yxni+1).\nLet us substitute (30) into (29):\nṼi ≤ τ̄i + ∑\nxi,x′i\nP(xi |X i−11 )P(x′i |X i−11 )(F (xi)− F (x′i)).\nObserve that F is 1-Lipschitz under ρi and apply Jensen’s inequality:\nE[eλVi |X i−11 ] ≤ eλτ̄i ∑\nxi,x′i\nP(xi |X i−11 )P(x′i |X i−11 )eλ(F (xi)−F (x ′ i))\n≤ eλτ̄i ∑\nxi,x′i\nP(xi |X i−11 )P(x′i |X i−11 ) cosh(λρ(xi, x′i))\n≤ exp ( λτ̄i + 1\n2 ∆̄2 SG (Xi)λ2\n)\n,\nwhere the second inequality follows from the argument in (16) and the third from the definition of ∆̄SG(Xi). Repeating the standard martingale argument in (18) yields\nP(ϕ− Eϕ > t) = P ( n ∑\ni=1\nVi > t\n)\n≤ exp ( 1\n2 λ2\nn ∑\ni=1\n∆̄2 SG (Xi)− λt+ λ\nn ∑\ni=1\nτ̄i\n)\n.\nOptimizing over λ yields the claim."

      "text" : "We have given a concentration inequality for metric spaces with unbounded diameter, showed its applicability to algorithmic stability with unbounded losses, and gave an extension to non-independent sampling processes. Some fascinating questions remain:\n(i) How tight is Theorem 1? First there is the vexing matter of having a worse constant in the exponent (i.e., 1/2) than McDiarmid’s (optimal) constant 2. Although this gap is not of critical importance, one would like a bound that recovers McDiarmid’s in the finite-diameter case. More importantly, is it the case that finite subgaussian diameter is necessary for subgaussian concentration of all Lipschitz functions? That is, given the metric probability spaces (Xi, ρi, µi), i ∈ [n], can one always exhibit a 1-Lipschitz ϕ : Xn → R that achieves a nearly matching lower bound?\n(ii) We would like to better understand how Theorem 1 compares to the KutinNiyogi bound (14). We conjecture that for any (Xn, µn) and ϕ : Xn → R that satisfies (11) and (12), one can construct a product metric ρn for which ∑\ni∈[n] ∆ 2 SG (Xi) < ∞ and ϕ is 1-Lipschitz. This would imply that\nwhenever the Kutin-Niyogi bound is nontrivial, so is Theorem 1. We have already shown by example (19) that the reverse does not hold.\n(iii) The quantity τ̄i defined in Section 6 is a rather complicated object; one desires a better handle on it in terms of the given distribution and metric.\n(iv) Perhaps the most pressing question is that of showing that some common learning algorithms such as k-nearest neighbor, kernel SVM, regularized regression are totally Lipschitz stable under our definition (22)."

To this end, we introduce the notion of the subgaussian diameter, which is a distribution-dependent refinement of the metric diameter. Our technique provides an alternative approach to that of Kutin and Niyogi’s method of weakly difference-bounded functions, and yields nontrivial, dimension-free results in some interesting cases where the former does not. As an application, we give apparently the first generalization bound in the algorithmic stability setting that holds for unbounded loss functions. We give two extensions of the basic concentration result: to strongly mixing processes and to other Orlicz norms.",
