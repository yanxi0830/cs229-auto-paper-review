      "text" : "Variational bounds provide a convenient approach to approximate inference in a range of intractable models. Classical variational optimisation is achieved through coordinate ascent which can be slow to converge. A popular solution [King and Lawrence, 2006, Teh et al., 2007, Kurihara et al., 2007, Sung et al., 2008, Lázaro-Gredilla and Titsias, 2011, Lázaro-Gredilla et al., 2011] is to marginalize analytically a portion of the variational approximating distribution, removing this from the optimization. In this paper we provide a unifying framework for collapsed inference in the general class of models composed of conjugate-exponential graphs (CEGs).\nFirst we review the body of earlier work with a succinct and unifying derivation of the collapsed bounds. We describe how the applicability of the collapsed bound to any particular CEG can be determined with a simple d-separation test. Standard variational inference via coordinate ascent turns out to be steepest ascent with a unit step length on our unifying bound. This motivates us to consider natural gradients and conjugate gradients for fast optimization of these models. We apply our unifying approach to a range of models from the literature obtaining, often, an order of magnitude or more increase in convergence speed. Our unifying view allows collapsed variational methods to be integrated into general inference tools like infer.net [Minka et al., 2010].\nar X\niv :1\n20 6.\n51 62\nv2 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n4 D\nec 2"

      "text" : "The advantages to marginalising analytically a subset of variables in variational bounds seem to be well understood: several different approaches have been suggested in the context of specific models. In Dirichlet process mixture models Kurihara et al. [2007] proposed a collapsed approach using both truncated stick-breaking and symmetric priors. Sung et al. [2008] proposed ‘latent space variational Bayes’ where both the clusterparameters and mixing weights were marginalised, again with some approximations. Teh et al. [2007] proposed a collapsed inference procedure for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). In this paper we unify all these results from the perspective of the ‘KL corrected bound’ [King and Lawrence, 2006]. This lower bound on the model evidence is also an upper bound on the original variational bound, the difference between the two bounds is given by a Kullback Leibler divergence. The approach has also been referred to as the marginalised variational bound by Lázaro-Gredilla et al. [2011], Lázaro-Gredilla and Titsias [2011]. The connection between the KL corrected bound and the collapsed bounds is not immediately obvious. The key difference between the frameworks is the order in which the marginalisation and variational approximation are applied. However, for CEGs this order turns out to be irrelevant. Our framework leads to a more succinct derivation of the collapsed approximations. The resulting bound can then be optimised without recourse to approximations in either the bound’s evaluation or its optimization."

      "text" : "Assume we have a probabilistic model for data, D, given parameters (and/or latent variables), X, Z, of the form p(D,X,Z) = p(D |Z,X)p(Z |X)p(X). In variational Bayes (see e.g. Bishop [2006]) we approximate the posterior p(Z,X|D) by a distribution q(Z,X). We use Jensen’s inequality to derive a lower bound on the model evidence L, which serves as an objective function in the variational optimisation:\np(D) ≥ L = ∫ q(Z,X) ln\np(D,Z,X) q(Z,X) dZ dX. (1)\nFor tractability the mean field (MF) approach assumes q factorises across its variables, q(Z,X) = q(Z)q(X). It is then possible to implement an optimisation scheme which analytically optimises each factor alternately, with the optimal distribution given by\nq?(X) ∝ exp {∫ q(Z) ln p(D,X|Z) dZ } , (2)\nand similarly for Z: these are often referred to as VBE and VBM steps. King and Lawrence [2006] substituted the expression for the optimal distribution (for example q?(X)) back into the bound (1), eliminating one set of parameters from the optimisation, an approach that has been reused by Lázaro-Gredilla et al. [2011], Lázaro-Gredilla and Titsias [2011]. The resulting bound is not dependent on q(X). King and Lawrence [2006] referred to this new bound as ‘the KL corrected bound’. The difference between the bound, which we denote LKL, and a standard mean field approximation LMF, is the Kullback Leibler divergence between the optimal form of q∗(X) and the current q(X).\nWe rederive their bound by first using Jensen’s inequality to construct the variational lower bound on the conditional distribution,\nln p(D|X) ≥ ∫ q(Z) ln\np(D,Z|X) q(Z) dZ , L1. (3)\nThis object turns out to be of central importance in computing the final KL-corrected bound and also in computing gradients, curvatures and the distribution of the collapsed variables q?(X). It is easy to see that it is a function of X which lower-bounds the log likelihood p(D |X), and indeed our derivation treats it as such. We now marginalize the conditioned variable from this expression,\nln p(D) ≥ ln ∫ p(X) exp{L1} dX , LKL, (4)\ngiving us the bound of King and Lawrence [2006] & Lázaro-Gredilla et al. [2011]. Note that one set of parameters was marginalised after the variational approximation was made.\nUsing (2), this expression also provides the approximate posterior for the marginalised variables X:\nq?(X) = p(X)eL1−LKL (5)\nand eLKL appears as the constant of proportionality in the mean-field update equation (2)."

For a given q(Z), the bounds are equal after q(X) is updated via the mean field method: the approximations are ultimately the same. The advantage of the new bound is to reduce the number of parameters in the optimisation. It is particularly useful when variational parameters are optimised by gradient methods. Since VBEM is equivalent to a steepest descent gradient method with a fixed step size, there appears to be a lot to gain by combining the KLC bound with more sophisticated optimization techniques.\n1We use KL(·||·) to denote the Kullback Leibler divergence between two distributions."

We can combine this important insight with the above result to realize that we have a simple method for computing the gradients of the KL corrected bound: we only need to look at the update expressions for the mean-field method. This result also reveals the weakness of standard variational Bayesian expectation maximization (VBEM): it is a steepest ascent algorithm. Honkela et al. [2010] looked to rectify this weakness by applying a conjugate gradient algorithm to the mean field bound. However, they didn’t obtain a significant improvement in convergence speed. Our suggestion is to apply conjugate gradients to the KLC bound. Whilst the value and gradient of the MF bound matches that of the KLC bound after an update of the collapsed variables, the curvature is always greater. In practise this means that much larger steps (which we compute using conjugate gradient methods) can be taken when optimizing the KLC bound than for the MF bound leading to more rapid convergence."

These procedures lead to improved inference, or faster convergence.\nThe KLC bound derivation we have provided also marginalises parameters, but after a variational approximation is made. The difference between the two approaches is distilled in these expressions:\nlnEp(X) [ exp { Eq(Z) [ ln p(D|X,Z) ]}] Eq(Z) [ ln { Ep(X) [ p(D|X,Z) ]}] (12)\nwhere the left expression appears in the KLC bound, and the right expression appears in the bound for collapsed variational Bayes, with the remainder of the bounds being equal. Whilst appropriately conjugate formulation of the model will always ensure that the KLC expression is analytically tractable, the expectation in the collapsed VB expression is not. Sung et al. [2008] propose a first order approximation to the expectation of the form Eq(Z) [ f(Z) ] ≈ f(Eq(Z) [ Z ] ), which reduces the right expression to the that on the left. Under this approximation2 the KL corrected approach is equivalent to the collapsed variational approach."

The requirement is to select a sufficient set of variables, Z, such that the effective likelihood for X, given by (3) becomes conjugate to the prior. Figure 1(a) illustrates the d-separation test with application to the KLC bound.\nFor latent variable models, it is often sufficient to select the latent variables for X whilst collapsing the model variables. For example, in the specific case of mixture models and topic models, approximating the component labels allows for the marginalisation of the cluster parameters (topics allocations) and mixing proportions. This allowed Sung et al. [2008] to derive a general form for latent variable models, though our formulation is general to any conjugate exponential graph."

      "text" : "Sato [2001] and Hoffman et al. [2012] showed that the VBEM procedure performs gradient ascent in the space of the natural parameters. Using the KLC bound to collapse the problem, gradient methods seem a natural choice for optimisation, since there are fewer parameters to deal with, and we have shown that computation of the gradients is straightforward (the variational update equations contain the model gradients). It turns out that the KLC bound is particularly amenable to Riemannian or natural gradient methods, because the information geometry of the exponential family distrubution(s), over which we are optimising, leads to a simple expression for the natural gradient. Previous investigations of natural gradients for variational Bayes [Honkela et al., 2010, Kuusela et al., 2009] required the inversion of the Fisher information at every step (ours does not), and also used VBEM steps for some parameters and Riemannian optimisation for other variables. The collapsed nature of the KLC bound means that these VBEM steps are unnecessary: the bound can be computed by parameterizing the dis-\ntribution of only one set of variables (q(Z)) whilst the implicit distribution of the other variables is given in terms of the first distribution and the data by equation (5).\nWe optimize the lower bound LKL with respect to the parameters of the approximating distribution of the non-collapsed variables. We showed in section 2 that the gradient of the KLC bound is given by the gradient of the standard MF variational bound, after an update of the collapsed variables. It is clear from their definition that the same is true of the natural gradients."

(14)\nFor exponential family distributions, this reduces to ∇2θψ(θ), where ψ is the lognormaliser. Further, for exponential family distributions, the Fisher information in the canonical parameters (θ) and that in the expectation parameters (η) are reciprocal, and we also have G(θ) = ∂η/∂θ.

Full details of the algorithm derivation are given in the supplementary material. A neat feature is that we can make use of the discussion above to derive an expression for the natural gradient without a matrix inverse.\nIn Honkela et al. [2010] data are drawn from a mixture of five two-dimensional Gaussians with equal weights, each with unit spherical covariance. The centers of the components are at (0, 0) and (±R,±R). R is varied from 1 (almost completely overlapping) to 5 (completely separate). The model is initialised with eight components with an uninformative prior over the mixing proportions: the optimisation procedure is left to select an appropriate number of components.\n3We empirically evaluated a line-search procedure, but found that in most cases that Wolfe-Powell conditions were met after a single step of unit length.\nSung et al. [2008] reported that their collapsed method led to improved convergence over VBEM. Since our objective is identical, though our optimisation procedure different, we devised a metric for measuring the efficacy of our algorithms which also accounts for their propensity to fall into local minima. Using many randomised restarts, we measured the average number of iterations taken to reach the best-known optimum. If the algorithm converged at a lesser optimum, those iterations were included in the denomiator, but we didn’t increment the numerator when computing the average. We compared three different conjugate gradient approaches and standard VBEM (which is also steepest ascent on the KLC bound) using 500 restarts.\nTable 1 shows the number of iterations required (on average) to come within 10 nats of the best known solution for three different conjugate-gradient methods and VBEM.

The sampler can suffer from particularly slow convergence due to the large size of the problem, which has six million latent variables for the data considered here. We implemented a variational version of their model and optimised it using VBEM and our collapsed Riemannian method. We applied the model to data described in Xu et al. [2010], a study of human microRNA. The model was initialised using four random initial conditions, and optimised using standard VBEM and the conjugate gradient versions of the algorithm. The Polack-Ribiére conjugate method performed very poorly for this problem, often giving negative conjugation: we omit it here. The solutions found for the other algorithms were all fairly close, with bounds coming within 60 nats. The VBEM method was dramatically outperformed by the Fletcher-Reeves and HestenesSteifel methods: it took 4600±20 iterations to converge, whilst the conjugate methods took only 268± 4 and 265± 1 iterations to converge. At about 8 seconds per iteration, our collapsed Riemannian method requires around forty minutes, whilst VBEM takes almost eleven hours.

We have provided a succinct derivation of these bounds, unifying several strands of work and laying the foundations for much wider application of this approach.\nWhen the collapsed variables are updated in the standard MF bound the KLC bound is identical to the MF bound in value and gradient. Sato [2001] has shown that coordinate ascent of the MF bound (as proscribed by VBEM updates) is equivalent to steepest\nascent of the MF bound using natural gradients. This implies that standard variational inference is also performing steepest ascent on the KLC bound. This equivalence between natural gradients and the VBEM update equations means our method is quickly implementable for any model where the mean field update equations have been computed. It is only necessary to determine which variables to collapse using a d-separation test. Importantly this implies our approach can readily be incorporated in automated inference engines such as that provided by infer.net [Minka et al., 2010]. We’d like to emphasise the ease with which the method can be applied: we have provided derivations of equivalencies of the bounds and gradients which should enable collapsed conjugate optimisation of any existing mean field algorithm, with minimal changes to the software. Indeed our own implementations (see supplementary material) use just a few lines of code to switch between the VBEM and conjugate methods.\nThe improved performance arises from the curvature of the KLC bound. We have shown that it is always less negative than that of the original variational bound allowing much larger steps in the variational parameters as King and Lawrence [2006] suggested. This also provides a gateway to second-order optimisation, which could prove even faster.\nWe provided empirical evidence of the performance increases that are possible using our method in three models. In a thorough exploration of the convergence properties of a mixture of Gaussians model, we concluded that a conjugate Riemannian algorithm can find solutions that are not found with standard VBEM. In a large LDA model, we found that performance can be improved many times over that of the VBEM method. In the BitSeq model for differential expression of genes transcripts we showed that very large improvements in performance are possible for models with huge numbers of latent variables."

The integrals result in\nLKL = − ND\n2 ln(2π) + lnRDi(α)− lnRDi(α′)\n+K lnRGW (S0, ν0, κ0)− K∑ k=1 lnRGW (Sk, νk, κk) +HL\n(24)\nwhere we have defined\nαk = α+ r̂k κk = κ0 + r̂k\nmk = (κ0m0 + ȳk)/κk νk = ν0 + r̂k\nSk = S0 + Ck + κ0m0m > 0 − κkmkm>k\n(25)\nand α′ represents a vector containing each αk. Some simplification of (24) leads to\nLKL = K∑ k=1 { ln Γ(αk)− D2 lnκk − νk 2 ln |Sk|\n+ D∑ d=1 ln Γ((νk + 1− d)/2) } +HL + const.\n(26)\nwhere const. contains terms independent of r. Equations (25) are similar to the update equations for the approximating distributions in the VBEM methodology [see e.g. Bishop, 2006]. However, for our model they are simply intermediate variables, representing combinations of the true variational parameters r, the data, and the model prior parameters. When optimizing the model with respect to the variational parameters, the dependency of these intermediate variables on r is not ignored as it would be in MF variational approach.\nThe gradient of the MV bound (26) with respect to the parameters r is given by\n∂LKL ∂rnk =− D2 κ −1 k − 1 2 ln |Sk|+ ψ(αk)− ln rnk\n− νk2 (yn −mk) >S−1k (yn −mk))\n+ 12 D∑ d=1 ψ((νk + 1− d)/2)− 1.\n(27)\nTaking a step in this direction (in the valiables γ) yields exactly the VB-E step associated with the mean-field bound. the gradient in r is the natural gradient in γ (see paper section 4.1)."

Each word is associated with a latent variable `dn, which assigns the word to a topic, thus `dn ∈ {0, 1}K .

We assume a symmetrical prior distribution over topics in each document p(θd) = Dir(θd|α), and similarly for words within topics. p(φk) = Dir(φk|β).\nThe LDA generative model states that for each word, first the associated topic is drawn from the topic proportions for the document, and then the word is drawn from the selected topic.\np(`dn|θd) = K∏ k=1 θ`dnkdk\np(wdn|`dn, φ) = K∏ k=1 V∏ v=1 φwdnv`dnkkv\n(28)"

We assume that the experiment consists of a pile of RNA fragments, where the abundance of fragments from transcript Tm in the assay is θm. The sequencer then selects a fragment at random from the pile, such that the probability of picking a fragment corresponding to transcript Tm is θm. Introducing a convenient membership vector `n for each read, we can write\np(L|θ) = N∏ n=1 M∏ m=1 θ`nmm (34)\nwhere `nm ∈ {0, 1} is a binary variable which indicates whether the nth fragment came from the mth transcript (`nm = 1) and is subject to ∑M m=1 `nm = 1. We use L to represent the collection of all alignment variables. Both θ and L are variables to be inferred, with θ the main object of interest. Writing the collection of all reads as R = {rn}Nn=1, the likelihood of a set of alignments L is\np(R|T,L) = N∏ n=1 p(rn|Tm)`nm (35)\nwhere Tm represents the mth transcript, T represents the transcriptome. The values of p(rn|Tm) can be computed before performing inference in θ since we are assuming a known transcriptome.

Our approach is very general and is easily applied to any model where the mean field update equations have been derived. Empirically we show significant speed-ups for probabilistic inference using our bound.",
