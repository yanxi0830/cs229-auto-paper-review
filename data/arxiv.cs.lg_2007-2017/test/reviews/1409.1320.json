MSSVM properly accounts for the uncertainty of hidden variables, and can significantly outperform the previously proposed latent structured SVM (LSSVM; Yu &amp; Joachims (2009)) and other state-of-art methods, especially when that uncertainty is large. Our method also results in a smoother objective function, making gradient-based optimization of MSSVMs converge significantly faster than for LSSVMs. We also show that our method consistently outperforms hidden conditional random fields (HCRFs; Quattoni et al. (2007)) on both simulated and real-world datasets. Furthermore, we propose a unified framework that includes both our and several other existing methods as special cases, and provides insights into the comparison of different models in practice.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Sep 2014 05:06:34 GMT  (381kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1320v1", "Accepted by the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2014). 12 pages version with supplement"], ["v2", "Fri, 5 Sep 2014 21:13:36 GMT  (379kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1320v2", "Accepted by the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2014). 12 pages version with supplement"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2014). 12 pages version with supplement", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["wei ping", "qiang liu", "alexander t ihler"], "accepted": true, "id": "1409.1320"}
