It is well known in the signal processing community that, in case of heavy-tailed non-Gaussian noise corruption, $\\ell_1$ distortion is a more suitable metric for data fidelity. Dictionary based image denoising algorithms existing in the literature are typically aimed at minimizing the $\\ell_2$ distortion metric, and hence not suitable for suppressing non-Gaussian or impulsive noise. In this paper, we develop a dictionary learning algorithm by minimizing the $\\ell_1$ error. The proposed algorithm exploits the idea of iterative minimization of suitably weighted $\\ell_2$ error. We refer to this algorithm as robust dictionary learning (RDL). We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm results in higher atom detection rate compared to the state-of-the-art $K$-SVD algorithm, both in case of Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise contamination. For real images, we observe clear superiority of the proposed RDL algorithm over its $\\ell_2$ based counterpart, namely the $K$-SVD algorithm, in terms of the quality of denoised output.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 26 Aug 2014 07:23:04 GMT  (370kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0311v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 3 Mar 2015 04:38:37 GMT  (237kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0311v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["subhadip mukherjee", "rupam basu", "chandra sekhar seelamantula"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.0311"}
