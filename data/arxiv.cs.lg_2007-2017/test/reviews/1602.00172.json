A smile recognition test accuracy of 99.45% is achieved for the Denver Intensity of Spontaneous Facial Action (DISFA) database, significantly outperforming existing approaches based on hand-crafted features with accuracies ranging from 65.55% to 79.67%. The novelty of this approach includes a comprehensive model selection of the architecture parameters, allowing to find an appropriate architecture for each expression such as smile. This is feasible because all experiments were run on a Tesla K40c GPU, allowing a speedup of factor 10 over traditional computations on a CPU.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 30 Jan 2016 23:59:04 GMT  (68kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00172v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 25 Jul 2017 04:46:01 GMT  (68kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00172v2", "Proceedings of the 12th Conference on Uncertainty Modelling in Knowledge Engineering and Decision Making (FLINS 2016)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["patrick o glauner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.00172"}
