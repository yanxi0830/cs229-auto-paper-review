There is a growing interest in developing automatic mechanisms for identifying the properties of a seismic event. One main motivation is the ability have a reliable identification of man-made explosions. The availability of multiple high-dimensional observations has increased the use of machine learning techniques in a variety of fields. In this work, we propose to use a kernel-fusion based dimensionality reduction framework for generating meaningful seismic representations from raw data. The proposed method is tested on 2023 events that were recorded in Israel and in Jordan. The method achieves promising results in classification of event type as well as in estimating the location of the event. The proposed fusion and dimensionality reduction tools may be applied to other types of geophysical data.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Jun 2017 13:27:28 GMT  (2291kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01750v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ofir lindenbaum", "yuri bregman", "neta rabin", "amir averbuch"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.01750"}
