First, we adopt a low rank representation (LRR) model to learn a powerful representation of the spectral response. Then, graph regularization is incorporated into the LRR model to capture the local structure information and the nonlinear property of the remote-sensing data. Since it is easy to acquire the rich satellite-retrieval results, we use them as a baseline to construct the graph. Finally, the learned feature representation is feeded into support vector machine (SVM) to retrieve AOD. Experiments are conducted on two widely used data sets acquired by different sensors, and the experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve superior performance compared to the physical models and other state-of-the-art empirical models.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Feb 2016 15:31:19 GMT  (2785kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06818v1", "16 pages, 6 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 7 Mar 2016 16:03:39 GMT  (2283kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06818v2", "16 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yubao sun", "renlong hang", "qingshan liu", "fuping zhu", "hucheng pei"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.06818"}
