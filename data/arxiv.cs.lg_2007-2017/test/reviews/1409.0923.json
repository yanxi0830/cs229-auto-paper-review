The proposed similarity measure is invariant to large differences in some dimensions in the feature space. The proposed metric is proved mathematically to be a metric. To test its viability for different applications, the KNN used the proposed metric for classifying test examples chosen from a number of real datasets. Compared to some other well known metrics, the experimental results show that the proposed metric is a promising distance measure for the KNN classifier with strong potential for a wide range of applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Sep 2014 23:45:29 GMT  (134kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0923v1", "(ISSN: 1545-1003).this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "(ISSN: 1545-1003).this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ahmad basheer hassanat"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.0923"}
