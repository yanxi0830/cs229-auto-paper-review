In this work, we appeal to kernels over combinatorial structures, such as sequences and graphs, to derive appropriate neural operations. We introduce a class of deep recurrent neural operations and formally characterize their associated kernel spaces. Our recurrent modules compare the input to virtual reference objects (cf. filters in CNN) via the kernels. Similar to traditional neural operations, these reference objects are parameterized and directly optimized in end-to-end training. We empirically evaluate the proposed class of neural architectures on standard applications such as language modeling and molecular graph regression, achieving state-of-the-art or competitive results across these applications. We also draw connections to existing architectures such as LSTMs.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 May 2017 03:58:10 GMT  (539kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09037v1", "to appear at ICML 2017; includes additional discussions"], ["v2", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 14:34:24 GMT  (1618kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09037v2", "extended version of ICML 2017 camera ready"], ["v3", "Mon, 30 Oct 2017 13:56:23 GMT  (1618kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09037v3", "extended version of ICML 2017 camera ready"]], "COMMENTS": "to appear at ICML 2017; includes additional discussions", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["tao lei", "wengong jin", "regina barzilay", "tommi s jaakkola"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.09037"}
