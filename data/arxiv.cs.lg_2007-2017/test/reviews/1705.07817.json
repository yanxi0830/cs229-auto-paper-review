We investigate two different fashions in the literature to deal with this problem: \"hierNet\" and structural-sparsity regularization, and study their connections, then we propose a primal-dual proximal algorithm based on epigraphical projection to optimize the learning problem. The experimental setting first highlight the improvement of the proposed procedure compare to state-of-the-art methods based on FISTA or ADMM and second we provide comparisons between the different hierarchical penalization. The experiments are conducted both on the synthetic and real data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 May 2017 15:53:22 GMT  (919kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07817v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 3 Aug 2017 15:05:53 GMT  (612kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07817v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["mingyuan jiu", "nelly pustelnik", "stefan janaqi", "meriam chebre", "philippe ricoux"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07817"}
