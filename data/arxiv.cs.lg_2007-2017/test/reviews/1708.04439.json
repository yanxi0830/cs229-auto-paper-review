This approach consists of three phases: feature extraction, feature enhancement, and summary generation, which work together to assimilate core information and generate a coherent, understandable summary. We are exploring various features to improve the set of sentences selected for the summary, and are using a Restricted Boltzmann Machine to enhance and abstract those features to improve resultant accuracy without losing any important information. The sentences are scored based on those enhanced features and an extractive summary is constructed. Experimentation carried out on several articles demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Aug 2017 09:08:50 GMT  (158kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04439v1", "Accepted to 18th International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to 18th International Conference on Computational Linguistics and Intelligent Text Processing", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["sukriti verma", "vagisha nidhi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.04439"}
