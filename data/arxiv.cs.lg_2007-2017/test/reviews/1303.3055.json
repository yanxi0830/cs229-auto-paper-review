We introduce an algorithm whose regret with respect to any policy in a comparison class grows as the square root of the number of rounds of the game, provided the transition probabilities satisfy a uniform mixing condition. Our approach is efficient as long as the comparison class is polynomial and we can compute expectations over sample paths for each policy. Designing an efficient algorithm with small regret for the general case remains an open problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 Mar 2013 23:25:37 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3055v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["yasin abbasi-yadkori", "peter l bartlett", "varun kanade", "yevgeny seldin", "csaba szepesv\u00e1ri"], "accepted": true, "id": "1303.3055"}
