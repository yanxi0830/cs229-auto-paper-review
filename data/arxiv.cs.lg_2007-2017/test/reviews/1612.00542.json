Because of its mostly manual nature, variability in mass appearance, and low signal-to-noise ratio, a significant number of breast masses are missed or misdiagnosed. In this work, we present how Convolutional Neural Networks can be used to directly classify pre-segmented breast masses in mammograms as benign or malignant, using a combination of transfer learning, careful pre-processing and data augmentation to overcome limited training data. We achieve state-of-the-art results on the DDSM dataset, surpassing human performance, and show interpretability of our model.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 02:06:15 GMT  (4891kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00542v1", "NIPS 2016 ML4HC Workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS 2016 ML4HC Workshop", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["daniel l\\'evy", "arzav jain"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.00542"}
