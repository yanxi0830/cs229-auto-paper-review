Our algorithm learns the Mahalanobis metric based on the gradient outer product matrix $\\boldsymbol{G}$ of the regression function (automatically adapting to the effective rank of this matrix), while simultaneously bounding the regret ---on the same data sequence--- in terms of the spectrum of $\\boldsymbol{G}$. As a preliminary step in our analysis, we generalize a nonparametric online learning algorithm by Hazan and Megiddo by enabling it to compete against functions whose Lipschitzness is measured with respect to an arbitrary Mahalanobis metric.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 May 2017 16:58:13 GMT  (20kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07853v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 23 Oct 2017 15:51:33 GMT  (166kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07853v2", "To appear in NIPS 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ilja kuzborskij", "nicol\\`o cesa-bianchi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.07853"}
