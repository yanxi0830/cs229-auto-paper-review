While deep neural networks have reached maturity for image understanding tasks, we are still exploring network topologies and features to handle the richer environment of video clips. Here, we tackle the problem of multiple velocities in action recognition, and provide state-of-the-art results for gesture recognition, on known and new collected datasets. We further provide the training steps for our semi-supervised network, suited to learn from huge unlabeled datasets with only a fraction of labeled examples.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Mar 2016 15:26:26 GMT  (2955kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06829v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["otkrist gupta", "dan raviv", "ramesh raskar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.06829"}
