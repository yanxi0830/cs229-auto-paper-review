In particular, we consider the following setting: given a directed acyclic graph $G$ on $p$ vertices corresponding to variables, the non-zero entries of the extracted principal component must coincide with vertices lying along a path in $G$.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 03:37:36 GMT  (2565kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02344v1", "12 pages, 5 figures, In Proceedings of International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2015"], ["v2", "Fri, 19 Jun 2015 02:27:49 GMT  (2563kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02344v2", "12 pages, 5 figures, In Proceedings of International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 5 figures, In Proceedings of International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT math.OC", "authors": ["megasthenis asteris", "anastasios kyrillidis", "alexandros g dimakis", "han-gyol yi", "bharath chandrasekaran"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.02344"}
