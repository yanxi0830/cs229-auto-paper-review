We show that AUC is a smooth function, in expectation, if the distributions of the positive and negative data points obey a jointly normal distribution. The practical performance of this algorithm is compared to three prominent Bayesian optimization methods and random search. The presented numerical results show that DFO-TR surpasses Bayesian optimization and random search on various black-box optimization problem, such as maximizing AUC and hyperparameter tuning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Mar 2017 19:00:18 GMT  (490kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06925v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hiva ghanbari", "katya scheinberg"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06925"}
