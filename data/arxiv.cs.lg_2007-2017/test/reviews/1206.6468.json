Although able to capture audio spectral structure well, these models neglect the non-stationarity and temporal dynamics that are important properties of audio. The recently proposed non-negative factorial hidden Markov model (N-FHMM) introduces a temporal dimension and improves source separation performance. However, the factorial nature of this model makes the complexity of inference exponential in the number of sound sources. Here, we present a Bayesian variant of the N-FHMM suited to an efficient variational inference algorithm, whose complexity is linear in the number of sound sources. Our algorithm performs comparably to exact inference in the original N-FHMM but is significantly faster. In typical configurations of the N-FHMM, our method achieves around a 30x increase in speed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (1242kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6468v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SD stat.ML", "authors": ["gautham j mysore", "maneesh sahani"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6468"}
