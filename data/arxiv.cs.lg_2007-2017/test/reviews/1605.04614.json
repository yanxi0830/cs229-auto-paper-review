DeepLearningKit is developed in Metal in order to utilize the GPU efficiently and Swift for integration with applications, e.g. iOS-based mobile apps on iPhone/iPad, tvOS-based apps for the big screen, or OS X desktop applications. The goal is to support using deep learning models trained with popular frameworks such as Caffe, Torch, TensorFlow, Theano, Pylearn, Deeplearning4J and Mocha. Given the massive GPU resources and time required to train Deep Learning models we suggest an App Store like model to distribute and download pretrained and reusable Deep Learning models.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 May 2016 23:19:48 GMT  (3390kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04614v1", "9 pages, 12 figures, open source documentation and code at deeplearningkit.org and github.com/deeplearningkit"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 12 figures, open source documentation and code at deeplearningkit.org and github.com/deeplearningkit", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DC cs.NE", "authors": ["amund tveit", "torbj{\\o}rn morland", "thomas brox r{\\o}st"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.04614"}
