Traditional methods in this category inherently suffer three limitations: 1) they commonly adopt a two-stage scheme where similarity matrix is first constructed, followed by a subsequent hash function learning; 2) these methods are commonly developed on the assumption that data samples with multiple representations are noise-free,which is not practical in real-life applications; 3) they often incur cumbersome training model caused by the neighborhood graph construction using all $N$ points in the database ($O(N)$). In this paper, we motivate the problem of jointly and efficiently training the robust hash functions over data objects with multi-feature representations which may be noise corrupted. To achieve both the robustness and training efficiency, we propose an approach to effectively and efficiently learning low-rank kernelized \\footnote{We use kernelized similarity rather than kernel, as it is not a squared symmetric matrix for data-landmark affinity matrix.} hash functions shared across views. Specifically, we utilize landmark graphs to construct tractable similarity matrices in multi-views to automatically discover neighborhood structure in the data. To learn robust hash functions, a latent low-rank kernel function is used to construct hash functions in order to accommodate linearly inseparable data. In particular, a latent kernelized similarity matrix is recovered by rank minimization on multiple kernel-based similarity matrices. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-view datasets validate the efficacy of our method in the presence of error corruptions.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 Nov 2016 01:21:26 GMT  (262kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05521v1", "Accepted to appear in Image and Vision Computing"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to appear in Image and Vision Computing", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["lin wu", "yang wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.05521"}
