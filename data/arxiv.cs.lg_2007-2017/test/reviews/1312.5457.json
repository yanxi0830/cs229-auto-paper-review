Automated recommendation systems are essential for users to discover music they love and for artists to reach appropriate audience. When manual annotations and user preference data is lacking (e.g. for new artists) these systems must rely on \\emph{content based} methods. Besides powerful machine learning tools for classification and retrieval, a key component for successful recommendation is the \\emph{audio content representation}.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Dec 2013 09:40:03 GMT  (211kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5457v1", "Journal paper.
