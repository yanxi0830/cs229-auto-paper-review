{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "23-Aug-2016", "title": "Infinite-Label Learning with Semantic Output Codes", "abstract": "We develop a new statistical machine learning paradigm, named infinite-label learning, to annotate a data point with more than one relevant labels from a candidate set, which pools both the finite labels observed at training and a potentially infinite number of previously unseen labels. The infinite-label learning fundamentally expands the scope of conventional multi-label learning, and better models the practical requirements in various real-world applications, such as image tagging, ads-query association, and article categorization. However, how can we learn a labeling function that is capable of assigning to a data point the labels omitted from the training set? To answer the question, we seek some clues from the recent work on zero-shot learning, where the key is to represent a class/label by a vector of semantic codes, as opposed to treating them as atomic labels. We validate the infinite-label learning by a PAC bound in theory and some empirical studies on both synthetic and real data.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Aug 2016 19:14:47 GMT  (257kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06608v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Oct 2017 02:47:58 GMT  (322kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06608v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 21 Oct 2017 00:56:08 GMT  (321kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06608v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yang zhang", "rupam acharyya", "ji liu", "boqing gong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.06608"}
