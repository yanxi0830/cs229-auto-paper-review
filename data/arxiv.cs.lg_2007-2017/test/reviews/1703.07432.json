Standard approaches to crowdsourcing view the process of acquiring labeled data separately from the process of learning a classifier from the gathered data. This can give rise to computational and statistical challenges. For example, in most cases there are no known computationally efficient learning algorithms that are robust to the high level of noise that exists in crowdsourced data, and efforts to eliminate noise through voting often require a large number of queries per example.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 21:05:27 GMT  (28kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07432v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 13 Apr 2017 21:21:41 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07432v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["pranjal awasthi", "avrim blum", "nika haghtalab", "yishay mansour"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07432"}
