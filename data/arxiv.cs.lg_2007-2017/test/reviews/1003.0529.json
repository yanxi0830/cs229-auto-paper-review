Our algorithm is a simple iterative scheme with guaranteed convergence, and is \\emph{modular}; by changing the internals of a single subroutine in the algorithm, we can switch cost functions and target spaces easily. In addition to the formal guarantees of convergence, our algorithms are accurate; in most cases, they converge to better quality solutions than existing methods, in comparable time. We expect that this framework will be useful for a number of \\mds variants that have not yet been studied.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Mar 2010 09:11:44 GMT  (147kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0529v1", "18 pages, 7 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 30 Mar 2010 17:21:53 GMT  (145kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0529v2", "18 pages, 7 figures.
