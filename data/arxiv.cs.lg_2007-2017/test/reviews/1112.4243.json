In this framework, both the feature extraction and classification are obtained by solving corresponding convex optimization problem with trace norm regularization. For feature extraction, robust principle component analysis (robust PCA) via minimization a combination of the nuclear norm and the $\\ell_1$-norm is used to extract low-rank features which are robust to white noise and gross corruption for audio segments. These low-rank features are fed to a linear classifier where the weight and bias are learned by solving similar trace norm constrained problems. For this classifier, most methods find the weight and bias in batch-mode learning, which makes them inefficient for large-scale problems. In this paper, we propose an online framework using accelerated proximal gradient method. This framework has a main advantage in memory cost. In addition, as a result of the regularization formulation of matrix classification, the Lipschitz constant was given explicitly, and hence the step size estimation of general proximal gradient method was omitted in our approach. Experiments on real data sets for laugh/non-laugh and applause/non-applause classification indicate that this novel framework is effective and noise robust.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Dec 2011 05:29:18 GMT  (1025kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4243v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.MM", "authors": ["ziqiang shi", "jiqing han", "tieran zheng", "shiwen deng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1112.4243"}
