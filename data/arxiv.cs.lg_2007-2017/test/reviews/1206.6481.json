To reduce the labeling cost of training a classification model for each individual language, it is important to transfer the label knowledge gained from one language to another language by conducting cross language classification. In this paper we develop a novel subspace co-regularized multi-view learning method for cross language text classification. This method is built on parallel corpora produced by machine translation. It jointly minimizes the training error of each classifier in each language while penalizing the distance between the subspace representations of parallel documents. Our empirical study on a large set of cross language text classification tasks shows the proposed method consistently outperforms a number of inductive methods, domain adaptation methods, and multi-view learning methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (154kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6481v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["yuhong guo", "min xiao"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6481"}
