We also extend LHUC to a speaker adaptive training (SAT) framework that leads to more adaptable DNN acoustic model, which can work in both a speaker-dependent and a speaker-independent manner, without the requirement to maintain auxiliary speaker-dependent feature extractors or to introduce significant speaker-dependent changes to the DNN structure. Through a series of experiments on four different speech recognition benchmarks (TED talks, Switchboard, AMI meetings and Aurora4) and over 270 test speakers we show that LHUC in both its test-only and SAT variants results in consistent word error rate reductions ranging from 5% to 23% relative depending on the task and the degree of mismatch between training and test data. In addition we have investigated the effect of the amount of adaptation data per speaker, the quality of adaptation targets when estimating transforms in an unsupervised manner, the complementarity to other adaptation techniques, one-shot adaptation, and an extension to adapting DNNs trained in a sequence discriminative manner.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 Jan 2016 12:33:56 GMT  (474kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02828v1", "13 pages, Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing"], ["v2", "Wed, 13 Jul 2016 17:47:07 GMT  (2236kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02828v2", "14 pages, 9 Tables, 11 Figues in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing, Vol. 24, Num. 8, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.SD", "authors": ["pawel swietojanski", "jinyu li", "steve renals"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.02828"}
