Syntax errors constitute one of the largest classes of errors (34%) in our dataset of student submissions obtained from a MOOC course on edX. The previous techniques for generating automated feed- back on programming assignments have focused on functional correctness and style considerations of student programs. These techniques analyze the program AST of the program and then perform some dynamic and symbolic analyses to compute repair feedback. Unfortunately, it is not possible to generate ASTs for student pro- grams with syntax errors and therefore the previous feedback techniques are not applicable in repairing syntax errors.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Mar 2016 18:43:28 GMT  (328kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06129v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.AI cs.LG cs.SE", "authors": ["sahil bhatia", "rishabh singh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.06129"}
