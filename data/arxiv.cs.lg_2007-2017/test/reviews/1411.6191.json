However, weight updates under Backprop depend on lengthy recursive computations and require separate output and error messages -- features not shared by biological neurons, that are perhaps unnecessary. In this paper, we revisit Backprop and the credit assignment problem. We first decompose Backprop into a collection of interacting learning algorithms; provide regret bounds on the performance of these sub-algorithms; and factorize Backprop's error signals. Using these results, we derive a new credit assignment algorithm for nonparametric regression, Kickback, that is significantly simpler than Backprop. Finally, we provide a sufficient condition for Kickback to follow error gradients, and show that Kickback matches Backprop's performance on real-world regression benchmarks.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 23 Nov 2014 04:58:22 GMT  (317kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6191v1", "7 pages.
