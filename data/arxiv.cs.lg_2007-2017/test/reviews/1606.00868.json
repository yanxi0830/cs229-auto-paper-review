Apart from its intrinsic value as an aggregate statistic, quantification output can also be used to optimize classifier probabilities, thereby increasing classification accuracy. We unify major quantification approaches under a constrained multi-variate regression framework, and use mathematical programming to estimate class proportions for different loss functions. With this modeling approach, we extend existing binary-only quantification approaches to multi-class settings as well. We empirically verify our unified framework by experimenting with several multi-class datasets including the Stanford Sentiment Treebank and CIFAR-10.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 20:42:31 GMT  (530kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00868v1", "9 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["aykut firat"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.00868"}
