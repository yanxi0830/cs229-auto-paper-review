Here, we propose a novel model called Temporal embedding-enhanced convolutional neural Network (TeNet) to learn repeatedly-occurring-yet-hidden structural elements in periodical time-series, called abstract snippets, for predicting future changes. Our model uses convolutional neural networks and embeds a time-series with its potential neighbors in the temporal domain for aligning it to the dominant patterns in the dataset. The model is robust to distortions and misalignments in the temporal domain and demonstrates strong prediction power for periodical time-series.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Feb 2015 04:25:23 GMT  (395kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05113v1", "a submission to kdd 15'"]], "COMMENTS": "a submission to kdd 15'", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["jiajun liu", "kun zhao", "brano kusy", "ji-rong wen", "raja jurdak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.05113"}
