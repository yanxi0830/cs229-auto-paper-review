However, the accuracy of this algorithm heavily depend on the threshold value of d-c. Furthermore, [1] has not provided any efficient way to select the threshold value of d-c, that is, one can have to estimate the value of d_c depend on one's subjective experience. In this paper, based on the data field [2], we propose a new way to automatically extract the threshold value of d_c from the original data set by using the potential entropy of data field. For any data set to be clustered, the most reasonable value of d_c can be objectively calculated from the data set by using our proposed method. The same experiments in [1] are redone with our proposed method on the same experimental data set used in [1], the results of which shows that the problem to calculate the threshold value of d_c in [1] has been solved by using our method.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 18 Jan 2015 05:15:55 GMT  (1260kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04267v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 20 Jan 2015 03:41:28 GMT  (1305kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04267v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["shuliang wang", "dakui wang", "caoyuan li", "yan li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.04267"}
