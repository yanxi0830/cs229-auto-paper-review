However, recent works have shown that models with much smaller number of parameters can also perform just as well. In this work, we introduce the problem of architecture-learning, i.e; learning the architecture of a neural network along with weights. We introduce a new trainable parameter called tri-state ReLU, which helps in eliminating unnecessary neurons. We also propose a smooth regularizer which encourages the total number of neurons after elimination to be small. The resulting objective is differentiable and simple to optimize. We experimentally validate our method on both small and large networks, and show that it can learn models with a considerably small number of parameters without affecting prediction accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 18:26:11 GMT  (104kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05497v1", "ICLR 2016 submission"], ["v2", "Tue, 2 Aug 2016 11:46:48 GMT  (101kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05497v2", "BMVC 2016 ; Title modified from 'Learning the Architecture of Deep Neural Networks'"]], "COMMENTS": "ICLR 2016 submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["suraj srinivas", "r venkatesh babu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.05497"}
