The algorithm is shown to be near-optimal for all but O(N log^2 N) time-steps with high probability. Infinite classes are also considered where we show that compactness is a key criterion for determining the existence of uniform sample-complexity bounds. A matching lower bound is given for the finite case.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Aug 2013 11:39:06 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.4828v1", "16 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["tor lattimore", "marcus hutter", "peter sunehag"], "accepted": true, "id": "1308.4828"}
