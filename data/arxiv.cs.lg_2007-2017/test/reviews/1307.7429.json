In this paper, we provide a general schematic of the architecture of participation anticipating system in presidential election by using KNN, Classification Tree and Na\\\"ive Bayes and tools orange based on crisp which had hopeful output. To test and assess the proposed model, we begin to use the case study by selecting 100 qualified persons who attend in 11th presidential election of Islamic republic of Iran and anticipate their participation in Kohkiloye &amp; Boyerahmad. We indicate that KNN can perform anticipation and classification processes with high accuracy in compared with two other algorithms to anticipate participation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Jul 2013 01:15:25 GMT  (407kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7429v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.LG", "authors": ["amin babazadeh sangar", "seyyed reza khaze", "laya ebrahimi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.7429"}
