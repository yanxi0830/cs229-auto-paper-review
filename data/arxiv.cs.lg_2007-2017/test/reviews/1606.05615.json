{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "17-Jun-2016", "title": "Guaranteed Non-convex Optimization: Submodular Maximization over Continuous Domains", "abstract": "\\textit{Submodular continuous functions} are a category of (generally) non-convex/non-concave functions with a wide spectrum of applications. We characterize these functions and demonstrate that they can be maximized efficiently with approximation guarantees. Specifically, I) for monotone submodular continuous functions with an additional diminishing returns property, we propose a \\texttt{Frank-Wolfe} style algorithm with $(1-1/e)$-approximation, and sub-linear convergence rate; II) for general non-monotone submodular continuous functions, we propose a \\texttt{DoubleGreedy} algorithm with $1/3$-approximation. Submodular continuous functions naturally find applications in various real-world settings, including influence and revenue maximization with continuous assignments, sensor energy management, multi-resolution data summarization, facility location, etc. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms efficiently generate superior solutions in terms of empirical objectives compared to baseline algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 18:15:52 GMT  (354kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05615v1", "20 pages, 9 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 20 Sep 2016 16:21:08 GMT  (358kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05615v2", "26 pages, 9 figures"], ["v3", "Tue, 6 Dec 2016 15:53:40 GMT  (358kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05615v3", "26 pages, 9 figures"], ["v4", "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 16:30:15 GMT  (364kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05615v4", "To appear in the 20th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS) 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages, 9 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["andrew an bian", "baharan mirzasoleiman", "joachim m buhmann", "reas krause"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.05615"}
