In particular, one key challenge to image and video classification has been that the computational cost of image processing scales linearly with the number of pixels in the image or video. Here we present an intelligent machine (the \"active categorical classifier,\" or ACC) that is inspired by the saccadic movements of the eye, and is capable of classifying images by selectively scanning only a portion of the image. We harness evolutionary computation to optimize the ACC on the MNIST hand-written digit classification task, and provide a proof-of-concept that the ACC works on noisy multi-class data. We further analyze the ACC and demonstrate its ability to classify images after viewing only a fraction of the pixels, and provide insight on future research paths to further improve upon the ACC presented here.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 27 Mar 2016 16:36:43 GMT  (585kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08233v1", "10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to PPSN 2016 conference"], ["v2", "Thu, 16 Jun 2016 21:00:53 GMT  (292kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08233v2", "10 pages, 5 figures, to appear in PPSN 2016 conference proceedings"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to PPSN 2016 conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["randal s olson", "jason h moore", "christoph adami"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.08233"}
