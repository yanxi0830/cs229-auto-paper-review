In this paper, we use deep learning methods, and in particular employ the multilayer perceptron, to build an algorithm that can predict flow pattern in twophase flow from fluid properties and pipe conditions. The preliminary results show excellent performance when compared with classical methods of flow pattern prediction.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 May 2017 03:11:30 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07117v1", "Part of DM4OG 2017 proceedings (arXiv:1705.03451)"]], "COMMENTS": "Part of DM4OG 2017 proceedings (arXiv:1705.03451)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["mohammadmehdi ezzatabadipour", "parth singh", "melvin d robinson", "pablo guillen-rondon", "carlos torres"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07117"}
