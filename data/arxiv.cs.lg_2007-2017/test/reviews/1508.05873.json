The nonnegative least-mean-square (NNLMS) algorithm and its variants allow to address this problem in an online manner. A nonnegative least mean fourth (NNLMF) algorithm has been recently proposed to improve the performance of these algorithms in cases where the measurement noise is not Gaussian. This paper provides a first theoretical analysis of the stochastic behavior of the NNLMF algorithm for stationary Gaussian inputs and slow learning. Simulation results illustrate the accuracy of the proposed analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Aug 2015 16:26:38 GMT  (468kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05873v1", "11 pages, 8 figures, submitted for publication"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 8 figures, submitted for publication", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NA cs.LG", "authors": ["jingen ni", "jian yang", "jie chen", "c\\'edric richard", "jos\\'e carlos m bermudez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.05873"}
