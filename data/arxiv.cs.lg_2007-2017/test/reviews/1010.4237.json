{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Oct-2010", "title": "Robust PCA via Outlier Pursuit", "abstract": "Singular Value Decomposition (and Principal Component Analysis) is one of the most widely used techniques for dimensionality reduction: successful and efficiently computable, it is nevertheless plagued by a well-known, well-documented sensitivity to outliers. Recent work has considered the setting where each point has a few arbitrarily corrupted components. Yet, in applications of SVD or PCA such as robust collaborative filtering or bioinformatics, malicious agents, defective genes, or simply corrupted or contaminated experiments may effectively yield entire points that are completely corrupted.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Oct 2010 16:05:28 GMT  (169kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.4237v1", "24 pages, appeared in NIPS 2010"], ["v2", "Fri, 31 Dec 2010 18:36:49 GMT  (172kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.4237v2", "26 pages, appeared in NIPS 2010. v2 has typos corrected, some re-writing. results essentially unchanged"]], "COMMENTS": "24 pages, appeared in NIPS 2010", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IT math.IT stat.ML", "authors": ["huan xu", "constantine caramanis", "sujay sanghavi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1010.4237"}
