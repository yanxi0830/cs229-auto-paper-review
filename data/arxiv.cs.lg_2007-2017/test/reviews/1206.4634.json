Major challenges in computer-based Sumi-e simulation are to abstract complex scene information and draw smooth and natural brush strokes. To automatically find such strokes, we propose to model the brush as a reinforcement learning agent, and learn desired brush-trajectories by maximizing the sum of rewards in the policy search framework. We also provide elaborate design of actions, states, and rewards tailored for a Sumi-e agent. The effectiveness of our proposed approach is demonstrated through simulated Sumi-e experiments.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:14:24 GMT  (4113kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4634v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GR stat.ML", "authors": ["ning xie 0003", "hirotaka hachiya", "masashi sugiyama"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4634"}
