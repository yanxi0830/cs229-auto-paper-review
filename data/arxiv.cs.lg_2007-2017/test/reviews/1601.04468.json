We present an application to discriminative reranking in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) where the learning algorithm only has access to a 1-BLEU loss evaluation of a predicted translation instead of obtaining a gold standard reference translation. In our experiment bandit feedback is obtained by evaluating BLEU on reference translations without revealing them to the algorithm. This can be thought of as a simulation of interactive machine translation where an SMT system is personalized by a user who provides single point feedback to predicted translations. Our experiments show that our approach improves translation quality and is comparable to approaches that employ more informative feedback in learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jan 2016 11:09:02 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04468v1", "In Proceedings of MT Summit XV, 2015.
