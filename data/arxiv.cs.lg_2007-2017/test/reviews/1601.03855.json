We propose a new algorithm called Relative Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation (REX3) to handle the adversarial utility-based formulation of this problem. This algorithm is a non-trivial extension of the Exponential-weight algorithm for Exploration and Exploitation (EXP3) algorithm. We prove a finite time expected regret upper bound of order O(sqrt(K ln(K)T)) for this algorithm and a general lower bound of order omega(sqrt(KT)). At the end, we provide experimental results using real data from information retrieval applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 Jan 2016 09:50:07 GMT  (1637kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03855v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["pratik gajane", "tanguy urvoy", "fabrice cl\u00e9rot"], "accepted": true, "id": "1601.03855"}
