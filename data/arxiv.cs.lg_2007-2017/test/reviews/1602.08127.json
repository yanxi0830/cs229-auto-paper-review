In this paper, we propose a robust auto-encoder model that preserves the geometric relationships of high-dimensional data sets in Hamming space. This is done by considering a noise-removing function in a region surrounding the manifold where the training data points lie. This function is defined with the property that it projects the data points near the manifold into the manifold wisely, and we approximate this function by its first order approximation. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves better than state-of-the-art results on three large scale high dimensional data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Feb 2016 21:47:16 GMT  (2808kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08127v1", "Submitting to journal (TPAMI). 17 pages, 11 figures.
