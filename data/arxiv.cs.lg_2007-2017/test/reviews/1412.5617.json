Addressing learning from heterogeneous data in its full generality is a challenging problem. In this paper, we adopt instead a model in which data is observed through heterogeneous noise, where the noise level reflects the quality of the data source. We study how to use stochastic gradient algorithms to learn in this model. Our study is motivated by two concrete examples where this problem arises naturally: learning with local differential privacy based on data from multiple sources with different privacy requirements, and learning from data with labels of variable quality.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Dec 2014 21:15:06 GMT  (42kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5617v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["shuang song", "kamalika chaudhuri", "anand d sarwate"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.5617"}
