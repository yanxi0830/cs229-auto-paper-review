It is shown that for any constant factor $\\beta &gt; 1$, selecting $\\beta k$ cluster centers by $D^\\ell$ sampling yields a constant-factor approximation to the optimal clustering with $k$ centers, in expectation and without conditions on the dataset. This result extends the previously known $O(\\log k)$ guarantee for the case $\\beta = 1$ to the constant-factor bi-criteria regime. It also improves upon an existing constant-factor bi-criteria result that holds only with constant probability.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 May 2016 23:41:55 GMT  (50kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04986v1", "17 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CG", "authors": ["dennis wei"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.04986"}
