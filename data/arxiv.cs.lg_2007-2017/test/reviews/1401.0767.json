Here we propose a principled framework for directly constructing ensemble learning methods from kernel methods. Unlike previous studies showing the equivalence between boosting and support vector machines (SVMs), which needs a translation procedure, we show that it is possible to design boosting-like procedure to solve the SVM optimization problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 4 Jan 2014 02:28:48 GMT  (542kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0767v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["chunhua shen", "fayao liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.0767"}
