The DPC-Q leverages Q-Learning to identify the sub-optimal pattern of power allocation, which strives to maximize femtocell capacity, while guaranteeing macrocell capacity level in an underlay cognitive setting. We propose two different approaches for the DPC-Q algorithm: namely, independent, and cooperative. In the former, femtocells learn independently from each other while in the latter, femtocells share some information during learning in order to enhance their performance. Simulation results show that the independent approach is capable of mitigating the interference generated by the femtocells on macro-users. Moreover, the results show that cooperation enhances the performance of the femtocells in terms of speed of convergence, fairness and aggregate femtocell capacity.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 18 Mar 2012 10:30:54 GMT  (168kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3935v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GT", "authors": ["hussein saad", "amr mohamed", "tamer elbatt"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.3935"}
