Recent advances in variational inference allow such algorithms to scale to high dimensions. However, a central question remains: How to specify an expressive variational distribution which maintains efficient computation? To address this, we develop hierarchical variational models. In a hierarchical variational model, the variational approximation is augmented with a prior on its parameters, such that the latent variables are conditionally independent given this shared structure. This preserves the computational efficiency of the original approximation, while admitting hierarchically complex distributions for both discrete and continuous latent variables. We study hierarchical variational models on a variety of deep discrete latent variable models. Hierarchical variational models generalize other expressive variational distributions and maintains higher fidelity to the posterior.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 Nov 2015 19:01:48 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02386v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 30 May 2016 21:16:38 GMT  (213kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02386v2", "Appears in International Conference on Machine Learning, 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO stat.ME", "authors": ["rajesh ranganath", "dustin tran", "david m blei"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.02386"}
