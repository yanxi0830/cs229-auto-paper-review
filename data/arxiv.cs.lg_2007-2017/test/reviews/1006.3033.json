The primary mathematical tool employed in these methods is the notion of the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. However, so far, the emphasis has been on batch techniques. It is only recently, that online techniques have been considered in the context of adaptive signal processing tasks. Moreover, these efforts have only been focussed on and real valued data sequences. To the best of our knowledge, no kernel-based strategy has been developed, so far, that is able to deal with complex valued signals. In this paper, we present a general framework to attack the problem of adaptive filtering of complex signals, using either real reproducing kernels, taking advantage of a technique called \\textit{complexification} of real RKHSs, or complex reproducing kernels, highlighting the use of the complex gaussian kernel. In order to derive gradients of operators that need to be defined on the associated complex RKHSs, we employ the powerful tool of Wirtinger's Calculus, which has recently attracted much attention in the signal processing community. Writinger's calculus simplifies computations and offers an elegant tool for treating complex signals. To this end, in this paper, the notion of Writinger's calculus is extended, for the first time, to include complex RKHSs and use it to derive several realizations of the Complex Kernel Least-Mean-Square (CKLMS) algorithm. Experiments verify that the CKLMS offers significant performance improvements over the traditional complex LMS or Widely Linear complex LMS (WL-LMS) algorithms, when dealing with nonlinearities.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Jun 2010 17:09:01 GMT  (498kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.3033v1", "30 pages (double spaced), 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Trans.
