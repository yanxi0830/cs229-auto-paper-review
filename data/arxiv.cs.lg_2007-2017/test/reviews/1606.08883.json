We focus on the impact of the adversarial agents on the performance of consensus-based non-Bayesian learning, where non-faulty agents combine local learning updates with consensus primitives. In particular, we consider the scenario where an unknown subset of agents suffer Byzantine faults -- agents suffering Byzantine faults behave arbitrarily. Two different learning rules are proposed.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 20:50:08 GMT  (45kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08883v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.LG", "authors": ["lili su", "nitin h vaidya"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.08883"}
