We prove a new PAC bound on the sample-complexity of model-based value iteration algorithm in the presence of the generative model, which indicates that for an MDP with N state-action pairs and the discount factor \\gamma\\in[0,1) only O(N\\log(N/\\delta)/((1-\\gamma)^3\\epsilon^2)) samples are required to find an \\epsilon-optimal estimation of the action-value function with the probability 1-\\delta. We also prove a matching lower bound of \\Theta (N\\log(N/\\delta)/((1-\\gamma)^3\\epsilon^2)) on the sample complexity of estimating the optimal action-value function by every RL algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first matching result on the sample complexity of estimating the optimal (action-) value function in which the upper bound matches the lower bound of RL in terms of N, \\epsilon, \\delta and 1/(1-\\gamma). Also, both our lower bound and our upper bound significantly improve on the state-of-the-art in terms of 1/(1-\\gamma).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (468kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6461v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["mohammad gheshlaghi azar", "r\u00e9mi munos", "bert kappen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6461"}
