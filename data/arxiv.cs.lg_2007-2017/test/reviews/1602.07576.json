By convolving over groups larger than the translation group, G-CNNs build representations that are equivariant to these groups, which makes it possible to greatly increase the degree of parameter sharing. We show how G-CNNs can be implemented with negligible computational overhead for discrete groups such as the group of translations, reflections and rotations by multiples of 90 degrees. G-CNNs achieve state of the art results on rotated MNIST and significantly improve over a competitive baseline on augmented and non-augmented CIFAR-10.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 16:17:15 GMT  (105kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07576v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 11 Mar 2016 18:26:26 GMT  (106kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07576v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 3 Jun 2016 10:54:16 GMT  (454kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07576v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["taco cohen", "max welling"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.07576"}
