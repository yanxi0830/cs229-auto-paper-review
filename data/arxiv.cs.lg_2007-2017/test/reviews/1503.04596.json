{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Mar-2015", "title": "Enhanced Image Classification With a Fast-Learning Shallow Convolutional Neural Network", "abstract": "We present a neural network architecture and training method designed to enable very rapid training and low implementation complexity. Due to its training speed and very few tunable parameters, the method has strong potential for embedded hardware applications requiring frequent retraining or online training. The approach is characterized by (a) convolutional filters based on biologically inspired visual processing filters, (b) randomly-valued classifier-stage input weights, (c) use of least squares regression to train the classifier output weights in a single batch, and (d) linear classifier-stage output units. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method as an image classifier, obtaining state-of-the-art results on the MNIST (0.37% error) and NORB-small (2.2%) image classification databases, with very fast training times compared to standard deep network approaches. The network's performance on the Google Street View House Number (SVHN) (4%) database is also competitive with state-of-the art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Mar 2015 10:41:30 GMT  (194kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04596v1", "6 pages, 2 figures, 2015 conference submission"], ["v2", "Wed, 10 Jun 2015 06:26:40 GMT  (187kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04596v2", "6 pages, 2 figures, Accepted for IJCNN 2015 (International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2015)"], ["v3", "Sat, 15 Aug 2015 13:02:08 GMT  (187kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04596v3", "7 pages, 2 figures, Paper at IJCNN 2015 (International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, 2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 2 figures, 2015 conference submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["mark d mcdonnell", "tony vladusich"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.04596"}
