Twin Support Vector Machines (TWSVMs) have proved to be an efficient alternative to Support Vector Machine (SVM) for learning from imbalanced datasets. However, the TWSVM is unsuitable for large datasets due to the matrix inversion operations required. In this paper, we discuss a Twin Neural Network for learning from large datasets that are unbalanced, while optimizing the feature map at the same time. Our results clearly demonstrate the generalization ability and scalability obtained by the Twin Neural Network on large unbalanced datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 30 Apr 2017 17:25:45 GMT  (359kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00347v1", "16 pages, 6 figures, 12 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 6 figures, 12 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["himanshu pant", "jayadeva", "sumit soman", "mayank sharma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.00347"}
