We propose a simple projected gradient descent method to estimate the low-rank matrix that alternately performs a projected gradient descent step and cleans up a few of the corrupted entries using hard-thresholding. Our algorithm solves RMC using nearly optimal number of observations as well as nearly optimal number of corruptions. Our result also implies significant improvement over the existing time complexity bounds for the low-rank matrix completion problem. Finally, an application of our result to the robust PCA problem (low-rank+sparse matrix separation) leads to nearly linear time (in matrix dimensions) algorithm for the same; existing state-of-the-art methods require quadratic time. Our empirical results corroborate our theoretical results and show that even for moderate sized problems, our method for robust PCA is an an order of magnitude faster than the existing methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jun 2016 13:57:56 GMT  (1562kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07315v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 7 Dec 2016 20:05:13 GMT  (1588kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07315v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 8 Dec 2016 19:48:40 GMT  (1569kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07315v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NA", "authors": ["yeshwanth cherapanamjeri", "kartik gupta", "prateek jain"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.07315"}
