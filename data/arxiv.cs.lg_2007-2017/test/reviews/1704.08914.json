We show that SuperPivot performs well for the crosslingual analysis of the linguistic phenomenon of tense. We produce analysis results for more than 1000 languages, conducting - to the best of our knowledge - the largest crosslingual computational study performed to date. We extend existing methodology for leveraging parallel corpora for typological analysis by overcoming a limiting assumption of earlier work: We only require that a linguistic feature is overtly marked in a few of thousands of languages as opposed to requiring that it be marked in all languages under investigation.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Apr 2017 13:11:09 GMT  (2061kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08914v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 14 Sep 2017 17:20:41 GMT  (4292kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08914v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["ehsaneddin asgari", "hinrich sch\u00fctze"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.08914"}
