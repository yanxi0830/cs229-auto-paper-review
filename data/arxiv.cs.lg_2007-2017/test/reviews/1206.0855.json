In this paper, we will provide a method in which a slightly different version of them called Mixed observability Markov decision process, MOMDP, is going to join with our problem. Basically, we aim at offering a behavioural model for interaction of intelligent agents with musical pitch environment and we will show that how MOMDP can shed some light on building up a decision making model for musical pitch conveniently.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Jun 2012 09:35:44 GMT  (1283kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0855v1", "In 5th International Workshop on Machine Learning and Music, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012.
