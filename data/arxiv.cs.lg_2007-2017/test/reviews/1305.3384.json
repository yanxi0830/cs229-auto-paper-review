We show that training a system to use such information across domains can produce better performance. Specifically, we represent users' behavior patterns based on topological graph structures. Each behavior pattern represents the behavior of a set of users, when the users' behavior is defined as the items they rated and the items' rating values. In the next step we find a correlation between behavior patterns in the source domain and behavior patterns in the target domain. This mapping is considered a bridge between the two domains. Based on the correlation and content-attributes of the items, we train a machine learning model to predict users' ratings in the target domain. When we compare our approach to the popularity approach and KNN-cross-domain on a real world dataset, the results show that on an average of 83$%$ of the cases our approach outperforms both methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 May 2013 08:00:54 GMT  (46kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3384v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IR", "authors": ["naseem biadsy", "lior rokach", "armin shmilovici"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.3384"}
