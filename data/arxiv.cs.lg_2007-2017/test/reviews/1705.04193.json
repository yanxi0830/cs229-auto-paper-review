In this paper we propose to relax the choice of a pre-fixed transform and learn a short-time unitary transform together with the factorization, using a novel block-descent algorithm. This improves the fit between the processed data and its approximation and is in turn shown to induce better separation performance in a speech enhancement experiment.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 May 2017 14:12:23 GMT  (308kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04193v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["dylan fagot", "c\\'edric f\\'evotte", "herwig wendt"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.04193"}
