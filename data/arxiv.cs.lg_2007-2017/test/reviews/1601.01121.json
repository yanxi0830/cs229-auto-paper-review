By adding a cascade of additional classifiers, each of which receives the previous classifier's output in addition to regular input data, the approach harnesses unused information that manifests itself in the form of, e.g., correlations between predicted classes. Using multilayer perceptrons as a classification model, we demonstrate the validity of this approach by testing it on a complex ten-class 3D gesture recognition task.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Jan 2016 09:55:17 GMT  (884kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01121v1", "European Symposium on artificial neural networks (ESANN), Apr 2015, Bruges, Belgium. 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "European Symposium on artificial neural networks (ESANN), Apr 2015, Bruges, Belgium. 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["thomas kopinski", "st\\'ephane magand", "uwe handmann", "alexander gepperth"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.01121"}
