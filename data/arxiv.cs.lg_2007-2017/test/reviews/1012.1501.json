While earlier work has focused on non-decreasing functions, we explore symmetric submodular functions and their Lovasz extensions. We show that the Lovasz extension may be seen as the convex envelope of a function that depends on level sets: this leads to a class of convex structured regularization terms that impose prior knowledge on the level sets, and not on the supports of the underlying predictors. We provide a unified set of optimization algorithms (such as proximal operators), and theoretical guarantees (allowed level sets and recovery conditions). By selecting specific submodular functions, we give a new interpretation to known norms, such as the total variation; we also define new norms, in particular ones that are based on order statistics, and on noisy cuts in graphs.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Dec 2010 13:34:44 GMT  (100kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.1501v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 10 Jun 2011 14:12:14 GMT  (83kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.1501v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["francis r bach"], "accepted": true, "id": "1012.1501"}
