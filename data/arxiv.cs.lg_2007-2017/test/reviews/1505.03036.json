The method, referred to as half-sibling regression, is inspired by recent work in causal inference using additive noise models. We provide a theoretical justification and illustrate the potential of the method in a challenging astronomy application.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 May 2015 14:49:08 GMT  (2838kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03036v1", "Extended version of a paper appearing in the Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Lille, France, 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Extended version of a paper appearing in the Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Lille, France, 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML astro-ph.EP astro-ph.IM cs.LG", "authors": ["bernhard sch\u00f6lkopf", "david w hogg", "dun wang", "daniel foreman-mackey", "dominik janzing", "carl-johann simon-gabriel", "jonas peters"], "accepted": true, "id": "1505.03036"}
