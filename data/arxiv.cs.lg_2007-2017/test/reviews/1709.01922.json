In this paper, we investigate the effect of audio preprocessing on music tagging with neural networks. We perform comprehensive experiments involving audio preprocessing using different time-frequency representations, logarithmic magnitude compression, frequency weighting and scaling. We show that many commonly used input preprocessing techniques are redundant except magnitude compression.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Sep 2017 12:44:01 GMT  (169kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01922v1", "5 pages, will be submitted to ICASSP 2017. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1706.02361"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, will be submitted to ICASSP 2017. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1706.02361", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CV cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["keunwoo choi", "george fazekas", "kyunghyun cho", "mark sandler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.01922"}
