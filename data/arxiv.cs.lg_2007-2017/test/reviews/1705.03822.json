Mobile crowdsourcing requires an appropriate task assignment strategy, since different workers may have different performance in terms of acceptance rate and quality. Task assignment is challenging, since a worker's performance (i) may fluctuate, depending on both the worker's current context and the task context, (ii) is not known a priori, but has to be learned over time. However, learning context-specific worker performance requires access to context information, which workers may not grant to a central entity. Moreover, evaluating worker performance might require costly quality assessments. In this paper, we propose a context-aware hierarchical online learning algorithm addressing the problem of performance maximization in mobile crowdsourcing. In our algorithm, a local controller (LC) in the mobile device of a worker regularly observes its worker's context, his decisions to accept or decline tasks and the quality in completing tasks. Based on these observations, the LC regularly estimates its worker's context-specific performance. The mobile crowdsourcing platform (MCSP) then selects workers based on performance estimates received from the LCs. This hierarchical approach enables the LCs to learn context-specific worker performance and it enables the MCSP to select suitable workers. In addition, our algorithm preserves worker context locally, and it keeps the number of required quality assessments low. We prove that our algorithm converges to the optimal task assignment strategy. Moreover, the algorithm outperforms simpler task assignment strategies in experiments based on synthetic and real data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 May 2017 15:34:54 GMT  (1845kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03822v1", "18 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.HC cs.SI", "authors": ["sabrina m\\\"uller", "cem tekin", "mihaela van der schaar", "anja klein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03822"}
