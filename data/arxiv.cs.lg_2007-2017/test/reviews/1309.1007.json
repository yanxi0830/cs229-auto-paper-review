To this end, we introduce the notion of the {\\em subgaussian diameter}, which is a distribution-dependent refinement of the metric diameter. Our technique provides an alternative approach to that of Kutin and Niyogi's method of weakly difference-bounded functions, and yields nontrivial, dimension-free results in some interesting cases where the former does not. As an application, we give apparently the first generalization bound in the algorithmic stability setting that holds for unbounded loss functions. We furthermore extend our concentration inequality to strongly mixing processes.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Sep 2013 12:40:31 GMT  (17kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1007v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 11 Sep 2013 16:24:52 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.1007v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.PR cs.LG math.FA", "authors": ["aryeh kontorovich"], "accepted": true, "id": "1309.1007"}
