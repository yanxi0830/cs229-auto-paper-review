{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Feb-2015", "title": "An Infinite Restricted Boltzmann Machine", "abstract": "We present a mathematical construction for the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) in which the hidden layer size is adaptive and can grow during training. This is obtained by first extending the RBM to be sensitive to the ordering of its hidden units. Then, thanks to a carefully chosen definition of the energy function, we show that the limit of infinitely many hidden units is well defined. As in a regular RBM, approximate maximum likelihood training can be performed, resulting in an algorithm that naturally and adaptively adds trained hidden units during learning. We empirically study the behaviour of this infinite RBM, showing that its performance is competitive to that of the RBM.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Feb 2015 13:18:24 GMT  (644kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02476v1", "9 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 10 Feb 2015 03:44:17 GMT  (646kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02476v2", "9 pages"], ["v3", "Thu, 11 Jun 2015 16:05:59 GMT  (1767kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02476v3", "12 pages"], ["v4", "Fri, 18 Mar 2016 14:14:04 GMT  (863kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02476v4", "25 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["marc-alexandre c\\^ot\\'e", "hugo larochelle"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.02476"}
