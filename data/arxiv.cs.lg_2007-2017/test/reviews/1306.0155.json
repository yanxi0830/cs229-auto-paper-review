We focus on an important practical issue that advertisers are constrained in how much money they can spend on their ad campaigns. This issue has not been considered in the prior work on bandit-based approaches for ad allocation, to the best of our knowledge.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Jun 2013 22:00:03 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0155v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["aleksandrs slivkins"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.0155"}
