In this paper, we propose a general framework called Splash for parallelizing stochastic algorithms on multi-node distributed systems. Splash consists of a programming interface and an execution engine. Using the programming interface, the user develops sequential stochastic algorithms without concerning any detail about distributed computing. The algorithm is then automatically parallelized by a communication-efficient execution engine. We provide theoretical justifications on the optimal rate of convergence for parallelizing stochastic gradient descent. The real-data experiments with stochastic gradient descent, collapsed Gibbs sampling, stochastic variational inference and stochastic collaborative filtering verify that Splash yields order-of-magnitude speedup over single-thread stochastic algorithms and over parallelized batch algorithms. Besides its efficiency, Splash provides a rich collection of interfaces for algorithm implementation. It is built on Apache Spark and is closely integrated with the Spark ecosystem.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Jun 2015 20:39:54 GMT  (641kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07552v1", "32 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 23 Sep 2015 01:11:22 GMT  (286kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07552v2", "redo experiments to learn bigger models; compare Splash with state-of-the-art implementations on Spark"]], "COMMENTS": "32 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yuchen zhang", "michael i jordan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.07552"}
