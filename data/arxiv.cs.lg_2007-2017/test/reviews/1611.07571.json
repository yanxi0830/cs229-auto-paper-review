An ideal detector is able to find the corresponding interest points even if the data undergo a transformation typical for a given domain. Since the task is of high practical interest in computer vision, many hand-crafted solutions were proposed. In this paper, we ask a fundamental question: can we learn such detectors from scratch? Since it is often unclear, what points are \"interesting\", human labelling cannot be used to find a truly unbiased solution. Therefore, the task requires an unsupervised formulation. We are the first to propose such a formulation: training a neural network to rank points in a transformation-invariant manner. Interest points are then extracted from the top/bottom quantiles of this ranking. We validate our approach on two tasks: standard RGB image interest point detection and challenging cross-modal interest point detection between RGB and depth images. We quantitatively show that our unsupervised method performs better or on-par with baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Nov 2016 22:46:17 GMT  (7464kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07571v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 10 Apr 2017 21:15:18 GMT  (7521kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07571v2", "Accepted at CVPR 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["nikolay savinov", "akihito seki", "lubor ladicky", "torsten sattler", "marc pollefeys"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.07571"}
