We propose a parameter-free algorithm based on an original heuristic, and prove that it is optimal for this problem by deriving matching upper and lower bounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial pure exploration setting with \\textit{fixed budget} for which optimal strategies are constructed.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2016 14:35:29 GMT  (80kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08671v1", "ICML 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["andrea locatelli", "maurilio gutzeit", "alexandra carpentier"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.08671"}
