The success of these classification methods depends on the effectiveness of learning methods. Extreme learning machine (ELM) classification algorithm is a relatively new learning method built on feed-forward neural-network. ELM classification algorithm is a simple and fast method that can create a model from high-dimensional data sets. Traditional ELM learning algorithm implicitly assumes complete access to whole data set. This is a major privacy concern in most of cases. Sharing of private data (i.e. medical records) is prevented because of security concerns. In this research, we propose an efficient and secure privacy-preserving learning algorithm for ELM classification over data that is vertically partitioned among several parties. The new learning method preserves the privacy on numerical attributes, builds a classification model without sharing private data without disclosing the data of each party to others.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 Feb 2016 08:37:26 GMT  (431kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02899v1", "22nd International Conference, ICONIP 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "22nd International Conference, ICONIP 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["ferhat \\\"ozg\\\"ur \\c{c}atak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.02899"}
