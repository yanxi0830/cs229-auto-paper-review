Among different types of deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks have been most extensively studied. Due to the lack of training data and computing power in early days, it is hard to train a large high-capacity convolutional neural network without overfitting. Recently, with the rapid growth of data size and the increasing power of graphics processor unit, many researchers have improved the convolutional neural networks and achieved state-of-the-art results on various tasks. In this paper, we provide a broad survey of the recent advances in convolutional neural networks. Besides, we also introduce some applications of convolutional neural networks in computer vision.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Dec 2015 14:54:34 GMT  (1693kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07108v1", "review, journal"], ["v2", "Tue, 5 Jul 2016 11:39:16 GMT  (578kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07108v2", "review, journal"], ["v3", "Mon, 1 Aug 2016 01:54:59 GMT  (439kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07108v3", "review, journal"], ["v4", "Sat, 6 Aug 2016 12:38:35 GMT  (438kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07108v4", "review, journal"], ["v5", "Thu, 5 Jan 2017 05:45:53 GMT  (3100kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07108v5", "review, journal"], ["v6", "Thu, 19 Oct 2017 16:34:35 GMT  (4099kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07108v6", "Pattern Recognition, Elsevier"]], "COMMENTS": "review, journal", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["jiuxiang gu", "zhenhua wang", "jason kuen", "lianyang ma", "amir shahroudy", "bing shuai", "ting liu", "xingxing wang", "gang wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.07108"}
