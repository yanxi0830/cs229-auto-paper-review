It contains a CPU optimized implementation of the Fastfood algorithm, that allows the computation of approximated kernel expansions in loglinear time. The algorithm requires to compute the product of Walsh-Hadamard Transform (WHT) matrices. A cache friendly SIMD Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT) that achieves compelling speed and outperforms current state-of-the-art methods has been developed. F2F allows to obtain non-linear classification combining Fastfood and a linear classifier.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 06:30:47 GMT  (13kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08159v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["joachim curto", "irene zarza", "feng yang", "alexander j smola", "luc van gool"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08159"}
