{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "27-Jun-2012", "title": "Sparse stochastic inference for latent Dirichlet allocation", "abstract": "We present a hybrid algorithm for Bayesian topic models that combines the efficiency of sparse Gibbs sampling with the scalability of online stochastic inference. We used our algorithm to analyze a corpus of 1.2 million books (33 billion words) with thousands of topics. Our approach reduces the bias of variational inference and generalizes to many Bayesian hidden-variable models.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (686kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6425v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["david m mimno", "matthew d hoffman", "david m blei"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6425"}
