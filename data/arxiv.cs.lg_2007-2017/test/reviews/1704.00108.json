The seller offers an assortment, i.e. a subset of products, to each arriving customer, who then purchases one or no product from her offered assortment. A customer's purchase decision is governed by the underlying MultiNomial Logit (MNL) choice model. The seller aims to maximize the total revenue in a finite sales horizon, subject to resource constraints and uncertainty in the MNL choice model. We first propose an efficient online policy which incurs a regret $\\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$, where $T$ is the number of customers in the sales horizon. Then, we propose a UCB policy that achieves a regret $\\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$. Both regret bounds are sublinear in the number of assortments.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Apr 2017 02:37:53 GMT  (43kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00108v1", "16 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["wang chi cheung", "david simchi-levi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.00108"}
