The authentication process depends on two key steps: feature extraction and outlier detection. In this paper, a geometric tight frame and some low order moment statistics of the tight frame coefficients are used to extract features from the paintings. Then a forward stage-wise rank boosting is used to select a small set of features for more accurate classification so that van Gogh paintings are highly concentrated towards some center point while forgeries are spread out as outliers. Numerical results on leave-one-out cross-validation show that our proposed method can achieve a 87% classification accuracy which is better than any reported in literature so far. Even with only 4 features, our method can give a 84% classification accuracy, indicating a highly consistent style in van Gogh's brushstroke movements.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Jul 2014 01:55:37 GMT  (209kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0439v1", "14 pages, 10 figures"], ["v2", "Sat, 13 Sep 2014 00:53:16 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0439v2", "This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a critical error in numerical result"], ["v3", "Tue, 13 Jan 2015 07:20:12 GMT  (778kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0439v3", "14 pages, 13 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 10 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["haixia liu", "raymond h chan", "yuan yao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1407.0439"}
