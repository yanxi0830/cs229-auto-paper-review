In this paper, we study this classifier learning problem from a graph signal processing (GSP) perspective. Specifically, by viewing a binary classifier as a piecewise constant graph-signal in a high-dimensional feature space, we cast classifier learning as a signal restoration problem via a classical maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation. Unlike previous graph-signal restoration works, we consider in addition edges with negative weights that signify anti-correlation between samples. One unfortunate consequence is that the graph Laplacian matrix $\\mathbf{L}$ can be indefinite, and previously proposed graph-signal smoothness prior $\\mathbf{x}^T \\mathbf{L} \\mathbf{x}$ for candidate signal $\\mathbf{x}$ can lead to pathological solutions. In response, we derive an optimal perturbation matrix $\\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ - based on a fast lower-bound computation of the minimum eigenvalue of $\\mathbf{L}$ via a novel application of the Haynsworth inertia additivity formula---so that $\\mathbf{L} + \\boldsymbol{\\Delta}$ is positive semi-definite, resulting in a stable signal prior. Further, instead of forcing a hard binary decision for each sample, we define the notion of generalized smoothness on graph that promotes ambiguity in the classifier signal. Finally, we propose an algorithm based on iterative reweighted least squares (IRLS) that solves the posed MAP problem efficiently. Extensive simulation results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms both SVM variants and graph-based classifiers using positive-edge graphs noticeably.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 16:36:29 GMT  (309kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04924v1", "13 pages, submitted to IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (Special Issue on Graph Signal processing)"], ["v2", "Thu, 20 Jul 2017 13:10:24 GMT  (1036kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04924v2", "15 pages, revised for IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Network"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, submitted to IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (Special Issue on Graph Signal processing)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["gene cheung", "weng-tai su", "yu mao", "chia-wen lin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04924"}
