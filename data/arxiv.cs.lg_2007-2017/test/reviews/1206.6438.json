Many existing approaches first learn domain-invariant features and then construct classifiers with them. We propose a novel approach that jointly learn the both. Specifically, while the method identifies a feature space where data in the source and the target domains are similarly distributed, it also learns the feature space discriminatively, optimizing an information-theoretic metric as an proxy to the expected misclassification error on the target domain. We show how this optimization can be effectively carried out with simple gradient-based methods and how hyperparameters can be cross-validated without demanding any labeled data from the target domain. Empirical studies on benchmark tasks of object recognition and sentiment analysis validated our modeling assumptions and demonstrated significant improvement of our method over competing ones in classification accuracies.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (422kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6438v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["yuan shi", "fei sha"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6438"}
