This paper studies methods that fit parameters directly to maximize a measure of the accuracy of predicted marginals, taking into account both model and inference approximations at training time. Experiments on imaging problems suggest marginalization-based learning performs better than likelihood-based approximations on difficult problems where the model being fit is approximate in nature.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Jan 2013 01:07:14 GMT  (8070kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3193v1", "To Appear, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence"]], "COMMENTS": "To Appear, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["justin domke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3193"}
