Two types of the \"opposites\" have been defined in the literature, namely \\textit{type-I} and \\textit{type-II}. The former are linear in nature and applicable to the variable space, hence easy to calculate. On the other hand, type-II opposites capture the \"oppositeness\" in the output space. In fact, type-I opposites are considered a special case of type-II opposites where inputs and outputs have a linear relationship. However, in many real-world problems, inputs and outputs do in fact exhibit a nonlinear relationship. Therefore, type-II opposites are expected to be better in capturing the sense of \"opposition\" in terms of the input-output relation. In the absence of any knowledge about the problem at hand, there seems to be no intuitive way to calculate the type-II opposites. In this paper, we introduce an approach to learn type-II opposites from the given inputs and their outputs using the artificial neural networks (ANNs). We first perform \\emph{opposition mining} on the sample data, and then use the mined data to learn the relationship between input $x$ and its opposite $\\breve{x}$. We have validated our algorithm using various benchmark functions to compare it against an evolving fuzzy inference approach that has been recently introduced. The results show the better performance of a neural approach to learn the opposites. This will create new possibilities for integrating oppositional schemes within existing algorithms promising a potential increase in convergence speed and/or accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Sep 2016 16:19:56 GMT  (208kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05123v1", "To appear in proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2016), Cancun, Mexico, December 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR 2016), Cancun, Mexico, December 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["shivam kalra", "aditya sriram", "shahryar rahnamayan", "h r tizhoosh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.05123"}
