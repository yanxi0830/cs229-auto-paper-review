MI changes the way in which information from difference sources flows and is integrated in the computational building block of an RNN, while introducing almost no extra parameters. The new structure can be easily embedded into many popular RNN models, including LSTMs and GRUs. We empirically analyze its learning behaviour and conduct evaluations on several tasks using different RNN models. Our experimental results demonstrate that Multiplicative Integration can provide a substantial performance boost over many of the existing RNN models.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Jun 2016 15:55:29 GMT  (71kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06630v1", "11 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Sat, 12 Nov 2016 19:47:10 GMT  (187kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06630v2", "10 pages, 2 figures; To appear in NIPS2016"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yuhuai wu", "saizheng zhang", "ying zhang", "yoshua bengio", "ruslan salakhutdinov"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.06630"}
