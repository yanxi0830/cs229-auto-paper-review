(2015) showed that optimizing pixels to match features in a convolutional network with respect reference image features is a way to render images of high visual quality. We show that unrolling this gradient-based optimization yields a recurrent computation that creates images by incrementally adding onto a visual \"canvas\". We propose a recurrent generative model inspired by this view, and show that it can be trained using adversarial training to generate very good image samples. We also propose a way to quantitatively compare adversarial networks by having the generators and discriminators of these networks compete against each other.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Feb 2016 17:51:39 GMT  (2145kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05110v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 17 Feb 2016 14:41:52 GMT  (2145kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05110v2", null], ["v3", "Sun, 10 Apr 2016 19:17:27 GMT  (2148kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05110v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 29 May 2016 01:17:59 GMT  (2489kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05110v4", null], ["v5", "Tue, 13 Dec 2016 03:21:03 GMT  (4969kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05110v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["daniel jiwoong im", "chris dongjoo kim", "hui jiang", "roland memisevic"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.05110"}
