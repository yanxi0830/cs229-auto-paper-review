For these problems, label embeddings have been shown to be a useful primitive that can improve computational and statistical efficiency. In this work we utilize a correspondence between rank constrained estimation and low dimensional label embeddings that uncovers a fast label embedding algorithm which works in both the multiclass and multilabel settings. The result is a randomized algorithm for partial least squares, whose running time is exponentially faster than naive algorithms. We demonstrate our techniques on two large-scale public datasets, from the Large Scale Hierarchical Text Challenge and the Open Directory Project, where we obtain state of the art results.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Mar 2015 23:29:46 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08873v1", "Accepted as a workshop contribution at ICLR 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted as a workshop contribution at ICLR 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["paul mineiro", "nikos karampatziakis"], "accepted": true, "id": "1503.08873"}
