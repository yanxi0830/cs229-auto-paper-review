We prove that the Nash equilibria in a stochastic game remains unchanged after potential-based shaping is applied to the environment. The property of policy invariance provides a possible way of speeding convergence when learning to play a stochastic game.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:22:56 GMT  (89kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3907v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.LG", "authors": ["xiaosong lu", "howard m schwartz", "sidney n givigi jr"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3907"}
