In CS, a taskmaster typically breaks down the project into small batches of tasks and assigns them to so-called workers with imperfect skill levels. The crowdsourcer then collects and analyzes the results for inference and serving the purpose of the project. In this work, the CS problem, as a human-in-the-loop computation problem, is modeled and analyzed in an information theoretic rate-distortion framework. The purpose is to identify the ultimate fidelity that one can achieve by any form of query from the crowd and any decoding (inference) algorithm with a given budget. The results are established by a joint source channel (de)coding scheme, which represent the query scheme and inference, over parallel noisy channels, which model workers with imperfect skill levels. We also present and analyze a query scheme dubbed $k$-ary incidence coding and study optimized query pricing in this setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Aug 2016 22:43:46 GMT  (84kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07328v1", "Accepted for NIPS 2016, Barcelona, Spain"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for NIPS 2016, Barcelona, Spain", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IT math.IT", "authors": ["farshad lahouti", "babak hassibi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.07328"}
