However, it is unclear whether such algorithms can recover the ground-truth feature matrix when the weights for different features are highly correlated, which is common in applications. This paper proposes a simple and natural alternating gradient descent based algorithm, and shows that with a mild initialization it provably recovers the ground-truth in the presence of strong correlations. In most interesting cases, the correlation can be in the same order as the highest possible. Our analysis also reveals its several favorable features including robustness to noise. We complement our theoretical results with empirical studies on semi-synthetic datasets, demonstrating its advantage over several popular methods in recovering the ground-truth.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 14:39:59 GMT  (1519kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04097v1", "Accepted to the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS cs.NA stat.ML", "authors": ["yuanzhi li", "yingyu liang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.04097"}
