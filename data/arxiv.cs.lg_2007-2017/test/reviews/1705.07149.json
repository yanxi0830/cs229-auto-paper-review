Feasible learning rules must rely solely on synaptically local information in order to be implemented on spatially distributed neurons. We describe a neural network with spiking neurons that can address the aforementioned fundamental challenge and solve the L1-minimizing dictionary learning problem, representing the first model able to do so. Our major innovation is to introduce feedback synapses to create a pathway to turn the seemingly non-local information into local ones. The resulting network encodes the error signal needed for learning as the change of network steady states caused by feedback, and operates akin to the classical stochastic gradient descent method.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 May 2017 19:06:27 GMT  (725kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07149v1", "10 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["tsung-han lin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07149"}
