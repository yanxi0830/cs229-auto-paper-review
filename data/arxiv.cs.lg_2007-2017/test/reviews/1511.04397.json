First a Siamese network is trained with deep supervision on the labeled text of training dataset which project texts in a similarity manifold. The Deeply Supervised Siamese network learn the visual similarity of texts. Then a K-nearest neighbor classifier is used to predict the unlabeled text based on similarity distance to labeled texts. The performance of the model is evaluated on three datasets of combined machine-printed and hand-written text, which demonstrates in reducing the cost of human extimation by $50\\%-85\\%$ with error less than $0.1\\%$. The results also demonstrates that the predicted labels are sometimes better than human estimates labels e.g. spelling correction.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Nov 2015 18:46:01 GMT  (2444kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04397v1", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 20:59:10 GMT  (2508kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04397v2", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v3", "Fri, 8 Jan 2016 00:37:29 GMT  (1899kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04397v3", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v4", "Sun, 3 Jul 2016 16:38:35 GMT  (1896kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04397v4", "Accepted for presenting at Future Technologies Conference - (FTC 2016) San Francisco, December 6-7, 2016"], ["v5", "Tue, 5 Jul 2016 01:21:08 GMT  (1897kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04397v5", "Accepted for presenting at Future Technologies Conference - (FTC 2016) San Francisco, December 6-7, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["ehsan hosseini-asl", "angshuman guha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.04397"}
