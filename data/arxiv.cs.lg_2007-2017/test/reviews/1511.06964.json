{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Nov-2015", "title": "Online Semi-Supervised Learning with Deep Hybrid Boltzmann Machines and Denoising Autoencoders", "abstract": "Two novel deep hybrid architectures, the Deep Hybrid Boltzmann Machine and the Deep Hybrid Denoising Auto-encoder, are proposed for handling semi-supervised learning problems. The models combine experts that model relevant distributions at different levels of abstraction to improve overall predictive performance on discriminative tasks. Theoretical motivations and algorithms for joint learning for each are presented. We apply the new models to the domain of data-streams in work towards life-long learning. The proposed architectures show improved performance compared to a pseudo-labeled, drop-out rectifier network.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 Nov 2015 04:53:43 GMT  (107kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06964v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 24 Nov 2015 22:12:51 GMT  (79kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06964v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 27 Nov 2015 05:06:36 GMT  (79kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06964v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 13 Dec 2015 07:24:34 GMT  (79kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06964v4", null], ["v5", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 19:44:42 GMT  (134kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06964v5", null], ["v6", "Fri, 8 Jan 2016 06:19:07 GMT  (160kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06964v6", null], ["v7", "Mon, 18 Jan 2016 18:06:01 GMT  (160kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06964v7", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["alexander g ororbia ii", "c lee giles", "david reitter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06964"}
