Our RNN is armed with recently proposed Gated Recurrent Units which has shown promising results in some sequence modeling problems such as Machine Translation and Speech Synthesis. We demonstrate that this model is able to capture long-term dependencies in data and generate realistic motions.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Jan 2015 18:37:36 GMT  (6163kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00299v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["mohammad pezeshki"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.00299"}
