As newer features continue to be added to smartphones to increase their utility, their significance will only increase in future. Combining machine learning with mobile computing can enable smartphones to become 'intelligent' devices, a feature which is hitherto unseen in them. Also, the combination of machine learning and context aware computing can enable smartphones to gauge user's requirements proactively, depending upon their environment and context. Accordingly, necessary services can be provided to users.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Nov 2014 22:55:13 GMT  (476kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4076v1", "International Journal of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence(IJARAI), Volume 3 Issue 1, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal of Advanced Research in Artificial Intelligence(IJARAI), Volume 3 Issue 1, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.HC cs.LG", "authors": ["amiraj dhawan", "shruti bhave", "amrita aurora", "vishwanathan iyer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.4076"}
