We ask whether a strong defense can be created by combining multiple (possibly weak) defenses. To answer this question, we study three defenses that follow this approach. Two of these are recently proposed defenses that intentionally combine components designed to work well together. A third defense combines three independent defenses. For all the components of these defenses and the combined defenses themselves, we show that an adaptive adversary can create adversarial examples successfully with low distortion. Thus, our work implies that ensemble of weak defenses is not sufficient to provide strong defense against adversarial examples.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 00:13:28 GMT  (356kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04701v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["warren he", "james wei", "xinyun chen", "nicholas carlini", "dawn song"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.04701"}
