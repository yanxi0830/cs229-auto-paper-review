Our model calculates the density of a datapoint as the product of one-dimensional conditionals modeled using mixture density networks with shared parameters. RNADE learns a distributed representation of the data, while having a tractable expression for the calculation of densities. A tractable likelihood allows direct comparison with other methods and training by standard gradient-based optimizers. We compare the performance of RNADE on several datasets of heterogeneous and perceptual data, finding it outperforms mixture models in all but one case.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 2 Jun 2013 09:37:53 GMT  (315kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0186v1", "12 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, 2 algorithms"], ["v2", "Thu, 9 Jan 2014 11:14:27 GMT  (316kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0186v2", "12 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, 2 algorithms.
