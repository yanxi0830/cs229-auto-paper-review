In this regard, root-cause analysis becomes highly intractable due to complex fault propagation mechanisms in combination with diverse operating modes. This paper presents a new data-driven framework for root-cause analysis for addressing such issues. The framework is based on a spatiotemporal feature extraction scheme for multivariate time series built on the concept of symbolic dynamics for discovering and representing causal interactions among subsystems of a complex system. We propose sequential state switching ($S^3$) and artificial anomaly association ($A^3$) methods to implement root-cause analysis in an unsupervised and semi-supervised manner respectively. Synthetic data from cases with failed pattern(s) and anomalous node are simulated to validate the proposed approaches, then compared with the performance of vector autoregressive (VAR) model-based root-cause analysis. The results show that: (1) $S^3$ and $A^3$ approaches can obtain high accuracy in root-cause analysis and successfully handle multiple nominal operation modes, and (2) the proposed tool-chain is shown to be scalable while maintaining high accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 May 2016 16:17:59 GMT  (336kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06421v1", "Submitted to NIPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to NIPS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["chao liu", "kin gwn lore", "soumik sarkar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.06421"}
