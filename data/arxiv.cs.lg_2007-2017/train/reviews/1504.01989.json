To facilitate the process, the proposed approach leverages with DenseNet, an efficient implementation of multiscale convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to extract an informative feature vector for each pixel and uses an SVM classifier to accomplish contour detection. In the experiment of contour detection, we look into the effectiveness of combining per-pixel features from different CNN layers and verify their performance on BSDS500.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Apr 2015 14:44:20 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01989v1", "2 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1412.6857"]], "COMMENTS": "2 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1412.6857", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["jyh-jing hwang", "tyng-luh liu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1504.01989"}
