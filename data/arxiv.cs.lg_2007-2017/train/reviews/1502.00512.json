We discuss how to train very large RNNs on GPUs and address the questions of how RNNLMs scale with respect to model size, training-set size, computational costs and memory. Our analysis shows that despite being more costly to train, RNNLMs obtain much lower perplexities on standard benchmarks than n-gram models. We train the largest known RNNs and present relative word error rates gains of 18% on an ASR task. We also present the new lowest perplexities on the recently released billion word language modelling benchmark, 1 BLEU point gain on machine translation and a 17% relative hit rate gain in word prediction.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 2 Feb 2015 15:27:37 GMT  (19kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00512v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["will williams", "niranjani prasad", "david mrva", "tom ash", "tony robinson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.00512"}
