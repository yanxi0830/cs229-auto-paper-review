We propose a factorization of a physical scene into composable object-based representations and also the NPE architecture whose compositional structure factorizes object dynamics into pairwise interactions. Our approach draws on the strengths of both symbolic and neural approaches: like a symbolic physics engine, the NPE is endowed with generic notions of objects and their interactions, but as a neural network it can also be trained via stochastic gradient descent to adapt to specific object properties and dynamics of different worlds. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach on simple rigid body dynamics in two-dimensional worlds. By comparing to less structured architectures, we show that our model's compositional representation of the structure in physical interactions improves its ability to predict movement, generalize to different numbers of objects, and infer latent properties of objects such as mass.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 16:39:04 GMT  (7857kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00341v1", "Under review as a conference paper for ICLR 2017. 11 pages, 5 figures"], ["v2", "Sat, 4 Mar 2017 17:44:06 GMT  (6899kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00341v2", "Published as a conference paper for ICLR 2017. 15 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review as a conference paper for ICLR 2017. 11 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["michael b chang", "tomer ullman", "antonio torralba", "joshua b tenenbaum"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.00341"}
