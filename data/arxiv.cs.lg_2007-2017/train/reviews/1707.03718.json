Existing algorithms even though are accurate but they do not focus on utilizing the parameters of neural network efficiently. As a result they are huge in terms of parameters and number of operations; hence slow too. In this paper, we propose a novel deep neural network architecture which allows it to learn without any significant increase in number of parameters. Our network uses only 11.5 million parameters and 21.2 GFLOPs for processing an image of resolution 3x640x360. It gives state-of-the-art performance on CamVid and comparable results on Cityscapes dataset. We also compare our networks processing time on NVIDIA GPU and embedded system device with existing state-of-the-art architectures for different image resolutions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 20:37:17 GMT  (2586kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03718v1", "5 pages, 5 figures, GitHub:this https URL"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 5 figures, GitHub:this https URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["abhishek chaurasia", "eugenio culurciello"], "accepted": false, "id": "1707.03718"}
