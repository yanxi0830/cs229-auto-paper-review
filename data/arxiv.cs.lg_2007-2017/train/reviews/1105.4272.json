In this process, the trader rationally choose his gambles using a prediction made by a randomized calibrated algorithm. Our strategy is based on Dawid's notion of calibration with more general changing checking rules and on some modification of Kakade and Foster's randomized algorithm for computing calibrated forecasts.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 21 May 2011 17:28:12 GMT  (135kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.4272v1", "15 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["vladimir trunov", "vladimir v'yugin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.4272"}
