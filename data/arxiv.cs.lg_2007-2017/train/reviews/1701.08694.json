In this paper three well-known supervised learning techniques which are Support Vector Machine(SVM), Na\\\"ive Bayes(NB) and Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) compared for Bengali document categorization. Besides classifier, classification also depends on how feature is selected from dataset. For analyzing those classifier performances on predicting a document against twelve categories several feature selection techniques are also applied in this article namely Chi square distribution, normalized TFIDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) with word analyzer. So, we attempt to explore the efficiency of those three-classification algorithms by using two different feature selection techniques in this article.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Jan 2017 13:08:08 GMT  (528kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08694v1", "6 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["md saiful islam", "fazla elahi md jubayer", "syed ikhtiar ahmed"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08694"}
