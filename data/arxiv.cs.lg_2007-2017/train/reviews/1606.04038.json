The parameters from all models are regularised by the tensor trace norm, so that one neural network is encouraged to reuse others' parameters if possible -- this is the main motivation behind multi-task learning. In contrast to many deep multi-task learning work, we do not predefine a parameter sharing strategy by tying some (usually bottom) layers' parameters, instead, our framework allows the sharing for all shareable layers thus the sharing strategy is learned from a pure data-driven way.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Jun 2016 17:15:43 GMT  (15kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04038v1", "Technical Report, 5 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 17 Feb 2017 01:33:17 GMT  (42kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04038v2", "Submission to Workshop track - ICLR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical Report, 5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yongxin yang", "timothy m hospedales"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04038"}
