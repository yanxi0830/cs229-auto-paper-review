The developed system combines reinforcement learning with a neural network for learning to predict the possible outcomes of its actions. We validated the solution in three types of environment consisting of (pseudo)-randomly generated matrices of digits. The experimental verification is followed by the discussion regarding elements required by systems mimicking the fovea movement and possible further research directions.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 16:34:08 GMT  (1814kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06492v1", "Paper submitted to special session on Machine Intelligence organized during 23rd International AUTOMATION Conference"]], "COMMENTS": "Paper submitted to special session on Machine Intelligence organized during 23rd International AUTOMATION Conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["tomasz kornuta", "kamil rocki"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06492"}
