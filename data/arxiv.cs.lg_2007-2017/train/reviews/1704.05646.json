We show that minimisation of margin variance and not maximisation of the margin is more suitable for improving generalisation in deep architectures. We propose the Halfway loss function that minimises the Normalised Margin Variance (NMV) at the output of a deep learning models and evaluate its performance against the Softmax Cross-Entropy loss on the MNIST, smallNORB and CIFAR-10 datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Apr 2017 08:31:20 GMT  (185kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05646v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["lech szymanski", "brendan mccane", "wei gao", "zhi-hua zhou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.05646"}
