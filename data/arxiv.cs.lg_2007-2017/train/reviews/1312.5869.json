However, they are computationally prohibitive for large datasets. We propose randSel, a randomised feature selection algorithm, with attractive scaling properties. Our theoretical analysis of randSel provides strong probabilistic guarantees for correct identification of relevant features. RandSel's characteristics make it an ideal candidate for identifying informative learned representations. We've conducted experimentation to establish the performance of this approach, and present encouraging results, including a 3rd position result in the recent ICML black box learning challenge as well as competitive results for signal peptide prediction, an important problem in bioinformatics.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 10:16:13 GMT  (232kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5869v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 18 Feb 2014 17:25:43 GMT  (277kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5869v2", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1311.5636"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["dimitrios athanasakis", "john shawe-taylor", "delmiro fernandez-reyes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.5869"}
