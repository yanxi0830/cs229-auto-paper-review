Due in large part to the fuzzy nature of what constitutes suicidal risks, most supervised approaches for learning to automatically detect suicide-related activity in social media require a great deal of human labor to train. However, humans themselves have diverse or conflicting views on what constitutes suicidal thoughts. So how to obtain reliable gold standard labels is fundamentally challenging and, we hypothesize, depends largely on what is asked of the annotators and what slice of the data they label. We conducted multiple rounds of data labeling and collected annotations from crowdsourcing workers and domain experts. We aggregated the resulting labels in various ways to train a series of supervised models. Our preliminary evaluations show that using unanimously agreed labels from multiple annotators is helpful to achieve robust machine models.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 19:41:04 GMT  (1192kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08796v1", "8 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CY cs.SI", "authors": ["tong liu", "qijin cheng", "christopher m homan", "vincent m b silenzio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08796"}
