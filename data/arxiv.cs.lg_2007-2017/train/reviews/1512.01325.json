This task has not received enough attention in computer vision. In this paper we study various types of atypicalities in images in a more comprehensive way than has been done before. We propose a new dataset of abnormal images showing a wide range of atypicalities. We design human subject experiments to discover a coarse taxonomy of the reasons for abnormality. Our experiments reveal three major categories of abnormality: object-centric, scene-centric, and contextual. Based on this taxonomy, we propose a comprehensive computational model that can predict all different types of abnormality in images and outperform prior arts in abnormality recognition.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Dec 2015 06:29:53 GMT  (5518kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01325v1", "To appear in the Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in the Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.HC cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "authors": ["babak saleh", "ahmed m elgammal", "jacob feldman", "ali farhadi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.01325"}
