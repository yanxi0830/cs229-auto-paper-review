Previous attempts to use information theory to define clusters in an assumption-free way are based on maximizing mutual information between data and cluster labels. We demonstrate that this intuition suffers from a fundamental conceptual flaw that causes clustering performance to deteriorate as the amount of data increases. Instead, we return to the axiomatic foundations of information theory to define a meaningful clustering measure based on the notion of consistency under coarse-graining for finite data.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Oct 2013 21:19:22 GMT  (1079kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4210v1", "12 pages, 8 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 5 Feb 2014 22:21:06 GMT  (3462kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4210v2", "Proceedings of The 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2014. 11 pages, 9 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IT math.IT physics.data-an stat.ML", "authors": ["greg ver steeg", "aram galstyan", "fei sha", "simon dedeo"], "accepted": true, "id": "1310.4210"}
