We propose a new semi-supervised learning method for sequence classification tasks. Our work is based on both deep generative model for semi-supervised learning \\cite{kingma2014semi} and variational auto-encoder for sequence modeling \\cite{bowman2015generating}. We found the introduction of Sc-LSTM is critical to the success in our method. We have obtained some preliminary experimental results on IMDB sentiment classification dataset, showing that the proposed model improves the classification accuracy comparing to pure supervised classifier.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Mar 2016 13:24:45 GMT  (169kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02514v1", "6 pages, 1 figure"], ["v2", "Mon, 23 May 2016 14:33:50 GMT  (365kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02514v2", "6 pages, 1 figure"], ["v3", "Thu, 24 Nov 2016 08:18:31 GMT  (735kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02514v3", "8 pages, 4 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["weidi xu", "haoze sun", "chao deng", "ying tan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.02514"}
