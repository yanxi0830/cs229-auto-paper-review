However in the texture synthesize procedure. The state-of-art CNN can not capture the spatial location of texture in image, lead to significant distortion after texture synthesize, we propose a new way to generating-image by adding the semantic segment step with deep learning algorithm as Pre-Processing and analyze the outcome.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 May 2016 11:24:03 GMT  (556kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04731v1", "7 pages, 4 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1505.07376,arXiv:1604.04339,arXiv:1602.07188by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 4 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1505.07376,arXiv:1604.04339,arXiv:1602.07188by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.GR cs.LG", "authors": ["xianye liang", "bocheng zhuo", "peijie li", "liangju he"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.04731"}
