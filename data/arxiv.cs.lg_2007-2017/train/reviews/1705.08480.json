The recently introduced Recurrent Weighted Average (RWA) unit captures long term dependencies far better than an LSTM on several challenging tasks. The RWA achieves this by applying attention to each input and computing a weighted average over the full history of its computations. Unfortunately, the RWA cannot change the attention it has assigned to previous timesteps, and so struggles with carrying out consecutive tasks or tasks with changing requirements. We present the Recurrent Discounted Attention (RDA) unit that builds on the RWA by additionally allowing the discounting of the past.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 May 2017 18:57:50 GMT  (375kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08480v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 19 Jun 2017 08:53:04 GMT  (375kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08480v2", "Updated results of RDA-exp-tanh unit for the wikipedia char prediction task"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["brendan maginnis", "pierre h richemond"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.08480"}
