We describe the efficient weakly supervised learning of such inferences by our Dynamic Adaptive Network Intelligence (DANI) model. We report state-of-the-art results for DANI over question answering tasks in the bAbI dataset that have proved difficult for contemporary approaches to learning representation (Weston et al., 2015).", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 21:07:27 GMT  (237kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06379v1", "8 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, ICLR 2016 conference paper submission"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, ICLR 2016 conference paper submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["richard searle", "megan bingham-walker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06379"}
