{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "28-Mar-2016", "title": "Attend, Infer, Repeat: Fast Scene Understanding with Generative Models", "abstract": "We present a framework for efficient inference in structured image models that explicitly reason about objects. We achieve this by performing probabilistic inference using a recurrent neural network that attends to scene elements and processes them one at a time. Crucially, the model itself learns to choose the appropriate number of inference steps. We use this scheme to learn to perform inference in partially specified 2D models (variable-sized variational auto-encoders) and fully specified 3D models (probabilistic renderers). We show that such models learn to identify multiple objects - counting, locating and classifying the elements of a scene - without any supervision, e.g., decomposing 3D images with various numbers of objects in a single forward pass of a neural network. We further show that the networks produce accurate inferences when compared to supervised counterparts, and that their structure leads to improved generalization.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Mar 2016 21:59:08 GMT  (2311kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08575v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 30 Mar 2016 06:27:26 GMT  (2311kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08575v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 12 Aug 2016 16:05:08 GMT  (2867kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08575v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["s m ali eslami", "nicolas heess", "theophane weber", "yuval tassa", "david szepesvari", "koray kavukcuoglu", "geoffrey e hinton"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.08575"}
