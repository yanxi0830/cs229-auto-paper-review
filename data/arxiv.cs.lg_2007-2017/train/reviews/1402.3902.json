We give an algorithm for exactly reconstructing f given random examples only from the uniform distribution on the boolean hypercube that runs in time polynomial in n and 2s and succeeds if each coefficient of f has been perturbed by a small Gaussian (or any other reasonable distribution on the reals). Learning sparse polynomials over the Boolean domain in time polynomial in n and 2s is considered a notoriously hard problem in the worst-case. Our result shows that the problem is tractable in the smoothed- analysis setting. Our proof combines a method for identifying unique sign patterns induced by the underlying monomials of f with recent work in compressed sensing. We identify other natural conditions on f for which our techniques will succeed.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Feb 2014 06:00:16 GMT  (27kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3902v1", "15 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 18 Feb 2014 06:56:27 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3902v2", "11 pages"], ["v3", "Wed, 5 Nov 2014 22:35:40 GMT  (76kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3902v3", "14 pages; to appear in NIPS 2014l Updated proof of Theorem 5 and some other minor changes during revision"], ["v4", "Fri, 7 Nov 2014 03:00:28 GMT  (65kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3902v4", "14 pages; to appear in NIPS 2014l Updated proof of Theorem 5 and some other minor changes during revision"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["murat kocaoglu", "karthikeyan shanmugam", "alexandros g dimakis", "adam r klivans"], "accepted": true, "id": "1402.3902"}
