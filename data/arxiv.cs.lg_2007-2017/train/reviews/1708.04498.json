It simplifies existing network structures by removing intralayer weights, essentially cutting the number of weights that need to be trained in half.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Jun 2017 12:29:41 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04498v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG cs.SE", "authors": ["leonard johard", "victor rivera", "manuel mazzara", "jooyoung lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.04498"}
