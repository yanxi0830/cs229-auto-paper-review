Current deep learning algorithms train the layers of the network sequentially, improving algorithmic performance as well as providing some regularization. We present a new training algorithm for deep networks which trains \\emph{each node in the network} sequentially. Our algorithm is orders of magnitude faster, creates more interpretable internal representations at the node level, while not sacrificing on the ultimate out-of-sample performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Feb 2016 15:36:38 GMT  (1172kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06183v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ke wu", "malik magdon-ismail"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.06183"}
