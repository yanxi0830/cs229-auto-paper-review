A deep, classification-specific attention mechanism improves further the overall performance of the RNN. We also compare against a CNN and a word-list baseline, considering both fully automatic and semi-automatic moderation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 May 2017 21:12:56 GMT  (1433kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09993v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 17 Jul 2017 15:25:56 GMT  (1433kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09993v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["john pavlopoulos", "prodromos malakasiotis", "ion", "routsopoulos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09993"}
