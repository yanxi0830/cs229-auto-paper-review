We will proceed initially with their analysis using the WEKA software to work with the classifiers on a well-known IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems) dataset like NSL-KDD dataset. The NSL-KDD dataset of network attacks was created in a military network by MIT Lincoln Labs. Then we will discuss and experiment some of the hybrid AI (Artificial Intelligence) classifiers that can be used for IDS, and finally we developed a Java software with three most efficient classifiers and compared it with other options. The outputs would show the detection accuracy and efficiency of the single and combined classifiers used.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Sep 2015 09:01:30 GMT  (595kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08239v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["mohanad albayati", "biju issac"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.08239"}
