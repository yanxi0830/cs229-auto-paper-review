Deep feedforward neural networks with many hidden layers also suffer from this effect. In this paper we propose a novel universal technique that makes the norm of the gradient stay in the suitable range. We construct a way to estimate a contribution of each training example to the norm of the long-term components of the target function s gradient. Using this subroutine we can construct mini-batches for the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training that leads to high performance and accuracy of the trained network even for very complex tasks. We provide a straightforward mathematical estimation of minibatch s impact on for the gradient norm and prove its correctness theoretically. To check our framework experimentally we use some special synthetic benchmarks for testing RNNs on ability to capture long-term dependencies. Our network can detect links between events in the (temporal) sequence at the range approx. 100 and longer.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 17:31:02 GMT  (3731kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07767v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 21:30:29 GMT  (3987kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07767v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 13 Feb 2017 21:25:26 GMT  (3916kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07767v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["artem chernodub", "dimitri nowicki"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07767"}
