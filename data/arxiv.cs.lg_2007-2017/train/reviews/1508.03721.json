We chose two widely studied neural models and tasks as our testbed. We tried several frequently applied or newly proposed regularization strategies, including penalizing weights (embeddings excluded), penalizing embeddings, re-embedding words, and dropout. We also emphasized on incremental hyperparameter tuning, and combining different regularizations. The results provide a picture on tuning hyperparameters for neural NLP models.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 15 Aug 2015 11:16:39 GMT  (113kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03721v1", "EMNLP '15"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP '15", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["hao peng", "lili mou", "ge li", "yunchuan chen", "yangyang lu", "zhi jin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.03721"}
