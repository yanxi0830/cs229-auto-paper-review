We develop the formulation of the Gaussian process for regression (GPR) to deal with complex-valued outputs. Previous solutions for kernels methods usually assume a complexification approach, where the real-valued kernel is replaced by a complex-valued one. However, based on the results in complex-valued linear theory, we prove that both a kernel and a pseudo-kernel are to be included in the solution. This is the starting point to develop the new formulation for the complex-valued GPR. The obtained formulation resembles the one of the widely linear minimum mean-squared (WLMMSE) approach. Just in the particular case where the outputs are proper, the pseudo-kernel cancels and the solution simplifies to a real-valued GPR structure, as the WLMMSE does into a strictly linear solution. We include some numerical experiments to show that the novel solution, denoted as widely non-linear complex GPR (WCGPR), outperforms a strictly complex GPR where a pseudo-kernel is not included.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 09:49:22 GMT  (3429kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05710v1", "6 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["rafael boloix-tortosa", "eva arias-de-reyna", "f javier payan-somet", "juan j murillo-fuentes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.05710"}
