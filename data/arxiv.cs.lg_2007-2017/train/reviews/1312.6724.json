Our algorithms start with any initial clustering and only make local changes in each step; both are desirable features in many applications. We show that in this constrained setting one can still design provably efficient algorithms that produce accurate clusterings. We also show that our algorithms perform well on real-world data.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Dec 2013 00:16:37 GMT  (2189kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6724v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 7 Feb 2014 05:12:20 GMT  (2189kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6724v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 19 Mar 2015 23:45:54 GMT  (2403kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6724v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["pranjal awasthi", "maria-florina balcan", "konstantin voevodski"], "accepted": true, "id": "1312.6724"}
