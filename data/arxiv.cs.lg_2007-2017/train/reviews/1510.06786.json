Quantifying the Geographic Variation of Internet Language", "abstract": "We present a new computational technique to detect and analyze statistically significant geographic variation in language. Our meta-analysis approach captures statistical properties of word usage across geographical regions and uses statistical methods to identify significant changes specific to regions. While previous approaches have primarily focused on lexical variation between regions, our method identifies words that demonstrate semantic and syntactic variation as well.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Oct 2015 22:53:10 GMT  (1142kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06786v1", "11 pages : Submitted to WWW 2016"], ["v2", "Mon, 7 Mar 2016 14:40:36 GMT  (5166kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06786v2", "11 pages (updated submission)"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages : Submitted to WWW 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["vivek kulkarni", "bryan perozzi", "steven skiena"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.06786"}
