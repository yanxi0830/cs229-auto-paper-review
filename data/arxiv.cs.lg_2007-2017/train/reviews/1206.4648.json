These methods have had some successes, but their applicability is limited because they are not robust to noise. To address this limitation, we look at two-manifold problems, in which we simultaneously reconstruct two related manifolds, each representing a different view of the same data. By solving these interconnected learning problems together, two-manifold algorithms are able to succeed where a non-integrated approach would fail: each view allows us to suppress noise in the other, reducing bias. We propose a class of algorithms for two-manifold problems, based on spectral decomposition of cross-covariance operators in Hilbert space, and discuss when two-manifold problems are useful. Finally, we demonstrate that solving a two-manifold problem can aid in learning a nonlinear dynamical system from limited data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:23:02 GMT  (7860kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4648v1", "ICML2012. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1112.6399"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1112.6399", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["byron boots", "geoff gordon"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4648"}
