{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "21-Feb-2017", "title": "Memory and Communication Efficient Distributed Stochastic Optimization with Minibatch-Prox", "abstract": "We present and analyze statistically optimal, communication and memory efficient distributed stochastic optimization algorithms with near-linear speedups (up to $\\log$-factors). This improves over prior work which includes methods with near-linear speedups but polynomial communication requirements (accelerated minibatch SGD) and communication efficient methods which do not exhibit any runtime speedups over a naive single-machine approach. We first analyze a distributed SVRG variant as a distributed stochastic optimization method and show that it can achieve near-linear speedups with logarithmic rounds of communication, at the cost of high memory requirements. We then present a novel method, stochastic DANE, which trades off memory for communication and still allows for optimization with communication which scales only logarithmically with the desired accuracy while also being memory efficient. Stochastic DANE is based on a minibatch prox procedure, solving a non-linearized subproblem on a minibatch at each iteration. We provide a novel analysis for this procedure which achieves the statistical optimal rate regardless of minibatch size and smoothness, and thus significantly improving on prior work.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Feb 2017 05:19:23 GMT  (619kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06269v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 9 Jun 2017 16:14:48 GMT  (735kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06269v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jialei wang", "weiran wang", "nathan srebro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06269"}
