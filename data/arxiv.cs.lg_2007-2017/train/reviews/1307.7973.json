Our model is based on two scoring functions that operate by learning low-dimensional embeddings of words and of entities and relationships from a knowledge base. We empirically show on New York Times articles aligned with Freebase relations that our approach is able to efficiently use the extra information provided by a large subset of Freebase data (4M entities, 23k relationships) to improve over existing methods that rely on text features alone.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Jul 2013 13:37:09 GMT  (78kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7973v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["jason weston", "antoine bordes", "oksana yakhnenko", "nicolas usunier"], "accepted": true, "id": "1307.7973"}
