The contribution of the paper is threefold. Firstly, a generic spatio-temporal regularization term is designed and used together with the standard $\\ell_1$ regularization term to enforce a sparse decomposition preserving the spatio-temporal structure of the signal. Secondly, an optimization algorithm based on the split Bregman approach is proposed to handle the associated optimization problem, and its convergence is analyzed. Our well-founded approach yields same accuracy as the other algorithms at the state-of-the-art, with significant gains in terms of convergence speed. Thirdly, the empirical validation of the approach on artificial and real-world problems demonstrates the generality and effectiveness of the method. On artificial problems, the proposed regularization subsumes the Total Variation minimization and recovers the expected decomposition. On the real-world problem of electro-encephalography brainwave decomposition, the approach outperforms similar approaches in terms of P300 evoked potentials detection, using structured spatial priors to guide the decomposition.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 20:50:16 GMT  (328kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09525v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["yoann isaac", "quentin barth\\'elemy", "c\\'edric gouy-pailler", "mich\\`ele sebag", "jamal atif"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.09525"}
