Our goal is to answer more complex questions reliably, without incurring a significant cost in knowledge resource construction to support the QA. One readily available knowledge resource is a term bank, enumerating the key concepts in a domain. We have developed an unsupervised learning approach that leverages a term bank to guide a QA system, by representing the terminological knowledge with thousands of specialized vector spaces. In experiments with complex science questions, we show that this approach significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art QA systems, demonstrating that significant leverage can be gained from continuous vector representations of domain terminology.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 21:21:39 GMT  (27kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03543v1", "Related datasets can be found atthis http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "Related datasets can be found atthis http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["peter d turney"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.03543"}
