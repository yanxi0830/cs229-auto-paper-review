In this framework, a relaxation error analysis can be developed avoiding constraints on the considered hypotheses class. Moreover, we show that in this setting it is possible to derive the first provably consistent regularized method with training/tuning complexity which is independent to the number of classes. Tools from convex analysis are introduced that can be used beyond the scope of this paper.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Sep 2012 18:22:25 GMT  (238kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1360v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 14 Sep 2012 14:14:53 GMT  (170kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1360v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["youssef mroueh", "tomaso a poggio", "lorenzo rosasco", "jean-jacques e slotine"], "accepted": true, "id": "1209.1360"}
