A New Model and the Kinetics Dataset", "abstract": "The paucity of videos in current action classification datasets (UCF-101 and HMDB-51) has made it difficult to identify good video architectures, as most methods obtain similar performance on existing small-scale benchmarks. This paper re-evaluates state-of-the-art architectures in light of the new Kinetics Human Action Video dataset. Kinetics has two orders of magnitude more data, with 400 human action classes and over 400 clips per class, and is collected from realistic, challenging YouTube videos. We provide an analysis on how current architectures fare on the task of action classification on this dataset and how much performance improves on the smaller benchmark datasets after pre-training on Kinetics.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 May 2017 13:57:53 GMT  (3229kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07750v1", "To appear at CVPR 2017"], ["v2", "Thu, 20 Jul 2017 15:24:03 GMT  (3228kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07750v2", "Added results on the full Kinetics dataset test set.
