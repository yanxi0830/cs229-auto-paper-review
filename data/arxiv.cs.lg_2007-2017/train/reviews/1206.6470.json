We present the first necessary and sufficient combinatorial conditions for matrices of arbitrary rank to be identifiable from a set of matrix entries, yielding theoretical constraints and new algorithms for the problem of matrix completion. We conclude by algorithmically evaluating the tightness of the given conditions and algorithms for practically relevant matrix sizes, showing that the algebraic-combinatoric approach can lead to improvements over state-of-the-art matrix completion methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (320kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6470v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DM cs.NA stat.ML", "authors": ["franz j kir\u00e1ly", "ryota tomioka"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6470"}
