While ML estimator works by (locally) maximizing the likelihood of the observed data, VT seeks to maximize the probability of the most likely hidden state sequence. We develop an analytical framework based on a generating function formalism and illustrate it on an exactly solvable model of HMM with one unambiguous symbol. For this particular model the ML objective function is continuously degenerate. VT objective, in contrast, is shown to have only finite degeneracy. Furthermore, VT converges faster and results in sparser (simpler) models, thus realizing an automatic Occam's razor for HMM learning. For more general scenario VT can be worse compared to ML but still capable of correctly recovering most of the parameters.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Dec 2013 21:03:28 GMT  (170kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4551v1", "Appeared in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "Appeared in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["armen e allahverdyan", "aram galstyan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1312.4551"}
