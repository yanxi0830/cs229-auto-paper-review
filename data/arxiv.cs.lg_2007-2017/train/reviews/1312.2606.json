It extends similar hypothesis spaces that have previously considered in the literature. Assuming this space, an improved Empirical Rademacher Complexity-based generalization bound is derived. The analysis is itself extended to an MKL setting. The connection between the proposed hypothesis space and a Group-Lasso type regularizer is discussed. Finally, experimental results, with some SVM-based Multi-Task Learning problems, underline the quality of the derived bounds and validate the paper's analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Dec 2013 21:27:23 GMT  (46kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2606v1", "18 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["cong li", "michael georgiopoulos", "georgios c anagnostopoulos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.2606"}
