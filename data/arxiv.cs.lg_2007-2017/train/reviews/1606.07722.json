The utilization of sequential patterns has boosted performance on several kinds of recommendation tasks. Inspired by natural language processing (NLP) techniques, we propose a novel neural network (NN) based next-song recommender, CNN-rec, in this paper. Then, we compare the proposed system with several NN based and classic recommendation systems on the next-song recommendation task. Verification results indicate the proposed system outperforms classic systems and has comparable performance with the state-of-the-art system.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 15:25:55 GMT  (3621kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07722v1", "5 pages, 3 figures, the 1st Workshop on Deep Learning for Recommender Systems (DLRS 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 3 figures, the 1st Workshop on Deep Learning for Recommender Systems (DLRS 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["kai-chun hsu", "szu-yu chou", "yi-hsuan yang", "tai-shih chi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07722"}
