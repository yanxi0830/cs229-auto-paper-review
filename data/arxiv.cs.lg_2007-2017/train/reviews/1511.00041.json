The objective is to minimize the number of experiments to discover the causal directions of all the edges in a causal graph. Previous work has focused on the use of separating systems for complete graphs for this task. We prove that any deterministic adaptive algorithm needs to be a separating system in order to learn complete graphs in the worst case. In addition, we present a novel separating system construction, whose size is close to optimal and is arguably simpler than previous work in combinatorics. We also develop a novel information theoretic lower bound on the number of interventions that applies in full generality, including for randomized adaptive learning algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 22:24:13 GMT  (61kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00041v1", "Accepted to NIPS 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to NIPS 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ML", "authors": ["karthikeyan shanmugam", "murat kocaoglu", "alexandros g dimakis", "sriram vishwanath"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.00041"}
