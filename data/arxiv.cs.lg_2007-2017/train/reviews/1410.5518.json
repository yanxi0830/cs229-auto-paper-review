We show a simple LSH for the problem, using a simple symmetric mapping, with better performance, both theoretically and empirically.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Oct 2014 02:00:34 GMT  (129kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5518v1", "9 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 24 Oct 2014 21:31:06 GMT  (161kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5518v2", "14 pages"], ["v3", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 19:30:35 GMT  (169kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5518v3", "11 pages, 3 figures, In Proceedings of The 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML)"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.DS cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["behnam neyshabur", "nathan srebro"], "accepted": true, "id": "1410.5518"}
