Here, by simulating the process of practice, we demonstrate both selective memory and selective forgetting when we introduce statistical recall biases during PSGD. Frequently recalled memories are remembered, whilst memories recalled rarely are forgotten. This results in a 'use it or lose it' stimulus driven memory process that is similar to human memory.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Sep 2015 15:12:00 GMT  (316kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03185v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1509.00913"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1509.00913", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["andrew j r simpson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.03185"}
