In both the average and worst cases of the maximum coverage setting, we prove that all $\\alpha$-approximate algorithms are robust (i.e., near $\\alpha$-approximate) if the utility is Lipschitz continuous in the prior. We further show that robustness may not be achieved if the utility is non-Lipschitz. This suggests we should use a Lipschitz utility for AL if robustness is required. For the minimum cost setting, we can also obtain a robustness result for approximate AL algorithms. Our results imply that many commonly used AL algorithms are robust against perturbed priors. We then propose the use of a mixture prior to alleviate the problem of prior misspecification. We analyze the robustness of the uniform mixture prior and show experimentally that it performs reasonably well in practice.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Mar 2016 06:21:42 GMT  (233kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09050v1", "This paper is published at AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper is published at AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["nguyen viet cuong", "nan ye", "wee sun lee"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.09050"}
