First, we show that the search space can be defined by an arbitrary imperative program, reducing the number of lines of code required to develop new structured prediction tasks by orders of magnitude. Second, we make structured prediction orders of magnitude faster through various algorithmic improvements.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 Jun 2014 00:24:42 GMT  (100kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1837v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 13 Jun 2014 13:16:36 GMT  (101kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1837v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 1 Jun 2015 23:44:33 GMT  (841kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1837v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 5 Jun 2015 16:26:05 GMT  (845kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1837v4", null], ["v5", "Wed, 1 Jun 2016 05:35:31 GMT  (622kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1837v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["kai-wei chang", "he he", "st\u00e9phane ross", "hal daum\u00e9 iii", "john langford"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.1837"}
