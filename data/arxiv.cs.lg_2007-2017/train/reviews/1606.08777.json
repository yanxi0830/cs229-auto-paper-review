Modeling reference with continuous representations is challenging because it requires individuation, i.e., tracking and distinguishing an arbitrary number of referents. We introduce a neural network model that, given a definite description and a set of objects represented by natural images, points to the intended object if the expression has a unique referent, or indicates a failure, if it does not. The model, directly trained on reference acts, is competitive with a pipeline manually engineered to perform the same task, both when referents are purely visual, and when they are characterized by a combination of visual and linguistic properties.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 16:31:50 GMT  (6442kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08777v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["gemma boleda", "sebastian pad\\'o", "marco baroni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.08777"}
