To this end, we demonstrate that hybrid planning with Tensorflow and RMSProp gradient descent is competitive with mixed integer linear program (MILP) based optimization on piecewise linear planning domains (where we can compute optimal solutions) and substantially outperforms state-of-the-art interior point methods for nonlinear planning domains. Furthermore, we remark that Tensorflow is highly scalable, converging to a strong policy on a large-scale concurrent domain with a total of 576,000 continuous actions over a horizon of 96 time steps in only 4 minutes. We provide a number of insights that clarify such strong performance including observations that despite long horizons, RMSProp avoids both the vanishing and exploding gradients problem. Together these results suggest a new frontier for highly scalable planning in nonlinear hybrid domains by leveraging GPUs and the power of recent advances in gradient descent with highly optmized toolkits like Tensorflow.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 01:52:45 GMT  (138kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07511v1", "8 pages"], ["v2", "Sat, 29 Apr 2017 17:58:42 GMT  (215kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07511v2", "8 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ga wu", "buser say", "scott sanner"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.07511"}
