In domains like clothing recommendation, this task is particularly challenging since a successful system should be capable of handling a large corpus of items, a huge amount of relationships among them, as well as the high-dimensional and semantically complicated features involved. Furthermore, the human notion of \"compatibility\" that we need to capture goes beyond mere similarity: For two items to be compatible---whether jeans and a t-shirt, or a laptop and a charger---they should be similar in some ways, but systematically different in others.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 07:22:30 GMT  (4709kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09473v1", "10 pages, 5 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 07:25:36 GMT  (4734kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09473v2", "11 pages, 5 figures"], ["v3", "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 00:43:21 GMT  (4734kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09473v3", "11 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["ruining he", "charles packer", "julian mcauley"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.09473"}
