Stochastic attention-based models have been shown to improve computational efficiency at test time, but they remain difficult to train because of intractable posterior inference and high variance in the stochastic gradient estimates. Borrowing techniques from the literature on training deep generative models, we present the Wake-Sleep Recurrent Attention Model, a method for training stochastic attention networks which improves posterior inference and which reduces the variability in the stochastic gradients. We show that our method can greatly speed up the training time for stochastic attention networks in the domains of image classification and caption generation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Sep 2015 23:52:30 GMT  (490kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06812v1", "To appear in NIPS 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in NIPS 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jimmy ba", "ruslan salakhutdinov", "roger b grosse", "brendan j frey"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.06812"}
