In this paper we propose a new class of algorithms for multiway spectral clustering based on optimization of a certain \"contrast function\" over a sphere. These algorithms are simple to implement, efficient and, unlike most of the existing algorithms for multiclass spectral clustering, are not initialization-dependent. Moreover, they are applicable without modification for normalized and un-normalized clustering, which are two common variants of spectral clustering.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Mar 2014 02:48:20 GMT  (854kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0667v1", "26 pages, 3 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 1 Oct 2015 21:59:05 GMT  (1057kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0667v2", "37 pages"], ["v3", "Wed, 4 May 2016 18:10:13 GMT  (2769kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0667v3", "22 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "26 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["james r voss", "mikhail belkin", "luis rademacher"], "accepted": true, "id": "1403.0667"}
