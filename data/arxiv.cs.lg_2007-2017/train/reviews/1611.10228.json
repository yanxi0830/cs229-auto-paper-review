A recent Choice Prediction Competition (2015) challenged researchers to suggest a model that captures 14 classic choice biases and can predict human decisions under risk and ambiguity. The competition focused on simple decision problems, in which human subjects were asked to repeatedly choose between two gamble options.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 15:44:57 GMT  (10kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10228v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GT", "authors": ["gali noti", "effi levi", "yoav kolumbus", "amit daniely"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.10228"}
