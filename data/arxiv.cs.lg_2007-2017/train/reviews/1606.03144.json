Various systems using word overlap, neural embeddings and neural compositional models are evaluated on two datasets of learner writing. We propose a new method for sentence-level similarity calculation, which learns to adjust the weights of pre-trained word embeddings for a specific task, achieving substantially higher accuracy compared to other relevant baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2016 23:42:45 GMT  (22kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03144v1", "Accepted for publication at BEA-2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for publication at BEA-2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["marek rei", "ronan cummins"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03144"}
