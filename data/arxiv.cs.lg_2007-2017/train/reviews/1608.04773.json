{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Aug-2016", "title": "Faster Principal Component Regression and Stable Matrix Chebyshev Approximation", "abstract": "We solve principle component regression (PCR) by providing an efficient algorithm to project any vector onto the subspace formed by the top principle components of a matrix. Our algorithm does not require any explicit construction of the top principle components, and therefore is suitable for large-scale PCR instances.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Aug 2016 20:48:02 GMT  (2532kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04773v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 19:35:38 GMT  (2557kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04773v2", "title changed and minor revisions"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.DS cs.LG math.NA math.OC", "authors": ["zeyuan allen-zhu", "yuanzhi li"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.04773"}
