It was proposed as an improvement to latent class analysis --- a method widely used in social sciences and medicine to identify homogeneous subgroups in a population. It provides new and fruitful perspectives on a number of machine learning areas, including cluster analysis, topic detection, and deep probabilistic modeling. This paper gives an overview of the research on latent tree analysis and various ways it is used in practice.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Oct 2016 04:26:48 GMT  (1383kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00085v1", "7 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["nevin l zhang", "leonard k m poon"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.00085"}
