These algorithms use weight sharing schemes to perform as well as the best sequence of experts with a limited number of changes. Here we show, with a common, general, and simpler analysis, that weight sharing in fact achieves much more than what it was designed for. We use it to simultaneously prove new shifting regret bounds for online convex optimization on the simplex in terms of the total variation distance as well as new bounds for the related setting of adaptive regret. Finally, we exhibit the first logarithmic shifting bounds for exp-concave loss functions on the simplex.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Feb 2012 14:39:42 GMT  (45kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3323v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 27 Sep 2012 19:39:42 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3323v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["nicol\u00f2 cesa-bianchi", "pierre gaillard", "g\u00e1bor lugosi", "gilles stoltz"], "accepted": true, "id": "1202.3323"}
