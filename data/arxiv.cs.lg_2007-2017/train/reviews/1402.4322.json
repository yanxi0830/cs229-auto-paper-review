Herein, we study some basic properties of two hierarchical clustering methods: $\\alpha$-unchaining single linkage or $SL(\\alpha)$ and a modified version of this one, $SL^*(\\alpha)$. We compare the results with the properties satisfied by the classical linkage-based hierarchical clustering methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Feb 2014 13:08:47 GMT  (256kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4322v1", "14 pages, 4 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1210.6292"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 4 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1210.6292", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["a mart\\'inez-p\\'erez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.4322"}
