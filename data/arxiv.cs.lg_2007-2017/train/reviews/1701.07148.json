However, they need a lot of memory and computational cost, which hinders them from running in relatively low-end smart devices such as smart phones. We propose a CNN compression method based on CP-decomposition and Tensor Power Method. We also propose an iterative fine tuning, with which we fine-tune the whole network after decomposing each layer, but before decomposing the next layer. Significant reduction in memory and computation cost is achieved compared to state-of-the-art previous work with no more accuracy loss.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 02:58:06 GMT  (3185kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07148v1", "Accepted as a conference paper at BigComp 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted as a conference paper at BigComp 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["marcella astrid", "seung-ik lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.07148"}
