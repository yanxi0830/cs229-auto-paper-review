However, all the previous studies have been done on the clean data without significant additive noise. To simulate the real-life scenarios, we perform a preliminary investigation of spoofing detection under additive noisy conditions, and also describe an initial database for this task. The noisy database is based on the ASVspoof challenge 2015 database and generated by artificially adding background noises at different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). Five different additive noises are included. Our preliminary results show that using the model trained from clean data, the system performance degrades significantly in noisy conditions. Phase-based feature is more noise robust than magnitude-based features. And the systems perform significantly differ under different noise scenarios.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 Feb 2016 12:00:56 GMT  (2229kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02950v1", "Submitted to Odyssey: The Speaker and Language Recognition Workshop 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to Odyssey: The Speaker and Language Recognition Workshop 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SD", "authors": ["xiaohai tian", "zhizheng wu", "xiong xiao", "eng siong chng", "haizhou li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.02950"}
