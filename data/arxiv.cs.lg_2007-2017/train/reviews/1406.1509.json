The effectiveness of such networks depends on their architecture, which is determined by the placement of constituent n-tuples, sequences of board locations, providing input to the network. The most popular method of placing n-tuples consists in randomly generating a small number of long, snake-shaped board location sequences. In comparison, we show that learning n-tuple networks is significantly more effective if they involve a large number of systematically placed, short, straight n-tuples. Moreover, we demonstrate that in order to obtain the best performance and the steepest learning curve for Othello it is enough to use n-tuples of size just 2, yielding a network consisting of only 288 weights. The best such network evolved in this study has been evaluated in the online Othello League, obtaining the performance of nearly 96% --- more than any other player to date.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 Jun 2014 20:10:48 GMT  (318kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1509v1", "8 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables"], ["v2", "Tue, 24 Jun 2014 10:06:29 GMT  (318kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1509v2", "Fixed a typo ($\\eps=0.01$ instead of $\\eps=0.1$ on page 8"], ["v3", "Wed, 25 Jun 2014 20:12:19 GMT  (318kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1509v3", "Added technical report number"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["wojciech ja\\'skowski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.1509"}
