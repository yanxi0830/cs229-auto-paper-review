The proposed algorithm combines state aggregation with the use of upper confidence bounds for implementing optimism in the face of uncertainty. Beside the existence of an optimal policy which satisfies the Poisson equation, the only assumptions made are Holder continuity of rewards and transition probabilities.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Feb 2013 17:44:10 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2550v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ronald ortner", "daniil ryabko"], "accepted": true, "id": "1302.2550"}
