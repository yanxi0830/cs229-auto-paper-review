We describe two algorithms for solving this problem, one exact and one a top-down novel approach, and we derive a consistency results for the case of two segments and no outliers. Robustness to outliers is evaluated on two real-world tasks related to speech segmentation. Our algorithms outperform baseline segmentation algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Nov 2014 14:59:25 GMT  (127kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4503v1", "Accepted to AAAI-15, this version includes the appendix/supplementary material referenced in the AAAI-15 submission"], ["v2", "Tue, 18 Nov 2014 07:59:33 GMT  (127kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4503v2", "* Accepted to AAAI-15, this version includes the appendix/supplementary material referenced in the AAAI-15 submission, as well as color figures * This version include some minor typos correction"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to AAAI-15, this version includes the appendix/supplementary material referenced in the AAAI-15 submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["itamar katz", "koby crammer"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.4503"}
