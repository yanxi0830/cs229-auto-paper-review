The optimization problems change slowly in the sense that the minimizers change at either a fixed or bounded rate. A method based on estimates of the change in the minimizers and properties of the optimization algorithm is introduced for adaptively selecting the number of samples needed from the distributions underlying each problem in order to ensure that the excess risk, i.e., the expected gap between the loss achieved by the approximate minimizer produced by the optimization algorithm and the exact minimizer, does not exceed a target level. Experiments with synthetic and real data are used to confirm that this approach performs well.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Sep 2015 16:19:43 GMT  (276kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07422v1", "submitted to ICASSP 2016, extended version"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to ICASSP 2016, extended version", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["craig wilson", "venugopal v veeravalli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.07422"}
