The proposed method is shown to converge almost surely to the optimal classifier at a rate that is linear in expectation. Numerical results show that the proposed method exhibits a convergence rate that degrades smoothly with the dimensionality of the feature vectors.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Feb 2014 01:44:33 GMT  (90kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4861v1", "5 pages, To appear in International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP) 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, To appear in International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP) 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["aryan mokhtari", "alejandro ribeiro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.4861"}
