The bound is relevant to the estimation of nonlinear transformations or the analysis of learning algorithms whenever hypotheses are chosen from composite classes, as is the case for multi-layer models.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Nov 2014 21:41:32 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2635v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["andreas maurer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.2635"}
