{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "27-Sep-2015", "title": "Discriminative Learning of the Prototype Set for Nearest Neighbor Classification", "abstract": "The nearest neighbor classifier is one of the most widely used models for classification. The selection of prototype instances is an important problem for its applications, as the efficiency of the model largely depends on the compactness of the prototype set. The existing studies on prototype selection have been primarily motivated by instance-based analyses of the class distribution and consistency among local neighbors. In this paper, we explore an approximation and a parametrization of the nearest neighbor rule, which allows us to formulate the violation of the rule over the training set with regards to the prototypes and take advantage of a discriminative learning principle. We show that our approach reduces to a large-margin learning based on a sparse representation of the relations among the neighbors. We demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm by empirical comparison with the recent state-of-the-art methods over a collection of public benchmarks.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 27 Sep 2015 15:43:33 GMT  (94kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08102v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 31 Dec 2015 00:44:17 GMT  (105kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08102v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 5 Jan 2016 07:49:27 GMT  (105kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08102v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 17 Jan 2016 11:54:57 GMT  (117kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08102v4", null], ["v5", "Sun, 21 Aug 2016 14:40:20 GMT  (763kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08102v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["shin", "o"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.08102"}
