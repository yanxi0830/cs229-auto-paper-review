We describe several initializations of weights in 3D Convolutional Layers of Spatio-Temporal ConvNet using 2D Convolutional Weights learned from ImageNet. We show that it is important to initialize 3D Convolutional Weights judiciously in order to learn temporal representations of videos. We evaluate our methods on the UCF-101 dataset and demonstrate improvement over Spatial ConvNets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Mar 2015 03:41:47 GMT  (483kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07274v1", "Technical Report"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical Report", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["elman mansimov", "nitish srivastava", "ruslan salakhutdinov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.07274"}
