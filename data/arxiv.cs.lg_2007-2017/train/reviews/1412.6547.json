For these problems, label embeddings have been shown to be a useful primitive that can improve computational and statistical efficiency. In this work we utilize a correspondence between rank constrained estimation and low dimensional label embeddings that uncovers fast label embedding algorithms and provides us with a unifying view of label embeddings in the multiclass and multilabel settings. Leveraging techniques from randomized linear algebra, the running time of our label embedding algorithm is exponentially faster than naive algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate our techniques on two datasets from the Large Scale Hierarchical Text Challenge and the Open Directory Project where we obtain state of the art results.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Dec 2014 22:09:35 GMT  (81kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6547v1", "In submission for ICLR 2015"], ["v2", "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 23:29:44 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6547v2", "In submission for ICLR 2015"], ["v3", "Mon, 23 Mar 2015 16:11:14 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6547v3", "Accepted as a workshop contribution at ICLR 2015"], ["v4", "Mon, 30 Mar 2015 23:24:53 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6547v4", null], ["v5", "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 00:29:44 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6547v5", null], ["v6", "Mon, 15 Jun 2015 18:07:20 GMT  (67kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6547v6", "To appear in the proceedings of the ECML/PKDD 2015 conference"], ["v7", "Sun, 5 Jul 2015 15:38:11 GMT  (67kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6547v7", "To appear in the proceedings of the ECML/PKDD 2015 conference.
