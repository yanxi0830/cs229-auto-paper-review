The traditional methods to solve this problem usually learns one single predictor for all the data points, and ignores the variety of the different data points. Different parts of the data set may have different local distributions, and requires different optimal local predictors. To overcome this disadvantage of existing methods, we propose to learn different local predictors for neighborhoods of different data points, and the missing structured outputs simultaneously. In the neighborhood of each data point, we proposed to learn a linear predictor by minimizing both the complexity of the predictor and the upper bound of the structured prediction loss. The minimization is conducted by gradient descent algorithms. Experiments over four benchmark data sets, including DDSM mammography medical images, SUN natural image data set, Cora research paper data set, and Spanish news wire article sentence data set, show the advantages of the proposed method.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Apr 2016 15:53:04 GMT  (568kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03010v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["xin du"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.03010"}
