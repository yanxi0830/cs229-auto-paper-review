The aim of the design is to provide an easy-to-understand, easy-to-use and efficient computational platform for deep learning research. The implemented framework supports major deep learning architectures such as Multilayer Perceptron Networks (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The framework also supports both CPU and GPU for computation and the switch between them is straightforward. Different applications in computer vision, natural language processing and robotics are demonstrated as experiments.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 May 2016 20:33:30 GMT  (114kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02766v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 13 May 2016 00:20:14 GMT  (114kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02766v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 2 Aug 2016 04:00:30 GMT  (118kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02766v3", "Accepted to ACM MULTIMEDIA 2016 Open Source Software Competition"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["chengxi ye", "chen zhao", "yezhou yang", "cornelia fermuller", "yiannis aloimonos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.02766"}
