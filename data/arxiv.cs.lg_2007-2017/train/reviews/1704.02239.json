We know that a set of k nodes embedding all k-bandlimited signals always exists, thereby enabling their perfect reconstruction after sampling. Unfortunately, to exhibit such a set, one needs to partially diagonalize the graph Laplacian, which becomes prohibitive at large scale. We propose a novel strategy based on determinantal point processes that side-steps partial diagonalisation and enables reconstruction with only O(k) samples. While doing so, we exhibit a new general algorithm to sample determinantal process, faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm by an order k.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Apr 2017 14:11:36 GMT  (352kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02239v1", "in French"], ["v2", "Wed, 5 Jul 2017 09:34:13 GMT  (353kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02239v2", "in French"]], "COMMENTS": "in French", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.DM cs.LG", "authors": ["nicolas tremblay", "simon barthelme", "pierre-olivier amblard cnrs", "gipsa-cics cnrs", "gipsa-vibs)"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.02239"}
