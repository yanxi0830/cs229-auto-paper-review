{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Nov-2015", "title": "On Binary Embedding using Circulant Matrices", "abstract": "Binary embeddings provide efficient and powerful ways to perform operations on large scale data. However binary embedding typically requires long codes in order to preserve the discriminative power of the input space. Thus binary coding methods traditionally suffer from high computation and storage costs in such a scenario. To address this problem, we propose Circulant Binary Embedding (CBE) which generates binary codes by projecting the data with a circulant matrix. The circulant structure allows us to use Fast Fourier Transform algorithms to speed up the computation. For obtaining $k$-bit binary codes from $d$-dimensional data, this improves the time complexity from $O(dk)$ to $O(d\\log{d})$, and the space complexity from $O(dk)$ to $O(d)$.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 03:05:15 GMT  (120kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06480v1", "This is an extended version of a paper by the first, third, fourth and fifth authors that appeared in ICML 2014 [arXiv:1405.3162]"], ["v2", "Sat, 5 Dec 2015 02:36:10 GMT  (419kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06480v2", "This is an extended version of a paper by the first, third, fourth and fifth authors that appeared in ICML 2014 [arXiv:1405.3162]"]], "COMMENTS": "This is an extended version of a paper by the first, third, fourth and fifth authors that appeared in ICML 2014 [arXiv:1405.3162]", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["felix x yu", "aditya bhaskara", "sanjiv kumar", "yunchao gong", "shih-fu chang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06480"}
