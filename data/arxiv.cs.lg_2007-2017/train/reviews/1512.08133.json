This is directly motivated by applications like medical diagnosis and fraud risk assessment, in which incorrect predictions have potentially calamitous consequences. We focus on a recent spate of theoretically driven work in this area that characterizes how allowing abstentions can lead to fewer errors in very general settings. Two areas are highlighted: the surprising possibility of zero-error learning, and the fundamental tradeoff between predicting sufficiently often and avoiding incorrect predictions. We review efficient algorithms with provable guarantees for each of these areas. We also discuss connections to other scenarios, notably active learning, as they suggest promising directions of further inquiry in this emerging field.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 26 Dec 2015 19:02:00 GMT  (630kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08133v1", "Short survey"]], "COMMENTS": "Short survey", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["akshay balsubramani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.08133"}
