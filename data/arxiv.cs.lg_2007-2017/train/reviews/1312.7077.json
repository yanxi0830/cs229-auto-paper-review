{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "26-Dec-2013", "title": "Language Modeling with Power Low Rank Ensembles", "abstract": "We present power low rank ensembles, a flexible framework for n-gram language modeling where ensembles of low rank matrices and tensors are used to obtain smoothed probability estimates of words in context. Our method is a generalization of n-gram modeling to non-integer n, and includes standard techniques such as absolute discounting and Kneser-Ney smoothing as special cases. On English and Russian evaluation sets, we obtain noticeably lower perplexities relative to state-of-the-art modified Kneser-Ney and class-based n-gram models.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Dec 2013 09:45:02 GMT  (38kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7077v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 3 Oct 2014 08:28:03 GMT  (157kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7077v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["ankur p parikh", "avneesh saluja", "chris dyer", "eric p xing"], "accepted": true, "id": "1312.7077"}
