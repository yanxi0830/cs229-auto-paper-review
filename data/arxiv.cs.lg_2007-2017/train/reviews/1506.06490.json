Our approach applies convolution neural networks (CNNs) to learning the joint representation of question-answer pair firstly, and then uses the joint representation as input of the long short-term memory (LSTM) to learn the answer sequence of a question for labeling the matching quality of each answer. Experiments conducted on the SemEval 2015 CQA dataset shows the effectiveness of our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Jun 2015 07:26:51 GMT  (231kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06490v1", "6 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["xiaoqiang zhou", "baotian hu", "qingcai chen", "buzhou tang", "xiaolong wang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.06490"}
