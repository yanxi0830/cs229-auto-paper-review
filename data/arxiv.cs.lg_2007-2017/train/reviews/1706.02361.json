However, there are several open questions regarding generalisation and best practices in the choice of network architectures, hyper-parameters and input representations. In this article, we investigate specific aspects of neural networks to deepen our understanding of their properties. We analyse and (re-)validate a large music tagging dataset to investigate the reliability of training and evaluation. We perform comprehensive experiments involving audio preprocessing using different time-frequency representations, logarithmic magnitude compression, frequency weighting and scaling. Using a trained network, we compute label vector similarities which is compared to groundtruth similarity.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Jun 2017 19:54:39 GMT  (316kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02361v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 10 Sep 2017 23:47:42 GMT  (185kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02361v2", "The section that overlapped witharXiv:1709.01922is completely removed in this version.
