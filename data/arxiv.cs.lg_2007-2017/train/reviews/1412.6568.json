We show that the neighbourhoods of the mapped elements are strongly polluted by hubs, vectors that tend to be near a high proportion of items, pushing their correct labels down the neighbour list. After illustrating the problem empirically, we propose a simple method to correct it by taking the proximity distribution of potential neighbours across many mapped vectors into account. We show that this correction leads to consistent improvements in realistic zero-shot experiments in the cross-lingual, image labeling and image retrieval domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 Dec 2014 01:03:46 GMT  (1038kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6568v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 10 Mar 2015 14:15:13 GMT  (1039kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6568v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 15 Apr 2015 13:10:07 GMT  (1039kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6568v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["georgiana dinu", "angeliki lazaridou", "marco baroni"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.6568"}
