The word-to-vector representation is used, and convolutional neural networks are employed as sentence encoders, mapping an input sentence into a fixed-length vector. This representation is decoded using long short-term memory recurrent neural networks, considering several tasks, such as reconstructing the input sentence, or predicting the future sentence. We further describe a hierarchical encoder-decoder model to encode a sentence to predict multiple future sentences. By training our models on a large collection of novels, we obtain a highly generic convolutional sentence encoder that performs well in practice. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets, and across a broad range of applications, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over competing methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Nov 2016 17:32:23 GMT  (213kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07897v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 26 Jul 2017 20:48:52 GMT  (275kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07897v2", "Accepted by EMNLP 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["zhe gan", "yunchen pu", "ricardo henao", "chunyuan li", "xiaodong he", "lawrence carin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.07897"}
