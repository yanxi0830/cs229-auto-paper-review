Technological advances have made it possible for transportation systems to collect large volumes of varied data on an unprecedented scale. We propose a traffic signal control system which takes advantage of this new, high quality data, with minimal abstraction compared to other proposed systems. We apply modern deep reinforcement learning methods to build a truly adaptive traffic signal control agent in the traffic microsimulator SUMO. We propose a new state space, the discrete traffic state encoding, which is information dense. The discrete traffic state encoding is used as input to a deep convolutional neural network, trained using Q-learning with experience replay. Our agent was compared against a one hidden layer neural network traffic signal control agent and reduces average cumulative delay by 82%, average queue length by 66% and average travel time by 20%.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Nov 2016 19:46:19 GMT  (1981kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01142v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SY", "authors": ["wade genders", "saiedeh razavi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01142"}
