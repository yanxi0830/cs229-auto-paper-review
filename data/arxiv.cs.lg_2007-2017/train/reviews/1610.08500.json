More specifically, we introduce a modeling formalism in which both a human and an autonomy protocol can issue commands to a robot towards performing a certain task. These commands are blended into a joint input to the robot. The autonomy protocol is synthesized using an abstraction of possible human commands accounting for randomness in decisions caused by factors such as fatigue or incomprehensibility of the problem at hand. The synthesis is designed to ensure that the resulting robot behavior satisfies given safety and performance specifications, e.g., in temporal logic. Our solution is based on nonlinear programming and we address the inherent scalability issue by presenting alternative methods. We assess the feasibility and the scalability of the approach by an experimental evaluation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Oct 2016 19:49:09 GMT  (1170kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.08500v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["nils jansen", "murat cubuktepe", "ufuk topcu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.08500"}
