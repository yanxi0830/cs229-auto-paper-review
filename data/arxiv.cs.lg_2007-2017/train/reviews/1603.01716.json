While other ensemble creation techniques are based on careful selection of existing classifiers or preprocessing of the data, the presented approach automatically creates an optimal labelling for a number of classifiers, which are then assigned to the original data instances and fed to classifiers. The approach has been evaluated on high-dimensional biomedical datasets. The results show that the approach outperformed individual approaches in all cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 5 Mar 2016 12:01:00 GMT  (2526kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01716v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["b\\'alint antal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.01716"}
