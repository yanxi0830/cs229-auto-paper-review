Online popularity of a user or product (via follows, page-likes, etc.) can be monetized on the premise of higher ad click-through rates or increased sales. Web services and social networks which incentivize popularity thus suffer from a major problem of fake connections from link fraudsters looking to make a quick buck. Typical methods of catching this suspicious behavior use spectral techniques to spot large groups of often blatantly fraudulent (but sometimes honest) users. However, small-scale, stealthy attacks may go unnoticed due to the nature of low-rank eigenanalysis used in practice.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Oct 2014 03:10:26 GMT  (2156kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3915v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IR cs.SI", "authors": ["neil shah", "alex beutel", "brian gallagher", "christos faloutsos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.3915"}
