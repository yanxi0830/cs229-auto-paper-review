While there is a large literature on empirical approaches to selecting the best algorithm for a given application domain, there has been surprisingly little theoretical analysis of the problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Nov 2015 09:30:19 GMT  (507kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07147v1", "28 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 2 Sep 2016 21:06:20 GMT  (520kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07147v2", "28 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "28 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["rishi gupta", "tim roughgarden"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.07147"}
