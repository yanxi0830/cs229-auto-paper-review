Process Mining consists of mining event logs generated from PAIS for process model discovery, conformance and enhancement. We apply process map discovery techniques to mine event trace data generated from ITS of open source Firefox browser project to generate and study process models. Bug life-cycle consists of diversity and variance. Therefore, the process models generated from the event-logs are spaghetti-like with large number of edges, inter-connections and nodes. Such models are complex to analyse and difficult to comprehend by a process analyst. We improve the Goodness (fitness and structural complexity) of the process models by splitting the event-log into homogeneous subsets by clustering structurally similar traces. We adapt the K-Medoid clustering algorithm with two different distance metrics: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). We evaluate the goodness of the process models generated from the clusters using complexity and fitness metrics. We study back-forth \\&amp; self-loops, bug reopening, and bottleneck in the clusters obtained and show that clustering enables better analysis. We also propose an algorithm to automate the clustering process -the algorithm takes as input the event log and returns the best cluster set.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 Nov 2015 15:43:29 GMT  (997kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07023v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.LG", "authors": ["prerna juneja", "divya kundra", "ashish sureka"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.07023"}
