Recently, a few deep learning models have surpassed the traditional window based multilayer perceptron. Taking inspiration from the image classification domain we propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture, MUST-CNN, to predict protein properties. This architecture uses a novel multilayer shift-and-stitch (MUST) technique to generate fully dense per-position predictions on protein sequences. Our model is significantly simpler than the state-of-the-art, yet achieves better results. By combining MUST and the efficient convolution operation, we can consider far more parameters while retaining very fast prediction speeds. We beat the state-of-the-art performance on two large protein property prediction datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 May 2016 13:31:52 GMT  (171kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03004v1", "8 pages ; 3 figures ; deep learning based sequence-sequence prediction. in AAAI 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages ; 3 figures ; deep learning based sequence-sequence prediction. in AAAI 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["zeming lin", "jack lanchantin", "yanjun qi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.03004"}
