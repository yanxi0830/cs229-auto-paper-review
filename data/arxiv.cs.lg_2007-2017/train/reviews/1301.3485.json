In this paper, we present a new neural network architecture designed to embed multi-relational graphs into a flexible continuous vector space in which the original data is kept and enhanced. The network is trained to encode the semantics of these graphs in order to assign high probabilities to plausible components. We empirically show that it reaches competitive performance in link prediction on standard datasets from the literature.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Jan 2013 20:52:50 GMT  (12kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3485v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 21 Mar 2013 17:02:48 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3485v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["xavier glorot", "antoine bordes", "jason weston", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3485"}
