The vast growth of information on the Internet as well as number of visitors to websites add some key challenges to recommender systems. These are: producing accurate recommendation, handling many recommendations efficiently and coping with the vast growth of number of participants in the system. Therefore, new recommender system technologies are needed that can quickly produce high quality recommendations even for huge data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Jun 2010 07:20:28 GMT  (1267kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5278v1", "11 pages. 5 figures. project report"], ["v2", "Wed, 30 Jun 2010 07:37:17 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5278v2", "This paper needs completion"], ["v3", "Mon, 13 Sep 2010 04:16:30 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5278v3", "This paper needs completion"], ["v4", "Fri, 24 Dec 2010 07:22:48 GMT  (1267kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.5278v4", "This paper has some typos in it"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages. 5 figures. project report", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["dhoha almazro", "ghadeer shahatah", "lamia albdulkarim", "mona kherees", "romy martinez", "william nzoukou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.5278"}
