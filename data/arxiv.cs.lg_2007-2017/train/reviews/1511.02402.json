The goal of this study is to select a good \"quality\", bounded-size subset of a given set of items, while maintaining their diversity relative to a semi-metric distance function. This problem was first studied by Borodin et al\\cite{borodin}, but a crucial property used throughout their proof is the triangle inequality. In this modified proof, we want to relax the triangle inequality and relate the approximation ratio of max-sum diversification problem to the parameter of the relaxed triangle inequality in the normal form of the problem (i.e., a uniform matroid) and also in an arbitrary matroid.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 Nov 2015 20:56:51 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02402v1", "This article draws heavily fromarXiv:1203.6397by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "This article draws heavily fromarXiv:1203.6397by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["sepehr abbasi zadeh", "mehrdad ghadiri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.02402"}
