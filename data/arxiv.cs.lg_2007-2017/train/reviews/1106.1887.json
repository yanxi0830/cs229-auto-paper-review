In particular, we observe the time evolution of some variables, and never observe other variables; from this, we would like to find the dependency structure between the observed variables -- separating out the spurious interactions caused by the (marginalizing out of the) latent variables' time series. We develop a new method, based on convex optimization, to do so in the case when the number of latent variables is smaller than the number of observed ones. For the case when the dependency structure between the observed variables is sparse, we theoretically establish a high-dimensional scaling result for structure recovery. We verify our theoretical result with both synthetic and real data (from the stock market).", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2011 19:34:29 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1887v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 25 Feb 2012 02:03:33 GMT  (1654kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1887v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 16 Mar 2012 16:18:16 GMT  (1656kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1887v3", null], ["v4", "Tue, 1 May 2012 04:30:11 GMT  (1656kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1887v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ali jalali", "sujay sanghavi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1106.1887"}
