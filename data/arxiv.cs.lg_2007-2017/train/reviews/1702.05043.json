{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Feb-2017", "title": "Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization", "abstract": "The novel Unbiased Online Recurrent Optimization (UORO) algorithm allows for online learning of general recurrent computational graphs such as recurrent network models. It works in a streaming fashion and avoids backtracking through past activations and inputs. UORO is a modification of NoBackTrack that bypasses the need for model sparsity and makes implementation easy in current deep learning frameworks, even for complex models. Computationally, UORO is as costly as Truncated Backpropagation Through Time (TBPTT). Contrary to TBPTT, UORO is guaranteed to provide unbiased gradient estimates, and does not favor short-term dependencies. The downside is added noise, requiring smaller learning rates.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Feb 2017 16:38:08 GMT  (154kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05043v1", "11 pages, 5 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 27 Mar 2017 15:29:33 GMT  (157kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05043v2", "11 pages, 5 figures"], ["v3", "Tue, 23 May 2017 11:42:03 GMT  (251kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05043v3", "11 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["corentin tallec", "yann ollivier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.05043"}
