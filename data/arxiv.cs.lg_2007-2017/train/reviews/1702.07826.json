We describe a rationalization technique that uses neural machine translation to translate internal state-action representations of the autonomous agent into natural language. We evaluate our technique in the Frogger game environment. The natural language is collected from human players thinking out loud as they play the game. We motivate the use of rationalization as an approach to explanation generation, show the results of experiments on the accuracy of our rationalization technique, and describe future research agenda.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 25 Feb 2017 03:20:49 GMT  (183kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07826v1", "9 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.HC cs.LG", "authors": ["brent harrison", "upol ehsan", "mark o riedl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07826"}
