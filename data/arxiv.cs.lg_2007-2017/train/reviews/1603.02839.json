In this context, we investigate strategies for dynamically increasing the effective sample size, when using iterative methods such as stochastic gradient descent. Our interest is motivated by the rise of variance-reduced methods, which achieve linear convergence rates that scale favorably for smaller sample sizes. Exploiting this feature, we show -- theoretically and empirically -- how to obtain significant speed-ups with a novel algorithm that reaches statistical accuracy on an $n$-sample in $2n$, instead of $n \\log n$ steps.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Mar 2016 10:52:53 GMT  (561kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02839v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 7 Oct 2016 12:33:13 GMT  (774kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02839v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hadi daneshmand", "aurelien lucchi", "thomas hofmann"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.02839"}
