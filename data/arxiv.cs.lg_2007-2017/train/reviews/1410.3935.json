Our intension is first to provide a unified approach to CRFs for complex modeling through the use of a Turing complete language and second to offer a convenient way of realizing generative-discriminative pairs in machine learning to compare generative and discriminative models and choose the best model. We implemented our approach as the D-PRISM language by modifying PRISM, a logic-based probabilistic modeling language for generative modeling, while exploiting its dynamic programming mechanism for efficient probability computation. We tested D-PRISM with logistic regression, a linear-chain CRF and a CRF-CFG and empirically confirmed their excellent discriminative performance compared to their generative counterparts, i.e.\\ naive Bayes, an HMM and a PCFG. We also introduced new CRF models, CRF-BNCs and CRF-LCGs. They are CRF versions of Bayesian network classifiers and probabilistic left-corner grammars respectively and easily implementable in D-PRISM. We empirically showed that they outperform their generative counterparts as expected.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Oct 2014 06:01:03 GMT  (148kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3935v1", "20 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["taisuke sato", "keiichi kubota", "yoshitaka kameya"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.3935"}
