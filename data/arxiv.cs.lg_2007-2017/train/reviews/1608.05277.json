Several problems, however, will have an effect in other application areas. The most fundamental problem is the propagation of error in the product of probabilities. This is a common and pervasive problem which deserves more attention. On the basis of Monte Carlo modeling, tables for the expected relative error are given. It seems that it is distributed according to a continuous Poisson distribution over log probabilities. A second essential problem is related to the appropriateness of the Markov assumption. Basic tests will reveal whether a problem requires modeling of the stochastics of seriality, at all. Examples are given of lexical encodings which cover 95-99% classification accuracy of a lexicon, with removed sequence information, for several European languages. Finally, a summary of results on a non- Bayes, non-Markov method in handwriting recognition are presented, with very acceptable results and minimal modeling or training requirements using nearest-mean classification. The suggestion is to keep considering the design of features and exploiting the power and convenience of nearest-neighbour search on contemporary computing platforms.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Aug 2016 14:32:04 GMT  (113kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05277v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 28 Oct 2016 17:21:36 GMT  (119kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05277v2", "Difference of v2.6 with v2.3: a) Changed title to be less provocative. b) Added results on the effect of string classification in a dictionary tree task"], ["v3", "Tue, 3 Jan 2017 12:31:30 GMT  (116kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05277v3", "Difference of v2.8 with v2.7: a) Final empirical (simulation) table for word-trie experiment with epsilon-in-the-probabilities; b) Some small text changes; c) used ispell"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["lambert schomaker"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.05277"}
