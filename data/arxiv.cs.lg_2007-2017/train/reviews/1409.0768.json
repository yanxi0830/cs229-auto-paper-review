Side effects that occur in more than one in a thousand patients are likely to be signalled efficiently by current drug surveillance methods, however, these same methods may take decades before generating signals for rarer side effects, risking medical morbidity or mortality in patients prescribed the drug while the rare side effect is undiscovered. In this paper we propose a novel computational meta-analysis framework for signalling rare side effects that integrates existing methods, knowledge from the web, metric learning and semi-supervised clustering. The novel framework was able to signal many known rare and serious side effects for the selection of drugs investigated, such as tendon rupture when prescribed Ciprofloxacin or Levofloxacin, renal failure with Naproxen and depression associated with Rimonabant. Furthermore, for the majority of the drug investigated it generated signals for rare side effects at a more stringent signalling threshold than existing methods and shows the potential to become a fundamental part of post marketing surveillance to detect rare side effects.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Sep 2014 16:00:23 GMT  (773kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0768v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE", "authors": ["jenna reps", "jonathan m garibaldi", "uwe aickelin", "daniele soria", "jack e gibson", "richard b hubbard"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.0768"}
