The redundancy of the parameters, especially weights of the convolutional filters in convolutional neural networks has been extensively studied and different heuristics have been proposed to construct a low rank basis of the filters after training. In this work, we train flattened networks that consist of consecutive sequence of one-dimensional filters across all directions in 3D space to obtain comparable performance as conventional convolutional networks. We tested flattened model on different datasets and found that the flattened layer can effectively substitute for the 3D filters without loss of accuracy. The flattened convolution pipelines provide around two times speed-up during feedforward pass compared to the baseline model due to the significant reduction of learning parameters. Furthermore, the proposed method does not require efforts in manual tuning or post processing once the model is trained.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Dec 2014 16:48:54 GMT  (136kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5474v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 20:36:05 GMT  (188kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5474v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 6 Apr 2015 01:40:08 GMT  (183kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5474v3", "International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2015"], ["v4", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 05:50:23 GMT  (183kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5474v4", "International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["jonghoon jin", "aysegul dundar", "eugenio culurciello"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.5474"}
