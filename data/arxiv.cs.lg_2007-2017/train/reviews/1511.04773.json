Although there exist closed-form solution to the KCCA objective by solving an $N\\times N$ eigenvalue system where $N$ is the training set size, the computational requirements of this approach in both memory and time prohibit its usage in the large scale. Various approximation techniques have been developed for KCCA. A recently proposed approach is to first transform original inputs to a $M$-dimensional feature space using random kitchen sinks so that inner product in the feature space approximates the kernel function, and then apply linear CCA to the transformed inputs. In challenging applications, however, the dimensionality $M$ of the feature space may need to be very large in order to reveal the nonlinear correlations, and then it becomes non-trivial to solve linear CCA for data matrices of very high dimensionality. We propose to use the recently proposed stochastic optimization algorithm for linear CCA and its neural-network extension to further alleviate the computation requirements of approximate KCCA. This approach allows us to run approximate KCCA on a speech dataset with $1.4$ million training samples and random feature space of dimensionality $M=100000$ on a normal workstation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 Nov 2015 22:20:02 GMT  (46kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04773v1", "Submission to ICLR 2016"], ["v2", "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 16:31:14 GMT  (46kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04773v2", "Submission to ICLR 2016"], ["v3", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 00:27:20 GMT  (49kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04773v3", "Submission to ICLR 2016"], ["v4", "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 16:04:46 GMT  (49kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04773v4", "Published as a conference paper at International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Submission to ICLR 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["weiran wang", "karen livescu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.04773"}
