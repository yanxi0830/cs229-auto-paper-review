While this task is a well-studied problem in OCR, our method takes an inherently different, data-driven approach. Our model does not require any knowledge of the underlying markup language, and is simply trained end-to-end on real-world example data. The model employs a convolutional network for text and layout recognition in tandem with an attention-based neural machine translation system. To train and evaluate the model, we introduce a new dataset of real-world rendered mathematical expressions paired with LaTeX markup, as well as a synthetic dataset of web pages paired with HTML snippets. Experimental results show that the system is surprisingly effective at generating accurate markup for both datasets. While a standard domain-specific LaTeX OCR system achieves around 25% accuracy, our model reproduces the exact rendered image on 75% of examples.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Sep 2016 08:14:50 GMT  (814kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04938v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:48:53 GMT  (323kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04938v2", "Accepted by ICML 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["yuntian deng", "anssi kanervisto", "jeffrey ling", "alexander m rush"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.04938"}
