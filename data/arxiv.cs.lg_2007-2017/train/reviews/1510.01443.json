Magnitude spectrum has been a dominant feature over the years. Although perceptual studies have shown that phase spectrum is essential to the quality of synthesized speech, it is often ignored by using a minimum phase filter during synthesis and the speech quality suffers. To bypass this bottleneck in vocoded speech, this paper proposes a phase-embedded waveform representation framework and establishes a magnitude-phase joint modeling platform for high-quality SPSS. Our experiments on waveform reconstruction show that the performance is better than that of the widely-used STRAIGHT. Furthermore, the proposed modeling and synthesis platform outperforms a leading-edge, vocoded, deep bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural network (DBLSTM-RNN)-based baseline system in various objective evaluation metrics conducted.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Oct 2015 06:12:31 GMT  (553kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.01443v1", "accepted and will appear in APSIPA2015; keywords: speech synthesis, LSTM-RNN, vocoder, phase, waveform, modeling"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted and will appear in APSIPA2015; keywords: speech synthesis, LSTM-RNN, vocoder, phase, waveform, modeling", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.LG", "authors": ["bo fan", "siu wa lee", "xiaohai tian", "lei xie", "minghui dong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.01443"}
