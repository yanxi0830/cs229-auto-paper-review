It is theoretically possible for an autonomous system with sufficient sensor and effector capability and using reinforcement learning to learn that the kill switch deprives it of long-term reward and learn to act to disable the switch or otherwise prevent a human operator from using the switch. This is referred to as the big red button problem. We present a technique which prevents a reinforcement learning agent from learning to disable the big red button. Our technique interrupts the agent or robot by placing it in a virtual simulation where it continues to receive reward. We illustrate our technique in a simple grid world environment.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Mar 2017 01:35:01 GMT  (47kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10284v1", "7 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["mark o riedl", "brent harrison"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.10284"}
