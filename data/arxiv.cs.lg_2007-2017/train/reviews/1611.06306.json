We learn a CNN model for the data of each modality to map the data of differ- ent modalities to a common space, and regularize the new representations in the common space by a cross-model relevance matrix. We further impose that the class label of data points can also be predicted from the CNN representa- tions in the common space. The learning problem is modeled as a minimiza- tion problem, which is solved by an augmented Lagrange method (ALM) with updating rules of Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The experiments over benchmark of sequence data of multiple modalities show its advantage.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Nov 2016 05:24:48 GMT  (181kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06306v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yanbin wu", "li wang", "fan cui", "hongbin zhai", "baoming dong", "jim jing-yan wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.06306"}
