Like all algorithms for this task, ours necessarily has worst-case complexity exponential in the dimension of the data. However, our algorithm packages the computationally hard step into a concisely defined integer program, which can be solved non-privately using standard solvers. We prove accuracy and privacy theorems for our algorithm, and then demonstrate experimentally that our algorithm performs well in practice. For example, our algorithm can efficiently and accurately answer millions of queries on the Netflix dataset, which has over 17,000 attributes; this is an improvement on the state of the art by multiple orders of magnitude.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Feb 2014 23:20:43 GMT  (229kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1526v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 04:36:00 GMT  (338kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1526v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.CR cs.DB cs.LG", "authors": ["marco gaboardi", "emilio jes\u00fas gallego arias", "justin hsu", "aaron roth", "zhiwei steven wu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1402.1526"}
