By using this new algorithm we show that there are two ways of classification by a neural network, for a large dimension feature space, both of which are non-iterative and deterministic and we apply both these methods to a classical pattern recognition problem and present the results. It is expected these methods will now be widely used for the training of neural networks for Deep Learning not only because of their non-iterative and deterministic nature but also because of their efficiency and speed and will supercede other classification methods which are iterative in nature and rely on error minimization.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Dec 2015 20:44:12 GMT  (277kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04509v1", "13 pages, 5 figures"], ["v2", "Sun, 20 Dec 2015 04:32:01 GMT  (307kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04509v2", "18 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["k eswaran", "k damodhar rao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.04509"}
