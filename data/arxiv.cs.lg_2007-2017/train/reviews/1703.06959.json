Such misinformation has been cited to have a strong impact on public opinion, presenting the opportunity for malicious manipulation. Detecting fake news is an important, yet challenging problem since it is often difficult for humans to distinguish misinformation. However, there have been three generally agreed upon characteristics of fake news: the text, the response received, and the source users promoting it. Existing work has largely focused on tailoring solutions to a particular characteristic, but the complexity of the fake news epidemic limited their success and generality.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Mar 2017 20:33:32 GMT  (3600kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06959v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 26 Mar 2017 17:29:45 GMT  (3601kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06959v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 06:00:56 GMT  (3762kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06959v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 3 Sep 2017 22:05:42 GMT  (3736kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06959v4", "In Proceedings of the 26th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM) 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SI", "authors": ["natali ruchansky", "sungyong seo", "yan liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06959"}
