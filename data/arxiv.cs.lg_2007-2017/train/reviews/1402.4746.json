In many of these applications data is scarce, and often much more costly than computation time. We provide the first sample-efficient polynomial-time estimator for high-dimensional spherical Gaussian mixtures.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Feb 2014 17:59:55 GMT  (61kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4746v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS cs.IT math.IT stat.ML", "authors": ["ananda theertha suresh", "alon orlitsky", "jayadev acharya", "ashkan jafarpour"], "accepted": true, "id": "1402.4746"}
