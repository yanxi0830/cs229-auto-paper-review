First, which models are identifiable from infinite data? We use a general technique for numerically checking identifiability based on the rank of a Jacobian matrix, and apply it to several standard constituency and dependency parsing models. Second, for identifiable models, how do we estimate the parameters efficiently? EM suffers from local optima, while recent work using spectral methods cannot be directly applied since the topology of the parse tree varies across sentences. We develop a strategy, unmixing, which deals with this additional complexity for restricted classes of parsing models.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 14 Jun 2012 15:21:24 GMT  (95kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3137v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["daniel j hsu", "sham m kakade", "percy liang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.3137"}
