We study distributed ADMM methods that boost performance by using different fine-tuned algorithm parameters on each worker node. We present a O(1/k) convergence rate for adaptive ADMM methods with node-specific parameters, and propose adaptive consensus ADMM (ACADMM), which automatically tunes parameters without user oversight.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Jun 2017 08:52:37 GMT  (410kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02869v1", "ICML 2017"], ["v2", "Tue, 20 Jun 2017 05:22:11 GMT  (410kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02869v2", "ICML 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NA cs.SY", "authors": ["zheng xu 0002", "gavin taylor", "hao li", "m\u00e1rio a t figueiredo", "xiaoming yuan", "tom goldstein"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.02869"}
