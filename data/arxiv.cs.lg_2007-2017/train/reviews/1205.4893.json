This approach has many advantages and has led to a deep and beautiful theory. However, from the practical perspective, this leaves much to be desired. In application areas, practically interesting instances very often occupy just a tiny part of an algorithm's space of instances, and the vast majority of instances are simply irrelevant. Addressing these issues is a major challenge for theoretical computer science which may make theory more relevant to the practice of computer science.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 May 2012 12:30:27 GMT  (19kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4893v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CC cs.LG", "authors": ["yonatan bilu", "amit daniely", "nati linial", "michael saks"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.4893"}
