A set of app icons (usually four) are presented on a special dock, called Prediction Bar, and dynamically change according to the user's habits at a given time, location, and device state (headphone connected, bluetooth active, and so on). The goal of the algorithm is, given the context information, to actively help the user navigate to the desired app as well as to provide a personalized feeling. We propose an efficient online algorithm that is executed on the device, which is based on the Passive-Aggressive online algorithmic framework, adapted to maximize the AUC at each round. We concluded the paper with a large scale empirical study on the performance of the algorithm on a real users' data.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Dec 2015 16:27:40 GMT  (473kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07851v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 25 Jan 2016 19:39:40 GMT  (473kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07851v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["joseph keshet", "adam kariv", "arnon dagan", "dvir volk", "joey simhon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.07851"}
