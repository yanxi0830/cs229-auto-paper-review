In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion strategy named conditional attention fusion, which can dynamically pay attention to different modalities at each time step. Long-short term memory recurrent neural networks (LSTM-RNN) is applied as the basic uni-modality model to capture long time dependencies. The weights assigned to different modalities are automatically decided by the current input features and recent history information rather than being fixed at any kinds of situation. Our experimental results on a benchmark dataset AVEC2015 show the effectiveness of our method which outperforms several common fusion strategies for valence prediction.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Sep 2017 12:05:47 GMT  (6020kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02251v1", "Appeared at ACM Multimedia 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Appeared at ACM Multimedia 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.MM", "authors": ["shizhe chen", "qin jin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.02251"}
