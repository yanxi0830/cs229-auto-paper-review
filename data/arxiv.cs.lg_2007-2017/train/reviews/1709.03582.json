In this work we propose a new algorithm for constructing universal adversarial perturbations. Our approach is based on computing the so called $(p, q)$-singular vectors of the Jacobian matrices of hidden layers of a network. Resulting perturbations present interesting visual patterns and by using a batch of just $64$ images we can construct adversarial perturbations with relatively high fooling rate. We also investigate a correlation between the singular values of the Jacobian matrices and the fooling rate of a corresponding singular vector.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Sep 2017 20:22:37 GMT  (1308kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03582v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["valentin khrulkov", "ivan oseledets"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.03582"}
