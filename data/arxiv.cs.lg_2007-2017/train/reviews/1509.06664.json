End-to-end differentiable neural architectures have failed to approach state-of-the-art performance until very recently. In this paper, we propose a neural model that reads two sentences to determine entailment using long short-term memory units. We extend this model with a word-by-word neural attention mechanism that encourages reasoning over entailments of pairs of words and phrases. Furthermore, we present a qualitative analysis of attention weights produced by this model, demonstrating such reasoning capabilities. On a large entailment dataset this model outperforms the previous best neural model and a classifier with engineered features by a substantial margin. It is the first generic end-to-end differentiable system that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a textual entailment dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Sep 2015 16:08:24 GMT  (1067kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06664v1", "9 pages, 10 figures (incl. subfigures)"], ["v2", "Tue, 10 Nov 2015 22:12:52 GMT  (1182kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06664v2", "9 pages, 10 figures (incl. subfigures)"], ["v3", "Mon, 18 Jan 2016 17:28:30 GMT  (1075kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06664v3", "9 pages, 10 figures (incl. subfigures)"], ["v4", "Tue, 1 Mar 2016 10:32:06 GMT  (1075kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06664v4", "ICLR 2016 camera-ready, 9 pages, 10 figures (incl. subfigures)"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 10 figures (incl. subfigures)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["tim rockt\\\"aschel", "edward grefenstette", "karl moritz hermann", "tom\\'a\\v{s} ko\\v{c}isk\\'y", "phil blunsom"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.06664"}
