In this paper, we apply and extend sequence-to-sequence learning framework to learn representations for audio segments without any supervision. The model we used is called Sequence-to-sequence Autoencoder (SA), which consists of two RNNs equipped with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units: the first RNN acts as an encoder that maps the input sequence into a vector representation of fixed dimensionality, and the second RNN acts as a decoder that maps the representation back to the input sequence. The two RNNs are then jointly trained by minimizing the reconstruction error. We further propose Denoising Sequence-to-sequence Autoencoder (DSA) that improves the learned representations. The vector representations learned by SA and DSA are shown to be very helpful for query-by-example STD. The experimental results have shown that the proposed models achieved better retrieval performance than using audio segment representation designed heuristically and the classical Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 05:44:51 GMT  (205kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00982v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 15 Mar 2016 14:16:28 GMT  (196kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00982v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 17 Mar 2016 06:11:47 GMT  (196kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00982v3", null], ["v4", "Sat, 11 Jun 2016 03:40:23 GMT  (201kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00982v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.LG", "authors": ["yu-an chung", "chao-chung wu", "chia-hao shen", "hung-yi lee", "lin-shan lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.00982"}
