However, there are scant to no resources available to perform tensor learning and decomposition in Python. To answer this need we developed TensorLy. TensorLy is a state of the art general purpose library for tensor learning. Written in Python, it aims at following the same standards adopted by the main projects of the Python scientific community and fully integrating with these. It allows for fast and straightforward tensor decomposition and learning and comes with exhaustive tests, thorough documentation and minimal dependencies. It can be easily extended and its BSD licence makes it suitable for both academic and commercial applications. TensorLy is available at", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 29 Oct 2016 18:32:27 GMT  (155kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09555v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jean kossaifi", "yannis panagakis", "maja pantic"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09555"}
