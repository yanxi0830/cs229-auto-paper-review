{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Nov-2012", "title": "Lasso Screening Rules via Dual Polytope Projection", "abstract": "Lasso is a widely used regression technique to find sparse representations. When the dimension of the feature space and the number of samples are extremely large, solving the Lasso problem remains challenging. To improve the efficiency of solving large-scale Lasso problems, El Ghaoui and his colleagues have proposed the SAFE rules which are able to quickly identify the inactive predictors, i.e., predictors that have 0 components in the solution vector. Then, the inactive predictors or features can be removed from the optimization problem to reduce its scale. By transforming the standard Lasso to its dual form, it can be shown that the inactive predictors include the set of inactive constraints on the optimal dual solution. In this paper, we propose a fast and efficient screening rule via Dual Polytope Projections (DPP), which is mainly based on the uniqueness and nonexpansiveness of the optimal dual solution due to the fact that the feasible set in the dual space is a convex and closed polytope. Moreover, we show that our screening rule can be extended to identify inactive groups in group Lasso. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no \"exact\" screening rules for group Lasso. We have evaluated our screening rule using both synthetic and real data sets. Results show that our rule is more effective to identify inactive predictors than existing state-of-the-art screening rules.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Nov 2012 17:48:42 GMT  (479kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3966v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 1 Feb 2014 00:12:10 GMT  (911kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3966v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 15 Oct 2014 20:18:33 GMT  (445kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3966v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["jie wang", "jiayu zhou", "peter wonka", "jieping ye"], "accepted": true, "id": "1211.3966"}
