In this task, a semantic tagger is deployed to associate a semantic label to each word in an input sequence. The success of RNN may be attributed to its ability to memorize long-term dependence that relates the current-time semantic label prediction to the observations many time instances away. However, the memory capacity of simple RNNs is limited because of the gradient vanishing and exploding problem. We propose to use an external memory to improve memorization capability of RNNs. We conducted experiments on the ATIS dataset, and observed that the proposed model was able to achieve the state-of-the-art results. We compare our proposed model with alternative models and report analysis results that may provide insights for future research.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 31 May 2015 05:10:03 GMT  (91kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00195v1", "submitted to Interspeech 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to Interspeech 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["baolin peng", "kaisheng yao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.00195"}
