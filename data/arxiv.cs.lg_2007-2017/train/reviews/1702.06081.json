[2016]. We study the problem of learning such a non-discriminatory predictor from a finite training set, both statistically and computationally. We show that a post-hoc correction approach, as suggested by Hardt et al, can be highly suboptimal, present a nearly-optimal statistical procedure, argue that the associated computational problem is intractable, and suggest a second moment relaxation of the non-discrimination definition for which learning is tractable.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Feb 2017 17:52:14 GMT  (99kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06081v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 29 Sep 2017 14:52:10 GMT  (143kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06081v2", "28 pages"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["blake woodworth", "suriya gunasekar", "mesrob i ohannessian", "nathan srebro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06081"}
