This increased representational power comes at the cost of a more challenging unsupervised learning problem of estimating the topic probability vectors (the distributions over words for each topic), when only the words are observed and the corresponding topics are hidden.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Apr 2012 17:06:06 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6703v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 22 May 2012 02:08:38 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6703v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 3 Jul 2012 20:01:11 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6703v3", null], ["v4", "Thu, 17 Jan 2013 21:01:29 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6703v4", "Changed title to match conference version, which appears in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 25, 2012"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["anima anandkumar", "dean p foster", "daniel j hsu", "sham kakade", "yi-kai liu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1204.6703"}
