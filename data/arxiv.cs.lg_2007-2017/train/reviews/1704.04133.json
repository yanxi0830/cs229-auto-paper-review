CLEAR facilitates the visualization of attentive regions and levels of interest of DNNs during the decision-making process. It also enables the visualization of the most dominant classes associated with these attentive regions of interest. As such, CLEAR can mitigate some of the shortcomings of heatmap-based methods associated with decision ambiguity, and allows for better insights into the decision-making process of DNNs. Quantitative and qualitative experiments across three different datasets demonstrate the efficacy of CLEAR for gaining a better understanding of the inner workings of DNNs during the decision-making process.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 Apr 2017 13:44:33 GMT  (3484kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04133v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 18 May 2017 18:38:06 GMT  (3486kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04133v2", "Accepted at Computer Vision and Patter Recognition Workshop (CVPR-W) on Explainable Computer Vision, 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG cs.MM", "authors": ["devinder kumar", "alexander wong", "graham w taylor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.04133"}
