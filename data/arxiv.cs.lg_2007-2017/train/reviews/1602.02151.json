{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "5-Feb-2016", "title": "Exploiting the Structure: Stochastic Gradient Methods Using Raw Clusters", "abstract": "The amount of data available in the world is growing faster and bigger than our ability to deal with it. However, if we take advantage of the internal structure, data may become much smaller for machine learning purposes. In this paper we focus on one of the most fundamental machine learning tasks, empirical risk minimization (ERM), and provide faster algorithms with the help from the clustering structure of the data.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Feb 2016 20:58:18 GMT  (818kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02151v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 4 Nov 2016 17:10:04 GMT  (2630kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02151v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["zeyuan allen zhu", "yang yuan", "karthik sridharan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.02151"}
