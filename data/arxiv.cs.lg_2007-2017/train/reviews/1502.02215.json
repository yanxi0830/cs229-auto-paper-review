{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-Feb-2015", "title": "Real World Applications of Machine Learning Techniques over Large Mobile Subscriber Datasets", "abstract": "Communication Service Providers (CSPs) are in a unique position to utilize their vast transactional data assets generated from interactions of subscribers with network elements as well as with other subscribers. CSPs could leverage its data assets for a gamut of applications such as service personalization, predictive offer management, loyalty management, revenue forecasting, network capacity planning, product bundle optimization and churn management to gain significant competitive advantage. However, due to the sheer data volume, variety, velocity and veracity of mobile subscriber datasets, sophisticated data analytics techniques and frameworks are necessary to derive actionable insights in a useable timeframe. In this paper, we describe our journey from a relational database management system (RDBMS) based campaign management solution which allowed data scientists and marketers to use hand-written rules for service personalization and targeted promotions to a distributed Big Data Analytics platform, capable of performing large scale machine learning and data mining to deliver real time service personalization, predictive modelling and product optimization. Our work involves a careful blend of technology, processes and best practices, which facilitate man-machine collaboration and continuous experimentation to derive measurable economic value from data. Our platform has a reach of more than 500 million mobile subscribers worldwide, delivering over 1 billion personalized recommendations annually, processing a total data volume of 64 Petabytes, corresponding to 8.5 trillion events.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 8 Feb 2015 06:18:55 GMT  (81kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02215v1", "SE4ML: Software Engineering for Machine Learning (NIPS 2014 Workshop)this https URL"]], "COMMENTS": "SE4ML: Software Engineering for Machine Learning (NIPS 2014 Workshop)this https URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CY cs.SE", "authors": ["jobin wilson", "chitharanj kachappilly", "rakesh mohan", "prateek kapadia", "arun soman", "santanu chaudhury"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.02215"}
