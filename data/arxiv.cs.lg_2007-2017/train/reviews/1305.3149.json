How does it constitute? What is the main ingredient of the adulteration oil? After extracting the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) data on triglyceride from 370 oil samples, we applied the adaptive boosting with multi-class Hamming loss (AdaBoost.MH) to distinguish the oil adulteration in contrast with the support vector machine (SVM). Further, we regarded the adulterant oil and the pure oil samples as ones with multiple labels and with only one label, respectively. Then multi-label AdaBoost.MH and multi-label learning vector quantization (ML-LVQ) model were built to determine the ingredients and their relative ratio in the adulteration oil. The experimental results on six measures show that ML-LVQ achieves better performance than multi-label AdaBoost.MH.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 May 2013 13:23:19 GMT  (152kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3149v1", "18 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CE cs.LG", "authors": ["xiao-bo jin", "qiang lu", "feng wang", "quan-gong huo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.3149"}
