Recently, Machine Learning techniques have been applied to video game level generation towards the purpose of automatically generating levels that have the properties of the training corpus. Towards that end we have made available a corpora of video game levels in an easy to parse format ideal for different machine learning and other game AI research purposes.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jun 2016 21:36:36 GMT  (1142kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07487v1", "To appear in proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Procedural Content Generation"], ["v2", "Sun, 3 Jul 2016 20:04:55 GMT  (1142kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07487v2", "To appear in proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Procedural Content Generation"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in proceedings of the 7th Workshop on Procedural Content Generation", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["adam james summerville", "sam snodgrass", "michael mateas", "santiago onta\\~n\\'on"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07487"}
