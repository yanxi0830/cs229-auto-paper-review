It has already seen wide adoption in enterprise-scale applications and is starting to be adopted in large-scale contexts. Training an AWE model has historically required a single batch of several hundred writing examples and human scores for each of them. This requirement limits large-scale adoption of AWE since human-scoring essays is costly. Here we evaluate algorithms for ensuring that AWE models are consistently trained using the most informative essays. Our results show how to minimize training set sizes while maximizing predictive performance, thereby reducing cost without unduly sacrificing accuracy. We conclude with a discussion of how to integrate this approach into large-scale AWE systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Dec 2014 22:41:14 GMT  (390kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5659v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["nicholas dronen", "peter w foltz", "kyle habermehl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.5659"}
