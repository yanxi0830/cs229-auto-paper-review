Many successful heuristics for this problem are based on the troll-trust features, estimating on each node the fraction of outgoing and incoming positive edges. We show that these heuristics can be understood, and rigorously analyzed, as approximators to the Bayes optimal classifier for a simple probabilistic model of the edge labels. We then show that the maximum likelihood estimator of this model approximately corresponds to the predictions of a label propagation algorithm run on a transformed version of the original social graph. Extensive experiments on a number of real-world datasets show that this algorithm is competitive against state-of-the-art classifiers in terms of both prediction performance and scalability. Finally, we show that troll-trust features can also be used to derive online learning algorithms which have theoretical guarantees even when edges are adversarially labeled.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Jun 2016 09:16:46 GMT  (145kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00182v1", "16 pages, 1 figure, submitted to nips"], ["v2", "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 13:39:36 GMT  (145kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00182v2", "remove notice line at the bottom"], ["v3", "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 16:47:46 GMT  (144kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00182v3", "v3 minor typos"], ["v4", "Fri, 14 Oct 2016 09:39:59 GMT  (102kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00182v4", "v4: incorporate NIPS reviews and improve presentation"], ["v5", "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 21:33:41 GMT  (111kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00182v5", "v5: accepted to AISTATS 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 1 figure, submitted to nips", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SI", "authors": ["g\\'eraud le falher", "nicol\\`o cesa-bianchi", "claudio gentile", "fabio vitale"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.00182"}
