Ascertaining non-payer before giving loan is a significant and conflict-ridden task of the Banker. Classification techniques are the better choice for predictive analysis like finding the claimant, whether he/she is an unpretentious customer or a cheat. Defining the outstanding classifier is a risky assignment for any industrialist like a banker. This allow computer science researchers to drill down efficient research works through evaluating different classifiers and finding out the best classifier for such predictive problems. This research work investigates the productivity of LADTree Classifier and REPTree Classifier for the credit risk prediction and compares their fitness through various measures. German credit dataset has been taken and used to predict the credit risk with a help of open source machine learning tool.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Mar 2015 11:47:05 GMT  (896kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06608v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1310.5963by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1310.5963by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["lakshmi devasena c"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.06608"}
