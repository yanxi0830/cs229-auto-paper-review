{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "30-Jun-2015", "title": "Notes on Low-rank Matrix Factorization", "abstract": "Low-rank matrix factorization (MF) is an important technique in data science. The key idea of MF is that there exists latent structures in the data, by uncovering which we could obtain a compressed representation of the data. By factorizing an original matrix to low-rank matrices, MF provides a unified method for dimesion reduction, clustering, and matrix completion. In this article we review several important variants of MF, including: Basic MF, Non-negative MF, Orthogonal non-negative MF. As can be seen from their names, non-negative MF and orthogonal non-negative MF are variants of basic MF with non-negativity and/or orthogonality constraints. Such constraints are useful in specific senarios. In the first part of this article, we introduce, for each of these models, the application scenarios, the distinctive properties, and the optimizing method. By properly adapting MF, we can go beyond the problem of clustering and matrix completion. In the second part of this article, we will extend MF to sparse matrix compeletion, enhance matrix compeletion using various regularization methods, and make use of MF for (semi-)supervised learning by introducing latent space reinforcement and transformation. We will see that MF is not only a useful model but also as a flexible framework that is applicable for various prediction problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Jun 2015 20:47:34 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00333v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 26 Oct 2015 20:44:46 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00333v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 6 May 2016 10:35:36 GMT  (15kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00333v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NA cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["yuan lu", "jie yang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1507.00333"}
