{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "21-Apr-2017", "title": "Bandit Structured Prediction for Neural Sequence-to-Sequence Learning", "abstract": "Bandit structured prediction describes a stochastic optimization framework where learning is performed from partial feedback. This feedback is received in the form of a task loss evaluation to a predicted output structure, without having access to gold standard structures. We advance this framework by lifting linear bandit learning to neural sequence-to-sequence learning problems using attention-based recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, we show how to incorporate control variates into our learning algorithms for variance reduction and improved generalization. We present an evaluation on a neural machine translation task that shows improvements of up to 5.89 BLEU points for domain adaptation from simulated bandit feedback.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 11:56:00 GMT  (34kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06497v1", "To appear in ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in ACL 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["julia kreutzer", "artem sokolov", "stefan riezler"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.06497"}
