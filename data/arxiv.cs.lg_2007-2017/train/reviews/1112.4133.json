It is also a complex task with many important methodological decisions to make. Among those, one of the most crucial is the choice of an appropriate measure in order to properly assess the classification performance and rank the algorithms. In this article, we focus on this specific task. We present the most popular measures and compare their behavior through discrimination plots. We then discuss their properties from a more theoretical perspective. It turns out several of them are equivalent for classifiers comparison purposes. Futhermore. they can also lead to interpretation problems. Among the numerous measures proposed over the years, it appears that the classical overall success rate and marginal rates are the more suitable for classifier comparison task.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 18 Dec 2011 08:02:49 GMT  (445kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4133v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["vincent labatut", "hocine cherifi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1112.4133"}
