Firstly, we provide a thresholding scheme which allows to approximate the support of a measure from a finite subset of its moments with strong asymptotic guaranties. Secondly, we provide a consistency result which relates the empirical Christoffel function and its population counterpart in the limit of large samples. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our results on simulated and real world datasets for several applications in statistics and machine learning: (a) density and support estimation from finite samples, (b) outlier and novelty detection and (c) affine matching.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Jan 2017 08:36:54 GMT  (783kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02886v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 08:05:15 GMT  (784kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02886v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jean-bernard lasserre", "edouard pauwels"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.02886"}
