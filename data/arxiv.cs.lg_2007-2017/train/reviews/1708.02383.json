This is usually done using heuristic selection methods, however the effectiveness of such methods is limited and moreover, the performance of heuristics varies between datasets. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel formulation by reframing the active learning as a reinforcement learning problem and explicitly learning a data selection policy, where the policy takes the role of the active learning heuristic. Importantly, our method allows the selection policy learned using simulation on one language to be transferred to other languages. We demonstrate our method using cross-lingual named entity recognition, observing uniform improvements over traditional active learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Aug 2017 07:06:48 GMT  (143kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02383v1", "To appear in EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["meng fang", "yuan li", "trevor cohn"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.02383"}
