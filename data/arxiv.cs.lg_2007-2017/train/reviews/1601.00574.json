An application of this is the following: by plugging in various play options one could determine the best play for a given situation in real time. While the outcome of a play can be described in many ways we had the most promising results with a newly defined measure that we call \"progress\". We see this work as a first step to include predictive analysis into NFL playcalling.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Jan 2016 17:30:07 GMT  (1301kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00574v1", "14 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["brendan teich", "roman lutz", "valentin kassarnig"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.00574"}
