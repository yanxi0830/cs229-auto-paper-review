In this tutorial we first study the basic notion of SVD and then show the central role of SVD in matrices. Using majorization theory, we consider variational principles of singular values and eigenvalues. Built on SVD and a theory of symmetric gauge functions, we discuss unitarily invariant norms, which are then used to formulate general results for matrix low rank approximation. We study the subdifferentials of unitarily invariant norms. These results would be potentially useful in many machine learning problems such as matrix completion and matrix data classification. Finally, we discuss matrix low rank approximation and its recent developments such as randomized SVD, approximate matrix multiplication, CUR decomposition, and Nystrom approximation. Randomized algorithms are important approaches to large scale SVD as well as fast matrix computations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Oct 2015 00:59:53 GMT  (83kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08532v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["zhihua zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.08532"}
