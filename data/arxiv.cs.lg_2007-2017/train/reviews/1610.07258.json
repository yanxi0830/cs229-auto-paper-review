{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "24-Oct-2016", "title": "Representation Learning with Deconvolution for Multivariate Time Series Classification and Visualization", "abstract": "We propose a new model based on the deconvolutional networks and SAX discretization to learn the representation for multivariate time series. Deconvolutional networks fully exploit the advantage the powerful expressiveness of deep neural networks in the manner of unsupervised learning. We design a network structure specifically to capture the cross-channel correlation with deconvolution, forcing the pooling operation to perform the dimension reduction along each position in the individual channel. Discretization based on Symbolic Aggregate Approximation is applied on the feature vectors to further extract the bag of features. We show how this representation and bag of features helps on classification. A full comparison with the sequence distance based approach is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the standard datasets. We further build the Markov matrix from the discretized representation from the deconvolution to visualize the time series as complex networks, which show more class-specific statistical properties and clear structures with respect to different labels.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 01:53:12 GMT  (1052kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07258v1", "Submitted to NeuroComputing. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1505.04366by other authors"], ["v2", "Wed, 26 Oct 2016 00:17:45 GMT  (1054kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07258v2", "Submitted to NeuroComputing. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1505.04366by other authors"], ["v3", "Sat, 26 Nov 2016 21:02:49 GMT  (1054kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07258v3", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1505.04366by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to NeuroComputing. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1505.04366by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["zhiguang wang", "wei song", "lu liu", "fan zhang", "junxiao xue", "yangdong ye", "ming fan", "mingliang xu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.07258"}
