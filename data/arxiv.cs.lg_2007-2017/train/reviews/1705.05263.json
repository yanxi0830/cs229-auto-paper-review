We then compare the generated samples, exact log-probability densities and approximate Wasserstein distances. We show that an independent critic trained to approximate Wasserstein distance between the validation set and the generator distribution helps detect overfitting. Finally, we use ideas from the one-shot learning literature to develop a novel fast learning critic.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 May 2017 14:24:01 GMT  (3581kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05263v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ivo danihelka", "balaji lakshminarayanan", "benigno uria", "daan wierstra", "peter dayan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05263"}
