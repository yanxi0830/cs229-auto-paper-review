The contributions of this paper are three-fold. First, we develop a joint model for video and natural language narration that takes advantage of the complementary nature of the two signals. Second, we collect an annotated dataset of 57 Internet instruction videos containing more than 350,000 frames for two tasks (changing car tire and CardioPulmonary Resuscitation). Third, we experimentally demonstrate that the proposed model automatically discovers, in an unsupervised manner, the main steps to achieve each task and locate them within the input videos. The results further show that the proposed model outperforms single-modality baselines, demonstrating the benefits of joint modeling video and text.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Jun 2015 19:55:37 GMT  (4681kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.09215v1", "13 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 2 Jul 2015 16:43:36 GMT  (1200kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.09215v2", "13 pages - corrected typo in reference [13] + added recently appeared arXiv reference [21]"], ["v3", "Mon, 30 Nov 2015 18:10:53 GMT  (6411kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.09215v3", "improved NLP method and bigger dataset"], ["v4", "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 18:43:37 GMT  (3190kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.09215v4", "Appears in: 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2016). 21 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["jean-baptiste alayrac", "piotr bojanowski", "nishant agrawal", "josef sivic", "ivan laptev", "simon lacoste-julien"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.09215"}
