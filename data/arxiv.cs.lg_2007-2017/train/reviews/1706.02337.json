We consider document semantic structure extraction as a pixel-wise segmentation task, and propose a unified model that classifies pixels based not only on their visual appearance, as in the traditional page segmentation task, but also on the content of underlying text. Moreover, we propose an efficient synthetic document generation process that we use to generate pretraining data for our network. Once the network is trained on a large set of synthetic documents, we fine-tune the network on unlabeled real documents using a semi-supervised approach. We systematically study the optimum network architecture and show that both our multimodal approach and the synthetic data pretraining significantly boost the performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Jun 2017 18:51:31 GMT  (29326kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02337v1", "CVPR 2017 Spotlight"]], "COMMENTS": "CVPR 2017 Spotlight", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["xiao yang", "ersin yumer", "paul asente", "mike kraley", "daniel kifer", "c lee giles"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02337"}
