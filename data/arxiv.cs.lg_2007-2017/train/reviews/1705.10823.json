In this paper, we show that a simple regression model, based on support vector machines, can predict the final performance of partially trained neural network configurations using features based on network architectures, hyperparameters, and time-series validation performance data. We use this regression model to develop an early stopping strategy for neural network configurations. With this early stopping strategy, we obtain significant speedups in both hyperparameter optimization and meta-modeling. Particularly in the context of meta-modeling, our method can learn to predict the performance of drastically different architectures and is seamlessly incorporated into reinforcement learning-based architecture selection algorithms. Finally, we show that our method is simpler, faster, and more accurate than Bayesian methods for learning curve prediction.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 May 2017 19:00:53 GMT  (326kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10823v1", "Submitted to 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017), Long Beach, CA, USA"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017), Long Beach, CA, USA", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["bowen baker", "otkrist gupta", "ramesh raskar", "nikhil naik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10823"}
