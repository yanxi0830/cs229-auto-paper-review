Such an approach will result in simple and efficient systems, requiring little domain-specific knowledge and making few model assumptions. We implement the idea by formulating the problem as a single neural network architecture, including the estimation of a speaker model on only a few utterances, and evaluate it on our internal \"Ok Google\" benchmark for text-dependent speaker verification. The proposed approach appears to be very effective for big data applications like ours that require highly accurate, easy-to-maintain systems with a small footprint.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 27 Sep 2015 07:43:36 GMT  (473kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08062v1", "submitted to ICASSP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to ICASSP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SD", "authors": ["georg heigold", "ignacio moreno", "samy bengio", "noam shazeer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.08062"}
