The embedding is characterized from the analytical standpoint and shown to provide improved performance on tasks such as classification in a reduced-dimensionality space.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 08:37:25 GMT  (358kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08511v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IR", "authors": ["diego valsesia", "enrico magli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08511"}
