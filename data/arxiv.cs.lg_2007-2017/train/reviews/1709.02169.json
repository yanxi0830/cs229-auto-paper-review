Ideally, the robot should be able to identify areas that are safe for navigation based on its own percepts about the environment while avoiding damage to itself. Bayesian optimisation (BO) has been successfully applied to the task of learning a model of terrain traversability while guiding the robot through more traversable areas. An issue, however, is that localisation uncertainty can end up guiding the robot to unsafe areas and distort the model being learnt. In this paper, we address this problem and present a novel method that allows BO to consider localisation uncertainty by applying a Gaussian process model for uncertain inputs as a prior. We evaluate the proposed method in simulation and in experiments with a real robot navigating over rough terrain and compare it to standard BO methods which assume deterministic inputs.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 Sep 2017 10:17:52 GMT  (1323kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02169v1", "To appear in International Symposium of Robotics Research (ISRR) 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in International Symposium of Robotics Research (ISRR) 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["rafael oliveira", "lionel ott", "vitor guizilini", "fabio ramos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.02169"}
