In this paper we are interested in studying and modeling the behavior of features that permit the end user to access, with her/his web browser, the status of the Bike-Sharing system. In particular, we address features able to make a prediction on the system state. We propose to use a machine learning approach to analyze usage patterns and learn computational models of such features from logs of system usage.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Aug 2015 01:51:36 GMT  (28kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03906v1", "In Proceedings WWV 2015,arXiv:1508.03389"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings WWV 2015,arXiv:1508.03389", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.LG", "authors": ["davide bacciu", "stefania gnesi", "laura semini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.03906"}
