We show that the problem of generalized support vector machine is equivalent to the problem of generalized variational inequality and establish various results for the existence of solutions. Moreover, we provide various examples to support our results.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 May 2016 09:54:46 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05664v1", "submitted"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["xiaomin qi", "sergei silvestrov", "talat nazir"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.05664"}
