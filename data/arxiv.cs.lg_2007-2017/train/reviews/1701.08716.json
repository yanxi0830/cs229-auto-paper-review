Causal Analysis of TV Logs", "abstract": "Weather affects our mood and behaviors, and many aspects of our life. When it is sunny, most people become happier; but when it rains, some people get depressed. Despite this evidence and the abundance of data, weather has mostly been overlooked in the machine learning and data science research. This work presents a causal analysis of how weather affects TV watching patterns. We show that some weather attributes, such as pressure and precipitation, cause major changes in TV watching patterns. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale causal study of the impact of weather on TV watching patterns.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 17:07:33 GMT  (104kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08716v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 24 Mar 2017 18:14:26 GMT  (83kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08716v2", "Companion of the 26th International World Wide Web Conference"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.LG", "authors": ["shi zong", "branislav kveton", "shlomo berkovsky", "azin ashkan", "nikos vlassis", "zheng wen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08716"}
