This information of network connectivity is not accurately available, at the low voltage level, due to uninformed changes that happen from time to time. In this paper, we propose a novel data--driven approach to identify the underlying network topology including the load phase connectivity from time series of energy measurements. The proposed method involves the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its graph-theoretic interpretation to infer the topology from smart meter energy measurements. The method is demonstrated through simulation on randomly generated networks and also on IEEE recognized Roy Billinton distribution test system.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Sep 2016 07:52:25 GMT  (158kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02678v1", "Submitted to IEEE transaction on smart grid"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to IEEE transaction on smart grid", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.LG", "authors": ["jayadev p satya", "nirav bhatt", "ramkrishna pasumarthy", "aravind rajeswaran"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.02678"}
