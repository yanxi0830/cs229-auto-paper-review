Moreover, is it possible to identify spurious structures that might arise due to sampling variability?", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 May 2011 10:34:25 GMT  (85kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.0540v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 5 May 2011 14:13:49 GMT  (85kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.0540v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["samory kpotufe", "ulrike von luxburg"], "accepted": true, "id": "1105.0540"}
