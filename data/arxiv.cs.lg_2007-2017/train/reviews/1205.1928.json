In this paper, we show that a general class of extended real-valued regularization functionals admits a linear representer theorem if and only if the regularizer is a non-decreasing function of the norm. In this way, we extend a recent characterization stating that such condition is necessary and sufficient for differentiable regularizers.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 May 2012 10:01:09 GMT  (6kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1928v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 3 Jun 2012 13:54:08 GMT  (8kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1928v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 17 Jul 2012 10:36:07 GMT  (9kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1928v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.FA cs.LG", "authors": ["francesco dinuzzo", "bernhard sch\u00f6lkopf"], "accepted": true, "id": "1205.1928"}
