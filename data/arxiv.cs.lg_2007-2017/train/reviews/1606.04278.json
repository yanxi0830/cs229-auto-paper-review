Examples of such problems emerge in several subfields of machine learning, such as collaborative filtering, multi-label classification, dyadic prediction and biological network inference. In this article we analyse efficient and exact algorithms for computing the top-$K$ predictions in the above problem settings, using a general class of models that we refer to as separable linear relational models. We show how to use those inference algorithms, which are modifications of well-known information retrieval methods, in a variety of machine learning settings. Furthermore, we study the possibility of scoring items incompletely, while still retaining an exact top-K retrieval. Experimental results in several application domains reveal that the so-called threshold algorithm is very scalable, performing often many orders of magnitude more efficiently than the naive approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 09:41:27 GMT  (1024kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04278v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["michiel stock", "krzysztof dembczynski", "bernard de baets", "willem waegeman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04278"}
