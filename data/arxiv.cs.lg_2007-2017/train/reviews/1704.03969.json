However, the convergence of Gaus- sian BP is still an open issue. In this paper, we consider the convergence of Gaussian BP, focusing in particular on the convergence of the information matrix. We show analytically that the exchanged message information matrix converges for arbitrary positive semidefinite initial value, and its dis- tance to the unique positive definite limit matrix decreases exponentially fast.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 Apr 2017 02:07:15 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03969v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1611.02010"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1611.02010", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jian du", "shaodan ma", "yik-chung wu", "soummya kar", "jos\\'e m f moura"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.03969"}
