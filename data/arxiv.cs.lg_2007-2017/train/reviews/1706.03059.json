They have been shown to be successful in image classification models, both in obtaining better models than previously possible for a given parameter count (the Xception architecture) and considerably reducing the number of parameters required to perform at a given level (the MobileNets family of architectures). Recently, convolutional sequence-to-sequence networks have been applied to machine translation tasks with good results. In this work, we study how depthwise separable convolutions can be applied to neural machine translation. We introduce a new architecture inspired by Xception and ByteNet, called SliceNet, which enables a significant reduction of the parameter count and amount of computation needed to obtain results like ByteNet, and, with a similar parameter count, achieves new state-of-the-art results. In addition to showing that depthwise separable convolutions perform well for machine translation, we investigate the architectural changes that they enable: we observe that thanks to depthwise separability, we can increase the length of convolution windows, removing the need for filter dilation. We also introduce a new \"super-separable\" convolution operation that further reduces the number of parameters and computational cost for obtaining state-of-the-art results.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Jun 2017 17:59:16 GMT  (227kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03059v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 16 Jun 2017 02:35:48 GMT  (226kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03059v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["lukasz kaiser", "aidan n gomez", "francois chollet"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03059"}
