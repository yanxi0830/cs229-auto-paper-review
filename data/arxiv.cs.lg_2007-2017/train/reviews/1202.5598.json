{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "25-Feb-2012", "title": "Clustering using Max-norm Constrained Optimization", "abstract": "We suggest using the max-norm as a convex surrogate constraint for clustering. We show how this yields a better exact cluster recovery guarantee than previously suggested nuclear-norm relaxation, and study the effectiveness of our method, and other related convex relaxations, compared to other clustering approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 25 Feb 2012 02:10:20 GMT  (3366kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5598v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 18 Mar 2012 22:09:44 GMT  (3366kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5598v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 11 Apr 2012 20:56:40 GMT  (3371kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5598v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 13 Apr 2012 06:52:44 GMT  (3371kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5598v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["ali jalali", "nathan srebro"], "accepted": true, "id": "1202.5598"}
