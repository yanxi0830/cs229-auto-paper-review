To deal with this problem, we investigate the use of complementary information at different levels for computing a combined match score for the unknown speaker. In this work, we observe the effect of two supervised machine learning approaches including support vectors machines (SVM) and na\\\"ive bayes (NB). We define two feature vector sets based on mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and relative spectral perceptual linear predictive coefficients (RASTA-PLP). Each feature is modeled using the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Several ways of combining these information sources give significant improvements in a text-independent speaker identification task using a very large telephone degraded NTIMIT database.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Jun 2014 20:34:05 GMT  (235kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0380v1", "10 pages, 4 figures, International Journal of Signal Processing, Image Processing and Pattern Recognition Vol. 6, No. 2, April, 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 4 figures, International Journal of Signal Processing, Image Processing and Pattern Recognition Vol. 6, No. 2, April, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.LG", "authors": ["imen trabelsi", "dorra ben ayed"], "accepted": false, "id": "1407.0380"}
