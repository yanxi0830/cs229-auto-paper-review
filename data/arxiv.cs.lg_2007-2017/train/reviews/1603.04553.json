In this paper, we propose a generative, unsupervised ranking model for entity coreference resolution by introducing resolution mode variables. Our unsupervised system achieves 58.44% F1 score of the CoNLL metric on the English data from the CoNLL-2012 shared task (Pradhan et al., 2012), outperforming the Stanford deterministic system (Lee et al., 2013) by 3.01%.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Mar 2016 04:39:15 GMT  (55kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04553v1", "Accepted by NAACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by NAACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["xuezhe ma", "zhengzhong liu", "eduard h hovy"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.04553"}
