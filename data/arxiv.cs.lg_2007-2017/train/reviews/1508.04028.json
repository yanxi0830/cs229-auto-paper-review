In this paper, we estimate head pose and eye pose from monocular video using methods developed extensively in prior work and ask two new interesting questions. First, how much better can we classify driver gaze using head and eye pose versus just using head pose? Second, are there individual-specific gaze strategies that strongly correlate with how much gaze classification improves with the addition of eye pose information? We answer these questions by evaluating data drawn from an on-road study of 40 drivers. The main insight of the paper is conveyed through the analogy of an \"owl\" and \"lizard\" which describes the degree to which the eyes and the head move when shifting gaze. When the head moves a lot (\"owl\"), not much classification improvement is attained by estimating eye pose on top of head pose. On the other hand, when the head stays still and only the eyes move (\"lizard\"), classification accuracy increases significantly from adding in eye pose. We characterize how that accuracy varies between people, gaze strategies, and gaze regions.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Aug 2015 13:54:05 GMT  (642kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04028v1", "Under review: IET Computer Vision. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1507.04760"], ["v2", "Sat, 13 Feb 2016 18:10:49 GMT  (641kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04028v2", "Accepted for Publication in IET Computer Vision. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1507.04760"], ["v3", "Sun, 20 Nov 2016 04:46:26 GMT  (643kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04028v3", "Accepted for Publication in IET Computer Vision. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1507.04760"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review: IET Computer Vision. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1507.04760", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.HC cs.LG", "authors": ["lex fridman", "joonbum lee", "bryan reimer", "trent victor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.04028"}
