We devise algorithms with regret bounds that are independent of the number of experts and depends only on the rank $d$. For the stochastic model we show a tight bound of $\\Theta(\\sqrt{dT})$, and extend it to a setting of an approximate $d$ subspace. For the adversarial model we show an upper bound of $O(d\\sqrt{T})$ and a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{dT})$.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Mar 2016 08:29:05 GMT  (20kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06352v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 23 May 2016 06:47:33 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06352v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["elad hazan", "tomer koren", "roi livni", "yishay mansour"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.06352"}
