The algorithm draws on two main ideas. First, it generates two views consisting of computationally inexpensive random features. Second, XNV applies multiview regression using Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) on unlabeled data to bias the regression towards useful features. It has been shown that, if the views contains accurate estimators, CCA regression can substantially reduce variance with a minimal increase in bias. Random views are justified by recent theoretical and empirical work showing that regression with random features closely approximates kernel regression, implying that random views can be expected to contain accurate estimators. We show that XNV consistently outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm for semi-supervised learning: substantially improving predictive performance and reducing the variability of performance on a wide variety of real-world datasets, whilst also reducing runtime by orders of magnitude.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Jun 2013 09:49:08 GMT  (327kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5554v1", "15 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables"], ["v2", "Tue, 5 Nov 2013 11:28:33 GMT  (639kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5554v2", "15 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 3 figures, 6 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["brian mcwilliams", "david balduzzi", "joachim m buhmann"], "accepted": true, "id": "1306.5554"}
