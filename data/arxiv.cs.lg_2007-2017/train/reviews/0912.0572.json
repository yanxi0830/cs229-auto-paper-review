However, Isomap fails to work on data which distribute on clusters in a single manifold or manifolds. Many works have been done on extending Isomap to multi-manifolds learning. In this paper, we first proposed a new multi-manifolds learning algorithm (M-Isomap) with help of a general procedure. The new algorithm preserves intra-manifold geodesics and multiple inter-manifolds edges precisely. Compared with previous methods, this algorithm can isometrically learn data distributed on several manifolds. Secondly, the original multi-cluster manifold learning algorithm first proposed in \\cite{DCIsomap} and called D-C Isomap has been revised so that the revised D-C Isomap can learn multi-manifolds data. Finally, the features and effectiveness of the proposed multi-manifolds learning algorithms are demonstrated and compared through experiments.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Dec 2009 03:05:59 GMT  (1791kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0572v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["mingyu fan", "hong qiao", "bo zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "0912.0572"}
