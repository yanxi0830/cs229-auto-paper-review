{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Sep-2015", "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning with Double Q-Learning", "abstract": "The popular Q-learning algorithm is known to overestimate action values under certain conditions. It was not previously known whether, in practice, such overestimations are common, whether this harms performance, and whether they can generally be prevented. In this paper, we answer all these questions affirmatively. In particular, we first show that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation. We propose a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also leads to much better performance on several games.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Sep 2015 04:40:22 GMT  (945kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 15:20:50 GMT  (1043kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461v2", "AAAI 2016"], ["v3", "Tue, 8 Dec 2015 21:19:16 GMT  (1043kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461v3", "AAAI 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hado van hasselt", "arthur guez", "david silver"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.06461"}
