We study this problem in the case of kernel ridge regression for functional responses with a lr-norm constraint on the combination coefficients. We propose a multiple operator-valued kernel learning algorithm based on solving a system of linear operator equations by using a block coordinate descent procedure. We experimentally validate our approach on a functional regression task in the context of finger movement prediction in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Mar 2012 20:31:17 GMT  (408kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1596v1", "No. RR-7900 (2012)"], ["v2", "Thu, 14 Jun 2012 18:44:49 GMT  (411kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1596v2", "No. RR-7900 (2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "No. RR-7900 (2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["hachem kadri", "alain rakotomamonjy", "francis r bach", "philippe preux"], "accepted": true, "id": "1203.1596"}
