Selective Generation using LSTMs with Coarse-to-Fine Alignment", "abstract": "We present an end-to-end, domain-independent neural encoder-aligner-decoder model for selective generation, i.e., the joint task of content selection and surface realization. Our model first encodes the full set of over-determined database event records (e.g., in weather forecasting and sportscasting) via a memory-based recurrent neural network (LSTM), then utilizes a novel coarse-to-fine (hierarchical), multi-input aligner to identify the small subset of salient records to talk about, and finally employs a decoder to generate free-form descriptions of the aligned, selected records. Our model achieves up to 54% relative improvement over the current state-of-the-art on the benchmark WeatherGov dataset, despite using no specialized features or resources. Using a simple k-nearest neighbor beam helps further. Finally, we also demonstrate the generalizability of our method on the RoboCup dataset, where it gets results that are competitive with state-of-the-art, despite being severely data-starved.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Sep 2015 19:52:56 GMT  (205kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00838v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 8 Jan 2016 23:07:32 GMT  (203kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00838v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["hongyuan mei", "mohit bansal", "matthew r walter"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.00838"}
