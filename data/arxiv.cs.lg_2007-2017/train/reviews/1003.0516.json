{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "2-Mar-2010", "title": "Model Selection with the Loss Rank Principle", "abstract": "A key issue in statistics and machine learning is to automatically select the \"right\" model complexity, e.g., the number of neighbors to be averaged over in k nearest neighbor (kNN) regression or the polynomial degree in regression with polynomials. We suggest a novel principle - the Loss Rank Principle (LoRP) - for model selection in regression and classification. It is based on the loss rank, which counts how many other (fictitious) data would be fitted better. LoRP selects the model that has minimal loss rank. Unlike most penalized maximum likelihood variants (AIC, BIC, MDL), LoRP depends only on the regression functions and the loss function. It works without a stochastic noise model, and is directly applicable to any non-parametric regressor, like kNN.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Mar 2010 08:21:07 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0516v1", "31 LaTeX pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "31 LaTeX pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["marcus hutter", "minh-ngoc tran"], "accepted": false, "id": "1003.0516"}
