Our main result is an algorithm to approximately count the number of solutions to a CNF formula $\\Phi$ with at least $k$ variables per clause and degree at most $d$ when $k$ is logarithmic in $d$. This closes an exponential gap between the known upper and lower bounds.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Oct 2016 03:44:12 GMT  (41kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04317v1", "27 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 16 Mar 2017 01:30:09 GMT  (50kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04317v2", "25 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "27 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.CC cs.LG", "authors": ["ankur moitra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.04317"}
