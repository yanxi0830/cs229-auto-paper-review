A neural network architecture is used to address sparsity issues that arise when integrating contextual information into classic statistical models, allowing the system to take into account previous dialog utterances. Our dynamic-context generative models show consistent gains over both context-sensitive and non-context-sensitive Machine Translation and Information Retrieval baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Jun 2015 18:29:03 GMT  (355kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06714v1", "A.
