This paper presents a Gaussian process localization (GP-Localize) algorithm that, in contrast to existing works, can exploit the spatially correlated field measurements taken during a robot's exploration (instead of relying on prior training data) for efficiently and scalably learning the GP observation model online through our proposed novel online sparse GP. As a result, GP-Localize is capable of achieving constant time and memory (i.e., independent of the size of the data) per filtering step, which demonstrates the practical feasibility of using GPs for persistent robot localization and autonomy. Empirical evaluation via simulated experiments with real-world datasets and a real robot experiment shows that GP-Localize outperforms existing GP localization algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Apr 2014 10:28:00 GMT  (345kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5165v1", "28th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2014), Extended version with proofs, 10 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 22 Apr 2014 08:03:33 GMT  (345kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.5165v2", "28th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2014), Extended version with proofs, 10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "28th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2014), Extended version with proofs, 10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["nuo xu", "kian hsiang low", "jie chen", "keng kiat lim", "etkin baris ozgul"], "accepted": true, "id": "1404.5165"}
