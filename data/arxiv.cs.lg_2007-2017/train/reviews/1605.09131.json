The common approach is to treat it as a classification problem and solve it using either a supervised learner or a semi-supervised learner. We propose an alternative approach by using unsupervised learning as the basis to solve this problem. The SENC problem can be decomposed into three sub problems: detecting emerging new classes, classifying for known classes, and updating models to enable classification of instances of the new class and detection of more emerging new classes. The proposed method employs completely random trees which have been shown to work well in unsupervised learning and supervised learning independently in the literature. This is the first time, as far as we know, that completely random trees are used as a single common core to solve all three sub problems: unsupervised learning, supervised learning and model update in data streams. We show that the proposed unsupervised-learning-focused method often achieves significantly better outcomes than existing classification-focused methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 May 2016 07:57:41 GMT  (5516kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09131v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["xin mu", "kai ming ting", "zhi-hua zhou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.09131"}
