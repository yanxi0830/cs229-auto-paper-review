Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (SDCA) model is a popular method and often has better performances than stochastic gradient descent methods in solving regularized convex loss minimization problems. Dual-Free Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent method is a variation of SDCA, and can be applied to non-convex problem when its dual problem is meaningless. We extend Dual-Free Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent method to the distributed mode with considering the star network in this paper.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 29 May 2016 21:33:07 GMT  (7kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09066v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 27 Jul 2016 03:29:57 GMT  (509kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09066v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 19 Nov 2016 20:32:35 GMT  (511kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09066v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 27 Oct 2017 03:06:07 GMT  (386kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09066v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["zhouyuan huo", "heng huang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.09066"}
