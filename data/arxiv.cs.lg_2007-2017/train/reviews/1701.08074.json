The practicality of a direct model-based approach is compromised by two challenges, namely scalability due to the large dimensionality of the problem and the system identification required to identify an accurate model. To help in mitigating these problems, this paper leverages on recent developments in reinforcement learning in combination with a market-based multi-agent system to obtain a scalable solution that obtains a significant performance improvement in a practical learning time. The control approach is applied on a scenario comprising 100 thermostatically controlled loads connected to a radial district heating network supplied by a central combined heat and power plant. Both for an energy arbitrage and a peak shaving objective, the control approach requires 60 days to obtain a performance within 65% of a theoretical lower bound on the cost.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Jan 2017 15:15:54 GMT  (2421kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08074v1", "Under review at Elsevier: Energy and buildings 2017"], ["v2", "Fri, 24 Feb 2017 15:59:34 GMT  (2419kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08074v2", "Under review at Elsevier: Energy and buildings 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review at Elsevier: Energy and buildings 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.LG", "authors": ["bert j claessens", "dirk vanhoudt", "johan desmedt", "frederik ruelens"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08074"}
