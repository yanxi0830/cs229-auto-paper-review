The framework makes streaming updates to the estimated posterior according to a user-specified approximation primitive function. We demonstrate the usefulness of our framework, with variational Bayes (VB) as the primitive, by fitting the latent Dirichlet allocation model to two large-scale document collections. We demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm over stochastic variational inference (SVI), both in the single-pass setting SVI was designed for and in the streaming setting, to which SVI does not apply.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Jul 2013 15:03:40 GMT  (214kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6769v1", "21 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 20 Nov 2013 23:29:01 GMT  (76kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6769v2", "25 pages, 3 figures, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["tamara broderick", "nicholas boyd", "andre wibisono", "ashia c wilson", "michael i jordan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1307.6769"}
