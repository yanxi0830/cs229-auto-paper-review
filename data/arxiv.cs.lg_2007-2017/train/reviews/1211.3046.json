This is in contrast to the previous studies that were focused on analyzing the classification performance using random projection. We reveal the relationship between compressive sensing and the problem of recovering optimal solution using random projection. We also present a simple algorithm, termed as Dual Random Projection, that recovers the optimal solution with a small error by computing dual solution provided that the data matrix is of low rank.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Nov 2012 16:39:45 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3046v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 15 Nov 2012 22:09:06 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3046v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 2 Apr 2013 19:05:01 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3046v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 21 Feb 2014 20:57:42 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3046v4", "The 26th Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2013)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["lijun zhang", "mehrdad mahdavi", "rong jin", "tianbao yang", "shenghuo zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1211.3046"}
