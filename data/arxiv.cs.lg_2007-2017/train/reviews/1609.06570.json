The implemented state-of-the-art methods can be categorized into 4 groups: (i) under-sampling, (ii) over-sampling, (iii) combination of over- and under-sampling, and (iv) ensemble learning methods. The proposed toolbox only depends on numpy, scipy, and scikit-learn and is distributed under MIT license. Furthermore, it is fully compatible with scikit-learn and is part of the scikit-learn-contrib supported project. Documentation, unit tests as well as integration tests are provided to ease usage and contribution. The toolbox is publicly available in GitHub:", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 Sep 2016 14:16:14 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06570v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["guillaume lemaitre", "fernando nogueira", "christos k aridas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.06570"}
