(For example, a statistical query (SQ) gives an estimate of $Ex_{x \\sim D}[q(x)]$ for any choice of the query function $q$ mapping $X$ to the reals, where $D$ is an unknown data distribution over $X$.) Yet some data analysis algorithms rely on properties of functions that depend on multiple samples. Such algorithms would be naturally implemented using $k$-wise queries each of which is specified by a function $q$ mapping $X^k$ to the reals. Hence it is natural to ask whether algorithms using $k$-wise queries can solve learning problems more efficiently and by how much.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 21:41:09 GMT  (35kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00066v1", "32 pages, Appeared in Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "32 pages, Appeared in Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS) 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["vitaly feldman", "badih ghazi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.00066"}
