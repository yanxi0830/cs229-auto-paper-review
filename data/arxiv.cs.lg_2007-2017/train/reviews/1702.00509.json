Fundus images were normalised before segmentation was performed to enforce consistency in background lighting and contrast. For every effective point in the fundus image, our algorithm extracted three channels of input from the neighbourhood of the point and forward the response across the 7 layer network. In average, our segmentation achieved an accuracy of 92.68 percent on the testing set from Drive database.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Feb 2017 00:37:22 GMT  (922kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00509v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["jen hong tan", "u rajendra acharya", "sulatha v bhandary", "kuang chua chua", "sobha sivaprasad"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.00509"}
