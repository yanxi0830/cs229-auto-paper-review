A popular approach to reduce computational cost, facilitate information representation and accelerate knowledge discovery is to eliminate bands that do not improve the classification and analysis methods being applied. In particular, algorithms that perform band elimination should be designed to take advantage of the specifics of the classification method being used. This paper employs a recently proposed filter-feature-selection algorithm based on minimizing a tight bound on the VC dimension. We have successfully applied this algorithm to determine a reasonable subset of bands without any user-defined stopping criteria on widely used hyperspectral images and demonstrate that this method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both sparsity of feature set as well as accuracy of classification.\\end{abstract}", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 27 Sep 2015 17:36:18 GMT  (537kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08112v1", "basic papers are onthis http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "basic papers are onthis http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["phool preet", "sanjit singh batra", "jayadeva"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.08112"}
