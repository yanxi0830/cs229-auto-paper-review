Doc2VecC represents each document as a simple average of word embeddings. It ensures a representation generated as such captures the semantic meanings of the document during learning. A corruption model is included, which introduces a data-dependent regularization that favors informative or rare words while forcing the embeddings of common and non-discriminative ones to be close to zero. Doc2VecC produces significantly better word embeddings than Word2Vec. We compare Doc2VecC with several state-of-the-art document representation learning algorithms. The simple model architecture introduced by Doc2VecC matches or out-performs the state-of-the-art in generating high-quality document representations for sentiment analysis, document classification as well as semantic relatedness tasks. The simplicity of the model enables training on billions of words per hour on a single machine. At the same time, the model is very efficient in generating representations of unseen documents at test time.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 8 Jul 2017 00:57:01 GMT  (664kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.02377v1", "5th International Conference on Learning Representations, 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "5th International Conference on Learning Representations, 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["minmin chen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.02377"}
