LTLS embeds large classification problems into simple structured prediction problems and relies on efficient dynamic programming algorithms for inference. We train LTLS with stochastic gradient descent on a number of multiclass and multilabel datasets and show that despite its small memory footprint it is often competitive with existing approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 10:10:43 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01964v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["kalina jasinska", "nikos karampatziakis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01964"}
