{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "30-Jun-2012", "title": "On Multilabel Classification and Ranking with Partial Feedback", "abstract": "We present a novel multilabel/ranking algorithm working in partial information settings. The algorithm is based on 2nd-order descent methods, and relies on upper-confidence bounds to trade-off exploration and exploitation. We analyze this algorithm in a partial adversarial setting, where covariates can be adversarial, but multilabel probabilities are ruled by (generalized) linear models. We show O(T^{1/2} log T) regret bounds, which improve in several ways on the existing results. We test the effectiveness of our upper-confidence scheme by contrasting against full-information baselines on real-world multilabel datasets, often obtaining comparable performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 30 Jun 2012 23:07:03 GMT  (127kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0166v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 20 Nov 2012 16:48:22 GMT  (128kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0166v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 19:19:34 GMT  (133kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0166v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["claudio gentile", "francesco orabona"], "accepted": true, "id": "1207.0166"}
