The straightforward way to do this is to (a) first sketch $A$ and $B$ individually, and then (b) find the top components using PCA on the sketch. Our algorithm in contrast retains additional summary information about $A,B$ (e.g. row and column norms etc.) and uses this additional information to obtain an improved approximation from the sketches. Our main analytical result establishes a comparable spectral norm guarantee to existing two-pass methods; in addition we also provide results from an Apache Spark implementation that shows better computational and statistical performance on real-world and synthetic evaluation datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Oct 2016 02:45:46 GMT  (407kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06656v1", "24 pages, 4 figures, NIPS 2016"], ["v2", "Wed, 26 Oct 2016 13:58:24 GMT  (407kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06656v2", "24 pages, 4 figures, NIPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "24 pages, 4 figures, NIPS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.DS cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "authors": ["shanshan wu", "srinadh bhojanapalli", "sujay sanghavi", "alexandros g dimakis"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.06656"}
