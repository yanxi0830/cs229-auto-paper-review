Current learning methods are either based on approximations of the hypergraphs via graphs or on tensor methods which are only applicable under special conditions. In this paper, we present a new learning framework on hypergraphs which fully uses the hypergraph structure. The key element is a family of regularization functionals based on the total variation on hypergraphs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Dec 2013 15:35:32 GMT  (62kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5179v1", "Long version of paper accepted at NIPS 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "Long version of paper accepted at NIPS 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG math.OC", "authors": ["matthias hein 0001", "simon setzer", "leonardo jost", "syama sundar rangapuram"], "accepted": true, "id": "1312.5179"}
