However, its application has been hindered by the computational complexity of extended dynamic mode decomposition; this requires a combinatorially large basis set to adequately describe many nonlinear systems of interest, e.g. cyber-physical infrastructure systems, biological networks, social systems, and fluid dynamics. Often the dictionaries generated for these problems are manually curated, requiring domain-specific knowledge and painstaking tuning. In this paper we introduce a deep learning framework for learning Koopman operators of nonlinear dynamical systems. We show that this novel method automatically selects efficient deep dictionaries, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We benchmark this method on partially observed nonlinear systems, including the glycolytic oscillator and show it is able to predict quantitatively 100 steps into the future, using only a single timepoint, and qualitative oscillatory behavior 400 steps into the future.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Aug 2017 23:32:19 GMT  (6231kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06850v1", "16 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["enoch yeung", "soumya kundu", "nathan hodas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.06850"}
