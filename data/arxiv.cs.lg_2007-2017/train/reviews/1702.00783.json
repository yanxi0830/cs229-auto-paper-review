A low resolution image may correspond to multiple plausible high resolution images, thus modeling the super resolution process with a pixel independent conditional model often results in averaging different details--hence blurry edges. By contrast, our model is able to represent a multimodal conditional distribution by properly modeling the statistical dependencies among the high resolution image pixels, conditioned on a low resolution input. We employ a PixelCNN architecture to define a strong prior over natural images and jointly optimize this prior with a deep conditioning convolutional network. Human evaluations indicate that samples from our proposed model look more photo realistic than a strong L2 regression baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Feb 2017 18:59:17 GMT  (3565kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00783v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 16:13:21 GMT  (4255kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00783v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["ryan dahl", "mohammad norouzi", "jonathon shlens"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.00783"}
