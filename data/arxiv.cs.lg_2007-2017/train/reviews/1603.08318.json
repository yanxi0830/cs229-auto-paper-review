This paper defines a novel measurement of diversity, termed as exclusivity. With the designed exclusivity, we further propose an ensemble model, namely Exclusivity Regularized Machine (ERM), to jointly suppress the training error of ensemble and enhance the diversity between bases. Moreover, an Augmented Lagrange Multiplier based algorithm is customized to effectively and efficiently seek the optimal solution of ERM. Theoretical analysis on convergence and global optimality of the proposed algorithm, as well as experiments are provided to reveal the efficacy of our method and show its superiority over state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of accuracy and efficiency.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Mar 2016 05:58:15 GMT  (30kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08318v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 16 May 2016 07:02:05 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08318v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["xiaojie guo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.08318"}
