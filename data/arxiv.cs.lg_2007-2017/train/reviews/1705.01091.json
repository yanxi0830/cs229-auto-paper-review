The supersolutions of the resulting non-linear parabolic partial differential equation are closely related to the potential functions in the sense of N.\\,Cesa-Bianci, G.\\,Lugosi (2003). Any such supersolution gives an upper bound for forecaster's regret and suggests a potential-based prediction strategy, satisfying the Blackwell condition. A conventional upper bound for the worst-case regret is justified by a simple verification argument.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 May 2017 17:56:54 GMT  (8kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01091v1", "7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["dmitry b rokhlin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.01091"}
