Two combinatorial parameters, the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension and its generalization, the Fat Shattering dimension of scale e, are explained and a few examples of their calculations are given with proofs. We then explain Sauer's Lemma, which involves the VC dimension and is used to prove the equivalence of a concept class being distribution-free PAC learnable and it having finite VC dimension.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 May 2011 20:04:16 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.4618v1", "Winter 2011 Honours research project done under the supervision of Dr. Vladimir Pestov at the University of Ottawa; 35 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Winter 2011 Honours research project done under the supervision of Dr. Vladimir Pestov at the University of Ottawa; 35 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hubert haoyang duan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.4618"}
