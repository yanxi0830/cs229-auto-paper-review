While region-level models often feature dense pairwise connectivity, pixel-level models are considerably larger and have only permitted sparse graph structures. In this paper, we consider fully connected CRF models defined on the complete set of pixels in an image. The resulting graphs have billions of edges, making traditional inference algorithms impractical. Our main contribution is a highly efficient approximate inference algorithm for fully connected CRF models in which the pairwise edge potentials are defined by a linear combination of Gaussian kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that dense connectivity at the pixel level substantially improves segmentation and labeling accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 Oct 2012 17:41:23 GMT  (3893kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.5644v1", "NIPS 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["philipp kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl", "vladlen koltun"], "accepted": true, "id": "1210.5644"}
