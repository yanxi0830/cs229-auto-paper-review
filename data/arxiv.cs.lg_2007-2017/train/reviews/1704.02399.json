However, policy gradient methods suffer from high variance, slow convergence, and inefficient exploration. In this work, we introduce a maximum entropy policy optimization framework which explicitly encourages parameter exploration, and show that this framework can be reduced to a Bayesian inference problem. We then propose a novel Stein variational policy gradient method (SVPG) which combines existing policy gradient methods and a repulsive functional to generate a set of diverse but well-behaved policies. SVPG is robust to initialization and can easily be implemented in a parallel manner. On continuous control problems, we find that implementing SVPG on top of REINFORCE and advantage actor-critic algorithms improves both average return and data efficiency.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Apr 2017 23:24:07 GMT  (4246kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02399v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yang liu", "prajit ramachandran", "qiang liu", "jian peng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.02399"}
