This paper describes the solution of team \"binghsu &amp; MLRush &amp; BrickMover\". We conduct simple feature engineering work and train different models by each individual team member. Afterwards, we use listwise ensemble method to combine each model's output. Besides describing effective model and features, we will discuss about the lessons we learned while using deep learning in this competition.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 29 Nov 2013 20:01:10 GMT  (314kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.7679v1", "6 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["xudong liu", "bing xu", "yuyu zhang", "qiang yan", "liang pang", "qiang li", "hanxiao sun", "bin wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1311.7679"}
