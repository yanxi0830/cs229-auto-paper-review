We conclude that this new quantity tightly characterizes the true sample complexity of large-margin classification. The bounds hold for a rich family of sub-Gaussian distributions.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Nov 2010 10:44:21 GMT  (89kb,S)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5053v1", "Appearing in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2010; This is the full version, including appendix with proofs"], ["v2", "Thu, 5 Apr 2012 16:40:03 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.5053v2", "Appearing in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2010; This is the full version, including appendix with proofs; Also with some corrections"]], "COMMENTS": "Appearing in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2010; This is the full version, including appendix with proofs", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.PR math.ST stat.ML stat.TH", "authors": ["sivan sabato", "nathan srebro", "naftali tishby"], "accepted": true, "id": "1011.5053"}
