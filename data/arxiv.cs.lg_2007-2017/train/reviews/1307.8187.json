We apply a minimax analysis, beginning with the fixed horizon case, and then moving on to two unknown-horizon settings, one that assumes the horizon is chosen randomly according to some known distribution, and the other which allows the adversary full control over the horizon. For the random horizon setting with restricted losses, we derive a fully optimal minimax algorithm. And for the adversarial horizon setting, we prove a nontrivial lower bound which shows that the adversary obtains strictly more power than when the horizon is fixed and known. Based on the minimax solution of the random horizon setting, we then propose a new adaptive algorithm which \"pretends\" that the horizon is drawn from a distribution from a special family, but no matter how the actual horizon is chosen, the worst-case regret is of the optimal rate. Furthermore, our algorithm can be generalized in many ways, including handling other unknown information and other online learning settings. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms many other existing algorithms in an online linear optimization setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 01:49:50 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.8187v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 6 Oct 2013 18:49:58 GMT  (47kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.8187v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["haipeng luo", "robert e schapire"], "accepted": true, "id": "1307.8187"}
