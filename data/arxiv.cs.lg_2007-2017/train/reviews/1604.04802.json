We demonstrate that our combined system along with auxiliary features outperforms the best performing system for both tasks in the 2015 competition, several ensembling baselines, as well as the state-of-the-art stacking approach to ensembling KBP systems. The success of our technique on two different and challenging problems demonstrates the power and generality of our combined approach to ensembling.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 16 Apr 2016 21:18:14 GMT  (383kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04802v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["nazneen fatema rajani", "raymond j mooney"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.04802"}
