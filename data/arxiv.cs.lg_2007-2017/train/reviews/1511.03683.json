Using a simple input replication strategy, we preserve the signal of auxiliary input across wider sequence intervals than can feasibly be trained by back-propagation through time. Our main results center on a large corpus of 1.5 million beer reviews from BeerAdvocate. In generative mode, our network produces reviews on command, tailored to a star rating or item category. The generative model can also run in reverse, performing classification with surprising accuracy. Performance of the reverse model provides a straightforward way to determine what the generative model knows without relying too heavily on subjective analysis. Given a review, the model can accurately determine the corresponding rating and infer the beer's category (IPA, Stout, etc.). We exploit this capability, tracking perceived sentiment and class membership as each character in a review is processed. Quantitative and qualitative empirical evaluations demonstrate that the model captures meaning and learns nonlinear dynamics in text, such as the effect of negation on sentiment, despite possessing no a priori notion of words. Because the model operates at the character level, it handles misspellings, slang, and large vocabularies without any machinery explicitly dedicated to the purpose.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Nov 2015 21:16:59 GMT  (1020kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03683v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 16 Nov 2015 10:27:27 GMT  (1080kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03683v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 08:20:05 GMT  (1080kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03683v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 19:17:07 GMT  (1072kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03683v4", null], ["v5", "Thu, 7 Apr 2016 07:08:42 GMT  (1211kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03683v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["zachary c lipton", "sharad vikram", "julian mcauley"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.03683"}
