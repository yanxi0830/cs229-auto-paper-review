This interactive learning will help with one of the most prevailing problems of open domain dialog system, which is the sparsity of facts a dialog system can reason about. The proposed dataset, consisting of 1900 collected dialogs, allows simulation of an interactive gaining of denotations and questions explanations from users which can be used for the interactive learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 15:13:51 GMT  (497kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09631v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 15 May 2016 13:03:26 GMT  (497kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09631v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["miroslav vodol\\'an", "filip jur\\v{c}\\'i\\v{c}ek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.09631"}
