We improve the previous best result of Buhrman et al. by an $\\exp(k)$ factor in the time complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Feb 2015 20:36:19 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05375v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.DM cs.LG", "authors": ["arnab bhattacharyya", "ameet gadekar", "ninad rajgopal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.05375"}
