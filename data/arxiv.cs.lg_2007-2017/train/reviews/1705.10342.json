{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "29-May-2017", "title": "Deep Learning for Ontology Reasoning", "abstract": "In this work, we present a novel approach to ontology reasoning that is based on deep learning rather than logic-based formal reasoning. To this end, we introduce a new model for statistical relational learning that is built upon deep recursive neural networks, and give experimental evidence that it can easily compete with, or even outperform, existing logic-based reasoners on the task of ontology reasoning. More precisely, we compared our implemented system with one of the best logic-based ontology reasoners at present, RDFox, on a number of large standard benchmark datasets, and found that our system attained high reasoning quality, while being up to two orders of magnitude faster.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 May 2017 18:17:52 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10342v1", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["patrick hohenecker", "thomas lukasiewicz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10342"}
