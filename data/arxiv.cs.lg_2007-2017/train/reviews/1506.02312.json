In such application areas, learning is a desirable feature to provide agents with the ability to adapt and improve interactions with humans and environment, but often discarded due to its unreliability. In this paper, we propose a framework that uses Reinforcement Learning nodes as part of Behavior Trees to address the problem of adding learning capabilities in constrained agents. We show how this framework relates to Options in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, ensuring convergence of nested learning nodes, and we empirically show that the learning nodes do not affect the execution of other nodes in the tree.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 7 Jun 2015 20:52:31 GMT  (305kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02312v1", "2015; 15 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "2015; 15 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO cs.SY", "authors": ["renato de pontes pereira", "paulo martins engel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.02312"}
