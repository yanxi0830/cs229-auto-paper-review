We formulate a unified optimization problem handling these three settings and derive algorithms whose core iteration complexity is concentrated in a k-means clustering step, which can be approximated efficiently. We test our methods on both artificial and realistic data sets extracted from movie reviews and 20NewsGroup.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 10:44:30 GMT  (241kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04908v1", "Submitted to NIPS"], ["v2", "Fri, 11 Mar 2016 09:22:47 GMT  (244kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04908v2", "Submitted to ICML"], ["v3", "Mon, 19 Sep 2016 08:37:40 GMT  (212kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04908v3", "Completely rewritten.
