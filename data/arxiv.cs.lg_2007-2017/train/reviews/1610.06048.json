Anatomy preserves all data values, but introduces uncertainty in the mapping between identifying and sensitive values. We first study the theoretical effect of the anatomized training data on the k nearest neighbor error rate bounds, nearest neighbor convergence rate, and Bayesian error. We then validate the derived bounds empirically. We show that 1) Learning from anatomized data approaches the limits of learning through the unprotected data (although requiring larger training data), and 2) nearest neighbor using anatomized data outperforms nearest neighbor on generalization-based anonymization.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Oct 2016 15:00:59 GMT  (113kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06048v1", "Technical Report. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1610.05815"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical Report. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1610.05815", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR cs.DB", "authors": ["koray mancuhan", "chris clifton"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06048"}
