{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-Sep-2011", "title": "Fast approximation of matrix coherence and statistical leverage", "abstract": "The \\emph{statistical leverage scores} of a matrix $A$ are the squared row-norms of the matrix containing its (top) left singular vectors and the \\emph{coherence} is the largest leverage score. These quantities have been of interest in recently-popular problems such as matrix completion and Nystr\\\"{o}m-based low-rank matrix approximation; in large-scale statistical data analysis applications more generally; and since they define the key structural nonuniformity that must be dealt with in developing fast randomized matrix algorithms. Our main result is a randomized algorithm that takes as input an arbitrary $n \\times d$ matrix $A$, with $n \\gg d$, and that returns as output relative-error approximations to \\emph{all} $n$ of the statistical leverage scores. The proposed algorithm runs (under assumptions on the precise values of $n$ and $d$) in $O(n d \\log n)$ time, as opposed to the $O(nd^2)$ time required by the na\\\"{i}ve algorithm that involves computing an orthogonal basis for the range of $A$. Our analysis may be viewed in terms of computing a relative-error approximation to an \\emph{under}constrained least-squares approximation problem, or, relatedly, it may be viewed as an application of Johnson-Lindenstrauss type ideas. Several practically-important extensions of our basic result are also described, including the approximation of so-called cross-leverage scores, the extension of these ideas to matrices with $n \\approx d$, and the extension to streaming environments.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 18 Sep 2011 04:38:12 GMT  (60kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1109.3843v1", "28 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 5 Dec 2012 00:13:53 GMT  (35kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.3843v2", "29 pages; conference version is in ICML; journal version is in JMLR"]], "COMMENTS": "28 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.DM cs.LG", "authors": ["michael w mahoney", "petros drineas", "malik magdon-ismail", "david p woodruff"], "accepted": true, "id": "1109.3843"}
