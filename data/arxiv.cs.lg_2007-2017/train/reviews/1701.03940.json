By performing rank-one updates on its precision matrices and determinants, its asymptotic time complexity is of \\BigO{NKD^2} for $N$ data points, $K$ Gaussian components and $D$ dimensions. The resulting algorithm can be applied to high dimensional tasks, and this is confirmed by applying it to the classification datasets MNIST and CIFAR-10. Additionally, in order to show the algorithm's applicability to function approximation and control tasks, it is applied to three reinforcement learning tasks and its data-efficiency is evaluated.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 14 Jan 2017 16:15:44 GMT  (49kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.03940v1", "13 pages, 1 figure, submitted for peer-review. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1506.04422"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 1 figure, submitted for peer-review. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1506.04422", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["rafael pinto", "paulo engel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.03940"}
