{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-Feb-2013", "title": "Maxout Networks", "abstract": "We consider the problem of designing models to leverage a recently introduced approximate model averaging technique called dropout. We define a simple new model called maxout (so named because its {\\em out}put is the max of a set of inputs, and because it is a natural companion to dropout) designed to both facilitate optimization by dropout and improve the accuracy of dropout's fast approximate model averaging technique. We empirically verify that the model successfully accomplishes both of these tasks. We use maxout and dropout to demonstrate state of the art classification performance on four benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Feb 2013 18:59:07 GMT  (517kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4389v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 19 Feb 2013 04:39:48 GMT  (484kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4389v2", "Revision; fixed a broken reference and removed a latex command from the abstract on the metadata page"], ["v3", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 22:33:13 GMT  (485kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4389v3", "Corrected a mistake in the \"Review of dropout\" section"], ["v4", "Fri, 20 Sep 2013 08:54:35 GMT  (1433kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4389v4", "This is the version of the paper that appears in ICML 2013"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["ian j goodfellow", "david warde-farley", "mehdi mirza", "aaron c courville", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": true, "id": "1302.4389"}
