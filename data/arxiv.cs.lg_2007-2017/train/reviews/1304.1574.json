Without loss of generality, we consider two kinds of representative domain adaptation: one is with multiple sources and the other is combining source and target data.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Apr 2013 22:34:55 GMT  (421kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.1574v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.PR", "authors": ["chao zhang", "lei zhang", "jieping ye"], "accepted": true, "id": "1304.1574"}
