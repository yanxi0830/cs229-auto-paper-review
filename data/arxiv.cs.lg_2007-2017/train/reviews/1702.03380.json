Two nonlinear functions are considered: the rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a linear unit with both lower and upper cutoffs (DCutLU). The problem reformulation over a graph is realized by explicitly representing ReLU or DCutLU using a set of slack variables. We then apply the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to update the weights of the network layerwise by solving subproblems of the reformulated problem. Empirical results suggest that by proper parameter selection, the ADMM- based method converges considerably faster than gradient descent method.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 11 Feb 2017 04:02:40 GMT  (889kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03380v1", "5 pages"], ["v2", "Sat, 17 Jun 2017 11:18:48 GMT  (973kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03380v2", "5 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DC", "authors": ["guoqiang zhang", "w bastiaan kleijn"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.03380"}
