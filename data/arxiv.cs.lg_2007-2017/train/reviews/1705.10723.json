In the overconstrained regression problem, one is given an $n \\times d$ matrix $A$, with $n \\gg d$, as well as an $n \\times 1$ vector $b$, and one wants to find a vector $\\hat{x}$ so as to minimize the residual error $\\|Ax-b\\|_2$. Using the sketch and solve paradigm, one first computes $S \\cdot A$ and $S \\cdot b$ for a randomly chosen matrix $S$, then outputs $x' = (SA)^{\\dagger} Sb$ so as to minimize $\\|SAx' - Sb\\|_2$.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 May 2017 16:20:34 GMT  (129kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10723v1", "ICALP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ICALP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["eric price", "zhao song", "david p woodruff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10723"}
