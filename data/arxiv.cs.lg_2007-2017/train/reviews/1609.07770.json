Various malwares incorporate code obfuscation methods that alters their code signatures effectively countering antimalware detection techniques utilizing static methods and signature database. In this study, we utilized an approach of converting a malware binary into an image and use Random Forest to classify various malware families. The resulting accuracy of 0.9562 exhibits the effectivess of the method in detecting malware", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 25 Sep 2016 16:43:44 GMT  (420kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07770v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["felan carlo c garcia", "felix p muga ii"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.07770"}
