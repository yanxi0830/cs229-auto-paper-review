The observations are the noisy realizations of the sum of an (appproximately) low rank matrix $\\Theta^\\star$ with a second matrix $\\Gamma^\\star$ endowed with a complementary form of low-dimensional structure. We derive a general theorem that gives upper bounds on the Frobenius norm error for an estimate of the pair $(\\Theta^\\star, \\Gamma^\\star)$ obtained by solving a convex optimization problem that combines the nuclear norm with a general decomposable regularizer. We then specialize this result to two cases that have been studied in the context of robust PCA: low rank plus an entrywise sparse matrix, and low rank plus a columnwise sparse matrix. For both models, our theory yields non-asymptotic Frobenius error bounds for both for deterministic and stochastic noise matrices, and applies to matrices $\\Theta^\\star$ that can be exactly or approximately low rank, and matrices $\\Gamma^\\star$ that can be exactly or approximately sparse. Moreover, for the case of stochastic noise matrices, we establish matching lower bounds on the minimax error, showing that our results cannot be improved beyond constant factors. The sharpness of our theoretical predictions is confirmed by numerical simulations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Feb 2011 18:02:53 GMT  (368kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4807v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 18 Jul 2011 02:25:47 GMT  (379kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4807v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 6 Mar 2012 06:59:59 GMT  (384kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4807v3", "41 pages, 2 figures"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "authors": ["alekh agarwal", "sahand negahban", "martin j wainwright"], "accepted": true, "id": "1102.4807"}
