However, there exist other important examples, such as text documents or bioinformatic data, that may lack some or all of these strong statistical regularities.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 22:31:09 GMT  (4299kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05163v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["mikael henaff", "joan bruna", "yann lecun"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.05163"}
