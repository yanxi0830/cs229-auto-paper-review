The computational complexity of the exact decoding/inference in latent conditional random fields is unclear. In this paper, we try to clarify the computational complexity of the exact decoding. We analyze the complexity and demonstrate that it is an NP-hard problem even on a sequential labeling setting. Furthermore, we propose the latent-dynamic inference (LDI-Naive) method and its bounded version (LDI-Bounded), which are able to perform exact-inference or almost-exact-inference by using top-$n$ search and dynamic programming.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Jun 2014 11:17:58 GMT  (204kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4682v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CC cs.LG", "authors": ["xu sun"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.4682"}
