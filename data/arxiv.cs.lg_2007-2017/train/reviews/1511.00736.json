The number of publicly available protein structures has increasingly become extremely large. Still, the determination of the function of a protein structure remains a difficult, costly, and time consuming task. The difficulties are often due to the essential role of spatial and topological structures in the determination of protein functions in living cells. In this paper, we propose ProtNN, a novel approach for protein function prediction. Given an unannotated protein structure and a set of annotated proteins, ProtNN finds the nearest neighbor annotated structures based on protein graph pairwise similarities. ProtNN assigns to the query protein the function with the highest number of votes across the set of $k$ nearest neighbor reference proteins, where $k$ is a user defined parameter. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that ProtNN is able to accurately classify several datasets in an extremely fast runtime compared to state-of-the-art approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 2 Nov 2015 23:02:48 GMT  (971kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00736v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 25 Jan 2016 01:55:45 GMT  (1369kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00736v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SI", "authors": ["wajdi dhifli", "abdoulaye banir\\'e diallo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.00736"}
