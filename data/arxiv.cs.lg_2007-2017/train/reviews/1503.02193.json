In this framework the algorithm is shown a pair of items at each step, chosen from a set of $n$ items. The learner then predicts a label for each item, from a label set of size $L$ and receives a real valued payoff. This is a natural framework which captures many interesting scenarios such as collaborative filtering, online gambling, and online max cut among others. (Christiano, 2014a) designed an efficient online learning algorithm for this problem achieving a regret of $O(\\sqrt{nL^3T})$, where $T$ is the number of rounds. Information theoretically, one can achieve a regret of $O(\\sqrt{n \\log L T})$. One of the main open questions left in this framework concerns closing the above gap.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 Mar 2015 17:36:08 GMT  (19kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02193v1", "17 pages"], ["v2", "Mon, 24 Aug 2015 19:56:12 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02193v2", "13 pages; Changes from previous version: small changes to proofs of Theorems 1 &amp; 2, a small rewrite of introduction as well (this version is the same as camera-ready copy in COLT '15)"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["pranjal awasthi", "moses charikar", "kevin a lai", "rej risteski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.02193"}
