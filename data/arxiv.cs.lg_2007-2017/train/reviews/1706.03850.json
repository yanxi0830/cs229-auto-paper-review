However, convergence issues and difficulties dealing with discrete data hinder the applicability of GAN to text. We propose a framework for generating realistic text via adversarial training. We employ a long short-term memory network as generator, and a convolutional network as discriminator. Instead of using the standard objective of GAN, we propose matching the high-dimensional latent feature distributions of real and synthetic sentences, via a kernelized discrepancy metric. This eases adversarial training by alleviating the mode-collapsing problem. Our experiments show superior performance in quantitative evaluation, and demonstrate that our model can generate realistic-looking sentences.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 20:55:51 GMT  (1244kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03850v1", "Accepted by ICML 2017"], ["v2", "Sat, 29 Jul 2017 05:50:13 GMT  (2106kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03850v2", "Accepted by ICML 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by ICML 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["yizhe zhang", "zhe gan", "kai fan", "zhi chen", "ricardo henao", "dinghan shen", "lawrence carin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.03850"}
