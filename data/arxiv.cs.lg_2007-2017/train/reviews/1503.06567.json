It's closely related to Expectation Maximization (EM), and is applied when exact EM is computationally infeasible. Despite being immensely popular, current theoretical understanding of the effectiveness of variaitonal inference based algorithms is very limited. In this work we provide the first analysis of instances where variational inference algorithms converge to the global optimum, in the setting of topic models.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Mar 2015 09:20:39 GMT  (48kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06567v1", "47 pages"], ["v2", "Sat, 22 Aug 2015 11:24:43 GMT  (49kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06567v2", "46 pages, Compared to previous version: clarified notation, a number of typos fixed throughout paper"]], "COMMENTS": "47 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS stat.ML", "authors": ["pranjal awasthi", "andrej risteski"], "accepted": true, "id": "1503.06567"}
