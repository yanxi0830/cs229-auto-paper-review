{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "6-Aug-2016", "title": "Bi-directional Attention with Agreement for Dependency Parsing", "abstract": "We develop a novel bi-directional attention model for dependency parsing, which learns to agree on headword predictions from the forward and backward parsing directions. The parsing procedure for each direction is formulated as sequentially querying the memory component that stores continuous headword embeddings. The proposed parser makes use of soft headword embeddings, allowing the model to implicitly capture high-order parsing history without dramatically increasing the computational complexity. We conduct experiments on English, Chinese, and 12 other languages from the CoNLL 2006 shared task, showing that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art unlabeled attachment scores on 7 languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 6 Aug 2016 07:16:31 GMT  (92kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02076v1", "EMNLP 2016"], ["v2", "Thu, 22 Sep 2016 08:52:31 GMT  (92kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.02076v2", "EMNLP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["hao cheng", "hao fang", "xiaodong he", "jianfeng gao", "li deng"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.02076"}
