{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "13-Jan-2017", "title": "End-to-End ASR-free Keyword Search from Speech", "abstract": "End-to-end (E2E) systems have achieved competitive results compared to conventional hybrid hidden Markov model (HMM)-deep neural network based automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems. Such E2E systems are attractive due to the lack of dependence on alignments between input acoustic and output grapheme or HMM state sequence during training. This paper explores the design of an ASR-free end-to-end system for text query-based keyword search (KWS) from speech trained with minimal supervision. Our E2E KWS system consists of three sub-systems. The first sub-system is a recurrent neural network (RNN)-based acoustic auto-encoder trained to reconstruct the audio through a finite-dimensional representation. The second sub-system is a character-level RNN language model using embeddings learned from a convolutional neural network. Since the acoustic and text query embeddings occupy different representation spaces, they are input to a third feed-forward neural network that predicts whether the query occurs in the acoustic utterance or not. This E2E ASR-free KWS system performs respectably despite lacking a conventional ASR system and trains much faster.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Jan 2017 15:05:39 GMT  (740kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04313v1", "Published in the IEEE 2017 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2017), scheduled for 5-9 March 2017 in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA"]], "COMMENTS": "Published in the IEEE 2017 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2017), scheduled for 5-9 March 2017 in New Orleans, Louisiana, USA", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["kartik audhkhasi", "rew rosenberg", "abhinav sethy", "bhuvana ramabhadran", "brian kingsbury"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.04313"}
