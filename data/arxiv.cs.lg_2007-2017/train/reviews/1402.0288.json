The volume approximation has hitherto been successfully applied to binary learning problems. In this paper, we extend it naturally to a more general definition which can be applied to several transductive problem settings, such as multi-class, multi-label and serendipitous learning. Even though the resultant learning method involves a non-convex optimization problem, the globally optimal solution is almost surely unique and can be obtained in O(n^3) time. We theoretically provide stability and error analyses for the proposed method, and then experimentally show that it is promising.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Feb 2014 06:09:52 GMT  (261kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0288v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["gang niu", "bo dai", "marthinus christoffel du plessis", "masashi sugiyama"], "accepted": true, "id": "1402.0288"}
