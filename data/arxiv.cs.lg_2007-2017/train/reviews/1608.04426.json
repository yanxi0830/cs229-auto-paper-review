We demonstrate that overfitting occurs in such models just as in deep feedforward neural networks, and discuss possible regularization methods to reduce overfitting. We consider weight decay, model averaging methods, and backward elimination, and propose revised model averaging methods to improve their efficiency. We also discuss the asymptotic convergence properties of these methods. Finally, we compare the performance of these methods using likelihood and classification error rates on various pattern recognition data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Aug 2016 22:28:05 GMT  (61kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04426v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 30 Aug 2016 23:41:53 GMT  (66kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04426v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 5 Sep 2016 16:53:55 GMT  (66kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04426v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 17 Feb 2017 02:49:12 GMT  (147kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04426v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["baiyang wang", "diego klabjan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.04426"}
