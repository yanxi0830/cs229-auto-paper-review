{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "24-Jun-2016", "title": "Hybrid Recommender System based on Autoencoders", "abstract": "A standard model for Recommender Systems is the Matrix Completion setting: given partially known matrix of ratings given by users (rows) to items (columns), infer the unknown ratings. In the last decades, few attempts where done to handle that objective with Neural Networks, but recently an architecture based on Autoencoders proved to be a promising approach. In current paper, we enhanced that architecture (i) by using a loss function adapted to input data with missing values, and (ii) by incorporating side information. The experiments demonstrate that while side information only slightly improve the test error averaged on all users/items, it has more impact on cold users/items.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jun 2016 12:37:04 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07659v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1603.00806"], ["v2", "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 15:41:21 GMT  (36kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07659v2", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1603.00806"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1603.00806", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IR", "authors": ["florian strub", "romaric gaudel", "j\\'er\\'emie mary"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07659"}
