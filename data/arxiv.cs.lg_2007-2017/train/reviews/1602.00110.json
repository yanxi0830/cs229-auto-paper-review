We obtain an incisive and compact DNA-inspired characterization of user actions. Then, we apply standard DNA analysis techniques to discriminate between genuine and spambot accounts on Twitter. An experimental campaign supports our proposal, showing its effectiveness and viability. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first ones to identify and adapt DNA-inspired techniques to online user behavioral modeling. While Twitter spambot detection is a specific use case on a specific social media, our proposed methodology is platform and technology agnostic, hence paving the way for diverse behavioral characterization tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 30 Jan 2016 12:03:45 GMT  (238kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00110v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["stefano cresci", "roberto di pietro", "marinella petrocchi", "angelo spognardi", "maurizio tesconi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.00110"}
