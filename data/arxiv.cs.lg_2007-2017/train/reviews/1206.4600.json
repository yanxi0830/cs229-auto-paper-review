A Dirichlet process prior (DPP) model defined over class distributions ensures that both known and unknown class distributions originate according to a common base distribution. In an attempt to automatically discover potentially interesting class formations, the prior model is coupled with a suitably chosen data model, and sequential Monte Carlo sampling is used to perform online inference. Our research is driven by a biodetection application, where a new class of pathogen may suddenly appear, and the rapid increase in the number of samples originating from this class indicates the onset of an outbreak.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 14:40:38 GMT  (405kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4600v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["murat dundar", "ferit akova", "alan qi", "bartek rajwa"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4600"}
