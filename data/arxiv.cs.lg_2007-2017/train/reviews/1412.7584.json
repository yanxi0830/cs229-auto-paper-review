Thus it seems hard to reconcile these competing interests. However, they frequently must be balanced when mining sensitive data. For example, medical research represents an important application where it is necessary both to extract useful information and protect patient privacy. One way to resolve the conflict is to extract general characteristics of whole populations without disclosing the private information of individuals.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Dec 2014 01:51:06 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7584v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR cs.DB", "authors": ["zhanglong ji", "zachary c lipton", "charles elkan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.7584"}
