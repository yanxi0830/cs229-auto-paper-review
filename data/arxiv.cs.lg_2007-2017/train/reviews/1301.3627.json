Much recent progress in the field has focused on efficient and effective methods for computing representations. In this paper, we propose an alternative method that is more efficient than prior work and produces representations that have a property we call focality -- a property we hypothesize to be important for neural network representations. The method consists of a simple application of two consecutive SVDs and is inspired by Anandkumar (2012).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 08:37:39 GMT  (84kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3627v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 11 May 2013 12:17:44 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3627v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["hinrich schuetze", "christian scheible"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3627"}
