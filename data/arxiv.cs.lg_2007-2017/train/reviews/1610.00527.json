{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "3-Oct-2016", "title": "Video Pixel Networks", "abstract": "We propose a probabilistic video model, the Video Pixel Network (VPN), that estimates the discrete joint distribution of the raw pixel values in a video. The model and the neural architecture reflect the time, space and color structure of video tensors and encode it as a four-dimensional dependency chain. The VPN approaches the best possible performance on the Moving MNIST benchmark, a leap over the previous state of the art, and the generated videos show only minor deviations from the ground truth. The VPN also produces detailed samples on the action-conditional Robotic Pushing benchmark and generalizes to the motion of novel objects.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 13:06:40 GMT  (5347kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00527v1", "16 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["nal kalchbrenner", "a\u00e4ron van den oord", "karen simonyan", "ivo danihelka", "oriol vinyals", "alex graves", "koray kavukcuoglu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.00527"}
