We investigate the possibility of using deep residual convolutional neural network with spectrograms as an input features in the text-dependent speaker verification task. Despite the fact that we were not able to surpass the baseline system in quality, we achieved a quite good results for such a new approach getting an 5.23\\% ERR on the RSR2015 evaluation part. Fusion of the baseline and proposed systems outperformed the best individual system by 18\\% relatively.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 May 2017 11:50:57 GMT  (1699kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10134v1", "Accepted for Specom 2017"], ["v2", "Tue, 30 May 2017 13:17:47 GMT  (1708kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10134v2", "Accepted for Specom 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for Specom 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.LG", "authors": ["egor malykh", "sergey novoselov", "oleg kudashev"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10134"}
