The crowds of smart devices offer opportunities to collectively sense and perform computing tasks in an unprecedented scale. This paper presents Crowd-ML, a privacy-preserving machine learning framework for a crowd of smart devices, which can solve a wide range of learning problems for crowdsensing data with differential privacy guarantees. Crowd-ML endows a crowdsensing system with an ability to learn classifiers or predictors online from crowdsensing data privately with minimal computational overheads on devices and servers, suitable for a practical and large-scale employment of the framework. We analyze the performance and the scalability of Crowd-ML, and implement the system with off-the-shelf smartphones as a proof of concept. We demonstrate the advantages of Crowd-ML with real and simulated experiments under various conditions.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 11 Jan 2015 18:57:28 GMT  (681kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02484v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR cs.DC cs.NI", "authors": ["jihun hamm", "adam champion", "guoxing chen", "mikhail belkin", "dong xuan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.02484"}
