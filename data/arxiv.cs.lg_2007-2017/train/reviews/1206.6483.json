While recently proposed kernels based on common subgraphs (Wale et al., 2008; Shervashidze et al., 2009) in general can not be applied to attributed graphs, our approach allows to rate mappings of subgraphs by a flexible scoring scheme comparing vertex and edge attributes by kernels. We show that subgraph matching kernels generalize several known kernels. To compute the kernel we propose a graph-theoretical algorithm inspired by a classical relation between common subgraphs of two graphs and cliques in their product graph observed by Levi (1973). Encouraging experimental results on a classification task of real-world graphs are presented.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (409kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6483v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["nils kriege", "petra mutzel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6483"}
