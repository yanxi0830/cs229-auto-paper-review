Clauses from many proof searches are classified as positive and negative based on their participation in the proofs. An efficient classification model is trained on this data, using fast feature-based characterization of the clauses . The learned model is then tightly linked with the core prover and used as a basis of a new parameterized evaluation heuristic that provides fast ranking of all generated clauses. The approach is evaluated on the E prover and the CASC 2016 AIM benchmark, showing a large increase of E's performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Jan 2017 18:03:52 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06532v1", "Submitted to LPAR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to LPAR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["jan jakub\\r{u}v", "josef urban"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.06532"}
