To exploit both deep learning and linguistic structures, we propose a tree-based convolutional neural network model which exploit various long-distance relationships between words. Our model improves the sequential baselines on all three sentiment and question classification tasks, and achieves the highest published accuracy on TREC.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Jul 2015 15:20:36 GMT  (530kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01839v1", "this paper has been accepted by ACL 2015"], ["v2", "Mon, 3 Aug 2015 15:36:45 GMT  (538kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01839v2", "this paper has been accepted by ACL 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "this paper has been accepted by ACL 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["mingbo ma", "liang huang", "bowen zhou", "bing xiang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1507.01839"}
