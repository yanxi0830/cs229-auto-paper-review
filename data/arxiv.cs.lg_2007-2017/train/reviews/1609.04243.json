CRNNs take advantage of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for local feature extraction and recurrent neural networks for temporal summarisation of the extracted features. We compare CRNN with two CNN structures that have been used for music tagging while controlling the number of parameters with respect to their performance and training time per sample. Overall, we found that CRNNs show strong performance with respect to the number of parameter and training time, indicating the effectiveness of its hybrid structure in music feature extraction and feature summarisation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Sep 2016 12:52:08 GMT  (100kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04243v1", "5 pages, ICASSP 2017 submitted"], ["v2", "Thu, 3 Nov 2016 07:50:14 GMT  (112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04243v2", "5 pages, ICASSP 2017 submitted.
