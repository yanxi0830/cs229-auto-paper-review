The classification model can also be utilized at image or patch level for many other applications, such as object detection and segmentation. In this paper, we propose a whole-image CNN regression model, by removing the full connection layer and training the network with continuous feature maps. This is a generic regression framework that fits many applications. We demonstrate this method through two tasks: simultaneous face detection &amp; segmentation, and scene saliency prediction. The result is comparable with other models in the respective fields, using only a small scale network. Since the regression model is trained on corresponding image / feature map pairs, there are no requirements on uniform input size as opposed to the classification model. Our framework avoids classifier design, a process that may introduce too much manual intervention in model development. Yet, it is highly correlated to the classification network and offers some in-deep review of CNN structures.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 06:43:58 GMT  (925kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6885v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["jun yuan", "bingbing ni", "ashraf a kassim"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.6885"}
