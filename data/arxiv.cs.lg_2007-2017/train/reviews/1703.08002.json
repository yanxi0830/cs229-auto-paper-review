A prominent limitation of current systems lies in the lack of matching and communication between the various technologies involved in the distant speech recognition process. The speech enhancement and speech recognition modules are, for instance, often trained independently. Moreover, the speech enhancement normally helps the speech recognizer, but the output of the latter is not commonly used, in turn, to improve the speech enhancement. To address both concerns, we propose a novel architecture based on a network of deep neural networks, where all the components are jointly trained and better cooperate with each other thanks to a full communication scheme between them. Experiments, conducted using different datasets, tasks and acoustic conditions, revealed that the proposed framework can overtake other competitive solutions, including recent joint training approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 11:02:47 GMT  (168kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08002v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["mirco ravanelli", "philemon brakel", "maurizio omologo", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08002"}
