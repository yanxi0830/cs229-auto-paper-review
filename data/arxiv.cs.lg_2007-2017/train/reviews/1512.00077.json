In our approach, we interpret the Viterbi algorithm as a repeated computation of matrix-vector $(\\max, +)$-multiplications. On time-homogeneous HMMs, this computation is online: a matrix, known in advance, has to be multiplied with several vectors revealed one at a time. Our main contribution is an algorithm solving this version of matrix-vector $(\\max,+)$-multiplication in subquadratic time, by performing a polynomial preprocessing of the matrix. Employing this fast multiplication algorithm, we solve the MAPD problem in $O(mn^2/ \\log n)$ time for any time-homogeneous HMM of size $n$ and observation sequence of length $m$, with an extra polynomial preprocessing cost negligible for $m &gt; n$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first algorithm for the MAPD problem requiring subquadratic time per observation, under the assumption -- usually verified in practice -- that the transition probability matrix does not change with time.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Nov 2015 22:38:07 GMT  (1618kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00077v1", "AAAI 2016, to appear"], ["v2", "Fri, 11 Dec 2015 10:40:51 GMT  (1618kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00077v2", "AAAI 2016, to appear"]], "COMMENTS": "AAAI 2016, to appear", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS cs.IT math.IT", "authors": ["massimo cairo", "gabriele farina", "romeo rizzi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.00077"}
