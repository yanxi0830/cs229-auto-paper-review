Such text documents arise in real world applications, including job advertisements and economic news articles, which are influenced by the fluctuations of the general economy. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian topic model which imposes a \"group-correlated\" hierarchical structure on the evolution of topics over time incorporating both processes, and show that this model can be estimated from Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods. We further demonstrate that this model captures the intrinsic relationships between the topic distribution and the time-dependent factors, and compare its performance with latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and two other related models. The model is applied to two collections of documents to illustrate its empirical performance: online job advertisements from DirectEmployers Association and journalists' postings on BusinessInsider.com.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Jul 2016 01:16:55 GMT  (347kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01274v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["baiyang wang", "diego klabjan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.01274"}
