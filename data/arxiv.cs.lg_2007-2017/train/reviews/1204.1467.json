The original rough-set model is, however, quite sensitive to noisy data. Tzung thus proposed deals with the problem of producing a set of fuzzy certain and fuzzy possible rules from quantitative data with a predefined tolerance degree of uncertainty and misclassification. This model allowed, which combines the variable precision rough-set model and the fuzzy set theory, is thus proposed to solve this problem. This paper thus deals with the problem of producing a set of fuzzy certain and fuzzy possible rules from incomplete quantitative data with a predefined tolerance degree of uncertainty and misclassification. A new method, incomplete quantitative data for rough-set model and the fuzzy set theory, is thus proposed to solve this problem. It first transforms each quantitative value into a fuzzy set of linguistic terms using membership functions and then finding incomplete quantitative data with lower and the fuzzy upper approximations. It second calculates the fuzzy {\\beta}-lower and the fuzzy {\\beta}-upper approximations. The certain and possible rules are then generated based on these fuzzy approximations. These rules can then be used to classify unknown objects.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Apr 2012 12:42:24 GMT  (217kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1467v1", "hi thanks for attention"]], "COMMENTS": "hi thanks for attention", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["ali soltan mohammadi", "l asadzadeh", "d d rezaee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.1467"}
