The kernel we propose is a particularization of a random walk kernel that exploits two properties previously studied in the RE literature: (i) the words between the candidate entities or connecting them in a syntactic representation are particularly likely to carry information regarding the relationship; and (ii) combining information from distinct sources in a kernel may help the RE system make better decisions. We performed experiments on a dataset of protein-protein interactions and the results show that our approach obtains effectiveness values that are comparable with the state-of-the art kernel methods. Moreover, our approach is able to outperform the state-of-the-art kernels when combined with other kernel methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 11:06:25 GMT  (232kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4874v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["gon\\c{c}alo sim\\~oes", "helena galhardas", "david matos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.4874"}
