We com- pare the outcomes of regularization methods that are popularly used to train deep neural networks and study how different context functions can affect the classification performance. We also compare the efficacy of gated activation functions that are favorably used in recurrent neural networks and study how to combine multimodal inputs. We evaluate our models on two multimodal datasets: MSR-Skype and CALLHOME.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 19:26:16 GMT  (91kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01042v1", "6 pages, accepted to NIPS 2015 Workshop on Machine Learning for Spoken Language Understanding and Interaction"], ["v2", "Mon, 16 Nov 2015 03:54:19 GMT  (91kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01042v2", "6 pages, accepted to NIPS 2015 Workshop on Machine Learning for Spoken Language Understanding and Interaction"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, accepted to NIPS 2015 Workshop on Machine Learning for Spoken Language Understanding and Interaction", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["junyoung chung", "jacob devlin", "hany hassan awadalla"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.01042"}
