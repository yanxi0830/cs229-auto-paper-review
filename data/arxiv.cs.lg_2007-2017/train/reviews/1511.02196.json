This aspect cannot be evaluated or numerically represented well by traditional metrics like accuracy, ROC, or precision-recall curve. In this work, we start from the alignment in sensitivity of ROC and recall of precision-recall curve, and propose an evaluation metric focusing on the ability of a model to be adopted by biologists. This metric evaluates the ability of a machine learning algorithm to predict only new interactions, meanwhile, it eliminates the influence of test dataset. In the experiment of evaluating different classifiers with a same data set and evaluating the same predictor with different datasets, our new metric fulfills the evaluation task of our interest while two widely recognized metrics, ROC and precision-recall curve fail the tasks for different reasons.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Nov 2015 19:14:09 GMT  (710kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02196v1", "This article is an extended version of a poster presented in AMIA TBI 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "This article is an extended version of a poster presented in AMIA TBI 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["haohan wang", "madhavi k ganapathiraju"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.02196"}
