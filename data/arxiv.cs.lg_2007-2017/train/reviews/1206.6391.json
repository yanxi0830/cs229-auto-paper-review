We present a new framework for direct quantile regression where a Gaussian process model is learned, minimising the expected tilted loss function. The integration required in learning is not analytically tractable so to speed up the learning we employ the Expectation Propagation algorithm. We describe how this work relates to other quantile regression methods and apply the method on both synthetic and real data sets. The method is shown to be competitive with state of the art methods whilst allowing for the leverage of the full Gaussian process probabilistic framework.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (496kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6391v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ME cs.LG stat.AP", "authors": ["alexis boukouvalas", "remi louis barillec", "dan cornford"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6391"}
