We can no longer assume that textual content is written in one language or even the same language family. In this paper, we demonstrate how to build massive multilingual annotators with minimal human expertise and intervention. We describe a system that builds Named Entity Recognition (NER) annotators for 40 major languages using Wikipedia and Freebase. Our approach does not require NER human annotated datasets or language specific resources like treebanks, parallel corpora, and orthographic rules. The novelty of approach lies therein - using only language agnostic techniques, while achieving competitive performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Oct 2014 18:37:32 GMT  (781kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3791v1", "9 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["rami al-rfou", "vivek kulkarni", "bryan perozzi", "steven skiena"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.3791"}
