Moreover, to solve the problem of kernel function selection and kernel parameter tuning, we proposed to construct an optimal kernel by weighted linear combination of some candidate kernels. The learning of the classifier parameter and the kernel weight are unified in a single objective function considering to minimize the upper boundary of the given multivariate performance measure. The objective function is optimized with regard to classifier parameter and kernel weight alternately in an iterative algorithm by using cutting plane algorithm. The developed algorithm is evaluated on two different pattern classification methods with regard to various multivariate performance measure optimization problems. The experiment results show the proposed algorithm outperforms the competing methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Aug 2015 19:45:06 GMT  (105kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06264v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["jingbin wang", "haoxiang wang", "yihua zhou", "nancy mcdonald"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.06264"}
