{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-Feb-2016", "title": "Black-box Optimization with a Politician", "abstract": "We propose a new framework for black-box convex optimization which is well-suited for situations where gradient computations are expensive. We derive a new method for this framework which leverages several concepts from convex optimization, from standard first-order methods (e.g. gradient descent or quasi-Newton methods) to analytical centers (i.e. minimizers of self-concordant barriers). We demonstrate empirically that our new technique compares favorably with state of the art algorithms (such as BFGS).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Feb 2016 21:35:58 GMT  (247kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04847v1", "19 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "19 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.OC cs.DS cs.LG cs.NA", "authors": ["s\u00e9bastien bubeck", "yin tat lee"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.04847"}
