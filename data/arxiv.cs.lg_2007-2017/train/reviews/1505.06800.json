Due to overtraining on the limited training samples, overfitting is a major problem of deep learning. We incorporate a boosting-like technique into deep learning to weigh the training samples, and thus prevent overtraining in the iterative process. We theoretically give the details of derivation of our algorithm, and report the experimental results on open data sets showing that BDL achieves a better stable performance than the state-of-the-arts. Our approach achieves 15.85% and 3.81% reduction in the average miss rate compared with ACF and JointDeep on the largest Caltech benchmark dataset, respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 26 May 2015 03:52:52 GMT  (1213kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06800v1", "9 pages,7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages,7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["lei wang", "baochang zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.06800"}
