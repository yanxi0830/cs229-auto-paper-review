We use L1 regularization to encourage the use of few structured primitive objects. We attack approximation using convex optimization over an infinite number of variables each corresponding to a primitive structured object that are generated on demand by easy inference in the Lagrangian dual. We apply our approach to producing low rank approximations to large 3-way tensors.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 14 Feb 2016 03:10:30 GMT  (2598kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04409v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["julian yarkony", "kamalika chaudhuri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.04409"}
