Encog allows a variety of machine learning models to be applied to datasets using regression, classification, and clustering. Various supported machine learning models can be used interchangeably with minimal recoding. Encog uses efficient multithreaded code to reduce training time by exploiting modern multicore processors. The current version of Encog can be downloaded from", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Jun 2015 21:20:06 GMT  (11kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04776v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MS cs.LG", "authors": ["jeff heaton"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.04776"}
