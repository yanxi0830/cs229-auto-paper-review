The question of interest is to which degree both sensors i) allow the estimation of force exerted on the sensor and ii) enable the recognition of differing degrees of curvature. Making use of a force controlled linear motor affecting the tactile sensors we acquire several high-quality data sets allowing the study of both sensors under exactly the same conditions. We also examined the structure of the representation of tactile stimuli in the recorded tactile sensor data using t-SNE embeddings. The experiments show that both the iCub and the BioTac excel in different settings.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Jun 2016 14:23:20 GMT  (2339kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06588v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.LG", "authors": ["maximilian karl", "artur lohrer", "dhananjay shah", "frederik diehl", "max fiedler", "saahil ognawala", "justin bayer", "patrick van der smagt"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06588"}
