One area in deep neural networks that is ripe for exploration is neural connectivity formation. A pivotal study on the brain tissue of rats found that synaptic formation for specific functional connectivity in neocortical neural microcircuits can be surprisingly well modeled and predicted as a random formation. Motivated by this intriguing finding, we introduce the concept of StochasticNet, where deep neural networks are formed via stochastic connectivity between neurons. Such stochastic synaptic formations in a deep neural network architecture can potentially allow for efficient utilization of neurons for performing specific tasks. To evaluate the feasibility of such a deep neural network architecture, we train a StochasticNet using three image datasets. Experimental results show that a StochasticNet can be formed that provides comparable accuracy and reduced overfitting when compared to conventional deep neural networks with more than two times the number of neural connections.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 22 Aug 2015 03:36:43 GMT  (521kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05463v1", "8 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 28 Aug 2015 19:05:03 GMT  (540kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05463v2", "8 pages"], ["v3", "Thu, 3 Sep 2015 01:34:17 GMT  (540kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05463v3", "8 pages"], ["v4", "Tue, 10 Nov 2015 20:30:05 GMT  (541kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.05463v4", "8 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["mohammad javad shafiee", "parthipan siva", "alexander wong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.05463"}
