To achieve this, we executed supervised training of a convolutional neural network to recover the removed center pixel label of patches sampled from a MDPM. MDPM can be generated from other machine learning based algorithms recognizing whether a pixel in an image corresponds to the cell membrane. By iteratively applying this network over MDPM for multiple rounds, we were able to significantly improve membrane segmentation results.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Jun 2015 23:11:40 GMT  (353kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05849v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["xundong wu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.05849"}
