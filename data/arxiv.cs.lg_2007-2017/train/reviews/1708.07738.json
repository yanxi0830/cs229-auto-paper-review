To solve the computationally expensive reinforcement learning problems, we propose a function approximation method to ensure that the Bellman Optimality Equation always holds, and then estimate a function based on the observed human actions for inverse reinforcement learning problems. The time complexity of the proposed method is linearly proportional to the cardinality of the action set, thus it can handle high-dimensional even continuous state spaces efficiently. We test the proposed method in a simulated environment to show its accuracy, and three clinical tasks to show how it can be used to evaluate a doctor's proficiency.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Aug 2017 20:25:01 GMT  (674kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.07738v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1707.09394"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1707.09394", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.RO", "authors": ["kun li", "joel w burdick"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.07738"}
