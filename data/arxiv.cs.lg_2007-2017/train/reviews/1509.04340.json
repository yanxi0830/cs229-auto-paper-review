The success of our algorithm arises from derived bounds that suggest a new regularization penalty in terms of the Rademacher complexities of the corresponding families of kernel maps. In a series of experiments we demonstrate the improved performance of our algorithm as compared to baselines. Furthermore, the algorithm enjoys several favorable properties. The optimization problem is convex, it allows for learning with non-PDS kernels, and the solutions are highly sparse, resulting in improved classification speed and memory requirements.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Sep 2015 21:58:43 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04340v1", "16 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["corinna cortes", "prasoon goyal", "vitaly kuznetsov", "mehryar mohri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.04340"}
