Our proposed solution relies on a new algorithm based on successive rejects of the seemingly bad arms, and successive accepts of the good ones. This algorithmic contribution allows to tackle other multiple identifications settings that were previously out of reach. In particular we show that this idea of successive accepts and rejects applies to the multi-bandit best arm identification problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 May 2012 20:10:04 GMT  (173kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3181v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["s\u00e9bastien bubeck", "tengyao wang", "nitin viswanathan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1205.3181"}
