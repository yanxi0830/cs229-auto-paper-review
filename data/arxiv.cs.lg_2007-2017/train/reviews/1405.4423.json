We consider the full and almost full cold start problem in dyadic prediction, a setting that occurs when both objects in an out-of-sample dyad have not been observed during training, or if one of them has been observed, but very few times. A popular approach for addressing this problem is to train a model that makes predictions based on a pairwise feature representation of the dyads, or, in case of kernel methods, based on a tensor product pairwise kernel. As an alternative to such a kernel approach, we introduce a novel two-step learning algorithm that borrows ideas from the fields of pairwise learning and spectral filtering. We show theoretically that the two-step method is very closely related to the tensor product kernel approach, and experimentally that it yields a slightly better predictive performance. Moreover, unlike existing tensor product kernel methods, the two-step method allows closed-form solutions for training and parameter selection via cross-validation estimates both in the full and almost full cold start settings, making the approach much more efficient and straightforward to implement.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 17 May 2014 18:20:13 GMT  (70kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4423v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["tapio pahikkala", "michiel stock", "antti airola", "tero aittokallio", "bernard de baets", "willem waegeman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.4423"}
