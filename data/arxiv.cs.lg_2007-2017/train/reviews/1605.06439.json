We quantify the friendliness of stochastic environments by means of the well-known Bernstein (a.k.a. generalized Tsybakov margin) condition. For two recent algorithms (Squint for the Hedge setting and MetaGrad for online convex optimization) we show that the particular form of their data-dependent individual-sequence regret guarantees implies that they adapt automatically to the Bernstein parameters of the stochastic environment. We prove that these algorithms attain fast rates in their respective settings both in expectation and with high probability.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 May 2016 17:05:55 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06439v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["wouter m koolen", "peter gr\u00fcnwald", "tim van erven"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.06439"}
