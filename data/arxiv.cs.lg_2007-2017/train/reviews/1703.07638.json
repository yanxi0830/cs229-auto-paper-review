In this paper we show that the source code programming language identification task can be fully automated using machine learning techniques. We first define the criteria that a production-level automatic programming language identification solution should meet. Our criteria include accuracy, programming language coverage, extensibility and performance. We then describe our approach: How training files are preprocessed for extracting features that mimic grammar productions, and then how these extracted grammar productions are used for the training and testing of our classifier. We achieve a 99 percent accuracy rate while classifying 29 of the most popular programming languages with a Maximum Entropy classifier.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 4 Mar 2017 10:44:40 GMT  (577kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07638v1", "13 pages, 4 tables, 4 examples"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 4 tables, 4 examples", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.PL", "authors": ["shaul zevin", "catherine holzem"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07638"}
