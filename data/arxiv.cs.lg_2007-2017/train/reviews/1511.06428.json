{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "19-Nov-2015", "title": "A Controller-Recognizer Framework: How necessary is recognition for control?", "abstract": "Recently there has been growing interest in building active visual object recognizers, as opposed to the usual passive recognizers which classifies a given static image into a predefined set of object categories. In this paper we propose to generalize these recently proposed end-to-end active visual recognizers into a controller-recognizer framework. A model in the controller-recognizer framework consists of a controller, which interfaces with an external manipulator, and a recognizer which classifies the visual input adjusted by the manipulator. We describe two most recently proposed controller-recognizer models--recurrent attention model and spatial transformer network-- as representative examples of controller-recognizer models. Based on this description we observe that most existing end-to-end controller-recognizers tightly, or completely, couple a controller and recognizer. We ask a question whether this tight coupling is necessary, and try to answer this empirically by building a controller-recognizer model with a decoupled controller and recognizer. Our experiments revealed that it is not always necessary to tightly couple them and that by decoupling a controller and recognizer, there is a possibility of building a generic controller that is pretrained and works together with any subsequent recognizer.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 22:38:53 GMT  (311kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06428v1", "ICLR 2016 submission"], ["v2", "Fri, 27 Nov 2015 03:51:33 GMT  (545kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06428v2", "ICLR 2016 submission"], ["v3", "Mon, 7 Dec 2015 18:47:15 GMT  (311kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06428v3", "ICLR 2016 submission"], ["v4", "Tue, 9 Feb 2016 20:58:21 GMT  (463kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06428v4", null]], "COMMENTS": "ICLR 2016 submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["marcin moczulski", "kelvin xu", "aaron courville", "kyunghyun cho"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06428"}
