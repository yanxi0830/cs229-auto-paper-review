We show that this is possible if the subset of columns is chosen proportional to the squared volume spanned by the rows of the chosen submatrix (ie, volume sampling). The resulting estimator is unbiased and surprisingly the covariance of the estimator also has a closed form: It equals a specific factor times $X^+X^{+\\top}$.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 May 2017 09:43:41 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06908v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 7 Jun 2017 22:42:47 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06908v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 22:36:50 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06908v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["michal derezinski", "manfred k warmuth"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.06908"}
