Most of the existing embedding approaches, however, run on an excessively high precision, ignoring the fact that at the end, embedding outputs are converted into coarse-grained discrete pixel coordinates in a screen space. Motivated by such an observation and directly considering pixel coordinates in an embedding optimization process, we accelerate Barnes-Hut tree-based t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (BH-SNE), known as a state-of-the-art 2D embedding method, and propose a novel method called PixelSNE, a highly-efficient, screen resolution-driven 2D embedding method with a linear computational complexity in terms of the number of data items. Our experimental results show the significantly fast running time of PixelSNE by a large margin against BH-SNE, while maintaining the minimal degradation in the embedding quality. Finally, the source code of our method is publicly available at", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Nov 2016 15:50:27 GMT  (6982kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02568v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 10 Nov 2016 03:28:39 GMT  (6982kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02568v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 06:28:34 GMT  (4339kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02568v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["minjeong kim", "minsuk choi", "sunwoong lee", "jian tang", "haesun park", "jaegul choo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.02568"}
