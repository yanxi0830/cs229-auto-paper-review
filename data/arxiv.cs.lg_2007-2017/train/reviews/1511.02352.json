Coronary heart disease have some types or levels. Referring to the UCI Repository dataset, it divided into 4 types or levels that are labeled numbers 1-4 (low, medium, high and serious). The diagnosis models can be analyzed with multiclass classification approach. One of multiclass classification approach used, one of which is a support vector machine (SVM). The SVM use due to strong performance of SVM in binary classification. This research study multiclass performance classification support vector machine to diagnose the type or level of coronary heart disease. Coronary heart disease patient data taken from the UCI Repository. Stages in this study is preprocessing, which consist of, to normalizing the data, divide the data into data training and testing. The next stage of multiclass classification and performance analysis. This study uses multiclass SVM algorithm, namely: Binary Tree Support Vector Machine (BTSVM), One-Against-One (OAO), One-Against-All (OAA), Decision Direct Acyclic Graph (DDAG) and Exhaustive Output Error Correction Code (ECOC). Performance parameter used is recall, precision, F-measure and Overall accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 Nov 2015 13:09:57 GMT  (358kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02352v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 16 Nov 2015 14:20:59 GMT  (358kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02352v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["wiharto wiharto", "hari kusnanto", "herianto herianto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.02352"}
