Attempts to relax this assumption involve the use of expensive iterative methods to discriminate among different structures. This paper introduces a deterministic method to learn the graphical structure of a BBN from a possibly incomplete database. Experimental evaluations show a significant robustness of this method and a remarkable independence of its execution time from the number of missing data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:58:45 GMT  (911kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1565v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["marco ramoni", "paola sebastiani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1565"}
