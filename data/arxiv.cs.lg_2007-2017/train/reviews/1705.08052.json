However, most of the state-of-the-art RNNs have millions of parameters and require many computational resources for training and predicting new data. This paper proposes an alternative RNN model to reduce the number of parameters significantly by representing the weight parameters based on Tensor Train (TT) format. In this paper, we implement the TT-format representation for several RNN architectures such as simple RNN and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). We compare and evaluate our proposed RNN model with uncompressed RNN model on sequence classification and sequence prediction tasks. Our proposed RNNs with TT-format are able to preserve the performance while reducing the number of RNN parameters significantly up to 40 times smaller.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 May 2017 01:14:22 GMT  (418kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08052v1", "Accepted at IJCNN 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at IJCNN 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["andros tjandra", "sakriani sakti", "satoshi nakamura"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.08052"}
