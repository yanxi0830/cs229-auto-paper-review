However, an issue that still deserves more study concerns the automatic evaluation of generalised data. Indeed, many automated generalisation systems require the utilisation of an evaluation function to automatically assess generalisation outcomes. In this paper, we propose a new approach dedicated to the design of such a function. This approach allows an imperfectly defined evaluation function to be revised through a man-machine dialogue. The user gives its preferences to the system by comparing generalisation outcomes. Machine Learning techniques are then used to improve the evaluation function. An experiment carried out on buildings shows that our approach significantly improves generalisation evaluation functions defined by users.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Apr 2012 12:10:10 GMT  (303kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4332v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.LG", "authors": ["patrick taillandier", "julien gaffuri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.4332"}
