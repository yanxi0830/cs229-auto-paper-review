Most kernel methods for learning on sets of points have not yet dealt with the specific geometrical invariances and practical constraints associated with point clouds in computer vision and graphics. In this paper, we present extensions of graph kernels for point clouds, which allow to use kernel methods for such ob jects as shapes, line drawings, or any three-dimensional point clouds. In order to design rich and numerically efficient kernels with as few free parameters as possible, we use kernels between covariance matrices and their factorizations on graphical models. We derive polynomial time dynamic programming recursions and present applications to recognition of handwritten digits and Chinese characters from few training examples.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Dec 2007 13:06:50 GMT  (67kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3402v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["francis r bach"], "accepted": true, "id": "0712.3402"}
