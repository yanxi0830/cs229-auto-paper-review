In this paper we explore the representational power of these models using synthetic grammars designed to exhibit phenomena similar to those found in real transduction problems such as machine translation. These experiments lead us to propose new memory-based recurrent networks that implement continuously differentiable analogues of traditional data structures such as Stacks, Queues, and DeQues. We show that these architectures exhibit superior generalisation performance to Deep RNNs and are often able to learn the underlying generating algorithms in our transduction experiments.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 14:23:30 GMT  (541kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02516v1", "12 pages, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 16:24:40 GMT  (696kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02516v2", "12 pages, 4 figures"], ["v3", "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 14:07:29 GMT  (699kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02516v3", "14 pages, 4 figures, NIPS 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["edward grefenstette", "karl moritz hermann", "mustafa suleyman", "phil blunsom"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.02516"}
