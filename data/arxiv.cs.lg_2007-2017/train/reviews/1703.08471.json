Current technology, however, still exhibits a lack of robustness, especially when adverse acoustic conditions are met. Despite the significant progress made in the last years on both speech enhancement and speech recognition, one potential limitation of state-of-the-art technology lies in composing modules that are not well matched because they are not trained jointly. To address this concern, a promising approach consists in concatenating a speech enhancement and a speech recognition deep neural network and to jointly update their parameters as if they were within a single bigger network. Unfortunately, joint training can be difficult because the output distribution of the speech enhancement system may change substantially during the optimization procedure. The speech recognition module would have to deal with an input distribution that is non-stationary and unnormalized. To mitigate this issue, we propose a joint training approach based on a fully batch-normalized architecture. Experiments, conducted using different datasets, tasks and acoustic conditions, revealed that the proposed framework significantly overtakes other competitive solutions, especially in challenging environments.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Mar 2017 15:40:19 GMT  (187kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08471v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1703.08002"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1703.08002", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["mirco ravanelli", "philemon brakel", "maurizio omologo", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08471"}
