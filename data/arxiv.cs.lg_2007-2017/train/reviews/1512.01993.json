Although substantial work has been done in developing distributed binary SVM algorithms and multi-class SVM algorithms individually, the field of multi-class distributed SVMs remains largely unexplored. This research proposes a novel algorithm that implements the Support Vector Machine over a multi-class dataset and is efficient in a distributed environment (here, Hadoop). The idea is to divide the dataset into half recursively and thus compute the optimal Support Vector Machine for this half during the training phase, much like a divide and conquer approach. While testing, this structure has been effectively exploited to significantly reduce the prediction time. Our algorithm has shown better computation time during the prediction phase than the traditional sequential SVM methods (One vs. One, One vs. Rest) and out-performs them as the size of the dataset grows. This approach also classifies the data with higher accuracy than the traditional multi-class algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Dec 2015 11:44:35 GMT  (812kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01993v1", "8 Pages"]], "COMMENTS": "8 Pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DC", "authors": ["aruna govada", "shree ranjani", "aditi viswanathan", "s k sahay"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.01993"}
