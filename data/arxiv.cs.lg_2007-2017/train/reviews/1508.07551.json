We empirically evaluated the performance of the algorithm on a set of databases from real world events. This benchmark enhancement was achieved by adapting Single-test TREPAN and C4.5 decision tree induction algorithms to analyze the datasets. The models are then compared with X-TREPAN for comprehensibility and classification accuracy. Furthermore, we validate the experimentations by applying statistical methods. Finally, the modified algorithm is extended to work with multi-class regression problems and the ability to comprehend generalized feed forward networks is achieved.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 30 Aug 2015 10:14:48 GMT  (415kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.07551v1", "17 Pages, 8 Tables, 8 Figures, 6 Equations"]], "COMMENTS": "17 Pages, 8 Tables, 8 Figures, 6 Equations", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["awudu karim", "shangbo zhou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.07551"}
