It provides a simple mathematical model for unsupervised deep network learning. It implements non-linear contractions, which are optimized for classification, with an unsupervised pair matching algorithm, of polynomial complexity. A structured Haar scattering over graph data computes permutation invariant representations of groups of connected points in the graph. If the graph connectivity is unknown, unsupervised Haar pair learning can provide a consistent estimation of connected dyadic groups of points. Classification results are given on image data bases, defined on regular grids or graphs, with a connectivity which may be known or unknown.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Sep 2015 14:20:29 GMT  (411kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09187v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["xiuyuan cheng", "xu chen", "stephane mallat"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.09187"}
