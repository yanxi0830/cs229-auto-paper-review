We formulate the regression problem as the minimization of a least square criterion under a multilinear rank constraint, a difficult non convex problem. HOLRR computes efficiently an approximate solution of this problem, with solid theoretical guarantees. A kernel extension is also presented. Experiments on synthetic and real data show that HOLRR outperforms multivariate and multilinear regression methods and is considerably faster than existing tensor methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Feb 2016 17:21:11 GMT  (4395kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06863v1", "submitted to ICML 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to ICML 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["guillaume rabusseau", "hachem kadri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.06863"}
