We use \"Bregman divergences\" and obtain certain multiplicative updates to train the linear combination weights under an affine constraint or without any constraints. We use unnormalized relative entropy and relative entropy to define two different Bregman divergences that produce an unnormalized exponentiated gradient update and a normalized exponentiated gradient update on the mixture weights, respectively. We then carry out the mean and the mean-square transient analysis of these adaptive algorithms when they are used to combine outputs of $m$ constituent filters. We illustrate the accuracy of our results and demonstrate the effectiveness of these updates for sparse mixture systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Mar 2012 21:32:33 GMT  (339kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4598v1", "Submitted to Digital Signal Processing, Elsevier; IEEE.org"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to Digital Signal Processing, Elsevier; IEEE.org", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["mehmet a donmez", "huseyin a inan", "suleyman s kozat"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.4598"}
