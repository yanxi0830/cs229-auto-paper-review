In this paper we present variants of well-known semi-supervised multiclass learning methods that are robust when the data contains an unknown number of classes. In particular, we present an \"exploratory\" extension of expectation-maximization (EM) that explores different numbers of classes while learning. \"Exploratory\" SSL greatly improves performance on three datasets in terms of F1 on the classes with seed examples i.e., the classes which are expected to be in the data. Our Exploratory EM algorithm also outperforms a SSL method based non-parametric Bayesian clustering.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Jul 2013 01:09:25 GMT  (825kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.0253v1", "16 pages; European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases, 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages; European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["bhavana dalvi", "william w cohen", "jamie callan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.0253"}
