{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "7-May-2015", "title": "A Survey of Predictive Modelling under Imbalanced Distributions", "abstract": "Many real world data mining applications involve obtaining predictive models using data sets with strongly imbalanced distributions of the target variable. Frequently, the least common values of this target variable are associated with events that are highly relevant for end users (e.g. fraud detection, unusual returns on stock markets, anticipation of catastrophes, etc.). Moreover, the events may have different costs and benefits, which when associated with the rarity of some of them on the available training data creates serious problems to predictive modelling techniques. This paper presents a survey of existing techniques for handling these important applications of predictive analytics. Although most of the existing work addresses classification tasks (nominal target variables), we also describe methods designed to handle similar problems within regression tasks (numeric target variables). In this survey we discuss the main challenges raised by imbalanced distributions, describe the main approaches to these problems, propose a taxonomy of these methods and refer to some related problems within predictive modelling.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 May 2015 10:44:57 GMT  (1348kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01658v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 13 May 2015 17:13:11 GMT  (1348kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01658v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["paula branco", "luis torgo", "rita ribeiro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.01658"}
