This paper presents results from an investigation into using a discrete dynamical system representation within the XCS Learning Classifier System. In particular, asynchronous random Boolean networks are used to represent the traditional condition-action production system rules. It is shown possible to use self-adaptive, open-ended evolution to design an ensemble of such discrete dynamical systems within XCS to solve a number of well-known test problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Apr 2012 20:30:23 GMT  (389kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4200v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1201.5604"], ["v2", "Sat, 18 Oct 2014 12:20:46 GMT  (390kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4200v2", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1201.5604"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1201.5604", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE cs.SY", "authors": ["richard j preen", "larry bull"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.4200"}
