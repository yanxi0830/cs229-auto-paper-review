However, many short texts occur in sequences (e.g., sentences in a document or utterances in a dialog), and most existing ANN-based systems do not leverage the preceding short texts when classifying a subsequent one. In this work, we present a model based on recurrent neural networks and convolutional neural networks that incorporates the preceding short texts. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on three different datasets for dialog act prediction.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 12 Mar 2016 00:02:51 GMT  (75kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03827v1", "Accepted as a conference paper at NAACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted as a conference paper at NAACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML", "authors": ["ji young lee", "franck dernoncourt"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.03827"}
