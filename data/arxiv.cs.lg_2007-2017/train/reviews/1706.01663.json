In this paper, we address the related - yet seemingly novel - problem of identifying a set of DFAs from examples that belong to different unknown simple regular languages. We propose two methods based on compression for clustering the observed positive examples. We apply our methods to a set of print jobs submitted to large industrial printers.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Jun 2017 09:03:17 GMT  (292kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01663v1", "This paper has been accepted at the Learning and Automata (LearnAut) Workshop, LICS 2017 (Reykjavik, Iceland)"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper has been accepted at the Learning and Automata (LearnAut) Workshop, LICS 2017 (Reykjavik, Iceland)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.FL", "authors": ["alexis linard", "rick smetsers", "frits vaandrager", "umar waqas", "joost van pinxten", "sicco verwer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.01663"}
