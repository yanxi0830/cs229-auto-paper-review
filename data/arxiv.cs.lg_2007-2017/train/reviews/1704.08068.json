However, there is no clear understanding of such neural computational models. In this paper, we try to unravel \"black-box\" structure of Ann model from network flow. Specifically, we consider the feed forward Ann as a network flow model, which consists of many directional class-pathways. Each class-pathway encodes one class. The class-pathway of a class is obtained by connecting the activated neural nodes in each layer from input to output, where activation value of neural node (node-value) is defined by the weights of each layer in a trained ANN-classifier. From the perspective of the class-pathway, training an ANN-classifier can be regarded as the formulation process of class-pathways of different classes. By analyzing the the distances of each two class-pathways in a trained ANN-classifiers, we try to answer the questions, why the classifier performs so? At last, from the neural encodes view, we define the importance of each neural node through the class-pathways, which is helpful to optimize the structure of a classifier. Experiments for two types of ANN model including multi-layer MLP and CNN verify that the network flow based on class-pathway is a reasonable explanation for ANN models.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 11:45:05 GMT  (819kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08068v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1702.04595by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1702.04595by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["dawei dai", "weimin tan", "hong zhan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.08068"}
