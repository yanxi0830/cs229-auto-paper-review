We present two encodings for deterministic finite automata and extend one of these for Moore and Mealy machines. Our experimental results show that these encodings improve upon the state-of-the-art, and are useful in practice for learning small models.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 May 2017 13:48:15 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10639v1", "Submitted and selected for oral presentation at the LearnAut workshop at LICS 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted and selected for oral presentation at the LearnAut workshop at LICS 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.FL cs.LG cs.LO", "authors": ["rick smetsers"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10639"}
