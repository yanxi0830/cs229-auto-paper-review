{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "14-Jun-2010", "title": "Agnostic Active Learning Without Constraints", "abstract": "We present and analyze an agnostic active learning algorithm that works without keeping a version space. This is unlike all previous approaches where a restricted set of candidate hypotheses is maintained throughout learning, and only hypotheses from this set are ever returned. By avoiding this version space approach, our algorithm sheds the computational burden and brittleness associated with maintaining version spaces, yet still allows for substantial improvements over supervised learning for classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Jun 2010 02:03:12 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.2588v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["alina beygelzimer", "daniel j hsu", "john langford", "tong zhang 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1006.2588"}
