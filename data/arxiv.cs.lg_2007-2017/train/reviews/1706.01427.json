In this paper we describe how to use Relation Networks (RNs) as a simple plug-and-play module to solve problems that fundamentally hinge on relational reasoning. We tested RN-augmented networks on three tasks: visual question answering using a challenging dataset called CLEVR, on which we achieve state-of-the-art, super-human performance; text-based question answering using the bAbI suite of tasks; and complex reasoning about dynamic physical systems. Then, using a curated dataset called Sort-of-CLEVR we show that powerful convolutional networks do not have a general capacity to solve relational questions, but can gain this capacity when augmented with RNs. Our work shows how a deep learning architecture equipped with an RN module can implicitly discover and learn to reason about entities and their relations.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 Jun 2017 17:17:18 GMT  (1069kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01427v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["adam santoro", "david raposo", "david g t barrett", "mateusz malinowski", "razvan pascanu", "peter battaglia", "timothy lillicrap"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.01427"}
