The communications-inspired approach has two versions - 1) a deterministic version where existing low-power communication IC design methods are repurposed, and 2) a stochastic version referred to as Shannon-inspired statistical information processing employing information-based metrics, statistical error compensation (SEC), and retraining-based methods to implement ML systems on stochastic circuit/device fabrics operating at the limits of energy-efficiency. The communications-inspired approach has the potential to fully leverage the opportunities afforded by ML algorithms and applications in order to address the challenges inherent in their deployment on energy-constrained platforms.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Oct 2016 18:45:32 GMT  (939kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03109v1", "This paper was presented at the 2016 ICML Workshop on On-Device Intelligence, June 24, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper was presented at the 2016 ICML Workshop on On-Device Intelligence, June 24, 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.AR", "authors": ["naresh r shanbhag"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.03109"}
