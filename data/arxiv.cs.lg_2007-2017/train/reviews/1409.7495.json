In the absence of labeled data for a certain task, domain adaptation often provides an attractive option given that labeled data of similar nature but from a different domain (e.g. synthetic images) are available. Here, we propose a new approach to domain adaptation in deep architectures that can be trained on large amount of labeled data from the source domain and large amount of unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data is necessary).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 Sep 2014 08:22:21 GMT  (5856kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7495v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 14:54:37 GMT  (6158kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7495v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["yaroslav ganin", "victor s lempitsky"], "accepted": true, "id": "1409.7495"}
