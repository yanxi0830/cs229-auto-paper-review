In particular, we show for all above problems (including asymmetric cases): 1) all local minima are also globally optimal; 2) no high-order saddle points exists. These results explain why simple algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent have global converge, and efficiently optimize these non-convex objective functions in practice. Our framework connects and simplifies the existing analyses on optimization landscapes for matrix sensing and symmetric matrix completion. The framework naturally leads to new results for asymmetric matrix completion and robust PCA.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 17:49:02 GMT  (50kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00708v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.OC stat.ML", "authors": ["rong ge 0001", "chi jin", "yi zheng"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.00708"}
