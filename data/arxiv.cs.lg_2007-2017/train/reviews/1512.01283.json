Predicting whether a song catches the pulse of the audience impacts the industry. In this paper we analyze language inside the lyrics of the songs using several computational linguistic algorithms and predict whether a song would make to the top or bottom of the billboard rankings based on the language features. We trained and tested an SVM classifier with a radial kernel function on the linguistic features. Results indicate that we can classify whether a song belongs to top and bottom of the billboard charts with a precision of 0.76.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Dec 2015 23:42:10 GMT  (123kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01283v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["vivek datla", "abhinav vishnu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.01283"}
