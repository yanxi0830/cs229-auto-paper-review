Based on an extension of stochastic composite likelihood we quantify the asymptotic accuracy of generative semi-supervised learning. In doing so, we complement distribution-free analysis by providing an alternative framework to measure the value associated with different labeling policies and resolve the fundamental question of how much data to label and in what manner. We demonstrate our approach with both simulation studies and real world experiments using naive Bayes for text classification and MRFs and CRFs for structured prediction in NLP.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 Feb 2010 21:59:02 GMT  (280kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1003.0024v1", "12 pages, 9 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 9 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["joshua v dillon", "krishnakumar balasubramanian", "guy lebanon"], "accepted": true, "id": "1003.0024"}
