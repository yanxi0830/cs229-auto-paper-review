Molecular graphs are usually preprocessed using hash-based functions to produce fixed-size fingerprint vectors, which are used as features for making predictions. We introduce a convolutional neural network that operates directly on graphs, allowing end-to-end learning of the feature pipeline. This architecture generalizes standard molecular fingerprints. We show that these data-driven features are more interpretable, and have better predictive performance on a variety of tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Sep 2015 18:33:50 GMT  (1247kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09292v1", "9 pages, 5 figures.
