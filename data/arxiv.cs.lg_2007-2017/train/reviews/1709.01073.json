Many approaches for RUL estimation based on sensor data make assumptions about how machines degrade. Additionally, sensor data from machines is noisy and often suffers from missing values in many practical settings. We propose Embed-RUL: a novel approach for RUL estimation from sensor data that does not rely on any degradation-trend assumptions, is robust to noise, and handles missing values. Embed-RUL utilizes a sequence-to-sequence model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to generate embeddings for multivariate time series subsequences. The embeddings for normal and degraded machines tend to be different, and are therefore found to be useful for RUL estimation. We show that the embeddings capture the overall pattern in the time series while filtering out the noise, so that the embeddings of two machines with similar operational behavior are close to each other, even when their sensor readings have significant and varying levels of noise content. We perform experiments on publicly available turbofan engine dataset and a proprietary real-world dataset, and demonstrate that Embed-RUL outperforms the previously reported state-of-the-art on several metrics.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Sep 2017 12:15:44 GMT  (920kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01073v1", "Presented at 2nd ML for PHM Workshop at SIGKDD 2017, Halifax, Canada"], ["v2", "Fri, 6 Oct 2017 10:42:52 GMT  (892kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01073v2", "Presented at 2nd ML for PHM Workshop at SIGKDD 2017, Halifax, Canada"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at 2nd ML for PHM Workshop at SIGKDD 2017, Halifax, Canada", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["narendhar gugulothu", "vishnu tv", "pankaj malhotra", "lovekesh vig", "puneet agarwal", "gautam shroff"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.01073"}
