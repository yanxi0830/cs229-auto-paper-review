Using this formula, we are able to connect the cardinality of the dictionary with the eigen-decay of the covariance operator. In particular, we show that under certain technical conditions, the size of the dictionary will always grow sub-linearly in the number of data points, and, as a consequence, the kernel linear regressor constructed from the resulting dictionary is consistent.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:06:34 GMT  (382kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4623v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["yi sun", "faustino j gomez", "j\u00fcrgen schmidhuber"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4623"}
