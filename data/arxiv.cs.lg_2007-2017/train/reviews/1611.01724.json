Fine-grained Gating for Reading Comprehension", "abstract": "Previous work combines word-level and character-level representations using concatenation or scalar weighting, which is suboptimal for high-level tasks like reading comprehension. We present a fine-grained gating mechanism to dynamically combine word-level and character-level representations based on properties of the words. We also extend the idea of fine-grained gating to modeling the interaction between questions and paragraphs for reading comprehension. Experiments show that our approach can improve the performance on reading comprehension tasks, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the Children's Book Test dataset. To demonstrate the generality of our gating mechanism, we also show improved results on a social media tag prediction task.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 6 Nov 2016 03:17:42 GMT  (2851kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01724v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 11 Sep 2017 21:00:30 GMT  (2852kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01724v2", "Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["zhilin yang", "bhuwan dhingra", "ye yuan", "junjie hu", "william w cohen", "ruslan salakhutdinov"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.01724"}
