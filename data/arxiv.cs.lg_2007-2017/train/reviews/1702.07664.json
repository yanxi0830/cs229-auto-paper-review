We introduce the paradigm of Transformation Networks (TN) which are a direct generalization of Convolutional Networks (ConvNets). Theoretically, we show that TNs (and thereby ConvNets) are can be invariant to non-linear transformations of the input despite pooling over mere local translations. Our analysis provides clear insights into the increase in invariance with depth in these networks. Deeper networks are able to model much richer classes of transformations. We also find that a hierarchical architecture allows the network to generate invariance much more efficiently than a non-hierarchical network. Our results provide useful insight into these three fundamental problems in deep learning using ConvNets.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Feb 2017 17:09:22 GMT  (113kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07664v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["dipan k pal", "marios savvides"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07664"}
