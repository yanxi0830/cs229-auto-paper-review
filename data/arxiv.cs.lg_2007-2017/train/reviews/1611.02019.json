Most related studies focus on the classification point of view and assume that all the views are available at any time. We consider an extension of this framework in two directions. First, based on the BiGAN model, the Multi-view BiGAN (MV-BiGAN) is able to perform density estimation from multi-view inputs. Second, it can deal with missing views and is able to update its prediction when additional views are provided. We illustrate these properties on a set of experiments over different datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 12:29:19 GMT  (3694kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02019v1", "Submitted at ICLR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted at ICLR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["micka\\\"el chen", "ludovic denoyer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.02019"}
