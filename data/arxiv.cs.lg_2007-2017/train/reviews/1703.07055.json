In this paper, we investigate how the language understanding module influences the dialogue system performance by conducting a series of systematic experiments on a task-oriented neural dialogue system in a reinforcement learning based setting. The empirical study shows that among different types of language understanding errors, slot-level errors can have more impact on the overall performance of a dialogue system compared to intent-level errors. In addition, our experiments demonstrate that the reinforcement learning based dialogue system is able to learn when and what to confirm in order to achieve better performance and greater robustness.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 04:56:14 GMT  (127kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07055v1", "5 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["xiujun li", "yun-nung chen", "lihong li", "jianfeng gao", "asli celikyilmaz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07055"}
