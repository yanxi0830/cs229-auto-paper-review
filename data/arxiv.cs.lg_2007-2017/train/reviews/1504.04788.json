We present a novel network architecture, HashedNets, that exploits inherent redundancy in neural networks to achieve drastic reductions in model sizes. HashedNets uses a low-cost hash function to randomly group connection weights into hash buckets, and all connections within the same hash bucket share a single parameter value. These parameters are tuned to adjust to the HashedNets weight sharing architecture with standard backprop during training. Our hashing procedure introduces no additional memory overhead, and we demonstrate on several benchmark data sets that HashedNets shrink the storage requirements of neural networks substantially while mostly preserving generalization performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 19 Apr 2015 04:24:15 GMT  (503kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04788v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["wenlin chen", "james t wilson", "stephen tyree", "kilian q weinberger", "yixin chen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1504.04788"}
