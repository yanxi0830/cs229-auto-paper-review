We present a fully Bayesian approach to inference and learning in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models. We place a Gaussian process prior over the transition dynamics, resulting in a flexible model able to capture complex dynamical phenomena. However, to enable efficient inference, we marginalize over the dynamics of the model and instead infer directly the joint smoothing distribution through the use of specially tailored Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Once a sample from the smoothing distribution is computed, the state transition predictive distribution can be formulated analytically. We make use of sparse Gaussian process models to greatly reduce the computational complexity of the approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 12 Jun 2013 15:20:28 GMT  (526kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2861v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 17 Dec 2013 16:10:24 GMT  (531kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2861v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG cs.SY", "authors": ["roger frigola", "fredrik lindsten", "thomas b sch\u00f6n", "carl e rasmussen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1306.2861"}
