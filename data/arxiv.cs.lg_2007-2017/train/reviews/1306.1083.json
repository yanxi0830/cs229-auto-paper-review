By combining contrast terms with prior terms, it provides accurate segmentations of medical images in a fully automated manner. However, one of the main drawbacks of using the RW algorithm is that its parameters have to be hand-tuned. we propose a novel discriminative learning framework that estimates the parameters using a training dataset. The main challenge we face is that the training samples are not fully supervised. Speci cally, they provide a hard segmentation of the images, instead of a proba-bilistic segmentation. We overcome this challenge by treating the optimal probabilistic segmentation that is compatible with the given hard segmentation as a latent variable. This allows us to employ the latent support vector machine formulation for parameter estimation. We show that our approach signi cantly outperforms the baseline methods on a challenging dataset consisting of real clinical 3D MRI volumes of skeletal muscles.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Jun 2013 12:48:02 GMT  (57kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1083v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["pierre-yves baudin", "danny goodman", "puneet kumar", "noura azzabou", "pierre g carlier", "nikos paragios", "m pawan kumar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.1083"}
