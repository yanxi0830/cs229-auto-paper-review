{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "24-Jul-2015", "title": "Linear Contextual Bandits with Knapsacks", "abstract": "We consider the linear contextual bandit problem with global convex constraints and a concave objective function. In each round, the outcome of pulling an arm is a vector, that depends linearly on the context of that arm. The global constraints require the average of these vectors to lie in a certain convex set. The objective is a concave function of this average vector. This problem turns out to be a common generalization of classic linear contextual bandits (linContextual) [Auer 2003], bandits with concave rewards and convex knapsacks (BwCR) [Agrawal, Devanur 2014], and the online stochastic convex programming (OSCP) problem [Agrawal, Devanur 2015]. We present algorithms with near-optimal regret bounds for this problem. Our bounds compare favorably to results on the unstructured version of the problem [Agrawal et al. 2015, Badanidiyuru et al. 2014] where the relation between the contexts and the outcomes could be arbitrary, but the algorithm only competes against a fixed set of policies.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Jul 2015 04:24:22 GMT  (36kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06738v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 9 Jul 2016 06:29:22 GMT  (37kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.06738v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.OC stat.ML", "authors": ["shipra agrawal", "nikhil r devanur"], "accepted": true, "id": "1507.06738"}
