{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "3-Oct-2016", "title": "Multi-View Representation Learning: A Survey from Shallow Methods to Deep Methods", "abstract": "Recently, multi-view representation learning has become a rapidly growing direction in machine learning and data mining areas. This paper first reviews the root methods and theories on multi-view representation learning, especially on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and its several extensions. And then we investigate the advancement of multi-view representation learning that ranges from shallow methods including multi-modal topic learning, multi-view sparse coding, and multi-view latent space Markov networks, to deep methods including multi-modal restricted Boltzmann machines, multi-modal autoencoders, and multi-modal recurrent neural networks. Further, we also provide an important perspective from manifold alignment for multi-view representation learning. Overall, this survey aims to provide an insightful overview of theoretical basis and current developments in the field of multi-view representation learning and to help researchers find the most appropriate tools for particular applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 17:14:15 GMT  (1036kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01206v1", "27 pages, 10 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1206.5538,arXiv:1304.5634by other authors"], ["v2", "Sun, 27 Nov 2016 03:11:53 GMT  (1032kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01206v2", "20pages, 9 figures"], ["v3", "Thu, 24 Aug 2017 08:08:22 GMT  (812kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01206v3", "20pages, 9 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1206.5538by other authors"], ["v4", "Fri, 1 Sep 2017 05:52:06 GMT  (812kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01206v4", "20pages, 9 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "27 pages, 10 figures. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1206.5538,arXiv:1304.5634by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.IR", "authors": ["yingming li", "ming yang", "zhongfei zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01206"}
