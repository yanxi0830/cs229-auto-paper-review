Unconstrained human pose estimation is one of the hardest problems in computer vision, and our new architecture and learning schema shows significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art results. The main contribution of this paper is showing, for the first time, that a specific variation of deep learning is able to outperform all existing traditional architectures on this task. The paper also discusses several lessons learned while researching alternatives, most notably, that it is possible to learn strong low-level feature detectors on features that might even just cover a few pixels in the image. Higher-level spatial models improve somewhat the overall result, but to a much lesser extent then expected. Many researchers previously argued that the kinematic structure and top-down information is crucial for this domain, but with our purely bottom up, and weak spatial model, we could improve other more complicated architectures that currently produce the best results. This mirrors what many other researchers, like those in the speech recognition, object recognition, and other domains have experienced.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Dec 2013 17:41:13 GMT  (3122kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7302v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 30 Dec 2013 04:29:34 GMT  (3097kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7302v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 3 Jan 2014 20:56:34 GMT  (3206kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7302v3", null], ["v4", "Tue, 18 Feb 2014 16:22:38 GMT  (3212kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7302v4", null], ["v5", "Tue, 25 Feb 2014 05:32:32 GMT  (3212kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7302v5", null], ["v6", "Wed, 23 Apr 2014 19:23:46 GMT  (3213kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7302v6", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["arjun jain", "jonathan tompson", "mykhaylo", "riluka", "graham w taylor", "christoph bregler"], "accepted": true, "id": "1312.7302"}
