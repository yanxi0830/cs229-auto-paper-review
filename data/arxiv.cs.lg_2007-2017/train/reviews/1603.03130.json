Although N data is missing, it sometimes outperforms PN learning (i.e., supervised learning) in experiments. In this paper, we theoretically compare PU (and the opposite NU) learning against PN learning, and prove that, one of PU and NU learning given infinite U data will almost always improve on PN learning. Our theoretical finding is also validated experimentally.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Mar 2016 02:53:52 GMT  (47kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03130v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 23 May 2016 04:35:47 GMT  (169kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03130v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 28 Oct 2016 13:37:46 GMT  (169kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03130v3", "NIPS 2016 camera-ready version"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["gang niu", "marthinus christoffel du plessis", "tomoya sakai", "yao ma", "masashi sugiyama"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.03130"}
