In this paper, we study the SM problem in data streams. Most existing algorithms for streaming SM only support the append-only model with cardinality constraints, which cannot meet the requirements of real-world problems considering either the data recency issues or more general $d$-knapsack constraints. Therefore, we first propose an append-only streaming algorithm {\\sc KnapStream} for SM subject to a $d$-knapsack constraint (SMDK). Furthermore, we devise the {\\sc KnapWindow} algorithm for SMDK over sliding windows to capture the recency constraints. Theoretically, the proposed algorithms have constant approximation ratios for a fixed number of knapsacks and sublinear complexities. We finally evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of our algorithms in two real-world datasets. The results show that the proposed algorithms achieve two orders of magnitude speedups over the greedy baseline in the batch setting while preserving high quality solutions.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 07:59:57 GMT  (285kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04764v1", "20 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG cs.SI", "authors": ["yanhao wang", "yuchen li", "kian-lee tan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.04764"}
