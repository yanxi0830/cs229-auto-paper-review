{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "21-Aug-2016", "title": "A Non-convex One-Pass Framework for Generalized Factorization Machine and Rank-One Matrix Sensing", "abstract": "We develop an efficient alternating framework for learning Factorization Machine (FM) on steaming data with provable guarantees. When the feature is $d$-dimension and the target second order coefficient matrix in FM is of rank $k$, our algorithm converges linearly, achieves $O(\\epsilon)$ recovery error after retrieving $O(k^{3}d\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ training instances, consumes $O(kd)$ memory in one-pass of dataset and only requires matrix-vector product operations in each iteration. The key ingredient of our framework is a construction of an estimation sequence endowed with a so-called Conditionally Independent RIP condition. As special cases of FM, our framework can be applied to symmetric or asymmetric rank-one matrix sensing problems, such as inductive matrix completion and phase retrieval.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 21 Aug 2016 20:28:29 GMT  (30kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05995v1", "accepted by NIPS 2016"], ["v2", "Fri, 9 Sep 2016 17:54:50 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05995v2", "accepted by NIPS 2016"], ["v3", "Mon, 12 Sep 2016 21:43:05 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05995v3", "accepted by NIPS 2016"], ["v4", "Wed, 14 Sep 2016 02:24:22 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05995v4", "accepted by NIPS 2016"], ["v5", "Tue, 25 Oct 2016 21:23:23 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05995v5", "accepted by NIPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted by NIPS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["ming lin", "jieping ye"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.05995"}
