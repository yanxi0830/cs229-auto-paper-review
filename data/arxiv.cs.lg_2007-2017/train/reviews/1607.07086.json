{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "24-Jul-2016", "title": "An Actor-Critic Algorithm for Sequence Prediction", "abstract": "We present an approach to training neural networks to generate sequences using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). Current log-likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their training and testing modes, as models must generate tokens conditioned on their previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this problem by introducing a \\textit{critic} network that is trained to predict the value of an output token, given the policy of an \\textit{actor} network. This results in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU. Crucially, since we leverage these techniques in the supervised learning setting rather than the traditional RL setting, we condition the critic network on the ground-truth output. We show that our method leads to improved performance on both a synthetic task, and for German-English machine translation. Our analysis paves the way for such methods to be applied in natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, caption generation, and dialogue modelling.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 24 Jul 2016 20:05:07 GMT  (43kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07086v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 26 Jul 2016 16:08:30 GMT  (43kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07086v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 15:43:52 GMT  (73kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07086v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["dzmitry bahdanau", "philemon brakel", "kelvin xu", "anirudh goyal", "ryan lowe", "joelle pineau", "aaron courville", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.07086"}
