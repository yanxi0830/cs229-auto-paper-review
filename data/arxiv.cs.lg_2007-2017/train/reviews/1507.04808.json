{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "17-Jul-2015", "title": "Building End-To-End Dialogue Systems Using Generative Hierarchical Neural Network Models", "abstract": "We consider the task of generative dialogue modeling for movie scripts. To this end, we extend the recently proposed hierarchical recurrent encoder decoder neural network and demonstrate that this model is competitive with state-of-the-art neural language models and backoff n-gram models. We show that its performance can be improved considerably by bootstrapping the learning from a larger question-answer pair corpus and from pretrained word embeddings.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Jul 2015 00:21:39 GMT  (336kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04808v1", "11 pages with references; under review at EMNLP 2015"], ["v2", "Wed, 25 Nov 2015 19:49:39 GMT  (214kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04808v2", "8 pages with references; will appear in AAAI 2016 (Special Track on Cognitive Systems)"], ["v3", "Wed, 6 Apr 2016 23:20:41 GMT  (215kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04808v3", "8 pages with references; Published in AAAI 2016 (Special Track on Cognitive Systems)"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages with references; under review at EMNLP 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["iulian vlad serban", "alessandro sordoni", "yoshua bengio", "aaron c courville", "joelle pineau"], "accepted": true, "id": "1507.04808"}
