We assume the noise distribution is unknown, and may change over time with no restriction other than having zero mean and bounded variance. Our technique relies on a family of unbiased estimators for non-linear functions, which may be of independent interest. We show that a variant of online gradient descent can learn functions in any dot-product (e.g., polynomial) or Gaussian kernel space with any analytic convex loss function. Our variant uses randomized estimates that need to query a random number of noisy copies of each instance, where with high probability this number is upper bounded by a constant. Allowing such multiple queries cannot be avoided: Indeed, we show that online learning is in general impossible when only one noisy copy of each instance can be accessed.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 May 2010 10:56:01 GMT  (46kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2296v1", "This is a full version of the paper appearing in the 23rd International Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2010)."], ["v2", "Thu, 20 May 2010 12:43:57 GMT  (46kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2296v2", "This is a full version of the paper appearing in the 23rd International Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2010)"]], "COMMENTS": "This is a full version of the paper appearing in the 23rd International Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2010).", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["nicol\\`o cesa-bianchi", "shai shalev-shwartz", "ohad shamir"], "accepted": false, "id": "1005.2296"}
