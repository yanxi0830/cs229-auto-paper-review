To isolate individual cells in live imaging data, we introduce an elegant image segmentation framework that effectively extracts cell boundaries, even in the presence of poor edge details. Our approach works in two stages. First, we estimate pixel interior/border/exterior class probabilities using random ferns. Then, we use an energy minimization framework to compute boundaries whose localization is compliant with the pixel class probabilities. We validate our approach on a manually annotated dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Feb 2016 14:47:32 GMT  (2873kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05439v1", "submitted to ICIP"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to ICIP", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["arnaud browet", "christophe de vleeschouwer", "laurent jacques", "navrita mathiah", "bechara saykali", "isabelle migeotte"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.05439"}
