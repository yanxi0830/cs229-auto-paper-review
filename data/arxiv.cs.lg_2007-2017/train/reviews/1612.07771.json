While depth of representation has been posited as a primary reason for their success, there are indications that these architectures defy a popular view of deep learning as a hierarchical computation of increasingly abstract features at each layer.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Dec 2016 19:57:35 GMT  (164kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07771v1", "10 + 3pages, under review for ICLR 2017"], ["v2", "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 19:52:47 GMT  (1447kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07771v2", "10 + 4 pages, accepted for ICLR 2017"], ["v3", "Tue, 14 Mar 2017 21:27:03 GMT  (1440kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07771v3", "10 + 4 pages, accepted for ICLR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "10 + 3pages, under review for ICLR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["klaus greff", "rupesh k srivastava", "j\\\"urgen schmidhuber"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.07771"}
