However, to this date, there are no large-scale question-answer corpora available. In this paper we present the 30M Factoid Question-Answer Corpus, an enormous question-answer pair corpus produced by applying a novel neural network architecture on the knowledge base Freebase to transduce facts into natural language questions. The produced question-answer pairs are evaluated both by human evaluators and using automatic evaluation metrics, including well-established machine translation and sentence similarity metrics. Across all evaluation criteria the question-generation model outperforms the competing template-based baseline. Furthermore, when presented to human evaluators, the generated questions appear to be indistinguishable from real human-generated questions.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Mar 2016 14:25:16 GMT  (452kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06807v1", "13 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables"], ["v2", "Sun, 29 May 2016 20:00:20 GMT  (452kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06807v2", "13 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["iulian vlad serban", "alberto garc\u00eda-dur\u00e1n", "\u00e7aglar g\u00fcl\u00e7ehre", "sungjin ahn", "sarath chandar", "aaron c courville", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.06807"}
