Following a Bayesian approach, our method automatically estimates the number of Gaussian components as well as their parameters, while simultaneously it avoids over/under fitting. The equations for estimating model parameters are analytically derived and thus our method does not require any sampling algorithm that is computationally and memory inefficient. The pixel density estimate is followed by an efficient and highly accurate updating mechanism, which permits our system to be automatically adapted to dynamically changing operation conditions. Experimental results and comparisons with other methods show that our method outperforms, in terms of precision and recall, while at the same time it keeps computational cost suitable for real-time applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Jun 2015 11:16:41 GMT  (1210kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08581v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["konstantinos makantasis", "anastasios doulamis", "nikolaos doulamis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.08581"}
