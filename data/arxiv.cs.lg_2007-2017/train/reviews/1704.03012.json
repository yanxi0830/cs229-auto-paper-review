However, tasks with sparse rewards or long horizons continue to pose significant challenges. To tackle these important problems, we propose a general framework that first learns useful skills in a pre-training environment, and then leverages the acquired skills for learning faster in downstream tasks. Our approach brings together some of the strengths of intrinsic motivation and hierarchical methods: the learning of useful skill is guided by a single proxy reward, the design of which requires very minimal domain knowledge about the downstream tasks. Then a high-level policy is trained on top of these skills, providing a significant improvement of the exploration and allowing to tackle sparse rewards in the downstream tasks. To efficiently pre-train a large span of skills, we use Stochastic Neural Networks combined with an information-theoretic regularizer. Our experiments show that this combination is effective in learning a wide span of interpretable skills in a sample-efficient way, and can significantly boost the learning performance uniformly across a wide range of downstream tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Apr 2017 18:41:28 GMT  (6737kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03012v1", "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE cs.RO", "authors": ["carlos florensa", "yan duan", "pieter abbeel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.03012"}
