While their expressiveness is the reason they succeed, it also causes them to learn uninterpretable solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. In this paper we report two such properties.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 21 Dec 2013 03:36:08 GMT  (9313kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6199v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 3 Jan 2014 04:37:34 GMT  (9312kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6199v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 13 Feb 2014 17:40:08 GMT  (9313kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6199v3", null], ["v4", "Wed, 19 Feb 2014 16:33:14 GMT  (9313kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6199v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["christian szegedy", "wojciech zaremba", "ilya sutskever", "joan bruna", "dumitru erhan", "ian goodfellow", "rob fergus"], "accepted": true, "id": "1312.6199"}
