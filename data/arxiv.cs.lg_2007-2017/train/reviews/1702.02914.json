Spatial filters have been widely used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG for BCI classification problems, but their applications in BCI regression problems have been very limited. This paper proposes two common spatial pattern (CSP) filters for EEG-based regression problems in BCI, which are extended from the CSP filter for classification, by making use of fuzzy sets. Experimental results on EEG-based response speed estimation from a large-scale study, which collected 143 sessions of sustained-attention psychomotor vigilance task data from 17 subjects during a 5-month period, demonstrate that the two proposed spatial filters can significantly increase the EEG signal quality. When used in LASSO and k-nearest neighbors regression for user response speed estimation, the spatial filters can reduce the root mean square estimation error by 10.02-19.77%, and at the same time increase the correlation to the true response speed by 19.39-86.47%.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Feb 2017 17:44:28 GMT  (525kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02914v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.HC", "authors": ["dongrui wu", "jung-tai king", "chun-hsiang chuang", "chin-teng lin", "tzyy-ping jung"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.02914"}
