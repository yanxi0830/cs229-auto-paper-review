However, empirically this fast approximation to RPCA fails to find representations that are parsemonious. We resolve these bad local minima by relaxing the elementwise L1 and L2 priors and instead utilize a structure inducing k-sparsity prior. In a discriminative classification task the newly learned representations outperform these from the original approximate RPCA formulation significantly.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Dec 2014 09:51:20 GMT  (442kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8291v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["maximilian karl", "christian osendorfer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.8291"}
