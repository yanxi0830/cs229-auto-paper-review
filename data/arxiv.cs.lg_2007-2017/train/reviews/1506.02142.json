However such tools for regression and classification do not allow us to capture model uncertainty. Bayesian models offer us the ability to reason about model uncertainty, but usually come with a prohibitive computational cost.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 6 Jun 2015 12:30:43 GMT  (1715kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142v1", "10 pages, 7 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 27 Aug 2015 13:39:15 GMT  (2065kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142v2", "10 pages, 7 figures"], ["v3", "Sun, 27 Sep 2015 15:15:31 GMT  (2068kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142v3", "11 pages, 6 figures"], ["v4", "Sat, 31 Oct 2015 19:45:05 GMT  (2069kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142v4", "11 pages, 6 figures; Minor corrections in experiments section"], ["v5", "Wed, 25 May 2016 18:48:52 GMT  (2384kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142v5", "11 pages, 6 figures; ICML proceedings version"], ["v6", "Tue, 4 Oct 2016 16:50:26 GMT  (2383kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02142v6", "12 pages, 6 figures; fixed a mistake with standard error and added a new table with updated results (marked \"Update [October 2016]\"); Published in ICML 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["yarin gal", "zoubin ghahramani"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.02142"}
