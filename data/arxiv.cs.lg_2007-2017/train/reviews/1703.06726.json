As for the latter, it was conjectured that representations may be disentangled by being flattened progressively and at a local scale. An attempt at a formalization of the role of invariance in learning representations was made recently, being referred to as I-theory. In this framework and using the language of differential geometry, we show that pooling over a group of transformations of the input contracts the metric and reduces its curvature, and provide quantitative bounds, in the aim of moving towards a theoretical understanding on how to disentangle representations.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Mar 2017 13:18:56 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06726v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["gary b\\'ecigneul"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06726"}
