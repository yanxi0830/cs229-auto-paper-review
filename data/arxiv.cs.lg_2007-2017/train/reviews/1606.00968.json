Since the mapping from context to behavior is often complex, we take a learning reduction approach to reduce smooth imitation learning to a regression problem using complex function classes that are regularized to ensure smoothness. We present a learning meta-algorithm that achieves fast and stable convergence to a good policy. Our approach enjoys several attractive properties, including being fully deterministic, employing an adaptive learning rate that can provably yield larger policy improvements compared to previous approaches, and the ability to ensure stable convergence. Our empirical results demonstrate significant performance gains over previous approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Jun 2016 05:25:27 GMT  (912kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00968v1", "ICML 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hoang minh le 0002", "andrew kang", "yisong yue", "peter carr 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.00968"}
