DRAW networks combine a novel spatial attention mechanism that mimics the foveation of the human eye, with a sequential variational auto-encoding framework that allows for the iterative construction of complex images. The system substantially improves on the state of the art for generative models on MNIST, and, when trained on the Street View House Numbers dataset, it generates images that cannot be distinguished from real data with the naked eye.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Feb 2015 16:48:56 GMT  (2705kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04623v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 20 May 2015 15:29:42 GMT  (4693kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04623v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["karol gregor", "ivo danihelka", "alex graves", "danilo jimenez rezende", "daan wierstra"], "accepted": true, "id": "1502.04623"}
