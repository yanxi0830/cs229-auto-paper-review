{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Dec-2012", "title": "Mining Techniques in Network Security to Enhance Intrusion Detection Systems", "abstract": "In intrusion detection systems, classifiers still suffer from several drawbacks such as data dimensionality and dominance, different network feature types, and data impact on the classification. In this paper two significant enhancements are presented to solve these drawbacks. The first enhancement is an improved feature selection using sequential backward search and information gain. This, in turn, extracts valuable features that enhance positively the detection rate and reduce the false positive rate. The second enhancement is transferring nominal network features to numeric ones by exploiting the discrete random variable and the probability mass function to solve the problem of different feature types, the problem of data dominance, and data impact on the classification. The latter is combined to known normalization methods to achieve a significant hybrid normalization approach. Finally, an intensive and comparative study approves the efficiency of these enhancements and shows better performance comparing to other proposed methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Dec 2012 13:14:42 GMT  (595kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.2414v1", "16 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["maher salem", "ulrich buehler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.2414"}
