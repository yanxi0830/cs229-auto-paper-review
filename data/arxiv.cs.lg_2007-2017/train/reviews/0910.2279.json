In this work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed \\BoostMetric, for learning a Mahalanobis distance metric. One of the primary difficulties in learning such a metric is to ensure that the Mahalanobis matrix remains positive semidefinite. Semidefinite programming is sometimes used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well. \\BoostMetric is instead based on a key observation that any positive semidefinite matrix can be decomposed into a linear positive combination of trace-one rank-one matrices. \\BoostMetric thus uses rank-one positive semidefinite matrices as weak learners within an efficient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The resulting method is easy to implement, does not require tuning, and can accommodate various types of constraints. Experiments on various datasets show that the proposed algorithm compares favorably to those state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and running time.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Oct 2009 00:54:31 GMT  (545kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.2279v1", "11 pages, Twenty-Third Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2009), Vancouver, Canada"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, Twenty-Third Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2009), Vancouver, Canada", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["chunhua shen", "junae kim", "lei wang 0001", "anton van den hengel"], "accepted": true, "id": "0910.2279"}
