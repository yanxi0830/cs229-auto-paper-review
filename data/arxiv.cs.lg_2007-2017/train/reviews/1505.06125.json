We consider a real-world environment, collect a large dataset of 3110 datapoints, and examine the performance of a substantial number of machine learning algorithms in localizing a mobile device. We have found algorithms that give a mean error as accurate as 0.76 meters, outperforming other indoor localization systems reported in the literature. We also propose a hybrid instance-based approach that results in a speed increase by a factor of ten with no loss of accuracy in a live deployment over standard instance-based methods, allowing for fast and accurate localization. Further, we determine how smaller datasets collected with less density affect accuracy of localization, important for use in real-world environments. Finally, we demonstrate that these approaches are appropriate for real-world deployment by evaluating their performance in an online, in-motion experiment.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 May 2015 15:39:52 GMT  (507kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06125v1", "6 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NI", "authors": ["david mascharka", "eric manley"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.06125"}
