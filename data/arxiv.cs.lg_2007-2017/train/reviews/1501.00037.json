In particular, each constraint $(x_i, x_j, x_k)$ is acquired by posing a query: is instance $x_i$ more similar to $x_j$ than to $x_k$? We consider the scenario where answers to such queries are based on an underlying (but unknown) class concept, which we aim to discover via clustering. Different from most existing methods that only consider constraints derived from yes and no answers, we also incorporate don't know responses. We introduce a Discriminative Clustering method with Relative Constraints (DCRC) which assumes a natural probabilistic relationship between instances, their underlying cluster memberships, and the observed constraints. The objective is to maximize the model likelihood given the constraints, and in the meantime enforce cluster separation and cluster balance by also making use of the unlabeled instances. We evaluated the proposed method using constraints generated from ground-truth class labels, and from (noisy) human judgments from a user study. Experimental results demonstrate: 1) the usefulness of relative constraints, in particular when don't know answers are considered; 2) the improved performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods that utilize either relative or pairwise constraints; and 3) the robustness of our method in the presence of noisy constraints, such as those provided by human judgement.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Dec 2014 22:34:24 GMT  (982kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00037v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yuanli pei", "xiaoli z fern", "r\\'omer rosales", "teresa vania tjahja"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.00037"}
