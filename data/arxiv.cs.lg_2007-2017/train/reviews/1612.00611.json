When physicians are prescribing treatments to a patient, they need to consider a large range of data variety and volume, making decisions increasingly complex. Machine learning based Clinical Decision Support systems can be a solution to the data challenges. In this work we focus on a class of decision support in which the physicians' decision is directly predicted. Concretely, the model would assign higher probabilities to decisions that it presumes the physician are more likely to make. Thus the CDS system can provide physicians with rational recommendations. We also address the problem of correlation in target features: Often a physician is required to make multiple (sub-)decisions in a block, and that these decisions are mutually dependent. We propose a solution to the target correlation problem using a tensor factorization model. In order to handle the patients' historical information as sequential data, we apply the so-called Encoder-Decoder-Framework which is based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) as encoders and a tensor factorization model as a decoder, a combination which is novel in machine learning. With experiments with real-world datasets we show that the proposed model does achieve better prediction performances.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 10:03:09 GMT  (396kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00611v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yinchong yang", "peter a fasching", "markus wallwiener", "tanja n fehm", "sara y brucker", "volker tresp"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.00611"}
