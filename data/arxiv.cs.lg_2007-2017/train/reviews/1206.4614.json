Given the probability parameterized by a Mahalanobis distance, we maximize the entropy of that probability on labeled data and minimize it on unlabeled data following entropy regularization, which allows the supervised and unsupervised parts to be integrated in a natural and meaningful way. Furthermore, Seraph is regularized by encouraging a low-rank projection induced from the metric. The optimization of Seraph is solved efficiently and stably by an EM-like scheme with the analytical E-Step and convex M-Step. Experiments demonstrate that Seraph compares favorably with many well-known global and local metric learning methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:01:43 GMT  (492kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4614v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["gang niu", "bo dai", "makoto yamada", "masashi sugiyama"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4614"}
