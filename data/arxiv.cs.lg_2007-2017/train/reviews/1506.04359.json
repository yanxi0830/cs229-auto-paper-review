The theoretical analysis motivates us to introduce a new multi-class classification machine based on $\\ell_p$-norm regularization, where the parameter $p$ controls the complexity of the corresponding bounds. We derive an efficient optimization algorithm based on Fenchel duality theory. Benchmarks on several real-world datasets show that the proposed algorithm can achieve significant accuracy gains over the state of the art.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 14 Jun 2015 08:07:23 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04359v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yunwen lei", "\u00fcr\u00fcn dogan", "alexander binder", "marius kloft"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.04359"}
