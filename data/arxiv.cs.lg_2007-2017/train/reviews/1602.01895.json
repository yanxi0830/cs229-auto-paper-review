The traditional way is to use the convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract image features, followed by recurrent neural network (RNN) to generate sentences. In this paper, we present a new model that added memory cells to gate the feeding of image features to the deep neural network. The intuition is enabling our model to memorize how much information from images should be fed at each stage of the RNN. Experiments on Flickr8K and Flickr30K datasets showed that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art models with higher BLEU scores.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Feb 2016 00:17:18 GMT  (140kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01895v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["shijian tang", "song han"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.01895"}
