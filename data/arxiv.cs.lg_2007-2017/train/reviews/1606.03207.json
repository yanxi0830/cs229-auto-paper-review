However, this is inappropriate with regard to the fact that acoustic features vary in frequency. In this paper, we contend that convolution along the time axis is more effective. We also propose the addition of an intermap pooling (IMP) layer to deep CNNs. In this layer, filters in each group extract common but spectrally variant features, then the layer pools the feature maps of each group. As a result, the proposed IMP CNN can achieve insensitivity to spectral variations characteristic of different speakers and utterances. The effectiveness of the IMP CNN architecture is demonstrated on several LVCSR tasks. Even without speaker adaptation techniques, the architecture achieved a WER of 12.7% on the SWB part of the Hub5'2000 evaluation test set, which is competitive with other state-of-the-art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 06:44:21 GMT  (8488kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03207v1", "5 pagegs, 4 figures, 5 tables"], ["v2", "Tue, 12 Jul 2016 07:23:53 GMT  (9113kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03207v2", "Submitted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pagegs, 4 figures, 5 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["hwaran lee", "geonmin kim", "ho-gyeong kim", "sang-hoon oh", "soo-young lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03207"}
