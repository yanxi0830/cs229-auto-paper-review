In this work we tackle the relation classification task using a convolutional neural network that performs classification by ranking (CR-CNN). We propose a new pairwise ranking loss function that makes it easy to reduce the impact of artificial classes. We perform experiments using the the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset, which encodes the task of classifying the relationship between two nominals marked in a sentence. Using CR-CNN, we outperform the state-of-the-art for this dataset and achieve a F1 of 84.1 without using any costly handcrafted features. Additionally, our experimental results also evidence that: (1) our approach is more effective than CNN followed by a softmax classifier; (2) omitting the representation of the artificial class Other improves both precision and recall; and (3) using only word embeddings as input features is enough to achieve state-of-the-art results if we consider only the text between the two target nominals.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Apr 2015 17:50:33 GMT  (57kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06580v1", "Accepted as a long paper in the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2015)"], ["v2", "Sun, 24 May 2015 13:58:05 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06580v2", "Accepted as a long paper in the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted as a long paper in the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["c\u00edcero nogueira dos santos", "bing xiang", "bowen zhou"], "accepted": true, "id": "1504.06580"}
