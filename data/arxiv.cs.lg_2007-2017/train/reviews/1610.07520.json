The model is based on the decomposable---or rank-one, in tensor language---Volterra kernels. It may also be described as a product of FIR filters, which explains its low-complexity. The rank-one model is also interesting because it comes from a well-posed problem in approximation theory. The paper uses such model in an estimation theory context to develop an exact gradient-type algorithm, from which adaptive algorithms such as the least mean squares (LMS) filter and its data-reuse version---the TRUE-LMS---are derived. Stability and convergence issues are addressed. The algorithms are then tested in simulations, which show its good performance when compared to other nonlinear processing algorithms in the literature.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 18:12:18 GMT  (884kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07520v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.LG", "authors": ["felipe c pinheiro", "cassio g lopes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.07520"}
