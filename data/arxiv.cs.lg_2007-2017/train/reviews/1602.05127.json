Unlike user-based or item-based methods that compute a weighted average of ratings given by the nearest neighbors, or low-rank approximation methods using convex optimization and the nuclear norm, we formulate matrix completion as a series of semi-supervised learning problems, and propagate the known ratings to the missing ones on the user-user or item-item graph globally. The semi-supervised learning problems are expressed as Laplace-Beltrami equations on a manifold, or namely, harmonic extension, and can be discretized by a point integral method. We show that our approach does not impose a low-rank Euclidean subspace on the data points, but instead minimizes the dimension of the underlying manifold. Our method, named LDM (low dimensional manifold), turns out to be particularly effective in generating rankings of items, showing decent computational efficiency and robust ranking quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Feb 2016 18:35:25 GMT  (173kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05127v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["da kuang", "zuoqiang shi", "stanley osher", "rea bertozzi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.05127"}
