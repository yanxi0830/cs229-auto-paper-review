The goals for the model vary depending on the application: in some cases, the discovered topics may be used for prediction or some other downstream task. In other cases, the content of the topic itself may be of intrinsic scientific interest.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Oct 2014 17:35:31 GMT  (62kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4510v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 21 Nov 2014 16:38:59 GMT  (62kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4510v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["finale doshi-velez", "byron c wallace", "ryan adams"], "accepted": true, "id": "1410.4510"}
