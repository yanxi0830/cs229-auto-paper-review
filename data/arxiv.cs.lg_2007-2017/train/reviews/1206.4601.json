{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-Jun-2012", "title": "Convex Multitask Learning with Flexible Task Clusters", "abstract": "Traditionally, multitask learning (MTL) assumes that all the tasks are related. This can lead to negative transfer when tasks are indeed incoherent. Recently, a number of approaches have been proposed that alleviate this problem by discovering the underlying task clusters or relationships. However, they are limited to modeling these relationships at the task level, which may be restrictive in some applications. In this paper, we propose a novel MTL formulation that captures task relationships at the feature-level. Depending on the interactions among tasks and features, the proposed method construct different task clusters for different features, without even the need of pre-specifying the number of clusters. Computationally, the proposed formulation is strongly convex, and can be efficiently solved by accelerated proximal methods. Experiments are performed on a number of synthetic and real-world data sets. Under various degrees of task relationships, the accuracy of the proposed method is consistently among the best. Moreover, the feature-specific task clusters obtained agree with the known/plausible task structures of the data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 14:40:55 GMT  (3237kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4601v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["wenliang zhong", "james tin-yau kwok"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4601"}
