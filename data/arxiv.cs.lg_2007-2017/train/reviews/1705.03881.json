Net2Vec is able to capture data from the network at more than 60Gbps, transform it into meaningful tuples and apply predictions over the tuples in real time. This platform can be used for different purposes ranging from traffic classification to network performance analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 May 2017 13:28:19 GMT  (1773kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03881v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.LG", "authors": ["roberto gonzalez", "filipe manco", "alberto garcia-duran", "jose mendes", "felipe huici", "saverio niccolini", "mathias niepert"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03881"}
