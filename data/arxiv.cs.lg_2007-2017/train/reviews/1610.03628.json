{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "12-Oct-2016", "title": "RetiNet: Automatic AMD identification in OCT volumetric data", "abstract": "Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) provides a unique ability to image the eye retina in 3D at micrometer resolution and gives ophthalmologist the ability to visualize retinal diseases such as Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). While visual inspection of OCT volumes remains the main method for AMD identification, doing so is time consuming as each cross-section within the volume must be inspected individually by the clinician. In much the same way, acquiring ground truth information for each cross-section is expensive and time consuming. This fact heavily limits the ability to acquire large amounts of ground truth, which subsequently impacts the performance of learning-based methods geared at automatic pathology identification. To avoid this burden, we propose a novel strategy for automatic analysis of OCT volumes where only volume labels are needed. That is, we train a classifier in a semi-supervised manner to conduct this task. Our approach uses a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, that only needs volume-level labels to be trained to automatically asses whether an OCT volume is healthy or contains AMD. Our architecture involves first learning a cross-section pathology classifier using pseudo-labels that could be corrupted and then leverage these towards a more accurate volume-level classification. We then show that our approach provides excellent performances on a publicly available dataset and outperforms a number of existing automatic techniques.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 12 Oct 2016 07:56:24 GMT  (6351kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.03628v1", "14 pages, 10 figures, Code available"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 10 figures, Code available", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["stefanos apostolopoulos", "carlos ciller", "sandro i de zanet", "sebastian wolf", "raphael sznitman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.03628"}
