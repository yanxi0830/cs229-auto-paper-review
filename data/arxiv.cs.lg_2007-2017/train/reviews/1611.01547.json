{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "4-Nov-2016", "title": "Automated Generation of Multilingual Clusters for the Evaluation of Distributed Representations", "abstract": "We propose a language-agnostic way of automatically generating sets of semantically similar clusters of entities along with sets of \"outlier\" elements, which may then be used to perform an intrinsic evaluation of word embeddings in the outlier detection task. We used our methodology to create a gold-standard dataset, which we call WikiSem500, and evaluated multiple state-of-the-art embeddings. The results show a correlation between performance on this dataset and performance on sentiment analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Nov 2016 21:35:07 GMT  (2182kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01547v1", "12 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 13:21:17 GMT  (2182kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01547v2", "12 pages"], ["v3", "Fri, 9 Dec 2016 15:58:37 GMT  (5232kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01547v3", "12 pages"], ["v4", "Wed, 21 Dec 2016 17:51:57 GMT  (5233kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01547v4", "13 pages"], ["v5", "Wed, 5 Apr 2017 15:26:51 GMT  (5267kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01547v5", "Published as a workshop paper at ICLR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["philip blair", "yuval merhav", "joel barry"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01547"}
