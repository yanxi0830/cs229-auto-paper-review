However, because sensor metadata is inconsistent across buildings, software-based solutions are tightly coupled to the sensor metadata conventions (i.e. schemas and naming) for each building. Running the same software across buildings requires significant integration effort.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Sep 2015 20:46:19 GMT  (1488kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00498v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["dezhi hong", "jorge ortiz", "arka bhattacharya", "kamin whitehouse"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.00498"}
