This is unsatisfactory in many applications where the reference policy is suboptimal and the goal of learning is to improve upon it. Can learning to search work even when the reference is poor?", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 8 Feb 2015 03:18:50 GMT  (975kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02206v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 20 May 2015 05:48:10 GMT  (366kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02206v2", "In ICML 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["kai-wei chang", "akshay krishnamurthy", "alekh agarwal", "hal daum\u00e9 iii", "john langford"], "accepted": true, "id": "1502.02206"}
