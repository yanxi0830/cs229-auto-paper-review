We define this requirement as the \"image-to-image translation\" problem, and propose a general approach to achieve it, based on deep convolutional and conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs), which has gained a phenomenal success to learn mapping images from noise input since 2014. In this work, we develop a two step (unsupervised) learning method to translate images between different domains by using unlabeled images without specifying any correspondence between them, so that to avoid the cost of acquiring labeled data. Compared with prior works, we demonstrated the capacity of generality in our model, by which variance of translations can be conduct by a single type of model. Such capability is desirable in applications like bidirectional translation", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 Jan 2017 16:43:03 GMT  (1484kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02676v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["hao dong", "paarth neekhara", "chao wu", "yike guo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.02676"}
