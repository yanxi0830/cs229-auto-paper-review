We then study the implications of this observation on training a deep neural network for representing image patches in the context of descriptor based optical flow. We propose a metric learning method, which selects suitable negative samples based on the nature of the true match. This type of training produces a network that displays multiple strategies depending on the input and leads to state of the art results on the KITTI 2012 and KITTI 2015 optical flow benchmarks.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 Nov 2016 08:31:56 GMT  (8096kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05607v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 29 Jan 2017 22:37:31 GMT  (1640kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05607v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 2 Feb 2017 10:52:03 GMT  (1640kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05607v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["tal schuster", "lior wolf", "david gadot"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.05607"}
