Any improvement in robust and accurate nodule characterization can assist in identifying cancer stage, prognosis, and improving treatment planning. In this study, we propose a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based nodule characterization strategy. With a completely 3D approach, we utilize the volumetric information from a CT scan which would be otherwise lost in the conventional 2D CNN based approaches. In order to address the need for a large amount for training data for CNN, we resort to transfer learning to obtain highly discriminative features. Moreover, we also acquire the task dependent feature representation for six high-level nodule attributes and fuse this complementary information via a Multi-task learning (MTL) framework. Finally, we propose to incorporate potential disagreement among radiologists while scoring different nodule attributes in a graph regularized sparse multi-task learning. We evaluated our proposed approach on one of the largest publicly available lung nodule datasets comprising 1018 scans and obtained state-of-the-art results in regressing the malignancy scores.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Apr 2017 03:32:54 GMT  (467kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08797v1", "Accepted for publication at Information Processing in Medical Imaging (IPMI) 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for publication at Information Processing in Medical Imaging (IPMI) 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["sarfaraz hussein", "kunlin cao", "qi song", "ulas bagci"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.08797"}
