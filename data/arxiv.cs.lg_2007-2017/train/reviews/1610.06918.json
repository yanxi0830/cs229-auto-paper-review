{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "21-Oct-2016", "title": "Learning to Protect Communications with Adversarial Neural Cryptography", "abstract": "We ask whether neural networks can learn to use secret keys to protect information from other neural networks. Specifically, we focus on ensuring confidentiality properties in a multiagent system, and we specify those properties in terms of an adversary. Thus, a system may consist of neural networks named Alice and Bob, and we aim to limit what a third neural network named Eve learns from eavesdropping on the communication between Alice and Bob. We do not prescribe specific cryptographic algorithms to these neural networks; instead, we train end-to-end, adversarially. We demonstrate that the neural networks can learn how to perform forms of encryption and decryption, and also how to apply these operations selectively in order to meet confidentiality goals.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Oct 2016 19:58:29 GMT  (181kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06918v1", "15 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["mart\\'in abadi", "david g", "ersen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06918"}
