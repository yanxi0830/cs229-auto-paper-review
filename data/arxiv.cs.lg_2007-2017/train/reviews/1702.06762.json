We propose a general formulation of style transfer as an extension of generative adversarial networks, by using a discriminator to regularize a generator with an otherwise separate loss function. We apply our approach to the task of learning to play chess in the style of a specific player, and present empirical evidence for the viability of our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 11:43:50 GMT  (262kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06762v1", "style transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks"], ["v2", "Sun, 7 May 2017 13:42:01 GMT  (712kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06762v2", "style transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks"]], "COMMENTS": "style transfer, Generative Adversarial Networks", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["muthuraman chidambaram", "yanjun qi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06762"}
