{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Nov-2015", "title": "Learning to Diagnose with LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "Clinical medical data, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU), consists of multivariate time series of observations. For each patient visit (or episode), sensor data and lab test results are recorded in the patient's Electronic Health Record (EHR). While potentially containing a wealth of insights, the data is difficult to mine effectively, owing to varying length, irregular sampling and missing data. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly those using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) hidden units, are powerful and increasingly popular models for learning from sequence data. They adeptly model varying length sequences and capture long range dependencies. We present the first study to empirically evaluate the ability of LSTMs to recognize patterns in multivariate time series of clinical measurements. Specifically, we consider multilabel classification of diagnoses, training a model to classify 128 diagnoses given 13 frequently but irregularly sampled clinical measurements. First, we establish the effectiveness of a simple LSTM network for modeling clinical data. Then we demonstrate a straightforward and effective deep supervision strategy in which we replicate targets at each sequence step. Trained only on raw time series, our models outperforms several strong baselines on a wide variety of metrics, and nearly matches the performance of a multilayer perceptron trained on carefully hand-engineered features, establishing the usefulness of LSTMs for modeling medical data. The best LSTM model accurately classifies many diagnoses, including diabetic ketoacidosis (F1 score of .714), scoliosis (.677), and status asthmaticus (.632).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Nov 2015 21:01:28 GMT  (216kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03677v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 13 Nov 2015 01:31:00 GMT  (216kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03677v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 11:22:34 GMT  (218kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03677v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 19:20:41 GMT  (839kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03677v4", null], ["v5", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 09:29:14 GMT  (775kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03677v5", null], ["v6", "Tue, 1 Mar 2016 01:55:57 GMT  (775kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03677v6", null], ["v7", "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 21:29:50 GMT  (775kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03677v7", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["zachary c lipton", "david c kale", "charles elkan", "randall wetzel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.03677"}
