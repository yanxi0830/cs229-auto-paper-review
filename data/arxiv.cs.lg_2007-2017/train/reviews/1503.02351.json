Particularly for semantic segmentation, a two-stage procedure is often employed. Hereby, convolutional networks are trained to provide good local pixel-wise features for the second step being traditionally a more global graphical model. In this work we unify this two-stage process into a single joint training algorithm. We demonstrate our method on the semantic image segmentation task and show encouraging results on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Mar 2015 01:08:00 GMT  (1545kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02351v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["alexander g schwing", "raquel urtasun"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.02351"}
