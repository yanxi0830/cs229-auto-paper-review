In particular we show that if $f$ is a degree-$d$ polynomial threshold function, then its Gaussian sensitivity at noise rate $\\epsilon$ is less than some quantity asymptotic to $\\frac{d\\sqrt{2\\epsilon}}{\\pi}$ and the Gaussian surface area is at most $\\frac{d}{\\sqrt{2\\pi}}$. Furthermore these bounds are asymptotically tight as $\\epsilon\\to 0$ and $f$ the threshold function of a product of $d$ distinct homogeneous linear functions.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Dec 2009 19:14:03 GMT  (6kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2709v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CC cs.LG", "authors": ["daniel m kane"], "accepted": false, "id": "0912.2709"}
