{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "23-Jun-2015", "title": "Multi-domain Dialog State Tracking using Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "Dialog state tracking is a key component of many modern dialog systems, most of which are designed with a single, well-defined domain in mind. This paper shows that dialog data drawn from different dialog domains can be used to train a general belief tracking model which can operate across all of these domains, exhibiting superior performance to each of the domain-specific models. We propose a training procedure which uses out-of-domain data to initialise belief tracking models for entirely new domains. This procedure leads to improvements in belief tracking performance regardless of the amount of in-domain data available for training the model.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Jun 2015 20:16:06 GMT  (926kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07190v1", "Accepted as a short paper in the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted as a short paper in the 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["nikola mrksic", "diarmuid \u00f3 s\u00e9aghdha", "blaise thomson", "milica gasic", "pei-hao su", "david vandyke", "tsung-hsien wen", "steve j young"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.07190"}
