In this paper, we study the impact of mixing coefficients on the convergence of EM. We show that when the mixture components exhibit some overlap, the convergence of EM becomes slower as the dynamic range among the mixing coefficients increases. We propose a deterministic anti-annealing algorithm, that significantly improves the speed of convergence of EM for such mixtures with unbalanced mixing coefficients. The proposed algorithm is compared against other standard optimization techniques like BFGS, Conjugate Gradient, and the traditional EM algorithm. Finally, we propose a similar deterministic anti-annealing based algorithm for the Dirichlet process mixture model and demonstrate its advantages over the conventional variational Bayesian approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (847kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6427v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["iftekhar naim", "daniel gildea"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6427"}
