Our seizure dataset contains brain activity recorded in typically more than a hundred individual channels for each seizure of each patient. The MLC-HDP model clusters over channels-types, seizure-types, and patient-types simultaneously. We describe this model and its implementation in detail. We also present the results of a simulation study comparing the MLC-HDP to a similar model, the Nested Dirichlet Process and finally demonstrate the MLC-HDP's use in modeling seizures across multiple patients. We find the MLC-HDP's clustering to be comparable to independent human physician clusterings. To our knowledge, the MLC-HDP model is the first in the epilepsy literature capable of clustering seizures within and between patients.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:02:12 GMT  (510kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4616v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.AP cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["drausin wulsin", "shane jensen", "brian litt"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4616"}
