The question of setting the optimal number of neighbors as well as the optimal weights has received much attention throughout the years, nevertheless this problem seems to have remained unsettled. In this paper we offer a simple approach to locally weighted regression/classification, where we make the bias-variance tradeoff explicit. Our formulation enables us to phrase a notion of optimal weights, and to efficiently find these weights as well as the optimal number of neighbors efficiently and adaptively, for each data point whose value we wish to estimate. The applicability of our approach is demonstrated on several datasets, showing superior performance over standard locally weighted methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 11:18:18 GMT  (38kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07266v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["oren anava", "kfir y levy"], "accepted": true, "id": "1701.07266"}
