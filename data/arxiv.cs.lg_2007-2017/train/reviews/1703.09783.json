Despite advances in sensing, in particular related to 3D video, the methodologies to process the data are still subject to research. We demonstrate superior results by a system which combines recurrent neural networks with convolutional neural networks in a voting approach. The gated-recurrent-unit-based neural networks are particularly well-suited to distinguish actions based on long-term information from optical tracking data; the 3D-CNNs focus more on detailed, recent information from video data. The resulting features are merged in an SVM which then classifies the movement. In this architecture, our method improves recognition rates of state-of-the-art methods by 14% on standard data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 22:29:56 GMT  (4926kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09783v1", "8 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["rui zhao", "haider ali", "patrick van der smagt"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.09783"}
