Using a linear complexity algorithm to compute vectors for trees, we embed feature spaces of tree fragments in low-dimensional spaces where the kernel computation is directly done with dot product. We show that DTKs are faster, correlate with tree kernels, and obtain a statistically similar performance in two natural language processing tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 14:44:09 GMT  (380kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4607v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["fabio massimo zanzotto", "lorenzo dell'arciprete"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4607"}
