Traditionally, these graphs are considered to be static in nature. However, recent availability of large scale event-based interaction data has given rise to dynamically evolving knowledge graphs that contain temporal information for each edge. Reasoning over time in such graphs is not yet well understood.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 May 2017 14:53:02 GMT  (1468kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05742v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 17 May 2017 04:54:07 GMT  (1468kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05742v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 21 Jun 2017 05:21:46 GMT  (1464kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05742v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["rakshit trivedi", "hanjun dai", "yichen wang", "le song"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.05742"}
