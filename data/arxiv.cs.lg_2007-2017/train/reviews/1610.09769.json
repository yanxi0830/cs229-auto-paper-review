Search for similar vertices of the same type in large HINs, such as bibliographic networks and business-review networks, is a fundamental problem with broad applications. Although similarity search in HINs has been studied previously, most existing approaches neither explore rich semantic information embedded in the network structures nor take user's preference as a guidance.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 03:15:02 GMT  (1964kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09769v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.LG", "authors": ["jingbo shang", "meng qu", "jialu liu", "lance m kaplan", "jiawei han", "jian peng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09769"}
