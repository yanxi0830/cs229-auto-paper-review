In this paper, we show how to make these algorithms efficient for data matrices that have many more rows than columns, so-called \"tall-and-skinny matrices\". One key component to these improved methods is an orthogonal matrix transformation that preserves the separability of the NMF problem. Our final methods need a single pass over the data matrix and are suitable for streaming, multi-core, and MapReduce architectures. We demonstrate the efficacy of these algorithms on terabyte-sized synthetic matrices and real-world matrices from scientific computing and bioinformatics.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Feb 2014 16:41:26 GMT  (224kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.6964v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DC cs.NA stat.ML", "authors": ["austin r benson", "jason d lee", "bartek rajwa", "david f gleich"], "accepted": true, "id": "1402.6964"}
