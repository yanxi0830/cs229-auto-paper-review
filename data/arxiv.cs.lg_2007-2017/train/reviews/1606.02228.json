The evalution tests the influence of the following choices of the architecture: non-linearity (ReLU, ELU, maxout, compatibility with batch normalization), pooling variants (stochastic, max, average, mixed), network width, classifier design (convolutional, fully-connected, SPP), image pre-processing, and of learning parameters: learning rate, batch size, cleanliness of the data, etc.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 17:38:06 GMT  (2747kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02228v1", "Submitted to CVIU Special Issue on Deep Learning"], ["v2", "Mon, 13 Jun 2016 13:48:39 GMT  (2751kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02228v2", "Submitted to CVIU Special Issue on Deep Learning.
