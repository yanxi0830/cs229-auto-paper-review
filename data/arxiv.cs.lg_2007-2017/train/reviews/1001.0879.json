In this paper we consider two online multi-class classification problems: classification by a linear model and by a kernelized model. The quality of predictions is measured by the Brier loss function. We suggest two computationally efficient algorithms to work with these problems and prove theoretical guarantees on their losses. We kernelize one of the algorithms and prove theoretical guarantees on its loss. We perform experiments and compare our algorithms with logistic regression.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Jan 2010 12:40:13 GMT  (44kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.0879v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["fedor zhdanov", "yuri kalnishkan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1001.0879"}
