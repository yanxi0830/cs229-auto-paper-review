The convergence of SGD depends on the careful choice of learning rate and the amount of the noise in stochastic estimates of the gradients. In this paper, we propose an adaptive learning rate algorithm, which utilizes stochastic curvature information of the loss function for automatically tuning the learning rates. The information about the element-wise curvature of the loss function is estimated from the local statistics of the stochastic first order gradients. We further propose a new variance reduction technique to speed up the convergence. In our experiments with deep neural networks, we obtained better performance compared to the popular stochastic gradient algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Mar 2017 14:03:48 GMT  (655kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00788v1", "IJCNN 2017 Accepted Paper, An extension of our paper, \"ADASECANT: Robust Adaptive Secant Method for Stochastic Gradient\""]], "COMMENTS": "IJCNN 2017 Accepted Paper, An extension of our paper, \"ADASECANT: Robust Adaptive Secant Method for Stochastic Gradient\"", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["caglar gulcehre", "jose sotelo", "marcin moczulski", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.00788"}
