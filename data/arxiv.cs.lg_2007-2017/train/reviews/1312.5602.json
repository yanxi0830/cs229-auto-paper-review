The model is a convolutional neural network, trained with a variant of Q-learning, whose input is raw pixels and whose output is a value function estimating future rewards. We apply our method to seven Atari 2600 games from the Arcade Learning Environment, with no adjustment of the architecture or learning algorithm. We find that it outperforms all previous approaches on six of the games and surpasses a human expert on three of them.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Dec 2013 16:00:08 GMT  (221kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5602v1", "NIPS Deep Learning Workshop 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS Deep Learning Workshop 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["volodymyr mnih", "koray kavukcuoglu", "david silver", "alex graves", "ioannis antonoglou", "daan wierstra", "martin riedmiller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.5602"}
