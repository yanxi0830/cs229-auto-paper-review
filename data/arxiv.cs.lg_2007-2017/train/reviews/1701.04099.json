Field-aware Factorization Machines (FFM) have recently been established as a state-of-the-art method for that problem and in particular won two Kaggle challenges. This paper presents some results from implementing this method in a production system that predicts click-through and conversion rates for display advertising and shows that this method it is not only effective to win challenges but is also valuable in a real-world prediction system. We also discuss some specific challenges and solutions to reduce the training time, namely the use of an innovative seeding algorithm and a distributed learning mechanism.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 Jan 2017 19:13:22 GMT  (187kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04099v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 16:47:44 GMT  (188kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04099v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 23 Feb 2017 05:26:04 GMT  (188kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04099v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yuchin juan", "damien lefortier", "olivier chapelle"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.04099"}
