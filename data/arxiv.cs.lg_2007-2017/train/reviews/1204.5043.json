{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "23-Apr-2012", "title": "Sparse Prediction with the $k$-Support Norm", "abstract": "We derive a novel norm that corresponds to the tightest convex relaxation of sparsity combined with an L2 penalty and can also be interpreted as a group Lasso norm with overlaps. We show that this new norm provides a tighter relaxation than the elastic net and suggest using it as a replacement for the Lasso or the elastic net in sparse prediction problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Apr 2012 12:35:56 GMT  (317kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5043v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 12 Jun 2012 08:59:52 GMT  (304kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5043v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["andreas argyriou", "rina foygel", "nathan srebro"], "accepted": true, "id": "1204.5043"}
