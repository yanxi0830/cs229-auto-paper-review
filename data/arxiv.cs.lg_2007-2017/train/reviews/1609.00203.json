We explore the necessary tradeoffs between accuracy, performance and resource utilization are explored given the large volume and update rates of input data. We start with building models based on well-established machine learning algorithms using static datasets and multi-scan training approaches and identify the best candidate to be used in implementing a single-pass predictive approach, under real-time constraints. The results are measured in terms of accuracy and performance and are compared against the baseline kinematic equations. Results show that it is possible to efficiently model the trajectory of multiple vessels using a single model, which is trained and evaluated using an adequately large, static dataset, thus achieving a significant gain in terms of resource usage while not compromising accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Sep 2016 12:06:20 GMT  (1249kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00203v1", "14 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, 31 references"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, 31 references", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["angelos valsamis", "konstantinos tserpes", "dimitrios zissis", "dimosthenis anagnostopoulos", "theodora varvarigou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.00203"}
