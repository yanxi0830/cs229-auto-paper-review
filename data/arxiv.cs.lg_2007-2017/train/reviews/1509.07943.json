This signal processing problem arises in numerous imaging problems, ranging from astronomy to biology to spectroscopy, where it is common to take (coarse) Fourier measurements of an object. Of particular interest is in obtaining estimation procedures which are robust to noise, with the following desirable statistical and computational properties: we seek to use coarse Fourier measurements (bounded by some cutoff frequency); we hope to take a (quantifiably) small number of measurements; we desire our algorithm to run quickly.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 26 Sep 2015 03:49:27 GMT  (45kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07943v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["qingqing huang", "sham m kakade"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.07943"}
