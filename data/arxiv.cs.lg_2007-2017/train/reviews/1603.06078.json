In computer graphics, screen-space shading has recently increased the visual quality in interactive image synthesis, where per-pixel attributes such as positions, normals or reflectance of a virtual 3D scene are converted into RGB pixel appearance, enabling effects like ambient occlusion, indirect light, scattering, depth-of-field, motion blur, or anti-aliasing. In this paper we consider the diagonal problem: synthesizing appearance from given per-pixel attributes using a CNN. The resulting Deep Shading simulates all screen-space effects as well as arbitrary combinations thereof at competitive quality and speed while not being programmed by human experts but learned from example images.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Mar 2016 10:29:57 GMT  (8850kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06078v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 3 Aug 2016 11:11:55 GMT  (8629kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06078v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GR cs.LG", "authors": ["oliver nalbach", "elena arabadzhiyska", "dushyant mehta", "hans-peter seidel", "tobias ritschel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.06078"}
