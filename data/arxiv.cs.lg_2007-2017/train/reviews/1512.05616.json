In fact, wristband and armband devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers already took an important place in the consumer electronics market and are becoming ubiquitous. By their very nature of being wearable, these devices, however, provide a new pervasive attack surface threatening users privacy, among others.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 Dec 2015 14:58:26 GMT  (5999kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05616v1", "Security, Side-Channel Attack, Keystroke Inference, Motion Sensors, Deep Learning, Recurrent Neural Network, Wearable Computing"]], "COMMENTS": "Security, Side-Channel Attack, Keystroke Inference, Motion Sensors, Deep Learning, Recurrent Neural Network, Wearable Computing", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.CY cs.LG", "authors": ["tony beltramelli", "sebastian risi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.05616"}
