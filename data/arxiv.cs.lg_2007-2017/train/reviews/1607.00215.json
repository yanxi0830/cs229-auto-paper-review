We provide insight into the extent of this performance boost and the phenomenon that drives it. We leverage this insight to establish an $\\tilde{O}(H\\sqrt{SAT})$ expected regret bound for PSRL in finite-horizon episodic Markov decision processes, where $H$ is the horizon, $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions and $T$ is the time elapsed. This improves upon the best previous bound of $\\tilde{O}(H S \\sqrt{AT})$ for any reinforcement learning algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Jul 2016 11:58:28 GMT  (3027kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00215v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 22 Jul 2016 22:43:10 GMT  (3222kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00215v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 15:54:51 GMT  (5658kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00215v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["ian osband", "benjamin van roy"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.00215"}
