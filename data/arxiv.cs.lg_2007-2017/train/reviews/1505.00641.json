This is a pity, because even though FMs are recognized as being very successful for recommender system type applications they are a general model to deal with sparse and high dimensional features. Our Factorization Machine implementation provides easy access to many solvers and supports regression, classification and ranking tasks. Such an implementation simplifies the use of FM's for a wide field of applications. This implementation has the potential to improve our understanding of the FM model and drive new development.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 May 2015 14:06:11 GMT  (72kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00641v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 5 May 2015 18:43:34 GMT  (72kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00641v2", "Source Code is available atthis https URL"], ["v3", "Wed, 23 Nov 2016 14:25:55 GMT  (56kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00641v3", "Source Code is available atthis https URL"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IR", "authors": ["immanuel bayer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.00641"}
