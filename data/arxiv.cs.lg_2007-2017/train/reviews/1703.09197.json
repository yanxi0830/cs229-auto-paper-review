Results show that radio modulation recognition is not limited by network depth and further work should focus on improving learned synchronization and equalization. Advances in these areas will likely come from novel architectures designed for these tasks or through novel training methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Mar 2017 17:28:43 GMT  (724kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09197v1", "7 pages, 14 figures, to be published in proceedings of IEEE DySPAN 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 14 figures, to be published in proceedings of IEEE DySPAN 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["nathan e west", "timothy j o'shea"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.09197"}
