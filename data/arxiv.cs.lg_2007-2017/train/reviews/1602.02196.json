Our algorithm BISTRO requires d calls to the empirical risk minimization (ERM) oracle per round, where d is the number of actions. The method uses unlabeled data to make the problem computationally simple. When the ERM problem itself is computationally hard, we extend the approach by employing multiplicative approximation algorithms for the ERM. The integrality gap of the relaxation only enters in the regret bound rather than the benchmark. Finally, we show that the adversarial version of the contextual bandit problem is learnable (and efficient) whenever the full-information supervised online learning problem has a non-trivial regret guarantee (and efficient).", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 6 Feb 2016 00:34:59 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02196v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["alexander rakhlin", "karthik sridharan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.02196"}
