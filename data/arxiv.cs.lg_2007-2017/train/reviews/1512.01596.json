We describe simple principles which we used to create this model in Caffe. The proposed model of convolutional auto-encoder does not have pooling/unpooling layers yet. The results of our experimental research show comparable accuracy of dimensionality reduction in comparison with a classic auto-encoder on the example of MNIST dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Dec 2015 23:58:47 GMT  (1184kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01596v1", "8 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables, 28 references in the list"], ["v2", "Thu, 21 Apr 2016 01:51:14 GMT  (1242kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01596v2", "9 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables, 34 references in the list; Added references, corrected Table 3, changed several paragraphs in the text"], ["v3", "Fri, 22 Apr 2016 03:20:41 GMT  (1258kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01596v3", "9 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables, 34 references in the list; Added references, corrected Table 3, changed several paragraphs in the text"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables, 28 references in the list", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["volodymyr turchenko", "artur luczak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.01596"}
