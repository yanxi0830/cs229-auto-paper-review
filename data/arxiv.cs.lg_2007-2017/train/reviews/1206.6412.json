The key idea is to use the top eigenfunctions of integral operator derived from both labeled and unlabeled examples as the basis functions and learn the prediction function by a simple linear regression. We show that under appropriate assumptions about the integral operator, this approach is able to achieve an improved regression error bound better than existing bounds of supervised learning. We also verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm by an empirical study.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (558kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6412v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["ming ji", "tianbao yang", "binbin lin", "rong jin", "jiawei han 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6412"}
