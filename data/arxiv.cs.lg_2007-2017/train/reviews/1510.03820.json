However, these models require practitioners to specify the exact model architecture and accompanying hyper-parameters, e.g., the choice of filter region size, regularization parameters, and so on. It is currently unknown how sensitive model performance is to changes in these configurations for the task of sentence classification. We thus conduct an empirical sensitivity analysis of one-layer CNNs to explore the effect of each part of the architecture on the performance; our aim is to assess the robustness of the model and to distinguish between important and comparatively inconsequential design decisions for sentence classification. We focus on one-layer CNNs (to the exclusion of more complex models) due to their comparative simplicity and strong empirical performance (Kim, 2014). We derive practical advice from our extensive empirical results for those interested in getting the most out of CNNs for sentence classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Oct 2015 19:00:57 GMT  (141kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03820v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 19 Oct 2015 19:26:44 GMT  (142kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03820v2", "Corrected typos and add some more references"], ["v3", "Sat, 20 Feb 2016 07:01:52 GMT  (152kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03820v3", null], ["v4", "Wed, 6 Apr 2016 23:20:27 GMT  (148kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03820v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["ye zhang", "byron wallace"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.03820"}
