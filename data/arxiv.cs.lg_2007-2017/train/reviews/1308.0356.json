The proposed system is included two main steps. In the first one, the human expert's knowledge is designed as decision trees. The second step is included an expert system which is evaluated using extracted rules of these decision trees. Also, to improve the quality of the proposed system, a majority voting algorithm is proposed as post processing step to choose the best lecturer which satisfied more expert's decision trees for each course. The results are shown that the designed system average accuracy is 78.88. Low computational complexity, simplicity to program and are some of other advantages of the proposed system.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Aug 2013 21:04:07 GMT  (635kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0356v1", "4 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["shervan fekri-ershad", "hadi tajalizadeh", "shahram jafari"], "accepted": false, "id": "1308.0356"}
