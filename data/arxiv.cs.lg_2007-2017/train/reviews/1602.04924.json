To tackle this problem, we exploit a data-driven approach that extracts searcher intents from their profile data and recent activities at a large scale. The intents such as job seeking, hiring, content consuming are used to construct features to personalize federated search experience. We tested the approach on the LinkedIn homepage and A/B tests show significant improvements in member engagement. As of writing this paper, the approach powers all of federated search on LinkedIn homepage.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Feb 2016 07:10:42 GMT  (283kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04924v1", "in Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "in Proceedings of the 24th ACM International on Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["dhruv arya", "viet ha-thuc", "shakti sinha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.04924"}
