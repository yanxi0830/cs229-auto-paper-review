In this paper, we experiment with the capacity of Neural Turing Machines (NTMs) to deal with these long-term dependencies on well-balanced strings of parentheses. We show that not only does the NTM emulate a stack with its heads and learn an algorithm to recognize such words, but it is also capable of strongly generalizing to much longer sequences.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 20:31:44 GMT  (94kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00827v1", "1st Workshop on Neural Abstract Machines &amp; Program Induction (NAMPI), NIPS 2016, Barcelona, Spain"]], "COMMENTS": "1st Workshop on Neural Abstract Machines &amp; Program Induction (NAMPI), NIPS 2016, Barcelona, Spain", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["tristan deleu", "joseph dureau"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.00827"}
