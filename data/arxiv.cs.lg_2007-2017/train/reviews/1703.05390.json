Maximizing the detection accuracy at a low false alarm (FA) rate, while minimizing the footprint size, latency and complexity are the goals for KWS. Towards achieving them, we study Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNNs). Inspired by large-scale state-of-the-art speech recognition systems, we combine the strengths of convolutional layers and recurrent layers to exploit local structure and long-range context. We analyze the effect of architecture parameters, and propose training strategies to improve performance. With only ~230k parameters, our CRNN model yields acceptably low latency, and achieves 97.71% accuracy at 0.5 FA/hour for 5 dB signal-to-noise ratio.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 21:20:44 GMT  (308kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05390v1", "Submitted to Interspeech 2017"], ["v2", "Wed, 24 May 2017 00:37:05 GMT  (316kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05390v2", "Submitted to Interspeech 2017"], ["v3", "Tue, 4 Jul 2017 22:49:18 GMT  (302kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05390v3", "Accepted to Interspeech 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to Interspeech 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["sercan o arik", "markus kliegl", "rewon child", "joel hestness", "rew gibiansky", "chris fougner", "ryan prenger", "adam coates"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.05390"}
