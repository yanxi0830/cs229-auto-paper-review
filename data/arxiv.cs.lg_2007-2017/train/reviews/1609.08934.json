Weakly dominated pure strategies can be detected and eliminated in polynomial time by solving a linear program. Furthermore, interior symmetric equilibria are a special case of a more general notion, namely, that of an \"equalizer,\" which can also be computed efficiently in polynomial time by solving a linear program. An elegant \"symmetrization method\" of bimatrix games [Jurg et al., 1992] and the well-known PPAD-completeness results on equilibrium computation in bimatrix games [Daskalakis et al., 2009, Chen et al., 2009] imply then the compelling P = PPAD.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Sep 2016 14:43:51 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08934v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.CC cs.LG", "authors": ["ioannis avramopoulos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.08934"}
