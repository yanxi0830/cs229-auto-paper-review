In addition, a novel regularization term is introduced which allows ACOL to encourage the neural network to reveal its own explicit clustering objective. While the underlying process of finding the subclasses is completely unsupervised, semi-supervised learning is also possible based on the provided classification objective. The results show that ACOL can achieve a 99.2% clustering accuracy for the semi-supervised case when partial class labels are presented and a 96% accuracy for the unsupervised clustering case. These findings represent a paradigm shift especially when it comes to harnessing the power of deep networks for primary and secondary clustering applications in large datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 05:21:31 GMT  (11293kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08648v1", "Submitted to ICML 2017"], ["v2", "Wed, 9 Aug 2017 00:02:45 GMT  (1920kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08648v2", "Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems, 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to ICML 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ozsel kilinc", "ismail uysal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08648"}
