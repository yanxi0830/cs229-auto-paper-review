Reasoning about such data requires a notion of similarity capable of handling sequences of different lengths. In this paper we describe a family of Mercer kernel functions for such sequentially structured data. The family is characterized by a decomposable structure in terms of symbol-level and structure-level similarities, representing a specific combination of kernels which allows for efficient computation. We provide an experimental evaluation on sequential classification tasks comparing kernels from our family of kernels to a state of the art sequence kernel called the Global Alignment kernel which has been shown to outperform Dynamic Time Warping", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Jan 2015 08:30:55 GMT  (323kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06284v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["andrea baisero", "florian t pokorny", "carl henrik ek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.06284"}
