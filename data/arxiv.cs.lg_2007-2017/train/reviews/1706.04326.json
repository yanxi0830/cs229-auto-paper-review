One of the constraints that limits full exploration of deep learning technologies for semantic parsing is the lack of sufficient annotation training data. In this paper, we propose using sequence-to-sequence in a multi-task setup for semantic parsing with a focus on transfer learning. We explore three multi-task architectures for sequence-to-sequence modeling and compare their performance with an independently trained model. Our experiments show that the multi-task setup aids transfer learning from an auxiliary task with large labeled data to a target task with smaller labeled data. We see absolute accuracy gains ranging from 1.0% to 4.4% in our in- house data set, and we also see good gains ranging from 2.5% to 7.0% on the ATIS semantic parsing tasks with syntactic and semantic auxiliary tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 05:53:51 GMT  (159kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04326v1", "Accepted for ACL Repl4NLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for ACL Repl4NLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["xing fan", "emilio monti", "lambert mathias", "markus dreyer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.04326"}
