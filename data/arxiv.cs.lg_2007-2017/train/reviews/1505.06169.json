This is accomplished by partitioning the features into a sequence of templates which are ordered such that high confidence can often be reached using only a small fraction of all features. Parameter estimation is arranged to maximize accuracy and early confidence in this sequence. Our approach is simpler and better suited to NLP than other related cascade methods. We present experiments in left-to-right part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and transition-based dependency parsing. On the typical benchmarking datasets we can preserve POS tagging accuracy above 97% and parsing LAS above 88.5% both with over a five-fold reduction in run-time, and NER F1 above 88 with more than 2x increase in speed.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 May 2015 18:28:21 GMT  (47kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06169v1", "Appears in The 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Beijing, China, July 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in The 53rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Beijing, China, July 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["emma strubell", "luke vilnis", "kate silverstein", "andrew mccallum"], "accepted": true, "id": "1505.06169"}
