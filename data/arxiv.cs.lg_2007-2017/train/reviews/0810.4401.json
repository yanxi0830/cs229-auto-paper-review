{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "24-Oct-2008", "title": "Efficient Exact Inference in Planar Ising Models", "abstract": "We give polynomial-time algorithms for the exact computation of lowest-energy (ground) states, worst margin violators, partition functions, and marginal probabilities in certain binary undirected graphical models. Our approach provides an interesting alternative to the well-known graph cut paradigm in that it does not impose any submodularity constraints; instead we require planarity to establish a correspondence with perfect matchings (dimer coverings) in an expanded dual graph. We implement a unified framework while delegating complex but well-understood subproblems (planar embedding, maximum-weight perfect matching) to established algorithms for which efficient implementations are freely available. Unlike graph cut methods, we can perform penalized maximum-likelihood as well as maximum-margin parameter estimation in the associated conditional random fields (CRFs), and employ marginal probabilities as well as maximum a posteriori (MAP) states for prediction. Maximum-margin CRF parameter estimation on image denoising and segmentation problems shows our approach to be efficient and effective.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Oct 2008 08:49:09 GMT  (685kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.4401v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 17 Dec 2008 06:47:01 GMT  (937kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0810.4401v2", "Fixed a number of bugs in v1; added 10 pages of additional figures, explanations, proofs, and experiments"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML", "authors": ["nicol n schraudolph", "dmitry kamenetsky"], "accepted": true, "id": "0810.4401"}
