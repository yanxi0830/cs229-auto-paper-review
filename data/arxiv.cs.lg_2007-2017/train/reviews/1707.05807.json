In this work, we use Dobrushin influence as the basis of a practical tool to certify and efficiently improve the quality of a discrete Gibbs sampler. Our Dobrushin-optimized Gibbs samplers (DoGS) offer customized variable selection orders for a given sampling budget and variable subset of interest, explicit bounds on total variation distance to stationarity, and certifiable improvements over the standard systematic and uniform random scan Gibbs samplers. In our experiments with joint image segmentation and object recognition, Markov chain Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation, and Ising model inference, DoGS consistently deliver higher-quality inferences with significantly smaller sampling budgets than standard Gibbs samplers.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Jul 2017 18:17:55 GMT  (8434kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05807v1", "ICML 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG math.PR stat.ME", "authors": ["ioannis mitliagkas", "lester w mackey"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.05807"}
