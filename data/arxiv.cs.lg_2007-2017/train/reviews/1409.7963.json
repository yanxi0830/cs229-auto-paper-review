We propose a new human body pose dataset, FLIC-motion, that extends the FLIC dataset with additional motion features. We apply our architecture to this dataset and report significantly better performance than current state-of-the-art pose detection systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 Sep 2014 21:32:15 GMT  (7934kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7963v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["arjun jain", "jonathan tompson", "yann lecun", "christoph bregler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.7963"}
