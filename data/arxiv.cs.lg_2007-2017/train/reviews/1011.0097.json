Because the conditional independencies between different nodes correspond to zero entries in the inverse covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution, one can learn the structure of the graph by estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix from sample data, by solving a convex maximum likelihood problem with an $\\ell_1$-regularization term. In this paper, we propose a first-order method based on an alternating linearization technique that exploits the problem's special structure; in particular, the subproblems solved in each iteration have closed-form solutions. Moreover, our algorithm obtains an $\\epsilon$-optimal solution in $O(1/\\epsilon)$ iterations. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data from gene association networks show that a practical version of this algorithm outperforms other competitive algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 30 Oct 2010 18:30:43 GMT  (185kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0097v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.OC stat.ML", "authors": ["katya scheinberg", "shiqian ma", "donald goldfarb"], "accepted": true, "id": "1011.0097"}
