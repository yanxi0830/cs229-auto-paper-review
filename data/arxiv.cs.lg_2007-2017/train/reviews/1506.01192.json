Each mobile device is primarily used by a single user, so it's possible to have a personalized recognizer well matching to the characteristics of individual user. Although acoustic model personalization has been investigated for decades, much less work have been reported on personalizing language model, probably because of the difficulties in collecting enough personalized corpora. Previous work used the corpora collected from social networks to solve the problem, but constructing a personalized model for each user is troublesome. In this paper, we propose a universal recurrent neural network language model with user characteristic features, so all users share the same model, except each with different user characteristic features. These user characteristic features can be obtained by crowdsouring over social networks, which include huge quantity of texts posted by users with known friend relationships, who may share some subject topics and wording patterns. The preliminary experiments on Facebook corpus showed that this proposed approach not only drastically reduced the model perplexity, but offered very good improvement in recognition accuracy in n-best rescoring tests. This approach also mitigated the data sparseness problem for personalized language models.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 Jun 2015 10:14:21 GMT  (137kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01192v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 23 Aug 2016 03:40:47 GMT  (168kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01192v2", "IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop (ASRU 2015), 13-17 Dec 2015, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA"], ["v3", "Tue, 22 Nov 2016 10:12:12 GMT  (169kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01192v3", "IEEE Automatic Speech Recognition and Understanding Workshop (ASRU 2015), 13-17 Dec 2015, Scottsdale, Arizona, USA"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["bo-hsiang tseng", "hung-yi lee", "lin-shan lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.01192"}
