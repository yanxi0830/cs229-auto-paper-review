Our main result is a characterization of regret in the directed observability model in terms of the dominating and independence numbers of the observability graph. We also show that in the undirected case, the learner can achieve optimal regret without even accessing the observability graph before selecting an action. Both results are shown using variants of the Exp3 algorithm operating on the observability graph in a time-efficient manner.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Jul 2013 10:24:00 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.4564v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["noga alon", "nicol\u00f2 cesa-bianchi", "claudio gentile", "yishay mansour"], "accepted": true, "id": "1307.4564"}
