This is a task of automatically sorting a set of documents into categories from a predefined set. Whereas a wide range of methods have been applied to English text categorization, relatively few studies have been conducted on Bangla language text categorization. Hence, we attempt to analyze the efficiency of those four methods for categorization of Bangla documents. In order to validate, Bangla corpus from various websites has been developed and used as examples for the experiment. For Bangla, empirical results support that all four methods produce satisfactory performance with SVM attaining good result in terms of high dimensional and relatively noisy document feature vectors.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Oct 2014 10:01:47 GMT  (228kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2045v1", "13 pages, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence &amp; Applications (IJAIA), Vol. 5, No. 5, September 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, International Journal of Artificial Intelligence &amp; Applications (IJAIA), Vol. 5, No. 5, September 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["ashis kumar mandal", "rikta sen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.2045"}
