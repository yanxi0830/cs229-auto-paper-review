However, modern datasets are so large that even linear-time models find them difficult to cope with. We introduce a novel re-parametrisation of variational inference for the GPLVM and sparse GP model that allows for an efficient distributed inference algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Feb 2014 16:08:40 GMT  (210kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1389v1", "9 pages, 8 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 21:16:47 GMT  (172kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1389v2", "9 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["yarin gal", "mark van der wilk", "carl e rasmussen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1402.1389"}
