{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Dec-2014", "title": "Diverse Embedding Neural Network Language Models", "abstract": "We propose Diverse Embedding Neural Network (DENN) - a novel architecture for neural network language models (LMs). A DENN-LM projects the input word history vector onto multiple diverse low-dimensional sub-spaces instead of a single higher-dimensional sub-space as in conventional feed-forward neural network LMs. We encourage these sub-spaces to be diverse during network training through an augmented loss function. Our language modeling experiments on the Penn Treebank data set show the performance benefit of using a DENN-LM. We also present an empirical analysis of the diverse word embeddings learned by DENN-LM.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 17:19:56 GMT  (1520kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7063v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 7 Jan 2015 21:33:46 GMT  (1533kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7063v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 19 Jan 2015 19:53:21 GMT  (1589kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7063v3", null], ["v4", "Wed, 25 Feb 2015 21:55:15 GMT  (1484kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7063v4", "Under review as workshop contribution at ICLR 2015"], ["v5", "Wed, 15 Apr 2015 20:07:50 GMT  (1484kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7063v5", "Under review as workshop contribution at ICLR 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["kartik audhkhasi", "abhinav sethy", "bhuvana ramabhadran"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.7063"}
