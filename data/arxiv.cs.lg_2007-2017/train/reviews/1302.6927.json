Using regret minimization techniques, we develop effective online learning algorithms for the prediction problem, without assuming that the noise terms are Gaussian, identically distributed or even independent. Furthermore, we show that our algorithm's performances asymptotically approaches the performance of the best ARMA model in hindsight.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Feb 2013 17:14:14 GMT  (124kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6927v1", "17 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["oren anava", "elad hazan", "shie mannor", "ohad shamir"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6927"}
