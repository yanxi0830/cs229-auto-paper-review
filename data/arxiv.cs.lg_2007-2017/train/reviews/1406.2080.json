{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Jun-2014", "title": "Training Convolutional Networks with Noisy Labels", "abstract": "We propose several simple approaches to training deep neural networks on data with noisy labels. We introduce an extra noise layer into the network which adapts the network outputs to match the noisy label distribution. The parameters of this noise layer can be estimated as part of the training process and involve simple modifications to current training infrastructures for deep networks. We demonstrate the approaches on several datasets, including large scale experiments on the ImageNet classification benchmark, showing how additional noisy data can improve state-of-the-art recognition models.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Jun 2014 05:45:12 GMT  (6370kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2080v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 20 Dec 2014 21:10:03 GMT  (6391kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2080v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 3 Mar 2015 21:13:47 GMT  (859kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2080v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 10 Apr 2015 16:44:00 GMT  (859kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2080v4", "Accepted as a workshop contribution at ICLR 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["sainbayar sukhbaatar", "joan bruna", "manohar paluri", "lubomir bourdev", "rob fergus"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.2080"}
