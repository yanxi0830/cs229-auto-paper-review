{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "21-Dec-2015", "title": "Deep Learning for Surface Material Classification Using Haptic And Visual Information", "abstract": "When a user scratches a hand-held rigid tool across an object surface, an acceleration signal can be captured, which carries relevant information about the surface. More importantly, such a haptic signal is complementary to the visual appearance of the surface, which suggests the combination of both modalities for the recognition of the surface material. In this paper, we present a novel deep learning method dealing with the surface material classification problem based on a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN), which takes as input the aforementioned acceleration signal and a corresponding image of the surface texture. Compared to previous surface material classification solutions, which rely on a careful design of hand-crafted domain-specific features, our method automatically extracts discriminative features utilizing the advanced deep learning methodologies. Experiments performed on the TUM surface material database demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art classification accuracy robustly and efficiently.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Dec 2015 15:22:16 GMT  (8593kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06658v1", "8 pages, under review as a paper at Transactions on Multimedia"], ["v2", "Sun, 1 May 2016 07:00:56 GMT  (14540kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06658v2", "8 pages, under review as a paper at Transactions on Multimedia"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, under review as a paper at Transactions on Multimedia", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["haitian zheng", "lu fang", "mengqi ji", "matti strese", "yigitcan ozer", "eckehard steinbach"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.06658"}
