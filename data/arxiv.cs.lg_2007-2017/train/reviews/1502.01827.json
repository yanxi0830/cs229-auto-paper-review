Our method extends beyond flat maximum-margin clustering, and performs clustering recursively in a top-down manner. We propose an effective greedy splitting criteria for selecting which cluster to split next, and employ regularizers that enforce feature sharing/competition for capturing data semantics. Experimental results obtained on four standard datasets show that our method outperforms flat and hierarchical clustering baselines, while forming clean and semantically meaningful cluster hierarchies.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Feb 2015 08:37:55 GMT  (412kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01827v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["guang-tong zhou", "sung ju hwang", "mark schmidt", "leonid sigal", "greg mori"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.01827"}
