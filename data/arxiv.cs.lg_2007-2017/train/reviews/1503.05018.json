Since the discovery of time series shapelets is costly in terms of time, the applicability on long or multivariate time series is difficult. In this work we propose Ultra-Fast Shapelets that uses a number of random shapelets. It is shown that Ultra-Fast Shapelets yield the same prediction quality as current state-of-the-art shapelet-based time series classifiers that carefully select the shapelets by being by up to three orders of magnitudes. Since this method allows a ultra-fast shapelet discovery, using shapelets for long multivariate time series classification becomes feasible.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Mar 2015 12:41:30 GMT  (489kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05018v1", "Preprint submitted to Journal of Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering January 24, 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Preprint submitted to Journal of Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering January 24, 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["martin wistuba", "josif grabocka", "lars schmidt-thieme"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.05018"}
