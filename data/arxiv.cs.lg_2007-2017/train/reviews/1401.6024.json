In addition to the non-convexity shared with other matrix factorization schemes, our problem is further complicated by a combinatorial constraint set of size $2^{m \\cdot r}$, where $m$ is the dimension of the data points and $r$ the rank of the factorization. Despite apparent intractability, we provide - in the line of recent work on non-negative matrix factorization by Arora et al. (2012) - an algorithm that provably recovers the underlying factorization in the exact case with $O(m r 2^r + mnr + r^2 n)$ operations for $n$ datapoints. To obtain this result, we use theory around the Littlewood-Offord lemma from combinatorics.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jan 2014 16:02:19 GMT  (368kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6024v1", "appeared in NIPS 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "appeared in NIPS 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["martin slawski", "matthias hein 0001", "pavlo lutsik"], "accepted": true, "id": "1401.6024"}
