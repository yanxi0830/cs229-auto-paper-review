In this paper, we propose a simple but effective coupled neural network, called Deeply Coupled Autoencoder Networks (DCAN), which seeks to build two deep neural networks, coupled with each other in every corresponding layers. In DCAN, each deep structure is developed via stacking multiple discriminative coupled auto-encoders, a denoising auto-encoder trained with maximum margin criterion consisting of intra-class compactness and inter-class penalty. This single layer component makes our model simultaneously preserve the local consistency and enhance its discriminative capability. With increasing number of layers, the coupled networks can gradually narrow the gap between the two views. Extensive experiments on cross-view image classification tasks demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Feb 2014 04:15:23 GMT  (2312kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2031v1", "11 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["wen wang", "zhen cui", "hong chang", "shiguang shan", "xilin chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.2031"}
