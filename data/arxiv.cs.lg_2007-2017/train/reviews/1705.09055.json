First, we relate two existing fairness measures to cost-sensitive risks. Second, we show that for cost-sensitive classification and fairness measures, the optimal classifier is an instance-dependent thresholding of the class-probability function. Third, we show how the tradeoff between accuracy and fairness is determined by the alignment between the class-probabilities for the target and sensitive features. Underpinning our analysis is a general framework that casts the problem of learning with a fairness requirement as one of minimising the difference of two statistical risks.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 May 2017 05:56:08 GMT  (377kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09055v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["aditya krishna menon", "robert c williamson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09055"}
