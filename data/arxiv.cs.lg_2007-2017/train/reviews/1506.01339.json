A commonly used accuracy metric for binary classification tasks is the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve (AUC), which is equivalent to the probability of correct response in a 2-Alternative Forced Choice (2AFC) task in which the classifier must distinguish one positively labeled example from one negatively labeled example. In this paper we illustrate how knowledge of the 2AFC score c of a set of guesses constrains the set of possible labelings that the dataset can have. We then show that the worst-case number of possible binary labelings of n examples corresponding to any particular 2AFC score c w.r.t. some candidate solution is 2^n.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 Jun 2015 18:06:49 GMT  (3kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01339v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 13 Nov 2015 15:02:42 GMT  (116kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01339v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jacob whitehill"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.01339"}
