We consider the convex problem whose objective consists of a smooth part and a nonsmooth but simple part. We propose the Fast Proximal Augmented Lagragian Method (Fast PALM) which achieves the convergence rate $O(1/K^2)$, compared with $O(1/K)$ by the traditional PALM. In order to further reduce the per-iteration complexity and handle the multi-blocks problem, we propose the Fast Proximal ADMM with Parallel Splitting (Fast PL-ADMM-PS) method. It also partially improves the rate related to the smooth part of the objective function. Experimental results on both synthesized and real world data demonstrate that our fast methods significantly improve the previous PALM and ADMM.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 14 Nov 2015 13:14:42 GMT  (649kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05133v1", "AAAI 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "AAAI 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.OC cs.LG cs.NA", "authors": ["canyi lu", "huan li", "zhouchen lin", "shuicheng yan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.05133"}
