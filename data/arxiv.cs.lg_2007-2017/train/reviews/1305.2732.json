The goal of the learner is to sequentially select its actions from a combinatorial decision set so as to minimize its cumulative loss. We propose a learning algorithm for this problem based on combining the Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader (FPL) prediction method with a novel loss estimation procedure called Geometric Resampling (GR). Contrary to previous solutions, the resulting algorithm can be efficiently implemented for any decision set where efficient offline combinatorial optimization is possible at all. Assuming that the elements of the decision set can be described with d-dimensional binary vectors with at most m non-zero entries, we show that the expected regret of our algorithm after T rounds is O(m sqrt(dT log d)). As a side result, we also improve the best known regret bounds for FPL in the full information setting to O(m^(3/2) sqrt(T log d)), gaining a factor of sqrt(d/m) over previous bounds for this algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 May 2013 10:39:47 GMT  (15kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.2732v1", "submitted to ALT 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to ALT 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["gergely neu", "g\\'abor bart\\'ok"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.2732"}
