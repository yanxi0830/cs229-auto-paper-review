Nature selects a state from a $d$-dimensional unit ball and then generates a sequence of $d$-dimensional directions. We are given access to the directions, but not access to the state. After receiving a direction, we have to guess the value of the dot product between the state and the direction. Our goal is to minimize the number of times when our guess is more than $\\epsilon$ away from the true answer. We construct a polynomial time algorithm that we call Projected Volume achieving regret $O(d\\log(d/\\epsilon))$, which is optimal up to a $\\log d$ factor. The algorithm combines a volume cutting strategy with a new geometric technique that we call cylindrification.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Nov 2016 22:38:32 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00829v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 02:29:51 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00829v2", "Appears in EC 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["ilan lobel", "renato paes leme", "adrian vladu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00829"}
