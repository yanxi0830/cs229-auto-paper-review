We show that neural networks originally designed for image recognition can be trained to detect objects within images, regardless of their class, including objects for which no bounding box labels have been provided. In addition, we show that bounding box labels yield a 1% performance increase on the ImageNet recognition challenge.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Dec 2013 20:38:18 GMT  (821kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6885v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["brody huval", "adam coates", "rew ng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6885"}
