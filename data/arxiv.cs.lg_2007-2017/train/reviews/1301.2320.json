We describe two families of methods for transforming data to encode time order in ways amenable to off-the-shelf classification and density estimation tools, and examine the results of using these approaches on several real-world data sets. The improvements in predictive accuracy we realize recommend the use of other predictive algorithms that exploit the temporal order of data.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jan 2013 16:27:15 GMT  (1084kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.2320v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Seventeenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2001)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["andrew zimdars", "david maxwell chickering", "christopher meek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.2320"}
