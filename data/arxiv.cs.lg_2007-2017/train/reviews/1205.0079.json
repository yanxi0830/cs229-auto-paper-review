We analyze in this paper this popular strategy, and prove that its worst case complexity is exponential in the number of variables. We then oppose this pessimistic result to an (optimistic) approximate analysis: We show that an approximate path with at most O(1/sqrt(epsilon)) linear segments can always be obtained, where every point on the path is guaranteed to be optimal up to a relative epsilon-duality gap. We complete our theoretical analysis with a practical algorithm to compute these approximate paths.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 May 2012 03:37:13 GMT  (56kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0079v1", "Accepted to the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012).
