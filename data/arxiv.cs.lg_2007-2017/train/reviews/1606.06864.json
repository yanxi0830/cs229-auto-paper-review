Speech enhancement or feature enhancement techniques for increasing noise robustness of these systems usually add components to the recognition system that need careful optimization. In this work, we propose the use of a relatively simple training method called accordion annealing which is inspired by curriculum learning. It uses a multi-stage training schedule where samples at SNR values as low as -15 dB are first added and subsequently samples at increasing higher SNR values are gradually added up to an SNR value of 50 dB. Because of the necessity of providing many different SNR valued samples, we additionally use a method called per-epoch noise mixing (PEM) to generate the noisy training samples online during training. Both the accordion annealing and the PEM methods are used during training of a recurrent neural network which is then evaluated on three databases. Accordion annealing improves the relative average accuracy of this network by 2 % when tested in a high SNR range (50 dB to 0 dB) and by 42 % in a low SNR range(-20 dB to 0 dB) on the Grid Corpus database.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 09:29:40 GMT  (20kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06864v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 16 Sep 2016 15:20:39 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06864v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.SD", "authors": ["stefan braun", "daniel neil", "shih-chii liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06864"}
