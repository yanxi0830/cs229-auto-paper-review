{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "21-Oct-2016", "title": "Modular Deep Q Networks for Sim-to-real Transfer of Visuo-motor Policies", "abstract": "In this paper we describe a deep network architecture that maps visual input to control actions for a robotic planar reaching task with 100% reliability in real-world trials. Our network is trained in simulation and fine-tuned with a limited number of real-world images. The policy search is guided by a kinematics-based controller (K-GPS), which works more effectively and efficiently than $\\varepsilon$-Greedy. A critical insight in our system is the need to introduce a bottleneck in the network between the perception and control networks, and to initially train these networks independently.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Oct 2016 13:36:25 GMT  (7705kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06781v1", "Under review for the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) with the option for the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2017 (submitted on 10 Sep, 2016)"], ["v2", "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 09:59:51 GMT  (6020kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06781v2", "Under review for the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) 2017 (submitted on 1 Mar, 2017)"], ["v3", "Mon, 17 Jul 2017 09:59:35 GMT  (2949kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06781v3", "Under review for CoRL 2017 (submitted on 28 June, 2017)"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review for the IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) with the option for the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2017 (submitted on 10 Sep, 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG cs.SY", "authors": ["fangyi zhang", "j\\\"urgen leitner", "michael milford", "peter corke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06781"}
