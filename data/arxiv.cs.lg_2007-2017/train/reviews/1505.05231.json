We specifically derive upper and lower bounds on the optimal rates under a smoothness condition on the correct prior, with the number of samples per data set equal the VC dimension. These results have implications for the improvements achievable via transfer learning. We additionally extend this setting to real-valued function, where we establish consistency of an estimator for the prior, and discuss an additional application to a preference elicitation problem in algorithmic economics.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 May 2015 02:43:24 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05231v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["liu yang", "steve hanneke", "jaime carbonell"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.05231"}
