Such a universal network can act like a `swiss knife' for vision tasks; we call this architecture an UberNet to indicate its overarching nature.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Sep 2016 19:35:30 GMT  (7244kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02132v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["iasonas kokkinos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.02132"}
