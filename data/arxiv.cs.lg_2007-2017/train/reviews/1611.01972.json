However, DNN-based methods are both computational-intensive and resource-consuming, which hinders the application of these methods on embedded systems like smart phones. To alleviate this problem, we introduce a novel Fixed-point Factorized Networks (FFN) on pre-trained models to reduce the computational complexity as well as the storage requirement of networks. Extensive experiments on large-scale ImageNet classification task show the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 10:26:41 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01972v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 09:46:41 GMT  (122kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01972v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["peisong wang", "jian cheng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01972"}
