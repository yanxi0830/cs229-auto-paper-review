{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "25-May-2016", "title": "Neural Universal Discrete Denoiser", "abstract": "We present a new framework of applying deep neural networks (DNN) to devise a universal discrete denoiser. Unlike other approaches that utilize supervised learning for denoising, we do not require any additional training data. In such setting, while the ground-truth label, i.e., the clean data, is not available, we devise \"pseudo-labels\" and a novel objective function such that DNN can be trained in a same way as supervised learning to become a discrete denoiser. We experimentally show that our resulting algorithm, dubbed as Neural DUDE, significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in several applications with a systematic rule of choosing the hyperparameter, which is an attractive feature in practice.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 May 2016 08:50:21 GMT  (590kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07779v1", "Submitted to NIPS 2016"], ["v2", "Wed, 24 Aug 2016 01:50:04 GMT  (590kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07779v2", "Accepted to NIPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to NIPS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["taesup moon", "seonwoo min", "byunghan lee", "sungroh yoon"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.07779"}
