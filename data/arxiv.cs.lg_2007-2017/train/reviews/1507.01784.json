By drawing explicit links between LDA and discrete versions of independent component analysis (ICA), we first derive a new set of cumulant-based tensors, with an improved sample complexity. Moreover, we reuse standard ICA techniques such as joint diagonalization of tensors to improve over existing methods based on the tensor power method. In an extensive set of experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, we show that our new combination of tensors and orthogonal joint diagonalization techniques outperforms existing moment matching methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Jul 2015 12:48:30 GMT  (122kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01784v1", "27 pages.
