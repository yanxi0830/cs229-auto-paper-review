(2013) by taking visual information into account. Like S KIP - GRAM , our multimodal models (MMSKIP-GRAM) build vector-based word representations by learning to predict linguistic contexts in text corpora. However, for a restricted set of words, the models are also exposed to visual representations of the objects they denote (extracted from natural images), and must predict linguistic and visual features jointly. The MMS KIP - GRAM models achieve excellent performance on a variety of semantic benchmarks. Moreover, since they propagate visual information to all words, we also use them to improve image labeling and retrieval in the challenging zero-shot setup, where the test concepts are not seen in training. Finally, the MMS KIP - GRAM models discover intriguing vision-related properties of abstract words, paving the way to realistic implementations of embodied theories of meaning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Jan 2015 10:48:32 GMT  (2994kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02598v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 13 Jan 2015 09:37:08 GMT  (2994kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02598v2", "10 pages"], ["v3", "Thu, 12 Mar 2015 09:47:33 GMT  (2537kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02598v3", "accepted at NAACL 2015, camera ready version, 11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["angeliki lazaridou", "nghia the pham", "marco baroni"], "accepted": true, "id": "1501.02598"}
