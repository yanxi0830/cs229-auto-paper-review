However, its convergence rate is known to be slow (sublinear) when the solution lies at the boundary. A simple less-known fix is to add the possibility to take 'away steps' during optimization, an operation that importantly does not require a feasibility oracle. In this paper, we highlight and clarify several variants of the Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm that have been successfully applied in practice: away-steps FW, pairwise FW, fully-corrective FW and Wolfe's minimum norm point algorithm, and prove for the first time that they all enjoy global linear convergence, under a weaker condition than strong convexity of the objective. The constant in the convergence rate has an elegant interpretation as the product of the (classical) condition number of the function with a novel geometric quantity that plays the role of a 'condition number' of the constraint set. We provide pointers to where these algorithms have made a difference in practice, in particular with the flow polytope, the marginal polytope and the base polytope for submodular optimization.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 20:24:43 GMT  (1097kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05932v1", "Appears in: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (NIPS 2015). 26 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28 (NIPS 2015). 26 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.OC cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["simon lacoste-julien", "martin jaggi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.05932"}
