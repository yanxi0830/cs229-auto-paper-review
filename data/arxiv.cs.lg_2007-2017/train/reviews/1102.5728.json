This Named Entity (NE) can be a named: location, person, organization, date, time, etc., characterized by instances. A NE is found in texts accompanied by contexts: words that are left or right of the NE. The work mainly aims at identifying contexts inducing the NE's nature. As such, The occurrence of the word \"President\" in a text, means that this word or context may be followed by the name of a president as President \"Obama\". Likewise, a word preceded by the string \"footballer\" induces that this is the name of a footballer. NE recognition may be viewed as a classification method, where every word is assigned to a NE class, regarding the context. The aim of this study is then to identify and classify the contexts that are most relevant to recognize a NE, those which are frequently found with the NE. A learning approach using training corpus: web documents, constructed from learning examples is then suggested. Frequency representations and modified tf-idf representations are used to calculate the context weights associated to context frequency, learning example frequency, and document frequency in the corpus.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Feb 2011 18:33:09 GMT  (136kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.5728v1", "11 pages 4 figures, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages 4 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["wahiba ben abdessalem karaa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.5728"}
