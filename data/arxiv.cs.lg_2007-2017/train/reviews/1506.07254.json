The two-class version of this problem was studied a few years ago where the proposed approaches to combat the noise revolve around a Per-ceptron learning scheme fed with peculiar examples computed through a weighted average of points from the noisy training set. We propose to build upon these approaches and we introduce a new algorithm called UMA (for Unconfused Multiclass additive Algorithm) which may be seen as a generalization to the multiclass setting of the previous approaches. In order to characterize the noise we use the confusion matrix as a multiclass extension of the classification noise studied in the aforemen-tioned literature. Theoretically well-founded, UMA furthermore displays very good empirical noise robustness, as evidenced by numerical simulations conducted on both synthetic and real data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Jun 2015 06:31:21 GMT  (126kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07254v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ugo louche", "liva ralaivola"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.07254"}
