The proposed algorithm, called DCD-RTLS, outperforms the previously-proposed RTLS algorithms, which are based on the line search method, with reduced computational complexity. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the DCD-RTLS algorithm and show that it is asymptotically unbiased as well as being stable in the mean. We also find a lower bound for the forgetting factor that ensures mean-square stability of the algorithm and calculate the theoretical steady-state mean-square deviation (MSD). We verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the accuracy of the predicted steady-state MSD via simulations.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 25 Aug 2014 17:40:44 GMT  (708kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6141v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 11 Nov 2014 00:44:23 GMT  (726kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6141v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.LG", "authors": ["reza arablouei", "kutluy{\\i}l do\\u{g}an\\c{c}ay", "stefan werner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1408.6141"}
