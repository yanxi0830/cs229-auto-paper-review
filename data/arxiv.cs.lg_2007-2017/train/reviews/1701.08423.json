Since the seminal paper by Ostrovsky, Rabani, Schulman and Swamy [FOCS 2006], much progress has been made to characterize real-world instances. We distinguish the three main definitions -- Distribution Stability (Awasthi, Blum, Sheffet, FOCS 2010) -- Spectral Separability (Kumar, Kannan, FOCS 2010) -- Perturbation Resilience (Bilu, Linial, ICS 2010) We show that Local Search performs well on the instances with the aforementioned stability properties. Specifically, for the $k$-means and $k$-median objective, we show that Local Search exactly recovers the optimal clustering if the dataset is $3+\\varepsilon$-perturbation resilient, and is a PTAS for distribution stability and spectral separability. This implies the first PTAS for instances satisfying the spectral separability condition. For the distribution stability condition we also go beyond previous work by showing that the clustering output by the algorithm and the optimal clustering are very similar. This is a significant step toward understanding the success of Local Search heuristics in clustering applications and supports the legitimacy of the stability conditions: They characterize some of the structure of real-world instances that make Local Search a popular heuristic.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 29 Jan 2017 19:55:27 GMT  (46kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08423v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 7 Apr 2017 08:46:26 GMT  (112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08423v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 10 Aug 2017 09:46:07 GMT  (116kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08423v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.CG cs.LG", "authors": ["vincent cohen-addad", "chris schwiegelshohn"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08423"}
