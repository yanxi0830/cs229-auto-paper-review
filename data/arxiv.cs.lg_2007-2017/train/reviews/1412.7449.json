Traditional approaches to parsing are highly complex and problem specific. Recently, Sutskever et al. (2014) presented a domain-independent method for learning to map input sequences to output sequences that achieved strong results on a large scale machine translation problem. In this work, we show that precisely the same sequence-to-sequence method achieves results that are close to state-of-the-art on syntactic constituency parsing, whilst making almost no assumptions about the structure of the problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Dec 2014 17:16:24 GMT  (114kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7449v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 03:16:54 GMT  (115kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7449v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 9 Jun 2015 22:41:07 GMT  (113kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7449v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["oriol vinyals", "lukasz kaiser", "terry koo", "slav petrov", "ilya sutskever", "geoffrey e hinton"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.7449"}
