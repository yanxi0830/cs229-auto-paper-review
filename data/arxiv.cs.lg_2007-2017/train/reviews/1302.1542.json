A BN can therefore be evaluated by the accuracy of the answers it returns. Many algorithms for learning BNs, however, attempt to optimize another criterion (usually likelihood, possibly augmented with a regularizing term), which is independent of the distribution of queries that are posed. This paper takes the \"performance criteria\" seriously, and considers the challenge of computing the BN whose performance - read \"accuracy over the distribution of queries\" - is optimal. We show that many aspects of this learning task are more difficult than the corresponding subtasks in the standard model.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:55:43 GMT  (1541kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1542v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["russell greiner", "adam j grove", "dale schuurmans"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1542"}
