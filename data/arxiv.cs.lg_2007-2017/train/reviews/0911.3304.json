Authentication is a challenging issue in order to guarantee the security of use of collaborative systems during the access control step. Many solutions exist in the state of the art such as the use of one time passwords or smart-cards. We focus in this paper on biometric based solutions that do not necessitate any additional sensor. Keystroke dynamics is an interesting solution as it uses only the keyboard and is invisible for users. Many methods have been published in this field. We make a comparative study of many of them considering the operational constraints of use for collaborative systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Nov 2009 13:35:40 GMT  (214kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.3304v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["romain giot", "mohamad el-abed", "christophe rosenberger"], "accepted": false, "id": "0911.3304"}
