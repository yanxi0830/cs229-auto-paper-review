For a distribution of related tasks, our model jointly learns: a data representation, an item selection heuristic, and a method for constructing prediction functions from labeled training sets. Our model uses the item selection heuristic to gather labeled training sets from which to construct prediction functions. Using the Omniglot and MovieLens datasets, we test our model in synthetic and practical settings.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Jul 2017 22:26:54 GMT  (472kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00088v1", "Accepted for publication at ICML 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for publication at ICML 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["philip bachman", "alessandro sordoni", "adam trischler"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.00088"}
