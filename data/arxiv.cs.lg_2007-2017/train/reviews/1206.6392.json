We introduce a probabilistic model based on distribution estimators conditioned on a recurrent neural network that is able to discover temporal dependencies in high-dimensional sequences. Our approach outperforms many traditional models of polyphonic music on a variety of realistic datasets. We show how our musical language model can serve as a symbolic prior to improve the accuracy of polyphonic transcription.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (616kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6392v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SD stat.ML", "authors": ["nicolas boulanger-lewandowski", "yoshua bengio", "pascal vincent"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6392"}
