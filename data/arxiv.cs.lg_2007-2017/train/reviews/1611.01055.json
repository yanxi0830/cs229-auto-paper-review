We compare the impact of four different action parameterizations (torques, muscle-activations, target joint angles, and target joint-angle velocities) in terms of learning time, policy robustness, motion quality, and policy query rates. Our results are evaluated on a gait-cycle imitation task for multiple planar articulated figures and multiple gaits. We demonstrate that the local feedback provided by higher-level action parameterizations can significantly impact the learning, robustness, and quality of the resulting policies.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Nov 2016 15:15:00 GMT  (1866kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01055v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GR cs.RO", "authors": ["xue bin peng", "michiel van de panne"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01055"}
