However, despite being scalable to large datasets they do not take full advantage of the extra data due to their linear nature, and typically underfit. We propose a new class of models which aim to provide improved performance while retaining many of the benefits of the existing class of embedding models. Our new approach works by iteratively learning a linear embedding model where the next iteration's features and labels are reweighted as a function of the previous iteration. We describe several variants of the family, and give some initial results.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 Jan 2013 17:46:27 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4171v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["jason weston", "ron j weiss", "hector yee"], "accepted": true, "id": "1301.4171"}
