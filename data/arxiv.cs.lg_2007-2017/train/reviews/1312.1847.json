However, like many deep models, there is little guidance on how the architecture of the model should be selected. Important hyper-parameters such as the degree of parameter sharing, number of layers, units per layer, and overall number of parameters must be selected manually through trial-and-error. To address this, we introduce a novel type of recursive neural network that is convolutional in nature. Its similarity to standard convolutional models allows us to tease apart the important architectural factors that influence performance. We find that for a given parameter budget, deeper models are preferred over shallow ones, and models with more parameters are preferred to those with fewer. Surprisingly and perhaps counterintuitively, we find that performance is independent of the number of units, so long as the network depth and number of parameters is held constant. This suggests that, computational efficiency considerations aside, parameter sharing within deep networks may not be so beneficial as previously supposed.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Dec 2013 12:55:05 GMT  (195kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1847v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 19 Feb 2014 17:55:37 GMT  (151kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1847v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["david eigen", "jason rolfe", "rob fergus", "yann lecun"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.1847"}
