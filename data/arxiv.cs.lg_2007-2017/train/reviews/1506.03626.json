Meanwhile, feed-forward neural network is a traditional classifier, which is very hot at present with a deeper architecture. However, the training algorithm of feed-forward neural network is developed and generated from Widrow-Hoff Principle that means to minimize the squared error. In this paper, we propose a new training algorithm for feed-forward neural networks based on Margin-Based Principle, which could effectively promote the accuracy and generalization ability of neural network classifiers with less labelled samples and flexible network. We have conducted experiments on four UCI open datasets and achieved good results as expected. In conclusion, our model could handle more sparse labelled and more high-dimension dataset in a high accuracy while modification from old ANN method to our method is easy and almost free of work.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Jun 2015 11:10:25 GMT  (378kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03626v1", "This paper has been published in ICANN 2015: International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, (May 14-15, 2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper has been published in ICANN 2015: International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, (May 14-15, 2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["han xiao", "xiaoyan zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.03626"}
