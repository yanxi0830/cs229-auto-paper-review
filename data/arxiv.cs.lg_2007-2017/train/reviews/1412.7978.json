We introduce a probabilistic framework from which computational intelligence is shown to be an entropy minimizing process at the local level. Using this new scheme, we develop a simple data driven clustering example and discuss its applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Dec 2014 07:41:45 GMT  (474kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7978v1", "Published atthis http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "Published atthis http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["daniel kovach"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.7978"}
