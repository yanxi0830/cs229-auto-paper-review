To address this, several methods incorporate constraints obtained from users into clustering algorithms, but unfortunately do not apply to hierarchical clustering. We design an interactive Bayesian algorithm that incorporates user interaction into hierarchical clustering while still utilizing the geometry of the data by sampling a constrained posterior distribution over hierarchies. We also suggest several ways to intelligently query a user. The algorithm, along with the querying schemes, shows promising results on real data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Feb 2016 03:59:57 GMT  (2050kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03258v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 12 Feb 2016 23:39:15 GMT  (2050kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03258v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 27 Apr 2016 01:36:46 GMT  (2050kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03258v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["sharad vikram", "sanjoy dasgupta"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.03258"}
