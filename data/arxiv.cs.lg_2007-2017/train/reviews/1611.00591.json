We quantitatively show the performance of our networks and illustrate the cases where our networks performs good as well as bad.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 4 Sep 2016 16:20:13 GMT  (3521kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00591v1", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["kshiteej sheth"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00591"}
