The fundamental reason is the difficulty of back-propagation through discrete random variables combined with the inherent instability of the GAN training objective. To address these problems, we propose Maximum-Likelihood Augmented Discrete Generative Adversarial Networks. Instead of directly optimizing the GAN objective, we derive a novel and low-variance objective using the discriminator's output that follows corresponds to the log-likelihood. Compared with the original, the new objective is proved to be consistent in theory and beneficial in practice. The experimental results on various discrete datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 26 Feb 2017 03:19:13 GMT  (284kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07983v1", "11 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["tong che", "yanran li", "ruixiang zhang", "r devon hjelm", "wenjie li", "yangqiu song", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07983"}
