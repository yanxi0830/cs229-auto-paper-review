The task of a feature selection algorithm (FSA) is to provide with a computational solution motivated by a certain definition of relevance or by a reliable evaluation measure. In this paper several fundamental algorithms are studied to assess their performance in a controlled experimental scenario. A measure to evaluate FSAs is devised that computes the degree of matching between the output given by a FSA and the known optimal solutions. An extensive experimental study on synthetic problems is carried out to assess the behaviour of the algorithms in terms of solution accuracy and size as a function of the relevance, irrelevance, redundancy and size of the data samples. The controlled experimental conditions facilitate the derivation of better-supported and meaningful conclusions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 12 Jan 2011 10:49:51 GMT  (238kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.2320v1", "13 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["l a belanche", "f f gonz\\'alez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1101.2320"}
