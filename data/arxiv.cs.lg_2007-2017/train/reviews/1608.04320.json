Provably accurate solutions for PCA have been in use for decades. However, to the best of our knowledge, all existing theoretical guarantees for it assume that the data and the corrupting noise are mutually independent, or at least uncorrelated. This is valid in practice often, but not always. In this paper, we study the PCA problem in the setting where the data and noise can be correlated. Such noise is often referred to as \"data-dependent noise\". We obtain a correctness result for the standard eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) based solution to PCA under simple assumptions on the data-noise correlation. We also develop and analyze a generalization of EVD, called cluster-EVD, and argue that it reduces the sample complexity of EVD in certain regimes.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Aug 2016 16:32:57 GMT  (202kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04320v1", "Under submission to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing, A part of this work will appear at NIPS 2016"], ["v2", "Wed, 2 Nov 2016 17:55:02 GMT  (57kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04320v2", "NIPS 2016 (to appear).
