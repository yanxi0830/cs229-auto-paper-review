In many problem domains, linear classifiers are preferred over more complex models due to their efficiency, robustness and interpretability, and the bag-of-words text representation can capture sufficient information for linear classifiers to make highly accurate predictions. However in settings where there is a large vocabulary, large variance in the frequency of terms in the training corpus, many classes and very short text (e.g., single sentences or document titles) the bag-of-words representation becomes extremely sparse, and this can reduce the accuracy of classifiers. A particular issue in such settings is that short texts tend to contain infrequently occurring or rare terms which lack class-conditional evidence. In this work we introduce a method for enriching the bag-of-words model by complementing such rare term information with related terms from both general and domain-specific Word Vector models. By reducing sparseness in the bag-of-words models, our enrichment approach achieves improved classification over several baseline classifiers in a variety of text classification problems. Our approach is also efficient because it requires no change to the linear classifier before or during training, since bag-of-words enrichment applies only to text being classified.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 05:00:34 GMT  (32kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05778v1", "8 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["bradford heap", "michael bain", "wayne wobcke", "alfred krzywicki", "susanne schmeidl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.05778"}
