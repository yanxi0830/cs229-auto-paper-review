Our procedure uses online convex optimization to control capital allocation to underlying investment algorithms while encouraging non-sparsity over the given grouping. We prove a logarithmic regret for this procedure with respect to the best-in-hindsight ensemble. We applied the procedure with known mean-reversion portfolio selection algorithms using the standard GICS industry sector grouping. Empirical Experimental results showed an impressive percentage increase of risk-adjusted return (Sharpe ratio).", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 Apr 2016 07:11:09 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03266v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["guy uziel", "ran el-yaniv"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.03266"}
