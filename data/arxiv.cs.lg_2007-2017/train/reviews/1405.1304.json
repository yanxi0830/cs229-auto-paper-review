Machine learning algorithms learn models from historical data. In aquaculture historical data are obtained from farm practices, yields, and environmental data sources. Associations between these different variables can be obtained by applying machine learning algorithms to historical data. In this paper we present applications of different machine learning algorithms in aquaculture applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 3 May 2014 14:26:42 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1304v1", "2 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "2 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CE cs.LG", "authors": ["akhlaqur rahman", "sumaira tasnim"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.1304"}
