The key issues of selecting the appropriate SVM kernels for classification in frequency subbands and the combination of individual subband classifiers using ensemble methods are addressed. The proposed front-end is compared with state-of-the-art ASR front-ends in terms of robustness to additive noise and linear filtering. Experiments performed on the TIMIT phoneme classification task demonstrate the benefits of the proposed subband based SVM front-end: it outperforms the standard cepstral front-end in the presence of noise and linear filtering for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) below 12-dB. A combination of the proposed front-end with a conventional front-end such as MFCC yields further improvements over the individual front ends across the full range of noise levels.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Dec 2013 08:45:07 GMT  (114kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3322v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.SD", "authors": ["jibran yousafzai", "zoran cvetkovic", "peter sollich", "matthew ager"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3322"}
