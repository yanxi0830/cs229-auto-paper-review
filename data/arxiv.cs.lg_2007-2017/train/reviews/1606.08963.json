We propose to address this problem as a task of ranking the ad categories depending on a user's preference, and introduce a novel label ranking approach capable of efficiently learning non-linear, highly accurate models in large-scale settings. Experiments on a real-world advertising data set with more than 3.2 million users show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing solutions in terms of both rank loss and top-K retrieval performance, strongly suggesting the benefit of using the proposed model on large-scale ranking problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Jun 2016 06:00:35 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08963v1", "28th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-14)"]], "COMMENTS": "28th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-14)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["nemanja djuric", "mihajlo grbovic", "vladan radosavljevic", "narayan bhamidipati", "slobodan vucetic"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.08963"}
