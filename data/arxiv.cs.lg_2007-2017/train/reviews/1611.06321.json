While very deep and wide networks have proven effective in general, they come at a high memory and computation cost, thus making them impractical for constrained platforms. These networks, however, are known to have many redundant parameters, and could thus, in principle, be replaced by more compact architectures. In this paper, we introduce an approach to automatically determining the number of neurons in each layer of a deep network during learning. To this end, we propose to make use of a group sparsity regularizer on the parameters of the network, where each group is defined to act on a single neuron. Starting from an overcomplete network, we show that our approach can reduce the number of parameters by up to 80\\% while retaining or even improving the network accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Nov 2016 07:18:17 GMT  (208kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06321v1", "NIPS 2016"], ["v2", "Fri, 13 Jan 2017 05:21:29 GMT  (342kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06321v2", "NIPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["jose m alvarez", "mathieu salzmann"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.06321"}
