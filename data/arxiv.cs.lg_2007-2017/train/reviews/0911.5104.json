Here we formalize adaptive agents as mixture distributions over sequences of inputs and outputs (I/O). Each distribution of the mixture constitutes a 'possible world', but the agent does not know which of the possible worlds it is actually facing. The problem is to adapt the I/O stream in a way that is compatible with the true world. A natural measure of adaptation can be obtained by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the I/O distribution of the true world and the I/O distribution expected by the agent that is uncertain about possible worlds. In the case of pure input streams, the Bayesian mixture provides a well-known solution for this problem. We show, however, that in the case of I/O streams this solution breaks down, because outputs are issued by the agent itself and require a different probabilistic syntax as provided by intervention calculus. Based on this calculus, we obtain a Bayesian control rule that allows modeling adaptive behavior with mixture distributions over I/O streams. This rule might allow for a novel approach to adaptive control based on a minimum KL-principle.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Nov 2009 15:52:33 GMT  (100kb,S)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.5104v1", "6 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 30 Dec 2009 23:34:14 GMT  (74kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.5104v2", "AGI-2010. 6 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["pedro a ortega", "daniel a braun"], "accepted": false, "id": "0911.5104"}
