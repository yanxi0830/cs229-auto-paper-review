However, many of these studies focus on datasets with a large number of patients. We present a novel method that is specifically designed to address the challenge of data scarcity, which is often the case for cancer datasets. Our method is able to use unlabeled data to improve classification by adopting a semi-supervised training approach to learn an ensemble classifier. The results of applying our method to three cancer datasets show the promise of semi-supervised learning for prediction of cancer survival.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Sep 2015 18:53:04 GMT  (281kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08888v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hamid reza hassanzadeh", "john h phan", "may d wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.08888"}
