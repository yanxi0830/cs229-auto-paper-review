Unfortunately, calculating the potentials in the maximum-entropy distribution is intractable \\cite{bresler2014hardness}. We provide computationally efficient versions of this principle when the mean parameters are pairwise moments: we design distributions that approximately match given pairwise moments, while having entropy which is comparable to the maximum entropy distribution matching those moments.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 Jul 2016 14:09:03 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03360v1", "12 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS stat.ML", "authors": ["andrej risteski", "yuanzhi li"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.03360"}
