Our technique is based on a local nonlinear fusion of several image estimates, all obtained by applying a chosen reconstruction algorithm with different values of its control parameters. Usually such output images have different bias/variance trade-off. The fusion of the images is performed by feed-forward neural network trained on a set of known examples. Numerical experiments show an improvement in reconstruction quality relatively to existing direct and iterative reconstruction methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 28 Nov 2013 09:44:45 GMT  (949kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.7251v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["joseph shtok", "michael zibulevsky", "michael elad"], "accepted": false, "id": "1311.7251"}
