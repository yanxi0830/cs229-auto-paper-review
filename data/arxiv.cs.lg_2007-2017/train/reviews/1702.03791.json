In order to improve the reliability of speaker verification systems, we develop a new filter bank based cepstral feature, deep neural network filter bank cepstral coefficients (DNN-FBCC), to distinguish between natural and spoofed speech. The deep neural network filter bank is automatically generated by training a filter bank neural network (FBNN) using natural and synthetic speech. By adding restrictions on the training rules, the learned weight matrix of FBNN is band-limited and sorted by frequency, similar to the normal filter bank. Unlike the manually designed filter bank, the learned filter bank has different filter shapes in different channels, which can capture the differences between natural and synthetic speech more effectively. The experimental results on the ASVspoof {2015} database show that the Gaussian mixture model maximum-likelihood (GMM-ML) classifier trained by the new feature performs better than the state-of-the-art linear frequency cepstral coefficients (LFCC) based classifier, especially on detecting unknown attacks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Feb 2017 14:44:17 GMT  (2659kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.03791v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["hong yu", "zheng-hua tan", "zhanyu ma", "jun guo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.03791"}
