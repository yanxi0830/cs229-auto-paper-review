The algorithm is derived from a theory in nonconvex optimization related to the diffusion equation. The contributions made in this work are two fold. First, we show how some seemingly disconnected mechanisms used in deep learning such as smart initialization, annealed learning rate, layerwise pretraining, and noise injection (as done in dropout and SGD) arise naturally and automatically from this framework, without manually crafting them into the algorithms. Second, we present some preliminary results on comparing the proposed method against SGD. It turns out that the new algorithm can achieve similar level of generalization accuracy of SGD in much fewer number of epochs.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 16 Jan 2016 02:24:17 GMT  (1131kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04114v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 4 Feb 2016 23:22:52 GMT  (1132kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04114v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hossein mobahi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.04114"}
