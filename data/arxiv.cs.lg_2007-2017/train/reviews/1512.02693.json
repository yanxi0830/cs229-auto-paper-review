However, this situation is typical for cases where the dynamical system to be controlled requires relatively frequent control updates in order to maintain stability or robustness yet has some action-consequences which must be established over relatively long periods of time. To address this problem, the learning capabilities of a control architecture comprised of two Backpropagated Adaptive Critics (BACs) in a two-level hierarchy with continuous actions are explored. The high-level BAC updates less frequently than the low-level BAC and controls the latter to some degree. The response of the low-level to high-level signals can either be determined a priori or it can emerge during learning. A general approach called Response Induction Learning is introduced to address the latter case.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Dec 2015 23:11:54 GMT  (1002kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02693v1", "16 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG cs.SY", "authors": ["john w jameson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.02693"}
