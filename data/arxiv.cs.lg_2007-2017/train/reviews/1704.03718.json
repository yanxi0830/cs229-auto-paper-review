The main challenge lies in the exponential label space which involves 2L possible label sets when the label dimension L is very large e.g. in millions for Wikipedia labels. This paper is motivated to better explore the label space by build- ing and modeling an explicit label graph. In the meanwhile, deep learning has been widely studied and used in various classification problems includ- ing multi-label classification, however it has not been sufficiently studied in this extreme but practi- cal case, where the label space can be as large as in millions. In this paper, we propose a practical deep embedding method for extreme multi-label classifi- cation. Our method harvests the ideas of non-linear embedding and modeling label space with graph priors at the same time. Extensive experiments on public datasets for XML show that our method per- form competitively against state-of-the-art result.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 12 Apr 2017 12:09:40 GMT  (367kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03718v1", "7 pages, 7 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 11 Sep 2017 07:46:31 GMT  (262kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03718v2", "9 pages, 7 figures"], ["v3", "Thu, 19 Oct 2017 15:59:32 GMT  (287kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03718v3", "9 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["wenjie zhang", "liwei wang", "xiangfeng wang", "junchi yan", "hongyuan zha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.03718"}
