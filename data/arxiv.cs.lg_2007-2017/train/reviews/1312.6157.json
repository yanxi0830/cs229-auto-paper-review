There are a number of methods used for this task such as Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) and Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFTs). Since some of the features extracted using automated feature extraction methods may not always be related to a specific machine learning task, in this paper we propose two methods in order to make a distinction between extracted features based on their relevancy to the task. We applied these two methods to a Deep Belief Network trained for a face recognition task.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 21:52:08 GMT  (3173kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6157v1", "4 pages, 4 figures, ICLR 2014 workshop track"], ["v2", "Thu, 2 Jan 2014 17:06:25 GMT  (3173kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6157v2", "4 pages, 4 figures, ICLR 2014 workshop track"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 4 figures, ICLR 2014 workshop track", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["mohammad pezeshki", "sajjad gholami", "ahmad nickabadi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6157"}
