We study a new formulation of the dueling bandit problems in which arms are dependent and regret occurs when neither pulled arm is optimal. We propose a new algorithm, Comparing The Best (CTB), with computational requirements appropriate for problems with few arms, and a variation of this algorithm whose computation scales to problems with many arms. We show both algorithms have constant expected cumulative regret. We demonstrate through numerical experiments on simulated and real dataset that these algorithms improve significantly over existing algorithms in the setting we study.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 28 May 2016 03:21:44 GMT  (317kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08838v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 01:30:11 GMT  (471kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08838v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["bangrui chen", "peter i frazier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.08838"}
