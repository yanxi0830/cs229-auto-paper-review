State-of-the-art automated theorem provers (ATPs) such as E allow a large number of user-specified proof search strategies described in a rich domain specific language. Several machine learning methods that invent strategies automatically for ATPs were proposed previously. One of them is the Blind Strategymaker (BliStr), a system for automated invention of ATP strategies.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 26 Nov 2016 18:48:43 GMT  (68kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08733v1", "Submitted to Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP 2017)"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to Certified Programs and Proofs (CPP 2017)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["jan jakubuv", "josef urban"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.08733"}
