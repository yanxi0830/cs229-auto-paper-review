A number of these have looked at platformer levels as a sequence of characters and performed generation using Markov chains. In this paper we examine the use of Long Short-Term Memory recurrent neural networks (LSTMs) for the purpose of generating levels trained from a corpus of Super Mario Brothers levels. We analyze a number of different data representations and how the generated levels fit into the space of human authored Super Mario Brothers levels.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Mar 2016 23:44:03 GMT  (775kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00930v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 8 Mar 2016 21:26:58 GMT  (778kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00930v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["adam summerville", "michael mateas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.00930"}
