Language models, which play a crucial role in speech recognizers and machine translation systems, are particularly sensitive to such changes, unless some form of adaptation takes place. One approach to speech language model adaptation is self-training, in which a language model's parameters are tuned based on automatically transcribed audio. However, transcription errors can misguide self-training, particularly in challenging settings such as conversational speech. In this work, we propose a model that considers the confusions (errors) of the ASR channel. By modeling the likely confusions in the ASR output instead of using just the 1-best, we improve self-training efficacy by obtaining a more reliable reference transcription estimate. We demonstrate improved topic-based language modeling adaptation results over both 1-best and lattice self-training using our ASR channel confusion estimates on telephone conversations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 Mar 2013 02:56:43 GMT  (70kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5148v1", "Technical Report 8, Human Language Technology Center of Excellence, Johns Hopkins University"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical Report 8, Human Language Technology Center of Excellence, Johns Hopkins University", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["damianos karakos", "mark dredze", "sanjeev khudanpur"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.5148"}
