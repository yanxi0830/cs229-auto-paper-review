Moreover, the difficulty of recognizing a revisited location increases with appearance changes caused, for instance, by weather or illumination variations, which hinders the long-term application of such algorithms in real environments. In this paper we present a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained for the first time with the purpose of recognizing revisited locations under severe appearance changes, which maps images to a low dimensional space where Euclidean distances represent place dissimilarity. In order for the network to learn the desired invariances, we train it with triplets of images selected from datasets which present a challenging variability in visual appearance. The triplets are selected in such way that two samples are from the same location and the third one is taken from a different place. We validate our system through extensive experimentation, where we demonstrate better performance than state-of-art algorithms in a number of popular datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 May 2015 18:21:54 GMT  (4919kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07428v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO", "authors": ["ruben gomez-ojeda", "manuel lopez-antequera", "nicolai petkov", "javier gonzalez-jimenez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.07428"}
