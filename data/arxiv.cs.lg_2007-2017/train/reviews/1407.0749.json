Moreover, when interactions are strong, Gibbs sampling may take exponential time to converge to the stationary distribution. We present an algorithm to project Ising model parameters onto a parameter set that is guaranteed to be fast mixing, under several divergences. We find that Gibbs sampling using the projected parameters is more accurate than with the original parameters when interaction strengths are strong and when limited time is available for sampling.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Jul 2014 00:19:08 GMT  (1976kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0749v1", "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 2013"], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Oct 2014 06:30:20 GMT  (1976kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0749v2", "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["justin domke", "xianghang liu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1407.0749"}
