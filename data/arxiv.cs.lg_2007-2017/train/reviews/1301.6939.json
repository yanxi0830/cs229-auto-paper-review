(2010), and emulating formal semantics by representing functions as tensors and arguments as vectors. We introduce a new learning method for tensors, generalising the approach of Baroni and Zamparelli (2010). We evaluate it on two benchmark data sets, and find it to outperform existing leading methods. We argue in our analysis that the nature of this learning method renders it suitable also for solving more subtle problems compositional distributional models might face.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Jan 2013 14:59:34 GMT  (58kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6939v1", "10 pages + 1 page references, to be presented at the 10th International Conference on Computational Semantics (IWCS 2013)"], ["v2", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 12:01:23 GMT  (58kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6939v2", "10 pages + 1 page references, to be presented at the 10th International Conference on Computational Semantics (IWCS 2013)"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages + 1 page references, to be presented at the 10th International Conference on Computational Semantics (IWCS 2013)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["edward grefenstette", "georgiana dinu", "yao-zhong zhang", "mehrnoosh sadrzadeh", "marco baroni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6939"}
