Content-based behavioral risk is quantified in the high dimensional space where the topics are generated from the log. The topics are being projected homogeneously into a space that is perception- and interaction-friendly to the human experts.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Aug 2016 22:44:42 GMT  (30kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06664v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IR", "authors": ["shih-chieh su", "joseph vaughn", "jean-laurent huynh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.06664"}
