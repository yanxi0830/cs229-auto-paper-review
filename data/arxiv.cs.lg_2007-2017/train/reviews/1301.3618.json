Much work has focused on building or extending them by finding patterns in large unannotated text corpora. In contrast, here we mainly aim to complete a knowledge base by predicting additional true relationships between entities, based on generalizations that can be discerned in the given knowledgebase. We introduce a neural tensor network (NTN) model which predicts new relationship entries that can be added to the database. This model can be improved by initializing entity representations with word vectors learned in an unsupervised fashion from text, and when doing this, existing relations can even be queried for entities that were not present in the database. Our model generalizes and outperforms existing models for this problem, and can classify unseen relationships in WordNet with an accuracy of 82.8%.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 08:05:35 GMT  (14kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3618v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 16 Mar 2013 03:23:26 GMT  (11kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3618v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["danqi chen", "richard socher", "christopher d manning", "rew y ng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3618"}
