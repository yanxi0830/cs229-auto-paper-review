The choice of the reserve price is the main mechanism through which the auction revenue can be influenced in these electronic markets. We cast the problem of selecting the reserve price to optimize revenue as a learning problem and present a full theoretical analysis dealing with the complex properties of the corresponding loss function. We further give novel algorithms for solving this problem and report the results of several experiments demonstrating their effectiveness.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Oct 2013 18:27:25 GMT  (188kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5665v1", "Under revision for ICML 2014"], ["v2", "Mon, 13 Jan 2014 18:31:04 GMT  (182kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5665v2", "Accepted at ICML 2014"], ["v3", "Tue, 2 Dec 2014 20:42:17 GMT  (172kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5665v3", "Accepted at ICML 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Under revision for ICML 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["mehryar mohri", "andres mu\\~noz medina"], "accepted": true, "id": "1310.5665"}
