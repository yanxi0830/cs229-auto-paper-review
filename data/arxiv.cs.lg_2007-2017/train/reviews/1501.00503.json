The ESN model overcomes the limitations during the training of the RNNs while introducing no significant disadvantages. Although the model presents some well-identified drawbacks when the parameters are not well initialised. The performance of an ESN is highly dependent on its internal parameters and pattern of connectivity of the hidden-hidden weights Often, the tuning of the network parameters can be hard and can impact in the accuracy of the models.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Jan 2015 21:15:00 GMT  (97kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00503v1", "To appear in Journal of Network and Innovative Computing, Volume 2, Issue 1, pp. 120 - 127, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Journal of Network and Innovative Computing, Volume 2, Issue 1, pp. 120 - 127, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["sebasti\\'an basterrech"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.00503"}
