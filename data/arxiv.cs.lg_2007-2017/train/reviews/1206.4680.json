In many applications, identifying new informative features is the primary pathway for improving performance. However, evaluating every potential feature by re-training the predictor with it can be costly. The paper describes an efficient, learner-independent technique for estimating new feature utility without re-training based on the current predictor's outputs. The method is obtained by deriving a connection between loss reduction potential and the new feature's correlation with the loss gradient of the current predictor. This leads to a simple yet powerful hypothesis testing procedure, for which we prove consistency. Our theoretical analysis is accompanied by empirical evaluation on standard benchmarks and a large-scale industrial dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:38:18 GMT  (875kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4680v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.ST stat.TH", "authors": ["hoyt a koepke", "mikhail bilenko"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4680"}
