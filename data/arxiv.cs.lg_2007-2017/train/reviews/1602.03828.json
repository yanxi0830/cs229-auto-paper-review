{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Feb-2016", "title": "Community Recovery in Graphs with Locality", "abstract": "Motivated by applications in domains such as social networks and computational biology, we study the problem of community recovery in graphs with locality. In this problem, pairwise noisy measurements of whether two nodes are in the same community or different communities come mainly or exclusively from nearby nodes rather than uniformly sampled between all nodes pairs, as in most existing models. We present an algorithm that runs nearly linearly in the number of measurements and which achieves the information theoretic limit for exact recovery.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Feb 2016 19:13:20 GMT  (782kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03828v1", "Preliminary versions"], ["v2", "Mon, 15 Feb 2016 19:26:32 GMT  (783kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03828v2", "Preliminary versions; the proofs of all theorems are deferred to the supplemental materials (this http URL)"], ["v3", "Wed, 1 Jun 2016 18:18:04 GMT  (2488kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03828v3", "accepted in part to International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Preliminary versions", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IT cs.LG cs.SI math.IT math.ST q-bio.GN stat.TH", "authors": ["yuxin chen", "govinda m kamath", "changho suh", "david tse"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.03828"}
