{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "24-Jul-2016", "title": "Scaling Up Sparse Support Vector Machines by Simultaneous Feature and Sample Reduction", "abstract": "Sparse support vector machine (SVM) is a popular classification technique that can simultaneously learn a small set of the most interpretable features. It has achieved great success in many real-world applications. However, for large-scale problems involving a huge number of samples and extremely high-dimensional features, solving sparse SVM remains challenging. By noting that sparse SVM induces sparsities in both feature and sample spaces, we propose a novel approach---that is based on accurate estimations of the primal and dual optimums of sparse SVM---to simultaneously identify the features and samples that are guaranteed to be irrelevant to the outputs. Thus, we can remove the identified samples and features from the training phase, which may lead to substantial savings in both memory usage and computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed method is the \\emph{first} \\emph{static} feature and sample reduction method for sparse SVM. Experiments on both synthetic and real data sets (e.g., the kddb data set with about 20 million of samples and 30 million of features) demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods and the speedup gained by our approach can be orders of magnitude.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 24 Jul 2016 04:00:30 GMT  (568kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06996v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 14 Aug 2016 18:45:52 GMT  (570kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06996v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 25 Feb 2017 14:25:20 GMT  (826kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06996v3", null], ["v4", "Wed, 8 Mar 2017 02:07:36 GMT  (825kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06996v4", null], ["v5", "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 08:33:14 GMT  (928kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06996v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["weizhong zhang", "bin hong", "wei liu", "jieping ye", "deng cai", "xiaofei he", "jie wang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.06996"}
