This paper proposes a novel learning paradigm named \\emph{label distribution learning} (LDL) for such kind of applications. The label distribution covers a certain number of labels, representing the degree to which each label describes the instance. LDL is a more general learning framework which includes both single-label and multi-label learning as its special cases. This paper proposes six working LDL algorithms in three ways: problem transformation, algorithm adaptation, and specialized algorithm design. In order to compare their performance, six evaluation measures are suggested for LDL algorithms, and the first batch of label distribution datasets are collected and made publicly available. Experimental results on one artificial and two real-world datasets show clear advantage of the specialized algorithms, which indicates the importance of special design for the characteristics of the LDL problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 26 Aug 2014 06:48:58 GMT  (8264kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6027v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 5 Apr 2016 09:47:09 GMT  (10286kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6027v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["xin geng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1408.6027"}
