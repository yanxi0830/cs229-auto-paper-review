To transcend this limitation, a major effort under way is to include software that (fully or at least semi) automatically mines video footage, reducing the burden imposed to the system. Herein, we propose a semi-supervised incremental learning framework for evolving visual streams in order to develop a robust and flexible track classification system. Our proposed method learns from consecutive batches by updating an ensemble in each time. It tries to strike a balance between performance of the system and amount of data which needs to be labelled. As no restriction is considered, the system can address many practical problems in an evolving multi-camera scenario, such as concept drift, class evolution and various length of video streams which have not been addressed before. Experiments were performed on synthetic as well as real-world visual data in non-stationary environments, showing high accuracy with fairly little human collaboration.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 May 2014 07:00:38 GMT  (730kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3382v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["samaneh khoshrou", "jaime s cardoso", "luis f teixeira"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3382"}
