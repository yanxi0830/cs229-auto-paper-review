By equipping Stochastic Variance Reduced Gradient (SVRG) with this preconditioning process, we obtain a significant speed-up relative to fast stochastic methods such as SVRG, SDCA and SAG.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 7 Feb 2016 08:37:18 GMT  (63kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02350v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 26 May 2016 07:42:58 GMT  (70kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02350v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["alon gonen", "francesco orabona", "shai shalev-shwartz"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.02350"}
