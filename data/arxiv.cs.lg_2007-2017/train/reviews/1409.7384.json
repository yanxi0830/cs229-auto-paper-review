In the feature subset selection problem there are two main issues that need to be addressed: (i) Finding an appropriate measure function than can be fairly fast and robustly computed for high-dimensional data. (ii) A search strategy to optimize the measure over the subset space in a reasonable amount of time. In this article mutual information between features and class labels is considered to be the measure function. Two series expansions for mutual information are proposed, and it is shown that most heuristic criteria suggested in the literature are truncated approximations of these expansions. It is well-known that searching the whole subset space is an NP-hard problem. Here, instead of the conventional sequential search algorithms, we suggest a parallel search strategy based on semidefinite programming (SDP) that can search through the subset space in polynomial time. By exploiting the similarities between the proposed algorithm and an instance of the maximum-cut problem in graph theory, the approximation ratio of this algorithm is derived and is compared with the approximation ratio of the backward elimination method. The experiments show that it can be misleading to judge the quality of a measure solely based on the classification accuracy, without taking the effect of the non-optimum search strategy into account.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Sep 2014 11:57:48 GMT  (2712kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7384v1", "Submitted to IEEETrans On Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence"], ["v2", "Wed, 12 Nov 2014 13:56:54 GMT  (2712kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7384v2", "IEEETrans On Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to IEEETrans On Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["tofigh naghibi", "sarah hoffmann", "beat pfister"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.7384"}
