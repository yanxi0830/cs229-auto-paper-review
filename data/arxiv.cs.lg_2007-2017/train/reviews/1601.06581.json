We have developed a character-level incremental speech recognition (ISR) system that responds quickly even during the speech, where the hypotheses are gradually improved while the speaking proceeds. The algorithm employs a speech-to-character unidirectional recurrent neural network (RNN), which is end-to-end trained with connectionist temporal classification (CTC), and an RNN-based character-level language model (LM). The output values of the CTC-trained RNN are character-level probabilities, which are processed by beam search decoding. The RNN LM augments the decoding by providing long-term dependency information. We propose tree-based online beam search with additional depth-pruning, which enables the system to process infinitely long input speech with low latency. This system not only responds quickly on speech but also can dictate out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words according to pronunciation. The proposed model achieves the word error rate (WER) of 8.90% on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) Nov'92 20K evaluation set when trained on the WSJ SI-284 training set.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 25 Jan 2016 12:51:46 GMT  (86kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06581v1", "To appear in ICASSP 2016"], ["v2", "Thu, 28 Jan 2016 11:03:05 GMT  (86kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06581v2", "To appear in ICASSP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in ICASSP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["kyuyeon hwang", "wonyong sung"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.06581"}
