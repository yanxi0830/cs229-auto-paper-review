{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "17-Jul-2016", "title": "Learning Unitary Operators with Help From u(n)", "abstract": "A major challenge in the training of recurrent neural networks is the so-called vanishing or exploding gradient problem. The use of a norm-preserving transition operator can address this issue, but parametrization is challenging. In this work we focus on unitary operators and describe a parametrization using the Lie algebra u(n) associated with the Lie group U(n) of n x n unitary matrices. The exponential map provides a correspondence between these spaces, and allows us to define a unitary matrix using n^2 real coefficients relative to a basis of the Lie algebra. The parametrization is closed under additive updates of these coefficients, and thus provides a simple space in which to do gradient descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this parametrization on the problem of learning arbitrary unitary operators, comparing to several baselines and outperforming a recently-proposed lower-dimensional parametrization.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 17 Jul 2016 18:58:12 GMT  (146kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04903v1", "9 pages, 3 figures, 5 figures inc. subfigures"], ["v2", "Mon, 14 Nov 2016 16:02:25 GMT  (233kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04903v2", "13 pages (3 appendix pages), 3 figures, 5 figures inc. subfigures"], ["v3", "Tue, 10 Jan 2017 11:13:35 GMT  (760kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04903v3", "9 pages, 3 figures, 5 figures inc. subfigures, to appear at AAAI-17"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 3 figures, 5 figures inc. subfigures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["stephanie l hyland", "gunnar r\u00e4tsch"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.04903"}
