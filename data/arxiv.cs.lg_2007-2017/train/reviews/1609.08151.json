The shallow autoencoder is a simplified RNN model, which is then stacked into a multi-layer architecture. The learning algorithms are based on the weight update rules in the NMF area, subjecting to the nonnegative and probability constraints in a RNN model. The autoencoders equipped with the learning algorithms are tested on both typical image datasets including the MNIST, Yale face and CIFAR-10 datesets and 16 real-world datasets from different areas, and the results verify its efficacy. Simulation results of the stochastic spiking behaviors of this RNN autoencoder demonstrate that it can be implemented in a highly-distributed manner.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 25 Sep 2016 13:47:08 GMT  (603kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08151v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 11:02:29 GMT  (603kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08151v2", "10 pages (a small edit to the abstract)"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yonghua yin", "erol gelenbe"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.08151"}
