We propose an approach that automatically identifies discriminative configurations of visual patterns that are characteristic of a given object class. We formulate the problem as a constrained submodular optimization problem and demonstrate the benefits of the discovered configurations in remedying mislocalizations and finding informative positive and negative training examples. Together, these lead to state-of-the-art weakly-supervised detection results on the challenging PASCAL VOC dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Jun 2014 09:35:40 GMT  (7360kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6507v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["hyun oh song", "yong jae lee", "stefanie jegelka", "trevor darrell"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.6507"}
