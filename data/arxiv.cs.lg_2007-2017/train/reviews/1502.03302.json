As such, researchers have proposed a variety of automatic tools and systems to assist users measure their calorie in-take. In this paper, we consider the category of those tools that use image processing to recognize the food, and we propose a method for fully automatic and user-friendly calibration of the dimension of the food portion sizes, which is needed in order to measure food portion weight and its ensuing amount of calories. Experimental results show that our method, which uses deep learning, mobile cloud computing, distance estimation and size calibration inside a mobile device, leads to an accuracy improvement to 95% on average compared to previous work", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Feb 2015 13:27:01 GMT  (1044kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03302v1", "7 pages"], ["v2", "Mon, 23 Mar 2015 11:45:11 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03302v2", "This paper has been withdrawn due to errors in equation 1"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.HC cs.LG", "authors": ["pallavi kuhad", "abdulsalam yassine", "shervin shirmohammadi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.03302"}
