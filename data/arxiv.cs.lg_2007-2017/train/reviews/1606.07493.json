{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "23-Jun-2016", "title": "Sort Story: Sorting Jumbled Images and Captions into Stories", "abstract": "Temporal common sense has applications in AI tasks such as QA, multi-document summarization, and human-AI communication. We propose the task of sequencing -- given a jumbled set of aligned image-caption pairs that belong to a story, the task is to sort them such that the output sequence forms a coherent story. We present multiple approaches, via unary (position) and pairwise (order) predictions, and their ensemble-based combinations, achieving strong results on this task. As features, we use both text-based and image-based features, which depict complementary improvements. Using qualitative examples, we demonstrate that our models have learnt interesting aspects of temporal common sense.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Jun 2016 21:54:44 GMT  (5382kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07493v1", "8 pages, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 05:26:43 GMT  (4627kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07493v2", "8 pages, 4 figures"], ["v3", "Wed, 6 Jul 2016 19:56:36 GMT  (4632kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07493v3", "9 pages, 4 figures"], ["v4", "Sat, 24 Sep 2016 00:37:27 GMT  (4883kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07493v4", "To appear in EMNLP 2016"], ["v5", "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 18:48:13 GMT  (4888kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07493v5", "EMNLP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["harsh agrawal", "arjun chandrasekaran", "dhruv batra", "devi parikh", "mohit bansal"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.07493"}
