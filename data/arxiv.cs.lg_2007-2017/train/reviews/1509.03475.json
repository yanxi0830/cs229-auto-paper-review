The performance of MDRNN is improved by further increasing its depth, and the difficulty of learning the deeper network is overcome by Hessian-free (HF) optimization. Considering that connectionist temporal classification (CTC) is utilized as an objective of learning MDRNN for sequence labelling, the non-convexity of CTC poses a problem to apply HF to the network. As a solution to this, a convex approximation of CTC is formulated and its relationship with the EM algorithm and the Fisher information matrix is discussed. MDRNN up to the depth of 15 layers is successfully trained using HF, resulting in improved performance for sequence labelling.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Sep 2015 12:28:36 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03475v1", "to appear at NIPS 2015"], ["v2", "Fri, 23 Oct 2015 07:14:04 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03475v2", "to appear at NIPS 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "to appear at NIPS 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML", "authors": ["minhyung cho", "chandra shekhar dhir", "jaehyung lee"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.03475"}
