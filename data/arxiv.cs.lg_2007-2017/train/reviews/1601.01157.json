Our method consists of a standard one-against-all (OAA) classification, followed by another network layer classifying the resulting class scores, possibly augmented by the original raw input vector. This allows the network to disambiguate hard-to-separate classes as the distribution of class scores carries considerable information as well, and is in fact often used for assessing the confidence of a decision. We show that by this approach we are able to significantly boost our results, overall as well as for particular difficult cases, on the hard 10-class gesture classification task.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Jan 2016 12:33:35 GMT  (936kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01157v1", "European Symposium on artificial neural networks (ESANN), Jun 2015, Bruges, Belgium"]], "COMMENTS": "European Symposium on artificial neural networks (ESANN), Jun 2015, Bruges, Belgium", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["thomas kopinski", "alexander gepperth", "uwe handmann"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.01157"}
