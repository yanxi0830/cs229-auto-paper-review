Most major manufacturers including Tesla, GM, Ford, BMW, and Waymo/Google are working on building and testing different types of autonomous vehicles. The lawmakers of several US states including California, Texas, and New York have passed new legislation to fast-track the process of testing and deployment of autonomous vehicles on their roads.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Aug 2017 23:26:14 GMT  (7349kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08559v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["yuchi tian", "kexin pei", "suman jana", "baishakhi ray"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.08559"}
