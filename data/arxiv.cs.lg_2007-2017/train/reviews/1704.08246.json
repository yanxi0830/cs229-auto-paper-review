Despite the success on obtaining relative error low rank approximations for matrices, no such results were known for tensors. One structural issue is that there may be no rank-$k$ tensor $A_k$ achieving the above infinum. Another, computational issue, is that an efficient relative error low rank approximation algorithm for tensors would allow one to compute the rank of a tensor, which is NP-hard. We bypass these issues via (1) bicriteria and (2) parameterized complexity solutions:", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 17:59:11 GMT  (1362kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08246v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.CC cs.LG", "authors": ["zhao song", "david p woodruff", "peilin zhong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.08246"}
