In contrast to existing works, our active learning problem involves selecting not just the most informative sampling locations to be observed but also the types of measurements at each selected location for minimizing the predictive uncertainty (i.e., posterior joint entropy) of a target phenomenon of interest given a sampling budget. Unfortunately, such an entropy criterion scales poorly in the numbers of candidate sampling locations and selected observations when optimized. To resolve this issue, we first exploit a structure common to sparse MOGP models for deriving a novel active learning criterion. Then, we exploit a relaxed form of submodularity property of our new criterion for devising a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that guarantees a constant-factor approximation of that achieved by the optimal set of selected observations. Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our proposed approach outperforms existing algorithms for active learning of MOGP and single-output GP models.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 21 Nov 2015 15:08:53 GMT  (176kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06891v1", "30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2016), Extended version with proofs, 13 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 24 Nov 2015 08:45:36 GMT  (176kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06891v2", "30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2016), Extended version with proofs, 13 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2016), Extended version with proofs, 13 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["yehong zhang", "trong nghia hoang", "kian hsiang low", "mohan s kankanhalli"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.06891"}
