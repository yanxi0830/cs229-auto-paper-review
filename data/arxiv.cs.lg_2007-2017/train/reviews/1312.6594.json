Our strategy is based on a sequential process that learns to explore the different regions of any image in order to infer its category. In particular, the choice of regions is specific to each image, directed by the actual content of previously selected regions.The capacity of the system to handle incomplete image information as well as its adaptive region selection allow the system to perform well in budgeted classification tasks by exploiting a dynamicly generated representation of each image. We demonstrate the system's abilities in a series of image-based exploration and classification tasks that highlight its learned exploration and inference abilities.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 16:36:40 GMT  (7524kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6594v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 7 Jan 2014 14:44:42 GMT  (3587kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6594v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 11 Feb 2014 17:07:21 GMT  (6918kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6594v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["gabriel dulac-arnold", "ludovic denoyer", "nicolas thome", "matthieu cord", "patrick gallinari"], "accepted": true, "id": "1312.6594"}
