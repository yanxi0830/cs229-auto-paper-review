Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a peer-referral process widely used by many health organizations, where research subjects recruit other subjects from their social network. In such surveys, researchers observe who recruited whom, along with the time of recruitment and the total number of acquaintances (network degree) of respondents. However, due to privacy concerns, the identities of acquaintances are not disclosed. In this work, we show how to reconstruct the underlying network structure through which the subjects are recruited. We formulate the dynamics of RDS as a continuous-time diffusion process over the underlying graph and derive the likelihood for the recruitment time series under an arbitrary recruitment time distribution. This way, we develop an efficient stochastic optimization algorithm called RENDER (REspoNdent-Driven nEtwork Reconstruction) that finds the network that best explains the collected data. We support our analytical results through an exhaustive set of experiments on both synthetic and real data.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Nov 2015 01:59:35 GMT  (565kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04137v1", "Accepted by AAAI 2016"], ["v2", "Wed, 2 Dec 2015 01:02:17 GMT  (440kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04137v2", "A full version with technical proofs.
