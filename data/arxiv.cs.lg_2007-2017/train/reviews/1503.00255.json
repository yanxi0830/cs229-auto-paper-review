Recently, Abernethy, Batlett and Hazan (2011) proposed a class of approachability algorithms that rely on the no-regret properties of Online Linear Programming for computing a suitable sequence of steering directions. This is first carried out for target sets that are convex cones, and then generalized to any convex set by embedding it in a higher-dimensional convex cone. In this paper we present a more direct formulation that relies on the support function of the set, along with suitable Online Convex Optimization algorithms, which leads to a general class of approachability algorithms. We further show that Blackwell's original algorithm and its convergence follow as a special case.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 1 Mar 2015 11:46:35 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00255v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.LG", "authors": ["nahum shimkin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.00255"}
