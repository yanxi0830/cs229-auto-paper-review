Dissimilarities are assessed based on the attribute values describing the objects. Often, distance measures are used. Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique, where interesting patterns and structures can be found directly from very large data sets with little or none of the background knowledge. This paper also considers the partitioning of m-dimensional lattice graphs using Fiedler's approach, which requires the determination of the eigenvector belonging to the second smallest Eigenvalue of the Laplacian with K-means partitioning algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Mar 2012 07:08:10 GMT  (245kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.2002v1", "14 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DB", "authors": ["t soni madhulatha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.2002"}
