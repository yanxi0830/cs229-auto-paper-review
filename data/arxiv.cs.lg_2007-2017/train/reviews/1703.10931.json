Most recent approaches draw on insights from machine translation to learn simplification rewrites from monolingual corpora of complex and simple sentences. We address the simplification problem with an encoder-decoder model coupled with a deep reinforcement learning framework. Our model explores the space of possible simplifications while learning to optimize a reward function that encourages outputs which are simple, fluent, and preserve the meaning of the input. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our model brings significant improvements over the state of the art.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 31 Mar 2017 15:05:45 GMT  (38kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10931v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 16 Jul 2017 02:28:14 GMT  (45kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10931v2", "to appear in EMNLP 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["xingxing zhang", "mirella lapata"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.10931"}
