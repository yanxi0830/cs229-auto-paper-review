With $O(r^2 \\kappa^2 n \\log n)$ random measurements of a positive semidefinite $n \\times n$ matrix of rank $r$ and condition number $\\kappa$, our method is guaranteed to converge linearly to the global optimum.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Jun 2015 16:41:08 GMT  (94kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06081v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 8 Oct 2015 22:46:11 GMT  (95kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06081v2", "Sample complexity updated.
