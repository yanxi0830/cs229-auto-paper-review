{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "21-Jul-2017", "title": "An Infinite Hidden Markov Model With Similarity-Biased Transitions", "abstract": "We describe a generalization of the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov Model (HDP-HMM) which is able to encode prior information that state transitions are more likely between \"nearby\" states. This is accomplished by defining a similarity function on the state space and scaling transition probabilities by pair-wise similarities, thereby inducing correlations among the transition distributions. We present an augmented data representation of the model as a Markov Jump Process in which: (1) some jump attempts fail, and (2) the probability of success is proportional to the similarity between the source and destination states. This augmentation restores conditional conjugacy and admits a simple Gibbs sampler. We evaluate the model and inference method on a speaker diarization task and a \"harmonic parsing\" task using four-part chorale data, as well as on several synthetic datasets, achieving favorable comparisons to existing models.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Jul 2017 04:39:10 GMT  (441kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06756v1", "16 pages, 4 figures, accepted to ICML 2017, includes supplemental appendix"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 4 figures, accepted to ICML 2017, includes supplemental appendix", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG stat.ME", "authors": ["colin reimer dawson", "chaofan huang", "clayton t morrison"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.06756"}
