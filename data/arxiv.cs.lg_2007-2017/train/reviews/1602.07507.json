The goal of data description is to draw a boundary around objects of a certain class of interest to discriminate that class from the rest of the feature space. Data description is also known as one-class learning and has a wide range of applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 13:52:52 GMT  (1313kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07507v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["alireza ghasemi", "hamid r rabiee", "mohammad taghi manzuri", "mohammad hossein rohban"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.07507"}
