We propose a fast non-iterative approximate inference method that uses a feedforward network to implement efficient exact sampling from the variational posterior. The model and this inference network are trained jointly by maximizing a variational lower bound on the log-likelihood. Although the naive estimator the inference model gradient is too high-variance to be useful, we make it practical by applying several straightforward model-independent variance reduction techniques. Applying our approach to training sigmoid belief networks and deep autoregressive networks, we show that it outperforms the wake-sleep algorithm on MNIST and achieves state-of-the-art results on the Reuters RCV1 document dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 31 Jan 2014 23:33:21 GMT  (130kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0030v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 4 Jun 2014 17:12:03 GMT  (57kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0030v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["andriy mnih", "karol gregor"], "accepted": true, "id": "1402.0030"}
