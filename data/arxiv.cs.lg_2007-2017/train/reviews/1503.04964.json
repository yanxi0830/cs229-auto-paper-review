Sensor nodes periodically sense the random field and generate data, which is stored in the corresponding data queues. The EH source harnesses energy from ambient energy sources and the generated energy is stored in an energy buffer. Sensor nodes receive energy for data transmission from the EH source. The EH source has to efficiently share the stored energy among the nodes in order to minimize the long-run average delay in data transmission. We formulate the problem of energy sharing between the nodes in the framework of average cost infinite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs). We develop efficient energy sharing algorithms, namely Q-learning algorithm with exploration mechanisms based on the $\\epsilon$-greedy method as well as upper confidence bound (UCB). We extend these algorithms by incorporating state and action space aggregation to tackle state-action space explosion in the MDP. We also develop a cross entropy based method that incorporates policy parameterization in order to find near optimal energy sharing policies. Through simulations, we show that our algorithms yield energy sharing policies that outperform the heuristic greedy method.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Mar 2015 09:32:29 GMT  (2063kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04964v1", "38 pages, 10 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "38 pages, 10 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.LG", "authors": ["sindhu padakandla", "prabuchandran k j", "shalabh bhatnagar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.04964"}
