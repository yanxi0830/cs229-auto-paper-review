The work is motivated by the growing popularity of the method that is claimed to guarantee a good generalization performance for the task in hand. The method is implemented in MATLAB. SVMs based on various kernels are tested for classifying data from various domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 13 Dec 2014 03:33:13 GMT  (239kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4186v1", "A short (6 page) report on evaluation of the SVM as a pattern classification tool, as of 1999"]], "COMMENTS": "A short (6 page) report on evaluation of the SVM as a pattern classification tool, as of 1999", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["eugene borovikov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.4186"}
