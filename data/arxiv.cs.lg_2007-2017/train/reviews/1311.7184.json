The goal is to associate instances with their generating distributions, or to identify the parameters of the hidden distributions. In this work we make the assumption that we have access to several samples drawn from the same $K$ underlying distributions, but with different mixing weights. As with topic modeling, having multiple samples is often a reasonable assumption. Instead of pooling the data into one sample, we prove that it is possible to use the differences between the samples to better recover the underlying structure. We present algorithms that recover the underlying structure under milder assumptions than the current state of art when either the dimensionality or the separation is high. The methods, when applied to topic modeling, allow generalization to words not present in the training data.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 28 Nov 2013 01:36:49 GMT  (284kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.7184v1", "Published in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "Published in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["jason d lee", "ran gilad-bachrach", "rich caruana"], "accepted": true, "id": "1311.7184"}
