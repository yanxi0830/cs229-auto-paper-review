The motivation for looking at new ways for comparing clusterings stems from the fact that the existing clustering indices are based on set cardinality alone and do not consider the positions of data points. The new indices, namely, the Random Walk index (RWI) and Variation of Information with Neighbors (VIN), are both inspired by the clustering metric Variation of Information (VI). VI possesses some interesting theoretical properties which are also desirable in a metric for comparing clusterings. We define our indices and discuss some of their explored properties which appear relevant for a clustering index. We also include the results of these indices on clusterings of some example data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Nov 2014 13:19:15 GMT  (396kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7582v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["zaeem hussain", "marina meila"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.7582"}
