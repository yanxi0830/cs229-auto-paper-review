In this paper we present a system chor-rnn for generating novel choreographic material in the nuanced choreographic language and style of an individual choreographer. It also shows promising results in producing a higher level compositional cohesion, rather than just generating sequences of movement. At the core of chor-rnn is a deep recurrent neural network trained on raw motion capture data and that can generate new dance sequences for a solo dancer. Chor-rnn can be used for collaborative human-machine choreography or as a creative catalyst, serving as inspiration for a choreographer.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 May 2016 07:36:49 GMT  (269kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06921v1", "This article will be presented at the 7th International Conference on Computational Creativity, ICCC2016"]], "COMMENTS": "This article will be presented at the 7th International Conference on Computational Creativity, ICCC2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.MM cs.NE", "authors": ["luka crnkovic-friis", "louise crnkovic-friis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.06921"}
