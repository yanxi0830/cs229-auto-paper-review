Feature selection plays a vital role in cancer classification. This paper investigates the feature selection process in Computed Tomographic (CT) lung cancer images using soft set theory. We propose a new soft set based unsupervised feature selection algorithm. Nineteen features are extracted from the segmented lung images using gray level co-occurence matrix (GLCM) and gray level different matrix (GLDM). In this paper, an efficient Unsupervised Soft Set based Quick Reduct (SSUSQR) algorithm is presented. This method is used to select features from the data set and compared with existing rough set based unsupervised feature selection methods. Then K-Means and Self Organizing Map (SOM) clustering algorithms are used to cluster the data. The performance of the feature selection algorithms is evaluated based on performance of clustering techniques. The results show that the proposed method effectively removes redundant features.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Dec 2012 10:46:24 GMT  (3995kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5391v1", "7 pages, IJSER Vol.3 Issue . 10 Oct 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, IJSER Vol.3 Issue . 10 Oct 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE", "authors": ["g jothi", "h hannah inbarani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.5391"}
