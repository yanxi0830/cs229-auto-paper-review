For example, optimal prediction of a label $Y$ given an input $X$ corresponds to maximizing the conditional probability of $Y$ given $X$. A common approach to inference tasks is learning a model of conditional probabilities. However, these models are often based on strong assumptions (e.g., log-linear models), and hence their estimate of conditional probabilities is not robust and is highly dependent on the validity of their assumptions.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Aug 2017 08:42:09 GMT  (147kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02406v1", "24 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "24 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yoav wald", "amir globerson"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.02406"}
