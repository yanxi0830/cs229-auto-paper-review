We introduce a new formulation, called contextual decision processes, that unifies and generalizes most prior settings. Our first contribution is a new complexity measure, the Bellman Rank, that we show enables tractable learning of near-optimal behavior in these processes and is naturally small for many well-studied reinforcement learning settings. Our second contribution is a new reinforcement learning algorithm that engages in systematic exploration to learn contextual decision processes with low Bellman Rank. The algorithm provably learns near-optimal behavior with a number of samples that is polynomial in all relevant parameters but independent of the number of unique observations. The algorithm uses Bellman error minimization with optimistic exploration and provides new insights into efficient exploration for reinforcement learning with function approximation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 29 Oct 2016 14:01:58 GMT  (849kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09512v1", "43 pages, 1 figure"], ["v2", "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 19:21:45 GMT  (846kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09512v2", "42 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "43 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["nan jiang", "akshay krishnamurthy", "alekh agarwal", "john langford", "robert e schapire"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.09512"}
