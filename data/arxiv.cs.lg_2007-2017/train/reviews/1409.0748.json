The Health Improvement Network (THIN) database is an electronic healthcare database containing medical information on over 11 million patients that has excellent potential for detecting ADRs. In this paper we apply four existing electronic healthcare database signal detecting algorithms (MUTARA, HUNT, Temporal Pattern Discovery and modified ROR) on the THIN database for a selection of drugs from six chosen drug families. This is the first comparison of ADR signalling algorithms that includes MUTARA and HUNT and enabled us to set a benchmark for the adverse drug reaction signalling ability of the THIN database. The drugs were selectively chosen to enable a comparison with previous work and for variety. It was found that no algorithm was generally superior and the algorithms' natural thresholds act at variable stringencies. Furthermore, none of the algorithms perform well at detecting rare ADRs.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Sep 2014 15:16:26 GMT  (420kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0748v1", "Soft Computing, 17(12) pp. 2381-2397, 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "Soft Computing, 17(12) pp. 2381-2397, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE", "authors": ["jenna reps", "jonathan m garibaldi", "uwe aickelin", "daniele soria", "jack gibson", "richard hubbard"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.0748"}
