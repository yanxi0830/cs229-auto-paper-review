The key idea underpinning existing ZSL approaches is to exploit knowledge transfer via an intermediate-level semantic representation which is assumed to be shared between the auxiliary and target datasets, and is used to bridge between these domains for knowledge transfer. The semantic representation used in existing approaches varies from visual attributes to semantic word vectors and semantic relatedness. However, the overall pipeline is similar: a projection mapping low-level features to the semantic representation is learned from the auxiliary dataset by either classification or regression models and applied directly to map each instance into the same semantic representation space where a zero-shot classifier is used to recognise the unseen target class instances with a single known 'prototype' of each target class. In this paper we discuss two related lines of work improving the conventional approach: exploiting transductive learning ZSL, and generalising ZSL to the multi-label case.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Mar 2015 20:07:37 GMT  (3272kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07884v1", "4 pages, 4 figures, ECCV 2014 Workshop on Parts and Attributes"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 4 figures, ECCV 2014 Workshop on Parts and Attributes", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["yanwei fu", "yongxin yang", "timothy m hospedales", "tao xiang", "shaogang gong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.07884"}
