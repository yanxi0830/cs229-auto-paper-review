Benefiting from weighted losses, the fine-tuning method significantly improves the performance of the policies for a robotic planar reaching task.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 May 2017 08:57:27 GMT  (3225kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05116v1", "2 pages, to appear in the Deep Learning for Robotic Vision (DLRV) Workshop in CVPR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "2 pages, to appear in the Deep Learning for Robotic Vision (DLRV) Workshop in CVPR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG cs.SY", "authors": ["fangyi zhang", "j\\\"urgen leitner", "michael milford", "peter i corke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05116"}
