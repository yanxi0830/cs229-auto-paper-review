Training with stochastic gradient descent and variants requires careful parameter tuning and provides no guarantee to achieve the global optimum. In contrast we show under quite weak assumptions on the data that a particular class of feedforward neural networks can be trained globally optimal with a linear convergence rate with our nonlinear spectral method. Up to our knowledge this is the first practically feasible method which achieves such a guarantee. While the method can in principle be applied to deep networks, we restrict ourselves for simplicity in this paper to one and two hidden layer networks. Our experiments confirm that these models are rich enough to achieve good performance on a series of real-world datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Oct 2016 16:28:23 GMT  (310kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09300v1", "Long version of NIPS 2016 paper"]], "COMMENTS": "Long version of NIPS 2016 paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.OC stat.ML", "authors": ["antoine gautier", "quynh n nguyen", "matthias hein 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.09300"}
