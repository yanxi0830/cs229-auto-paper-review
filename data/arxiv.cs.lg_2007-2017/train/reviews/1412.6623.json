{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Dec-2014", "title": "Word Representations via Gaussian Embedding", "abstract": "Current work in lexical distributed representations maps each word to a point vector in low-dimensional space. Mapping instead to a density provides many interesting advantages, including better capturing uncertainty about a representation and its relationships, expressing asymmetries more naturally than dot product or cosine similarity, and enabling more expressive parameterization of decision boundaries. This paper advocates for density-based distributed embeddings and presents a method for learning representations in the space of Gaussian distributions. We compare performance on various word embedding benchmarks, investigate the ability of these embeddings to model entailment and other asymmetric relationships, and explore novel properties of the representation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 Dec 2014 07:42:40 GMT  (316kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6623v1", "12 pages, in submission to ICLR 2015"], ["v2", "Tue, 10 Mar 2015 14:24:28 GMT  (183kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6623v2", "12 pages, in submission to ICLR 2015"], ["v3", "Thu, 23 Apr 2015 18:19:11 GMT  (183kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6623v3", "12 pages, published as conference paper at ICLR 2015"], ["v4", "Fri, 1 May 2015 10:14:58 GMT  (184kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6623v4", "12 pages, published as conference paper at ICLR 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, in submission to ICLR 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["luke vilnis", "rew mccallum"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.6623"}
