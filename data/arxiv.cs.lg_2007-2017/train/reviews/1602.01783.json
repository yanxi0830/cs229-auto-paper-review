We present asynchronous variants of four standard reinforcement learning algorithms and show that parallel actor-learners have a stabilizing effect on training allowing all four methods to successfully train neural network controllers. The best performing method, an asynchronous variant of actor-critic, surpasses the current state-of-the-art on the Atari domain while training for half the time on a single multi-core CPU instead of a GPU. Furthermore, we show that asynchronous actor-critic succeeds on a wide variety of continuous motor control problems as well as on a new task involving finding rewards in random 3D mazes using a visual input.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Feb 2016 18:38:41 GMT  (1848kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 16 Jun 2016 16:38:45 GMT  (1883kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["volodymyr mnih", "adri\u00e0 puigdom\u00e8nech badia", "mehdi mirza", "alex graves", "timothy p lillicrap", "tim harley", "david silver", "koray kavukcuoglu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.01783"}
