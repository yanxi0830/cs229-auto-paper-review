The curvature indifferent way of manifold processing often makes traditional dimension reduction poorly neighborhood preserving. To overcome this drawback we propose a new algorithm called RF-ML to perform an operation on the manifold with help of Ricci flow before reducing the dimension of manifold.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 07:27:04 GMT  (53kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10675v1", "10 pages, 1 figure"], ["v2", "Mon, 10 Apr 2017 08:01:52 GMT  (53kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10675v2", "10 pages, 1 figure"], ["v3", "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 00:46:25 GMT  (53kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10675v3", "10 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yangyang li", "ruqian lu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.10675"}
