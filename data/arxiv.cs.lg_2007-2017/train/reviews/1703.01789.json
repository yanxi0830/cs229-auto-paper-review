This approach was applied to musical signals as well but has been not fully explored yet. To this end, we propose sample-level deep convolutional neural networks which learn representations from very small grains of waveforms (e.g. 2 or 3 samples) beyond typical frame-level input representations. This allows the networks to hierarchically learn filters that are sensitive to log-scaled frequency, such as mel-frequency spectrogram that is widely used in music classification systems. It also helps learning high-level abstraction of music by increasing the depth of layers. We show how deep architectures with sample-level filters improve the accuracy in music auto-tagging and they provide results that are com- parable to previous state-of-the-art performances for the Magnatagatune dataset and Million song dataset. In addition, we visualize filters learned in a sample-level DCNN in each layer to identify hierarchically learned features.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 09:49:48 GMT  (3001kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01789v1", "7 pages, Sound and Music Computing Conference, 2017 submitted"], ["v2", "Mon, 22 May 2017 04:46:36 GMT  (6859kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01789v2", "7 pages, Sound and Music Computing Conference (SMC), 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, Sound and Music Computing Conference, 2017 submitted", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.LG cs.MM cs.NE", "authors": ["jongpil lee", "jiyoung park", "keunhyoung luke kim", "juhan nam"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.01789"}
