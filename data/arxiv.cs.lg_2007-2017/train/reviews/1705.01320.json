Such networks are often used in deep learning and have been shown to be hard to verify for modern satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) and integer linear programming (ILP) solvers.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 May 2017 09:13:10 GMT  (58kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01320v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 18 May 2017 07:32:33 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01320v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 2 Aug 2017 09:21:18 GMT  (58kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01320v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LO cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["ruediger ehlers"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.01320"}
