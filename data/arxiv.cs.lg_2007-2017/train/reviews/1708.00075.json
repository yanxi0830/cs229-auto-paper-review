Minimizing the standard notion of regret is computationally intractable. Thus, we define a natural notion of regret which permits efficient optimization and generalizes offline guarantees for convergence to an approximate local optimum. We give gradient-based methods that achieve optimal regret, which in turn guarantee convergence to equilibrium in this framework.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Jul 2017 21:23:29 GMT  (176kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.00075v1", "Published as a conference paper at ICML 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Published as a conference paper at ICML 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GT stat.ML", "authors": ["elad hazan", "karan singh", "cyril zhang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.00075"}
