We propose a recursive convolutional neural network (RCNN) architecture to capture syntactic and compositional-semantic representations of phrases and words in a dependency tree. Different with the original recursive neural network, we introduce the convolution and pooling layers, which can model a variety of compositions by the feature maps and choose the most informative compositions by the pooling layers. Based on RCNN, we use a discriminative model to re-rank a $k$-best list of candidate dependency parsing trees. The experiments show that RCNN is very effective to improve the state-of-the-art dependency parsing on both English and Chinese datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 May 2015 10:23:10 GMT  (199kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05667v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["chenxi zhu", "xipeng qiu", "xinchi chen", "xuanjing huang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1505.05667"}
