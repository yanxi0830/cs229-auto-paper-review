For example, in environment monitoring some sensors expired whereas some new ones deployed; in mobile game recommendation some games dropped whereas some new ones added. Learning with such incremental and decremental features is crucial but rarely studied, particularly when the data coming like a stream and thus it is infeasible to keep the whole data for optimization. In this paper, we study this challenging problem and present the OPID approach. Our approach attempts to compress important information of vanished features into functions of survived features, and then expand to include the augmented features. It is the one-pass learning approach, which only needs to scan each instance once and does not need to store the whole data, and thus satisfy the evolving streaming data nature. The effectiveness of our approach is validated theoretically and empirically.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 May 2016 01:18:47 GMT  (287kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09082v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["chenping hou", "zhi-hua zhou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.09082"}
