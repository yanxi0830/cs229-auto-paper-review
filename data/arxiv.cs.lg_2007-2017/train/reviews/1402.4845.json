We configure a network of cooperative agents running adaptive filters and discuss their behaviour when compared with a non-cooperative agent which represents the average of the network. The analysis provides conditions under which diversity in the filter parameters is beneficial in terms of convergence and stability. Simulations drive and support the analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Feb 2014 22:59:14 GMT  (78kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4845v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.MA", "authors": ["jonathan gelati", "sithan kanna"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.4845"}
