State-of-the-art decision-making methods for mHealth rely on some ideal assumptions. Those methods either assume that the users are completely homogenous or completely heterogeneous. However, in reality, a user might be similar with some, but not all, users. In this paper, we propose a novel group-driven reinforcement learning method for the mHealth. We aim to understand how to share information among similar users to better convert the limited user information into sharper learned RL policies. Specifically, we employ the K-means clustering method to group users based on their trajectory information similarity and learn a shared RL policy for each group. Extensive experiment results have shown that our method can achieve clear gains over the state-of-the-art RL methods for mHealth.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Aug 2017 03:58:29 GMT  (64kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04001v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CY", "authors": ["feiyun zhu", "jun guo", "zheng xu", "peng liao", "junzhou huang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.04001"}
