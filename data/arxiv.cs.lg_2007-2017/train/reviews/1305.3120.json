By proposing several algorithmic variants and simple convergence analyses, we make two main contributions. First, we provide a unified viewpoint for several first-order optimization techniques such as accelerated proximal gradient, block coordinate descent, or Frank-Wolfe algorithms. Second, we introduce a new incremental scheme that experimentally matches or outperforms state-of-the-art solvers for large-scale optimization problems typically arising in machine learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 May 2013 11:49:34 GMT  (152kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.3120v1", "to appear in the proceedings of ICML 2013; the arxiv paper contains the 9 pages main text followed by 26 pages of supplemental material.
