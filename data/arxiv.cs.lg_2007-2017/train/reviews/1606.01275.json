Our main results take the form of rather general reductions from our model to algorithms for PAC learning the function class and the distribution class separately, and show that virtually every such combination yields an efficient algorithm in our model. Our methods include a randomized reduction to classification noise that partially resolves an open problem in [RDM06], and an application of the Neyman-Pearson Lemma to obtain robust learning algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Jun 2016 20:56:51 GMT  (171kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01275v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 16 Nov 2016 01:02:06 GMT  (142kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01275v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 9 Jun 2017 15:06:49 GMT  (134kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01275v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["michael kearns", "zhiwei steven wu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.01275"}
