Clustering can be considered as the most important unsupervised learning technique. Most of the clustering methods group data based on distance and few methods cluster data based on similarity. The clustering algorithms classify gene expression data into clusters and the functionally related genes are grouped together in an efficient manner. The groupings are constructed such that the degree of relationship is strong among members of the same cluster and weak among members of different clusters. In this work, we focus on a similarity relationship among genes with similar expression patterns so that a consequential and simple analytical decision can be made from the proposed Fuzzy Soft Rough K-Means algorithm. The algorithm is developed based on Fuzzy Soft sets and Rough sets. Comparative analysis of the proposed work is made with bench mark algorithms like K-Means and Rough K-Means and efficiency of the proposed algorithm is illustrated in this work by using various cluster validity measures such as DB index and Xie-Beni index.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Dec 2012 08:43:05 GMT  (1137kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5359v1", "7 pages, IJSER Vol.3 Issue: 10 Oct 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, IJSER Vol.3 Issue: 10 Oct 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE", "authors": ["k dhanalakshmi", "h hannah inbarani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.5359"}
