Typical examples of such problems have an objective that decomposes into a non-smooth empirical risk part and a non-smooth regularisation penalty. The proposed algorithm, called Semi-Proximal Mirror-Prox, leverages the Fenchel-type representation of one part of the objective while handling the other part of the objective via linear minimization over the domain. The algorithm stands in contrast with more classical proximal gradient algorithms with smoothing, which require the computation of proximal operators at each iteration and can therefore be impractical for high-dimensional problems. We establish the theoretical convergence rate of Semi-Proximal Mirror-Prox, which exhibits the optimal complexity bounds, i.e. $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$, for the number of calls to linear minimization oracle. We present promising experimental results showing the interest of the approach in comparison to competing methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Jul 2015 14:21:21 GMT  (110kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01476v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.OC cs.LG", "authors": ["niao he", "za\u00efd harchaoui"], "accepted": true, "id": "1507.01476"}
