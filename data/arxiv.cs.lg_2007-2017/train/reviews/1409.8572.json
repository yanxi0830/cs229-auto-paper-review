In this sense, we propose to study the freshness of the user's content in CARS through the bandit problem. We introduce in this paper an algorithm named Freshness-Aware Thompson Sampling (FA-TS) that manages the recommendation of fresh document according to the user's risk of the situation. The intensive evaluation and the detailed analysis of the experimental results reveals several important discoveries in the exploration/exploitation (exr/exp) behaviour.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 17:17:52 GMT  (51kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8572v1", "21st International Conference on Neural Information Processing. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1409.7729"]], "COMMENTS": "21st International Conference on Neural Information Processing. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1409.7729", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["djallel bouneffouf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.8572"}
