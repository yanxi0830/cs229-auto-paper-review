With the knowledge of these two parameters, we show that any such algorithm attains an iteration complexity lower bound of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{L/\\epsilon})$ for $L$-smooth convex functions, and $\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{L/\\mu}\\ln(1/\\epsilon))$ for $L$-smooth $\\mu$-strongly convex functions. These lower bounds are stronger than those in the traditional oracle model, as they hold independently of the dimension. To attain these, we abandon the oracle model in favor of a structure-based approach which builds upon a framework recently proposed in (Arjevani et al., 2015). We further show that without knowing the strong convexity parameter, it is impossible to attain an iteration complexity better than $\\tilde{\\Omega}\\left((L/\\mu)\\ln(1/\\epsilon)\\right)$. This result is then used to formalize an observation regarding $L$-smooth convex functions, namely, that the iteration complexity of algorithms employing time-invariant step sizes must be at least $\\Omega(L/\\epsilon)$.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 May 2016 17:30:08 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03529v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.OC cs.LG", "authors": ["yossi arjevani", "ohad shamir"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.03529"}
