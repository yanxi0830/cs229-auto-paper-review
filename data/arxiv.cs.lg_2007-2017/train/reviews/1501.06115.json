However, its good generalization ability is built on large numbers of hidden neurons, which is not beneficial to real time response in the test process. In this paper, we proposed new ways, named \"constrained extreme learning machines\" (CELMs), to randomly select hidden neurons based on sample distribution. Compared to completely random selection of hidden nodes in ELM, the CELMs randomly select hidden nodes from the constrained vector space containing some basic combinations of original sample vectors. The experimental results show that the CELMs have better generalization ability than traditional ELM, SVM and some other related methods. Additionally, the CELMs have a similar fast learning speed as ELM.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 25 Jan 2015 05:11:34 GMT  (623kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06115v1", "14 pages, 6 figure, journel"], ["v2", "Wed, 4 Feb 2015 11:42:01 GMT  (589kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06115v2", "14 pages, 6 figure, journel"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 6 figure, journel", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["wentao zhu", "jun miao", "laiyun qing"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.06115"}
