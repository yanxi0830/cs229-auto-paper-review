We wish to compute the top eigenvector of A in an incremental fashion - with an algorithm that maintains an estimate of the top eigenvector in O(d) space, and incrementally adjusts the estimate with each new data point that arrives. Two classical such schemes are due to Krasulina (1969) and Oja (1983). We give finite-sample convergence rates for both.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Jan 2015 20:08:49 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03796v1", "NIPS 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["akshay balsubramani", "sanjoy dasgupta", "yoav freund"], "accepted": true, "id": "1501.03796"}
