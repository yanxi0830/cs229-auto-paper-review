Distance measure plays a very important rule on the performance of this algorithm. We have different distance measure techniques available. But choosing a proper technique for distance calculation is totally dependent on the type of the data that we are going to cluster. In this paper an experimental study is done in Matlab to cluster the iris and wine data sets with different distance measures and thereby observing the variation of the performances shown.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 May 2014 05:59:26 GMT  (283kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.7471v1", "6 pages, 11 figures, Clustering, K Means"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 11 figures, Clustering, K Means", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["mr dibya jyoti bora", "dr anil kumar gupta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.7471"}
