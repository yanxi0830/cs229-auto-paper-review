The model uses a mixture of random measures (MRM) as a base distribution of the Dirichlet process (DP) of the HDP framework, so we call it the DP-MRM. To model labeled data, we define a DP distributed random measure for each label, and the resulting model generates an unbounded number of topics for each label. We apply DP-MRM on single-labeled and multi-labeled corpora of documents and compare the performance on label prediction with MedLDA, LDA-SVM, and Labeled-LDA. We further enhance the model by incorporating ddCRP and modeling multi-labeled images for image segmentation and object labeling, comparing the performance with nCuts and rddCRP.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:27:40 GMT  (1424kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4658v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["dongwoo kim", "suin kim", "alice h oh"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4658"}
