Indeed, we observed that for adversarial instances originating from a given class, labeling tend to be done into a small subset of (incorrect) classes. Therefore, we argue that an ensemble of specialists should be better able to identify and reject fooling instances, with a high entropy (i.e., disagreement) over the decisions in the presence of adversaries. Experimental results obtained confirm that interpretation, opening a way to make the system more robust to adversarial examples through a rejection mechanism, rather than trying to classify them properly at any cost.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 15:37:50 GMT  (240kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06856v1", "Submitted to ICLR 2017 Workshop Track"], ["v2", "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 05:14:14 GMT  (248kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06856v2", "Submitted to ICLR 2017 Workshop Track"], ["v3", "Fri, 10 Mar 2017 04:10:18 GMT  (230kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06856v3", "Submitted to ICLR 2017 Workshop Track"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to ICLR 2017 Workshop Track", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["mahdieh abbasi", "christian gagn\\'e"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06856"}
