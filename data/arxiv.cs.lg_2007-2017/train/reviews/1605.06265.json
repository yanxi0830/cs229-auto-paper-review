Unlike traditional kernel methods, where the kernel is handcrafted or adapted to data in an unsupervised manner, we learn how to shape the kernel for a supervised prediction problem. We proceed by generalizing convolutional kernel networks, which originally provide unsupervised image representations, and we derive backpropagation rules to optimize model parameters. As a result, we obtain a new type of convolutional neural network with the following properties: (i) at each layer, learning filters is equivalent to optimizing a linear subspace in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), where we project data, (ii) the network may be learned with supervision or without, (iii) the model comes with a natural regularization function (the norm in the RKHS). We show that our method achieves reasonably competitive performance on some standard \"deep learning\" image classification datasets such as CIFAR-10 and SVHN, and also state-of-the-art results for image super-resolution, demonstrating the applicability of our approach to a large variety of image-related tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 May 2016 09:52:14 GMT  (9700kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06265v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 25 Oct 2016 12:52:50 GMT  (9700kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06265v2", "to appear in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["julien mairal"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.06265"}
