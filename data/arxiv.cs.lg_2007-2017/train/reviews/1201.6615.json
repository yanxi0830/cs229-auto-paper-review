Here we consider the Gaussian process based framework GPTD for approximate policy evaluation, and propose feature selection through marginal likelihood optimization of the associated hyperparameters. Our approach has two appealing benefits: (1) given just sample transitions, we can solve the policy evaluation problem fully automatically (without looking at the learning task, and, in theory, independent of the dimensionality of the state space), and (2) model selection allows us to consider more sophisticated kernels, which in turn enable us to identify relevant subspaces and eliminate irrelevant state variables such that we can achieve substantial computational savings and improved prediction performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 Jan 2012 16:57:55 GMT  (397kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.6615v1", "European Conference on Machine Learning (ECML'09)"]], "COMMENTS": "European Conference on Machine Learning (ECML'09)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["tobias jung", "peter stone"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.6615"}
