This paper presents a speed-optimized and cache-friendly implementation for multivariate classification called FastBDT. FastBDT is one order of magnitude faster during the fitting-phase and application-phase, in comparison with popular implementations in software frameworks like TMVA, scikit-learn and XGBoost. The concepts used to optimize the execution time and performance studies are discussed in detail in this paper. The key ideas include: An equal-frequency binning on the input data, which allows replacing expensive floating-point with integer operations, while at the same time increasing the quality of the classification; a cache-friendly linear access pattern to the input data, in contrast to usual implementations, which exhibit a random access pattern. FastBDT provides interfaces to C/C++, Python and TMVA. It is extensively used in the field of high energy physics by the Belle II experiment.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Sep 2016 11:50:52 GMT  (5861kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06119v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["thomas keck"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.06119"}
