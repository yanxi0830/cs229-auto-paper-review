So far, the research efforts have been focused on static graph signals. However numerous applications involve graph signals evolving in time, such as spreading or propagation of waves on a network. The analysis of this type of data requires a new set of methods that fully takes into account the time and graph dimensions. We propose a novel class of wavelet frames named Dynamic Graph Wavelets, whose time-vertex evolution follows a dynamic process. We demonstrate that this set of functions can be combined with sparsity based approaches such as compressive sensing to reveal information on the dynamic processes occurring on a graph. Experiments on real seismological data show the efficiency of the technique, allowing to estimate the epicenter of earthquake events recorded by a seismic network.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Jun 2016 16:48:25 GMT  (615kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06653v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["francesco grassi", "nathanael perraudin", "benjamin ricaud"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06653"}
