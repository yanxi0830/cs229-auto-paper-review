While simple in principle, in many cases the actual implementation of the linear optimization oracle is costly. We show a general method to lazify various conditional gradient algorithms, which in actual computations leads to several orders of magnitude of speedup in wall-clock time. This is achieved by using a faster separation oracle instead of a linear optimization oracle, relying only on few linear optimization oracle calls.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Oct 2016 14:01:25 GMT  (587kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05120v1", "18 pages and 16 pages of computational results"], ["v2", "Fri, 30 Dec 2016 16:53:44 GMT  (4189kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05120v2", "18 pages and 16 pages of computational results"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages and 16 pages of computational results", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["g\u00e1bor braun", "sebastian pokutta", "daniel zink"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.05120"}
