{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-Feb-2014", "title": "Learning the Irreducible Representations of Commutative Lie Groups", "abstract": "We present a new probabilistic model of commutative Lie groups, that produces invariant-equivariant and disentangled representations of data. We borrow a fundamental principle from physics, used to define the elementary particles of a physical system, and use it to give a mathematically precise definition of the popular but heretofore rather vague notion of a \"disentangled representation\". Our model is based on a newfound Bayesian conjugacy relation that enables us to perform fully tractable probabilistic inference over so-called Toroidal Lie groups -- a class that includes practically relevant groups such as rotations and translations of images. We train the model on pairs of transformed image patches, and show that it produces a completely invariant representation which is highly effective for classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Feb 2014 18:47:41 GMT  (129kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4437v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 25 May 2014 12:21:34 GMT  (311kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4437v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["taco cohen", "max welling"], "accepted": true, "id": "1402.4437"}
