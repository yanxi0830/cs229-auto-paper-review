The success of this algorithm relies on two components: prior knowledge acquired through simulation with an intact robot, and Bayesian optimization (BO) that operates on-line, on the damaged robot. While IT&amp;E leads to fast damage recovery, it does not incorporate any safety constraints that prevent the robot from attempting harmful behaviors. In this work, we address this limitation by replacing the BO component with a constrained BO procedure. We evaluate our approach on a simulated damaged humanoid robot that needs to crawl as fast as possible, while performing as few unsafe trials as possible. We compare our new \"safety-aware IT&amp;E\" algorithm to IT&amp;E and a multi-objective version of IT&amp;E in which the safety constraints are dealt as separate objectives. Our results show that our algorithm outperforms the other approaches, both in crawling speed within the safe regions and number of unsafe trials.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 22:56:24 GMT  (1438kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09419v1", "Accepted at the BayesOpt 2016 NIPS workshop, 5 pages, 2 figures, 1 algorithm"], ["v2", "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 23:28:57 GMT  (1429kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09419v2", "Accepted at the BayesOpt 2016 NIPS workshop, 5 pages, 2 figures, 1 algorithm"], ["v3", "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 09:33:07 GMT  (1429kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09419v3", "Accepted at the BayesOpt 2016 NIPS workshop, 5 pages, 2 figures, 1 algorithm"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at the BayesOpt 2016 NIPS workshop, 5 pages, 2 figures, 1 algorithm", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.LG", "authors": ["vaios papaspyros", "konstantinos chatzilygeroudis", "vassilis vassiliades", "jean-baptiste mouret"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.09419"}
