We propose a novel embedding model, \\emph{ITransF}, to perform knowledge base completion. Equipped with a sparse attention mechanism, ITransF discovers hidden concepts of relations and transfer statistical strength through the sharing of concepts. Moreover, the learned associations between relations and concepts, which are represented by sparse attention vectors, can be interpreted easily. We evaluate ITransF on two benchmark datasets---WN18 and FB15k for knowledge base completion and obtains improvements on both the mean rank and Hits@10 metrics, over all baselines that do not use additional information.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Apr 2017 19:35:54 GMT  (869kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05908v1", "ACL 2017"], ["v2", "Wed, 3 May 2017 05:20:09 GMT  (1737kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05908v2", "Accepted by ACL 2017.
