While there is a burgeoning literature on differentially private classification algorithms, we find that they are not practical in real applications due to two reasons. First, existing differentially private classifiers provide poor accuracy on real world datasets. Second, there is no known differentially private algorithm for empirically evaluating the private classifier on a private test dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Nov 2014 03:10:47 GMT  (238kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5428v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 21 Nov 2014 20:41:04 GMT  (238kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5428v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ben stoddard", "yan chen", "ashwin machanavajjhala"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.5428"}
