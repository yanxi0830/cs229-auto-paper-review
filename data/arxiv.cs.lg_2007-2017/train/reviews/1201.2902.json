Many research efforts have been conducted to facilitate the presentation modes used by instructors in classrooms as well as provide means for students to review lectures through web browsers. Other studies have been made to provide acoustical design recommendations for classrooms like room size and reverberation times. However, using acoustical features of classrooms as a way to provide education systems with feedback about the learning process was not thoroughly investigated in any of these studies. We propose a system that extracts different sound features of students and instructors, and then uses machine learning techniques to evaluate the acoustical quality of any learning environment. We infer conclusions about the students' satisfaction with the quality of lectures. Using classifiers instead of surveys and other subjective ways of measures can facilitate and speed such experiments which enables us to perform them continuously. We believe our system enables education systems to continuously review and improve their teaching strategies and acoustical quality of classrooms.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Jan 2012 17:46:17 GMT  (222kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2902v1", "7 pages, technical report"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, technical report", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["marian george", "moustafa youssef"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.2902"}
