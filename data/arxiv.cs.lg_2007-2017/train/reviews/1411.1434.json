While there have been recent results for specific graph classes, these involve fairly extensive technical arguments that are specialized to each specific graph class. In contrast, we isolate two key graph-structural ingredients that can then be used to specify sample complexity lower-bounds. Presence of these structural properties makes the graph class hard to learn. We derive corollaries of our main result that not only recover existing recent results, but also provide lower bounds for novel graph classes not considered previously. We also extend our framework to the random graph setting and derive corollaries for Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'{e}nyi graphs in a certain dense setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Nov 2014 22:28:00 GMT  (39kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1434v1", "21 pages; to appear in NIPS 2014"], ["v2", "Fri, 5 Dec 2014 22:02:55 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1434v2", "21 pages; to appear in NIPS 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages; to appear in NIPS 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["rashish tandon", "karthikeyan shanmugam", "pradeep ravikumar", "alexandros g dimakis"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.1434"}
