Based on arguments from multi-criteria optimization, we identify strategies that are improper for solving these problems and derive a common form of the remaining strategies. We show that some widely used approaches to recognition and learning are improper in this sense. We then propose a generalized formulation of the recognition and learning problem which embraces the whole range of sizes of the learning sample, including the zero size. Learning becomes a special case of recognition without learning. We define the concept of closest to optimal strategy, being a solution to the formulated problem, and describe a technique for finding such a strategy. On several illustrative cases, the strategy is shown to be superior to the widely used learning methods based on maximal likelihood estimation.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Sep 2015 16:23:28 GMT  (595kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08830v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["michail schlesinger", "evgeniy vodolazskiy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.08830"}
