{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-Jun-2016", "title": "Clustering with Same-Cluster Queries", "abstract": "We propose a framework for Semi-Supervised Active Clustering framework (SSAC), where the learner is allowed to interact with a domain expert, asking whether two given instances belong to the same cluster or not. We study the query and computational complexity of clustering in this framework. We consider a setting where the expert conforms to a center-based clustering with a notion of margin. We show that there is a trade off between computational complexity and query complexity; We prove that for the case of $k$-means clustering (i.e., when the expert conforms to a solution of $k$-means), having access to relatively few such queries allows efficient solutions to otherwise NP hard problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 05:28:14 GMT  (22kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02404v1", "Under Review"], ["v2", "Tue, 22 Nov 2016 18:16:44 GMT  (511kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02404v2", "NIPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Under Review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["hassan ashtiani", "shrinu kushagra", "shai ben-david"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.02404"}
