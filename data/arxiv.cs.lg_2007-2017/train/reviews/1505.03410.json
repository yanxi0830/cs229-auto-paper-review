In this paper, we propose new versions of the so-called $\\textit{safe rules}$ for the Lasso. Based on duality gap considerations, our new rules create safe test regions whose diameters converge to zero, provided that one relies on a converging solver. This property helps screening out more variables, for a wider range of regularization parameter values. In addition to faster convergence, we prove that we correctly identify the active sets (supports) of the solutions in finite time. While our proposed strategy can cope with any solver, its performance is demonstrated using a coordinate descent algorithm particularly adapted to machine learning use cases. Significant computing time reductions are obtained with respect to previous safe rules.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 May 2015 14:50:34 GMT  (263kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03410v1", "to appear in ICML 2015"], ["v2", "Tue, 25 Aug 2015 14:52:12 GMT  (263kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03410v2", "to appear in ICML 2015"], ["v3", "Thu, 3 Dec 2015 21:12:34 GMT  (263kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03410v3", "erratum to ICML 2015, \"The authors would like to thanks Jalal Fadili and Jingwei Liang for helping clarifying some misleading statements on the equicorrelation set\""]], "COMMENTS": "to appear in ICML 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG math.OC stat.CO", "authors": ["olivier fercoq", "alexandre gramfort", "joseph salmon"], "accepted": true, "id": "1505.03410"}
