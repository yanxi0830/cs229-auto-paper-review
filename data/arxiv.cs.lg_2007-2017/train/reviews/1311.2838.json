In this work we present a PAC-Bayesian bound on the generalization error in the lifelong learning framework. Our result gives a theoretical justification of how exploring the data from several related tasks makes it possible to automatically learn prior knowledge and how a prior that performs well on sufficiently many tasks guarantees good learning performance on new tasks from the same environment with high probability.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 Nov 2013 17:05:04 GMT  (10kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2838v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 10 May 2014 10:45:51 GMT  (448kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2838v2", "to appear at ICML 2014"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["anastasia pentina", "christoph h lampert"], "accepted": true, "id": "1311.2838"}
