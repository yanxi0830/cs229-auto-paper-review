Mostly, documents are stored as bag-of-words tf-idf representation. One of the most used ways of computing similarity between a pair of documents is cosine similarity between the vector representations, but cosine similarity is not a metric distance measure as it doesn't follow triangle inequality, therefore most metric searching methods can not be applied directly. We propose an efficient method for indexing documents using a pivot tree that leads to efficient retrieval. We also study the relation between precision and efficiency for the proposed method and compare it with a state of the art in the area of document searching based on inner product.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 21 May 2016 19:55:03 GMT  (76kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06693v1", "6 Pages, 2 Figures"]], "COMMENTS": "6 Pages, 2 Figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["gaurav singh", "benjamin piwowarski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.06693"}
