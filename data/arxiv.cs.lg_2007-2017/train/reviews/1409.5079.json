Weather in particular has been an area of keen interest for researchers to develop more accurate and reliable prediction models. This paper presents a set of experiments which involve the use of prevalent machine learning techniques to build models to predict the day of the week given the weather data for that particular day i.e. temperature, wind, rain etc., and test their reliability across four cities in Australia {Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart}. The results provide a comparison of accuracy of these machine learning techniques and their reliability to predict the day of the week by analysing the weather data. We then apply the models to predict weather conditions based on the available data.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Sep 2014 13:09:23 GMT  (772kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5079v1", "7 pages, 2 Result Sets"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 2 Result Sets", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["bilal ahmed"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.5079"}
