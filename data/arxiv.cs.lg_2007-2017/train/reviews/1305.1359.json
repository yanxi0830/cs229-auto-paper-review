The question turns out to be also equivalent to the problem of optimal trade-offs between the regrets of two experts in an \"experts problem\", studied before by \\cite{kearns-regret}. While, say, a regret of $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$ is known, we argue that it important to ask what is the provably optimal algorithm for this problem --- both because it leads to natural algorithms, as well as because regret is in fact often comparable in magnitude to the final payoffs and hence is a non-negligible term.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 May 2013 00:02:51 GMT  (151kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1359v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["alexandr", "oni", "rina panigrahy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.1359"}
