As the application area of technology is increases the size of data also increases. Classification of data becomes difficult because of unbounded size and imbalance nature of data. Class imbalance problem become greatest issue in data mining. Imbalance problem occur where one of the two classes having more sample than other classes. The most of algorithm are more focusing on classification of major sample while ignoring or misclassifying minority sample. The minority samples are those that rarely occur but very important. There are different methods available for classification of imbalance data set which is divided into three main categories, the algorithmic approach, data-preprocessing approach and feature selection approach. Each of this technique has their own advantages and disadvantages. In this paper systematic study of each approach is define which gives the right direction for research in class imbalance problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 May 2013 03:39:17 GMT  (127kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.1707v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["rushi longadge", "snehalata dongre"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.1707"}
