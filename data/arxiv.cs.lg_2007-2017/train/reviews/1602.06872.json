Specifically, we introduce an iterative algorithm that provably computes the projection using few calls to any black-box routine for ridge regression.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Feb 2016 17:52:02 GMT  (304kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06872v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["roy frostig", "cameron musco", "christopher musco", "aaron sidford"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.06872"}
