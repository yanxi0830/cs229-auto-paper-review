In this paper, we propose a feature selection method for multivariate performance measures. The proposed method forms an optimization problem with exponential size of both feature groups and label configurations for a given dataset. To address this problem, a two-layer cutting plane algorithm is proposed. The outer layer performs group feature generation; while the inner layer learns the label configuration for multivariate performance measures. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale and high-dimensional real world datasets show that the proposed method can significantly outperform $l_1$-SVM and SVM-RFE when choosing a small subset of features, and achieve significantly improved performances over SVM$^{perf}$ in terms of $F_1$-score. It also learns a sparse yet effective decision rule for multivariate performance measures.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 5 Mar 2011 07:10:41 GMT  (73kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1013v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 4 May 2013 14:48:06 GMT  (97kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.1013v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["qi mao", "ivor w tsang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1103.1013"}
