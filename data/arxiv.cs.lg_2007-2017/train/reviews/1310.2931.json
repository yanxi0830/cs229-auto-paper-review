Such a feedback loop can occur, for example, when a model that predicts a certain type of behavior ends up causing the behavior it predicts, thus creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. This paper analyzes statistical feedback detection as a causal inference problem, and proposes a local randomization scheme that can be used to detect feedback in real-world problems. We apply our method to a predictive model currently in use at an internet company.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Oct 2013 19:57:45 GMT  (115kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2931v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 1 Nov 2014 01:48:35 GMT  (120kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.2931v2", "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2014"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ME cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["stefan wager", "nick chamandy", "omkar muralidharan", "amir najmi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1310.2931"}
