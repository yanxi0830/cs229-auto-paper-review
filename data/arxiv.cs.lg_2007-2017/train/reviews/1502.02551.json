We study the effect of limited precision data representation and computation on neural network training. Within the context of low-precision fixed-point computations, we observe the rounding scheme to play a crucial role in determining the network's behavior during training. Our results show that deep networks can be trained using only 16-bit wide fixed-point number representation when using stochastic rounding, and incur little to no degradation in the classification accuracy. We also demonstrate an energy-efficient hardware accelerator that implements low-precision fixed-point arithmetic with stochastic rounding.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Feb 2015 16:37:29 GMT  (400kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02551v1", "10 pages, 6 figures, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 6 figures, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML", "authors": ["suyog gupta", "ankur agrawal", "kailash gopalakrishnan", "pritish narayanan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1502.02551"}
