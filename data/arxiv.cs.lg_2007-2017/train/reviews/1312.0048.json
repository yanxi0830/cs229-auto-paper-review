Furthermore, the existing analysis requires the knowledge of optimal classifier for tuning the step size in order to achieve the desired bound. However, this information is usually not accessible in advanced. We also propose a strategy to address the limitation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 30 Nov 2013 01:07:25 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0048v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["rong jin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.0048"}
