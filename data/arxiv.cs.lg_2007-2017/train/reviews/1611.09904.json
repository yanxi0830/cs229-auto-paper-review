We propose a generative adversarial model that works on continuous sequential data, and apply it by training it on a collection of classical music. We conclude that it generates music that sounds better and better as the model is trained, report statistics on generated music, and let the reader judge the quality by downloading the generated songs.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 21:53:09 GMT  (117kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09904v1", "Accepted to Constructive Machine Learning Workshop (CML) at NIPS 2016 in Barcelona, Spain, December 10"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to Constructive Machine Learning Workshop (CML) at NIPS 2016 in Barcelona, Spain, December 10", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["olof mogren"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.09904"}
