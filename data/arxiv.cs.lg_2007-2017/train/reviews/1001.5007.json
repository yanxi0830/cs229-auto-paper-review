Nominal trajectories are determined and learned using data driven methods. Standard procedures are used by air traffic controllers (ATC) to guide aircraft, ensure the safety of the airspace, and to maximize the runway occupancy. Even though standard procedures are used by ATC, the control of the aircraft remains with the pilots, leading to a large variability in the flight patterns observed. Two methods to identify typical operations and their variability from recorded radar tracks are presented. This knowledge base is then used to monitor the conformance of current operations against operations previously identified as standard. A tool called AirTrajectoryMiner is presented, aiming at monitoring the instantaneous health of the airspace, in real time. The airspace is \"healthy\" when all aircraft are flying according to the nominal procedures. A measure of complexity is introduced, measuring the conformance of current flight to nominal flight patterns. When an aircraft does not conform, the complexity increases as more attention from ATC is required to ensure a safe separation between aircraft.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jan 2010 19:24:33 GMT  (2835kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1001.5007v1", "15 pages, 20 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 27 Jan 2010 21:23:03 GMT  (2835kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.5007v2", "15 pages, 20 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 20 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["maxime gariel", "ashok n srivastava", "eric feron"], "accepted": false, "id": "1001.5007"}
