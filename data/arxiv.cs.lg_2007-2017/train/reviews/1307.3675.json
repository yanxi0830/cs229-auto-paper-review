This conception leads to a straightforward complexity analysis of the dynamic programming MERT algorithms of Macherey et al. (2008) and Kumar et al. (2009) and practical approaches to implementation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 13 Jul 2013 19:38:09 GMT  (17kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3675v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["chris dyer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.3675"}
