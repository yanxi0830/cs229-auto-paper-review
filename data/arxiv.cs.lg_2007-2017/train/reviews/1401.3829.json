At a high level, the design of many successful trading agents can be summarized as follows: (i) price prediction: build a model of market prices; and (ii) optimization: solve for an approximately optimal set of bids, given this model. To predict, RoxyBot builds a stochastic model of market prices by simulating simultaneous ascending auctions. To optimize, RoxyBot relies on the sample average approximation method, a stochastic optimization technique.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 04:47:45 GMT  (354kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3829v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.LG", "authors": ["amy greenwald", "seong jae lee", "victor naroditskiy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3829"}
