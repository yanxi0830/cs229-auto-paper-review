New architectures are handcrafted by careful experimentation or modified from a handful of existing networks. We propose a meta-modelling approach based on reinforcement learning to automatically generate high-performing CNN architectures for a given learning task. The learning agent is trained to sequentially choose CNN layers using Q-learning with an $\\epsilon$-greedy exploration strategy and experience replay. The agent explores a large but finite space of possible architectures and iteratively discovers designs with improved performance on the learning task. On image classification benchmarks, the agent-designed networks (consisting of only standard convolution, pooling, and fully-connected layers) beat existing networks designed with the same layer types and are competitive against the state-of-the-art methods that use more complex layer types. We also outperform existing network design meta-modelling approaches on image classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 16:49:43 GMT  (3590kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 20:26:41 GMT  (3711kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 20:08:30 GMT  (3721kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02167v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["bowen baker", "otkrist gupta", "nikhil naik", "ramesh raskar"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.02167"}
