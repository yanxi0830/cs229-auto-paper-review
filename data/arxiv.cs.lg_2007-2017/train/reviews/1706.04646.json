We show that the approach of releasing noisy sufficient statistics using the Laplace mechanism achieves a good trade-off between privacy, utility, and practicality. A naive learning algorithm that uses the noisy sufficient statistics \"as is\" outperforms general-purpose differentially private learning algorithms. However, it has three limitations: it ignores knowledge about the data generating process, rests on uncertain theoretical foundations, and exhibits certain pathologies. We develop a more principled approach that applies the formalism of collective graphical models to perform inference over the true sufficient statistics within an expectation-maximization framework. We show that this learns better models than competing approaches on both synthetic data and on real human mobility data used as a case study.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 19:27:25 GMT  (5623kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04646v1", "Accepted to ICML 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to ICML 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML", "authors": ["garrett bernstein", "ryan mckenna", "tao sun", "daniel sheldon", "michael hay", "gerome miklau"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.04646"}
