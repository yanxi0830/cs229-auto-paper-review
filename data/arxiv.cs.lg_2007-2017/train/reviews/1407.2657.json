The main algorithms for this problem are {\\em{disagreement-based active learning}}, which has a high label requirement, and {\\em{margin-based active learning}}, which only applies to fairly restricted settings. A major challenge is to find an algorithm which achieves better label complexity, is consistent in an agnostic setting, and applies to general classification problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jul 2014 00:34:16 GMT  (26kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2657v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 11 Jul 2014 23:35:49 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2657v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["chicheng zhang", "kamalika chaudhuri"], "accepted": true, "id": "1407.2657"}
