It defines a deep convolution network model, whose contraction properties can be analyzed mathematically. A cascade of wavelet transform convolutions are computed with a multirate filter bank, and adapted with permutations. Unsupervised learning of permutations optimize the contraction directions, by maximizing the average discriminability of training data. For Haar wavelets, it is solved with a polynomial complexity pairing algorithm. Translation and rotation invariance learning is shown with classification experiments on hand-written digits.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Jun 2014 23:51:30 GMT  (29kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2390v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 3 Nov 2014 15:25:16 GMT  (1277kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2390v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["xu chen", "xiuyuan cheng", "st\u00e9phane mallat"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.2390"}
