Recurrent Neural Networks have recently been shown to perform very well in session-based settings. While in many session-based recommendation domains user identifiers are hard to come by, there are also domains in which user profiles are readily available. We propose a seamless way to personalize RNN models with cross-session information transfer and devise a hierarchical RNN model that relies end evolves latent hidden states of the RNN's across user sessions. Results on two industry datasets show large improvements over the session-only RNN's.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 16:33:52 GMT  (422kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04148v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 08:02:51 GMT  (422kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04148v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 8 Jul 2017 16:52:18 GMT  (358kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04148v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 14 Jul 2017 16:42:43 GMT  (941kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04148v4", null], ["v5", "Wed, 23 Aug 2017 18:42:56 GMT  (942kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04148v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.HC cs.IR", "authors": ["massimo quadrana", "alexandros karatzoglou", "bal\\'azs hidasi", "paolo cremonesi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.04148"}
