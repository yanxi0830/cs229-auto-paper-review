Each agent operates independently by performing a Markovian random walk on a suitable weighted graph representation of the input dataset. Such a weighted graph representation is induced by the specific parameter configuration of the dissimilarity measure adopted by the agent, which searches and takes decisions autonomously for one cluster at a time. Results show that the algorithm is able to discover parameter configurations that yield a consistent and interpretable collection of clusters. Moreover, we demonstrate that our algorithm shows comparable performances with other similar state-of-the-art algorithms when facing specific clustering problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Sep 2014 14:39:37 GMT  (1014kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4988v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DC cs.MA", "authors": ["filippo maria bianchi", "enrico maiorino", "lorenzo livi", "antonello rizzi", "alireza sadeghian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.4988"}
