This paper presents a Bayesian probabilistic approach that incorporates various kinds of node attributes encoded in binary form in relational models with Poisson likelihood. Our method works flexibly with both directed and undirected relational networks. The inference can be done by efficient Gibbs sampling which leverages sparsity of both networks and node attributes. Extensive experiments show that our models achieve the state-of-the-art link prediction results, especially with highly incomplete relational data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 00:37:07 GMT  (1352kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04289v1", "Appearing in ICML 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Appearing in ICML 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG cs.SI", "authors": ["he zhao", "lan du", "wray l buntine"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.04289"}
