Specifically, we propose a framework for defining the goodness of a (dis)similarity function with respect to a given learning task and propose algorithms that have guaranteed generalization properties when working with such good functions. Our framework unifies and generalizes the frameworks proposed by [Balcan-Blum ICML 2006] and [Wang et al ICML 2007]. An attractive feature of our framework is its adaptability to data - we do not promote a fixed notion of goodness but rather let data dictate it. We show, by giving theoretical guarantees that the goodness criterion best suited to a problem can itself be learned which makes our approach applicable to a variety of domains and problems. We propose a landmarking-based approach to obtaining a classifier from such learned goodness criteria. We then provide a novel diversity based heuristic to perform task-driven selection of landmark points instead of random selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our goodness criteria learning method as well as the landmark selection heuristic on a variety of similarity-based learning datasets and benchmark UCI datasets on which our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Dec 2011 18:08:27 GMT  (113kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.5404v1", "To appear in the proceedings of NIPS 2011, 14 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in the proceedings of NIPS 2011, 14 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["purushottam kar", "prateek jain 0002"], "accepted": true, "id": "1112.5404"}
