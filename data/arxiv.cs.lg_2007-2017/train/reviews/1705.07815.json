In this work, we describe a minimax framework for statistical learning with ambiguity sets given by balls in Wasserstein space. In particular, we prove a generalization bound that involves the covering number properties of the original ERM problem. As an illustrative example, we provide generalization guarantees for domain adaptation problems where the Wasserstein distance between the source and target domain distributions can be reliably estimated from unlabeled samples.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 May 2017 15:50:47 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07815v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jaeho lee", "maxim raginsky"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07815"}
