Previous neural network models often suffer from irrelevant information introduced when subjects and objects are in a long distance. In this paper, we propose to learn more robust relation representations from the shortest dependency path through a convolution neural network. We further propose a straightforward negative sampling strategy to improve the assignment of subjects and objects. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Jun 2015 07:51:55 GMT  (136kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07650v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["kun xu", "yansong feng", "songfang huang", "dongyan zhao"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.07650"}
