PilotNet is trained using road images paired with the steering angles generated by a human driving a data-collection car. It derives the necessary domain knowledge by observing human drivers. This eliminates the need for human engineers to anticipate what is important in an image and foresee all the necessary rules for safe driving. Road tests demonstrated that PilotNet can successfully perform lane keeping in a wide variety of driving conditions, regardless of whether lane markings are present or not.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 21:25:41 GMT  (3943kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07911v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE cs.RO", "authors": ["mariusz bojarski", "philip yeres", "anna choromanska", "krzysztof choromanski", "bernhard firner", "lawrence jackel", "urs muller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.07911"}
