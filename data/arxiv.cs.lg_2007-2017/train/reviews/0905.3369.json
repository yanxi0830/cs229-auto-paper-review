We provide theory showing this new approach is consistent for models with long range structure, and apply the approach to motion capture and high-dimensional video data, yielding results superior to standard alternatives.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 May 2009 18:08:18 GMT  (223kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3369v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 3 Jun 2009 20:29:16 GMT  (223kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.3369v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["john langford", "ruslan salakhutdinov", "tong zhang 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "0905.3369"}
