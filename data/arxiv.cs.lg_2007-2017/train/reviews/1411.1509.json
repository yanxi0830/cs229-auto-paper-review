In this paper, we present for the first time a place recognition technique based on CNN models, by combining the powerful features learnt by CNNs with a spatial and sequential filter. Applying the system to a 70 km benchmark place recognition dataset we achieve a 75% increase in recall at 100% precision, significantly outperforming all previous state of the art techniques. We also conduct a comprehensive performance comparison of the utility of features from all 21 layers for place recognition, both for the benchmark dataset and for a second dataset with more significant viewpoint changes.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Nov 2014 07:03:15 GMT  (1436kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1509v1", "8 pages, 11 figures, this paper has been accepted by 2014 Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA 2014) to be held in University of Melbourne, Dec 2~4"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 11 figures, this paper has been accepted by 2014 Australasian Conference on Robotics and Automation (ACRA 2014) to be held in University of Melbourne, Dec 2~4", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["zetao chen", "obadiah lam", "adam jacobson", "michael milford"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.1509"}
