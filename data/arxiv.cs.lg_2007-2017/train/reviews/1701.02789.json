There is a fixed total budget for sampling under various interventions. Also, there are cost constraints on different types of interventions. We pose this as a best arm identification problem with $K$ arms, where each arm is a soft intervention at $V$. The key difference from the classical setting is that there is information leakage among the arms. Each soft intervention is a distinct known conditional probability distribution between $V$ and its parents $pa(V)$.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 Jan 2017 21:26:03 GMT  (5604kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02789v1", "33 pages, 7 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Mar 2017 01:19:33 GMT  (3267kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02789v2", "30 pages, 11 figures"], ["v3", "Thu, 9 Mar 2017 22:50:38 GMT  (3277kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02789v3", "30 pages, 11 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "33 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "authors": ["rajat sen", "karthikeyan shanmugam", "alexandros g dimakis", "sanjay shakkottai"], "accepted": true, "id": "1701.02789"}
