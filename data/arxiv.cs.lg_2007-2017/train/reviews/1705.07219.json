Adjacency of the examples is inferred using the predictions of a neural network model which is first initialized by a supervised pretraining. These predictions are then updated according to a novel unsupervised objective which regularizes another adjacency, now linking the output nodes. Regularizing the adjacency of the output nodes, inferred from the predictions of the network, creates an easier optimization problem and ultimately provides that the predictions of the network turn into the optimal embedding. Ultimately, the proposed framework provides an effective and scalable graph-based solution which is natural to the operational mechanism of deep neural networks. Our results show state-of-the-art performance within semi-supervised learning with the highest accuracies reported to date in the literature for SVHN and NORB datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 May 2017 23:02:58 GMT  (649kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07219v1", "Submitted to 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017)"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ozsel kilinc", "ismail uysal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07219"}
