In this approach, the unknown low-rank matrix is expressed as the product of two much smaller matrices so that the low-rank property is automatically fulfilled. The resulting optimization problem, even with huge size, can be solved (to stationary points) very efficiently through standard optimization algorithms such as alternating minimization and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). However, due to the non-convexity caused by the factorization model, there is a limited theoretical understanding of whether these algorithms will generate a good solution. In this paper, we establish a theoretical guarantee for the factorization based formulation to correctly recover the underlying low-rank matrix. In particular, we show that under similar conditions to those in previous works, many standard optimization algorithms converge to the global optima of the factorization based formulation, thus recovering the true low-rank matrix. To the best of our knowledge, our result is the first one that provides recovery guarantee for many standard algorithms such as gradient descent, SGD and block coordinate gradient descent. Our result also applies to alternating minimization, and a notable difference from previous studies on alternating minimization is that we do not need the resampling scheme (i.e. using independent samples in each iteration).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Nov 2014 20:52:47 GMT  (353kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.8003v1", "65 pages, 6 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 29 May 2015 22:31:49 GMT  (289kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.8003v2", "76 pages, 6 figures, a linear convergence result added, extended discussion on resampling"], ["v3", "Tue, 11 Oct 2016 17:35:12 GMT  (714kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.8003v3", "77 pages.
