We begin by relating this task to the more standard class prediction problem, showing that, given an arbitrary algorithm for class prediction, we can construct an algorithm for similarity prediction with \"nearly\" the same mistake bound, and vice versa. After noticing that this general construction is computationally infeasible, we target our study to {\\em feasible} similarity prediction algorithms on networked data. We initially assume that the network structure is {\\em known} to the learner. Here we observe that Matrix Winnow \\citep{w07} has a near-optimal mistake guarantee, at the price of cubic prediction time per round. This motivates our effort for an efficient implementation of a Perceptron algorithm with a weaker mistake guarantee but with only poly-logarithmic prediction time. Our focus then turns to the challenging case of networks whose structure is initially {\\em unknown} to the learner. In this novel setting, where the network structure is only incrementally revealed, we obtain a mistake-bounded algorithm with a quadratic prediction time per round.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 28 Feb 2013 17:15:55 GMT  (2207kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.7263v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 1 Mar 2013 16:57:09 GMT  (2206kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.7263v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 15 Mar 2013 12:52:33 GMT  (1919kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.7263v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["claudio gentile", "mark herbster", "stephen pasteris"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.7263"}
