The MSTRNN has been developed by newly introducing recurrent connectivity to a prior-proposed model, multiple spatio-temporal scales neural network (MSTNN) [1] such that the model can learn to extract latent spatio-temporal structures more effectively by developing adequate recurrent contextual dynamics. The MSTRNN was evaluated by conducting a set of simulation experiments on learning to categorize human action visual patterns. The first experiment on categorizing a set of long-concatenated human movement patterns showed that MSTRNN outperforms MSTNN in the capability of learning to extract long-ranged correlation in video image. The second experiment on categorizing a set of object-directed actions showed that the MSTRNN can learn to extract structural relationship between actions and directed-objects. Our analysis on the characteristics of miscategorization in both cases of object-directed action and pantomime actions indicated that the model network developed the categorical memories by organizing relational structure among them. Development of such relational structure is considered to be beneficial for gaining generalization in categorization.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Feb 2016 04:00:16 GMT  (627kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01921v1", "20 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables"], ["v2", "Wed, 5 Oct 2016 07:59:03 GMT  (3953kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01921v2", "18 pages, 7 figures, 6 tables"], ["v3", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 16:33:49 GMT  (1882kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01921v3", "10 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["haanvid lee", "minju jung", "jun tani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.01921"}
