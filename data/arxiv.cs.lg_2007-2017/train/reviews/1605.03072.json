The algorithm is based on assigning class probabilities to unlabeled data. The approach will use Hilber-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to find a mapping which takes the data to a lower dimensional space. We call this algorithm SSRL-PL. Use of unlabeled data for learning is not always beneficial and there is no algorithm which deterministically guarantee the improvement of the performance by using unlabeled data. Therefore, we also propose a bound on the performance of the algorithm which can be used to determine the effectiveness of using the structure of unlabeled data in the algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 May 2016 15:57:18 GMT  (218kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03072v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 22 Aug 2016 21:27:06 GMT  (218kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03072v2", "9 pages, 7 figures"], ["v3", "Thu, 15 Sep 2016 19:44:51 GMT  (211kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03072v3", "8 pages, 7 figures"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ershad banijamali", "ali ghodsi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.03072"}
