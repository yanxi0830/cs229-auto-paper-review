Examples of labels include interventions, changes in activity (e.g. sleep) and changes in physiology (e.g. arrhythmias). However, automated algorithms tend to be unreliable resulting in lower quality care. Expert annotations are scarce, expensive, and prone to significant inter- and intra-observer variance. To address these problems, a Bayesian Continuous-valued Label Aggregator(BCLA) is proposed to provide a reliable estimation of label aggregation while accurately infer the precision and bias of each algorithm. The BCLA was applied to QT interval (pro-arrhythmic indicator) estimation from the electrocardiogram using labels from the 2006 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge database. It was compared to the mean, median, and a previously proposed Expectation Maximization (EM) label aggregation approaches. While accurately predicting each labelling algorithm's bias and precision, the root-mean-square error of the BCLA was 11.78$\\pm$0.63ms, significantly outperforming the best Challenge entry (15.37$\\pm$2.13ms) as well as the EM, mean, and median voting strategies (14.76$\\pm$0.52ms, 17.61$\\pm$0.55ms, and 14.43$\\pm$0.57ms respectively with $p&lt;0.0001$).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Mar 2015 12:31:18 GMT  (221kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06619v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 13 Jun 2015 13:06:29 GMT  (211kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06619v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["tingting zhu", "nic dunkley", "joachim behar", "david a clifton", "gari d clifford"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.06619"}
