Lipschitz continuity is a strong form of continuity that linearly bounds the variations of a function. In this paper, we derive tight Lipschitz constants for two families of metrics: Mahalanobis distances and bounded-space bilinear forms. To our knowledge, this is the first time the Mahalanobis distance is formally proved to be Lipschitz continuous and that such tight Lipschitz constants are derived.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Apr 2016 12:39:26 GMT  (8kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01376v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NA cs.LG", "authors": ["valentina zantedeschi", "r\\'emi emonet", "marc sebban"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.01376"}
