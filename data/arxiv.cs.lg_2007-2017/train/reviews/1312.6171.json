In this way, the system develops a kind of supervised classification model meant to simulate aspects of human associative memory. The system uses a deep learning architecture (DLA) composed of two input/output channels formed from stacked Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) and an associative memory network that combines the two channels. The DLA is trained on pairs of MNIST handwritten digit images to develop hierarchical features and associative representations that are able to reconstruct one image given its paired-associate. Experiments show that the multi-modal learning system generates models that are as accurate as back-propagation networks but with the advantage of unsupervised learning from either paired or non-paired training examples.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 23:07:25 GMT  (320kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6171v1", "9 pages, for ICLR-2014"], ["v2", "Fri, 10 Jan 2014 23:19:26 GMT  (336kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6171v2", "9 pages, for ICLR-2014"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, for ICLR-2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["ti wang", "daniel l silver"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6171"}
