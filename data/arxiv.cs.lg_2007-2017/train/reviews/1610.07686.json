We show that co-occuring directions achieves a better error bound for AMM than other randomized and deterministic approaches for AMM. Co-occurring directions gives a $1 + \\epsilon$ -approximation of the optimal low rank approximation of a matrix product. Empirically our algorithm outperforms competing methods for AMM, for a small sketch size. We validate empirically our theoretical findings and algorithms", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Oct 2016 00:01:33 GMT  (429kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07686v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["youssef mroueh", "etienne marcheret", "vaibhava goel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.07686"}
