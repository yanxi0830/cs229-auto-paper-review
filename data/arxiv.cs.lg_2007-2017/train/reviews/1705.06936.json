However, given the fact that deep reinforcement learning often deals with interpreting visual information, a large part of the train and inference time is spent performing convolutions. In this work we present our results on learning strategies in Atari games using a Convolutional Neural Network, the Math Kernel Library and TensorFlow 0.11rc0 machine learning framework. We also analyze effects of asynchronous computations on the convergence of reinforcement learning algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 May 2017 11:19:45 GMT  (1399kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06936v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["robert adamski", "tomasz grel", "maciej klimek", "henryk michalewski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.06936"}
