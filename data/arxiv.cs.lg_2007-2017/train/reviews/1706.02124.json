We present the recurrent ladder network, a novel modification of the ladder network, for semi-supervised learning of recurrent neural networks which we evaluate with a phoneme recognition task on the TIMIT corpus. Our results show that the model is able to consistently outperform the baseline and achieve fully-supervised baseline performance with only 75% of all labels which demonstrates that the model is capable of using unsupervised data as an effective regulariser.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Jun 2017 10:50:47 GMT  (403kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02124v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 18:49:26 GMT  (403kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02124v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["marian tietz", "tayfun alpay", "johannes twiefel", "stefan wermter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02124"}
