It is well known that $\\ell^{1}$-norm used in $\\ell^{1}$-graph is a convex relaxation of $\\ell^{0}$-norm for enforcing the sparsity. In order to handle general cases when the subspaces are not independent and follow the original principle of sparse representation, we propose a novel $\\ell^{0}$-graph that employs $\\ell^{0}$-norm to encourage the sparsity of the constructed graph, and develop a proximal method to solve the associated optimization problem with the proved guarantee of convergence. Extensive experimental results on various data sets demonstrate the superiority of $\\ell^{0}$-graph compared to other competing clustering methods including $\\ell^{1}$-graph.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Oct 2015 22:48:09 GMT  (233kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08520v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 07:11:42 GMT  (233kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08520v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["yingzhen yang", "jiashi feng", "jianchao yang", "thomas s huang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.08520"}
