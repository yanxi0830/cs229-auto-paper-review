At each iteration, PPES aims to select a batch of points which will maximize the information gain about the global maximizer of the objective. Well known strategies exist for suggesting a single evaluation point based on previous observations, while far fewer are known for selecting batches of points to evaluate in parallel. The few batch selection schemes that have been studied all resort to greedy methods to compute an optimal batch. To the best of our knowledge, PPES is the first non-greedy batch Bayesian optimization strategy. We demonstrate the benefit of this approach in optimization performance on both synthetic and real world applications, including problems in machine learning, rocket science and robotics.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Nov 2015 08:21:17 GMT  (311kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07130v1", "12 pages in Neural Information Processing Systems 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages in Neural Information Processing Systems 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["amar shah", "zoubin ghahramani"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.07130"}
