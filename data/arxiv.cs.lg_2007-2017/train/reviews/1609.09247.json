However, there still lacks a systematic study on how to train statistical models with partial annotation (PA). Taking dependency parsing as our case study, this paper describes and compares two straightforward approaches for three mainstream dependency parsers. The first approach is previously proposed to directly train a log-linear graph-based parser (LLGPar) with PA based on a forest-based objective. This work for the first time proposes the second approach to directly training a linear graph-based parse (LGPar) and a linear transition-based parser (LTPar) with PA based on the idea of constrained decoding. We conduct extensive experiments on Penn Treebank under three different settings for simulating PA, i.e., random dependencies, most uncertain dependencies, and dependencies with divergent outputs from the three parsers. The results show that LLGPar is most effective in learning from PA and LTPar lags behind the graph-based counterparts by large margin. Moreover, LGPar and LTPar can achieve best performance by using LLGPar to complete PA into full annotation (FA).", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 08:12:14 GMT  (178kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09247v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["zhenghua li", "yue zhang", "jiayuan chao", "min zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.09247"}
