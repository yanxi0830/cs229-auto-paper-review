Simple non-convex optimization algorithms are popular and effective in practice. Despite recent progress in proving various non-convex algorithms converge from a good initial point, it remains unclear why random or arbitrary initialization suffices in practice. We prove that the commonly used non-convex objective function for matrix completion has no spurious local minima -- all local minima must also be global. Therefore, many popular optimization algorithms such as (stochastic) gradient descent can provably solve matrix completion with \\textit{arbitrary} initialization in polynomial time.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 May 2016 02:53:27 GMT  (440kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07272v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 16 Sep 2016 19:58:48 GMT  (451kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07272v2", "to appear in NIPS 2016 (with oral). added a section that explains the intuition of the proof"], ["v3", "Sun, 29 Jan 2017 18:45:48 GMT  (457kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07272v3", "NIPS'16 best student paper. added references and fixed typos"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS stat.ML", "authors": ["rong ge 0001", "jason d lee", "tengyu ma"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.07272"}
