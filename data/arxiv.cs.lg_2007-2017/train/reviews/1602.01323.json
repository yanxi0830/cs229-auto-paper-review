We introduce non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as a simple, unsupervised, and efficient way to cluster large numbers of manuscripts and readings simultaneously while summarizing contamination using an easy-to-interpret mixture model. We apply this method to an extensive collation of the New Testament epistle of Jude and show that the resulting clusters correspond to human-identified textual families from existing research.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 Feb 2016 14:54:05 GMT  (193kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01323v1", "31 pages, 2 figures, 42 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "31 pages, 2 figures, 42 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["joey mccollum", "stephen brown"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.01323"}
