This problem has been used as a sub-routine in many privacy-preserving algorithms for statistics and machine-learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 7 Sep 2014 23:51:00 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2177v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.TH", "authors": ["kamalika chaudhuri", "daniel j hsu", "shuang song"], "accepted": true, "id": "1409.2177"}
