Recently several subspace learning methods have proposed adaptive solutions in the unsupervised case, where no labeled data are available for the target. Most of the attention has been dedicated to searching a new low-dimensional domain-invariant representation, leaving the definition of the prediction function to a second stage. Here we propose to learn both jointly. Specifically we learn the source subspace that best matches the target subspace while at the same time minimizing a regularized misclassification loss. We provide an alternating optimization technique based on stochastic sub-gradient descent to solve the learning problem and we demonstrate its performance on several domain adaptation tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Nov 2014 14:29:35 GMT  (1963kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4491v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 18 Nov 2014 15:55:50 GMT  (1963kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4491v2", "Paper is under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters"], ["v3", "Wed, 29 Apr 2015 02:51:00 GMT  (1980kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4491v3", "Paper is under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["basura fernando", "tatiana tommasi", "tinne tuytelaars"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.4491"}
