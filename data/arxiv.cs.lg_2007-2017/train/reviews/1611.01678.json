Neural network is one of the techniques which are widely used for diagnosis in medical field. In this article efficiency of nine algorithms, which are basis of neural network learning in diagnosing cardiovascular diseases, will be assessed. Algorithms are assessed in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, transparency, AROC and convergence rate by means of 10 fold cross validation. The results suggest that in training phase, Lonberg-M algorithm has the best efficiency in terms of all metrics, algorithm OSS has maximum accuracy in testing phase, algorithm SCG has the maximum transparency and algorithm CGB has the maximum sensitivity.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 5 Nov 2016 17:17:14 GMT  (527kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01678v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["mirmorsal madani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01678"}
