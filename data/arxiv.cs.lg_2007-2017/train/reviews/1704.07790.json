Classical LDA for EHR data classification, however, suffers from two handicaps: the ill-posed estimation of LDA parameters (e.g., covariance matrix), and the \"linear inseparability\" of EHR data. To handle these two issues, in this paper, we propose a novel classifier FWDA -- Fast Wishart Discriminant Analysis, that makes predictions in an ensemble way. Specifically, FWDA first surrogates the distribution of inverse covariance matrices using a Wishart distribution estimated from the training data, then \"weighted-averages\" the classification results of multiple LDA classifiers parameterized by the sampled inverse covariance matrices via a Bayesian Voting scheme. The weights for voting are optimally updated to adapt each new input data, so as to enable the nonlinear classification. Theoretical analysis indicates that FWDA possesses a fast convergence rate and a robust performance on high dimensional data. Extensive experiments on large-scale EHR dataset show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms by a large margin.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 17:11:57 GMT  (260kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07790v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["haoyi xiong", "wei cheng", "wenqing hu", "jiang bian", "zhishan guo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.07790"}
