Speech features that are commonly used in speech emotion recognition rely on global utterance level prosodic features. In our work, we evaluate the impact of frame level feature extraction. The speech samples are from Berlin emotional database and the features extracted from these utterances are energy, different variant of mel frequency cepstrum coefficients, velocity and acceleration features.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Jun 2014 22:21:17 GMT  (427kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6101v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["imen trabelsi", "dorra ben ayed", "noureddine ellouze"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.6101"}
