In this work, we study a flexible model for pairwise comparisons, under which the probabilities of outcomes are required only to satisfy a natural form of stochastic transitivity. This class includes several parametric models including the BTL and Thurstone models as special cases, but is considerably more general. We provide various examples of models in this broader stochastically transitive class for which classical parametric models provide poor fits. Despite this greater flexibility, we show that the matrix of probabilities can be estimated at the same rate as in standard parametric models. On the other hand, unlike in the BTL and Thurstone models, computing the least-squares estimate in the stochastically transitive model is non-trivial, and we explore various computationally tractable alternatives. We show that a simple singular value thresholding algorithm is statistically consistent but does not achieve the minimax rate. We then propose and study algorithms that achieve the minimax rate over interesting sub-classes of the full stochastically transitive class. We complement our theoretical results with thorough numerical simulations.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Oct 2015 18:19:16 GMT  (166kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05610v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 21 Oct 2015 17:54:49 GMT  (171kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05610v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 25 May 2016 18:41:40 GMT  (179kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05610v3", null], ["v4", "Wed, 28 Sep 2016 02:14:25 GMT  (232kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05610v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "authors": ["nihar b shah", "sivaraman balakrishnan", "aditya guntuboyina", "martin j wainwright"], "accepted": true, "id": "1510.05610"}
