AIS-INMACA has created good impact on solving major problems in bioinformatics like protein region identification and promoter region prediction with less time (Pokkuluri Kiran Sree, 2014). This AIS-INMACA is now came with several variations (Pokkuluri Kiran Sree, 2014) towards projecting it as a tool in bioinformatics for solving many problems in bioinformatics. So this paper will be very much useful for so many researchers who are working in the domain of bioinformatics with cellular automata.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Mar 2014 03:46:38 GMT  (229kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1336v1", "5 Pages, Review of Bioinformatics and Biometrics (RBB) Volume 3 Issue 1, March 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "5 Pages, Review of Bioinformatics and Biometrics (RBB) Volume 3 Issue 1, March 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CE cs.LG", "authors": ["pokkuluri kiran sree", "inampudi ramesh babu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1403.1336"}
