This system shows how we combine research in personalized recommendation systems with research in dialogue systems to build a virtual sales agent. Based on new deep learning technologies we developed, the virtual agent is capable of learning how to interact with users, how to answer user questions, what is the next question to ask, and what to recommend when chatting with a human user.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Sep 2016 05:46:49 GMT  (491kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01546v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["yueming sun", "yi zhang", "yunfei chen", "roger jin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01546"}
