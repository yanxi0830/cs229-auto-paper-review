CPT works by distorting probabilities and is more general than the classic expected utility and coherent risk measures. We bring this idea to a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) setting and design algorithms for both estimation and control. The estimation scheme that we propose uses the empirical distribution in order to estimate the CPT-value of a random variable. We then use this scheme in the inner loop of policy optimization procedures for a Markov decision process (MDP). We propose both gradient-based as well as gradient-free policy optimization algorithms. The former includes both first-order and second-order methods that are based on the well-known simulation optimization idea of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA), while the latter is based on a reference distribution that concentrates on the global optima. Using an empirical distribution over the policy space in conjunction with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the reference distribution, we get a global policy optimization scheme. We provide theoretical convergence guarantees for all the proposed algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 19:37:55 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02632v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 20 Sep 2015 04:19:53 GMT  (46kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02632v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 26 Feb 2016 21:30:04 GMT  (79kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02632v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.OC", "authors": ["prashanth l a", "cheng jie", "michael c fu", "steven i marcus", "csaba szepesv\u00e1ri"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.02632"}
