However, there are many applications such as smart surveillance cameras that require or would benefit from on-site processing. To this end, we propose and evaluate a novel algorithm for change-based evaluation of CNNs for video data recorded with a static camera setting, exploiting the spatio-temporal sparsity of pixel changes. We achieve an average speed-up of 8.6x over a cuDNN baseline on a realistic benchmark with a negligible accuracy loss of less than 0.1% and no retraining of the network. The resulting energy efficiency is 10x higher than per-frame evaluation and reaches an equivalent of 328 GOp/s/W on the Tegra X1 platform.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Apr 2017 00:36:55 GMT  (2331kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04313v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 21 Jun 2017 09:27:14 GMT  (2333kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04313v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.PF", "authors": ["lukas cavigelli", "philippe degen", "luca benini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.04313"}
