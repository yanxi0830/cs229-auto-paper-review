Based on this, we develop an algorithm which learns semi-deterministic transducers given access to translation queries. We also prove that there is no learning algorithm for semi-deterministic transducers that uses only domain knowledge.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 10 May 2014 22:30:38 GMT  (22kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2476v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 19 May 2014 08:47:45 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2476v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 14 Apr 2015 16:45:05 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2476v3", "A shorter version has been published in the proceedings of ICGI 2014"], ["v4", "Mon, 10 Oct 2016 20:56:01 GMT  (33kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.2476v4", "A shorter version has been published in the proceedings of ICGI 2014.
