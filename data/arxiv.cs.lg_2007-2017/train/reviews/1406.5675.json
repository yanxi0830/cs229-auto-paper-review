To tackle the computational challenge, the Nystr\\\"om method has been extensively used to reduce time and space complexities by sacrificing some accuracy. The Nystr\\\"om method speedups computation by constructing an approximation of the kernel matrix in question using only a few columns of the matrix. Recently, a variant of the Nystr\\\"om method called the modified Nystr\\\"om method has demonstrated significant improvement over the standard Nystr\\\"om method in approximation accuracy, both theoretically and empirically.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 Jun 2014 05:02:06 GMT  (257kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5675v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 15 Jan 2015 10:05:36 GMT  (533kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5675v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 28 Mar 2015 07:43:49 GMT  (543kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5675v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 11 Oct 2015 08:49:11 GMT  (814kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5675v4", null], ["v5", "Sun, 20 Dec 2015 09:47:37 GMT  (888kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5675v5", null], ["v6", "Fri, 20 May 2016 06:32:12 GMT  (348kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5675v6", "Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["shusen wang", "luo luo", "zhihua zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.5675"}
