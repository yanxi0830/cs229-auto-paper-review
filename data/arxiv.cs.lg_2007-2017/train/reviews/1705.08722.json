Therefore, the classifier should be prepared for unseen classes. When an instance of an unseen class appears in the prediction stage, a robust classifier should have the ability to tell it is unseen, instead of classifying it to be any known category. In this paper, adopting the idea of adversarial learning, we propose the ASG framework for open-category classification. ASG generates positive and negative samples of seen categories in the unsupervised manner via an adversarial learning strategy. With the generated samples, ASG then learns to tell seen from unseen in the supervised manner. Experiments performed on several datasets show the effectiveness of ASG.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 May 2017 12:27:06 GMT  (473kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08722v1", "Published in IJCAI 2017"], ["v2", "Sat, 17 Jun 2017 09:08:34 GMT  (473kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08722v2", "Published in IJCAI 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Published in IJCAI 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yang yu", "wei-yang qu", "nan li", "zimin guo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.08722"}
