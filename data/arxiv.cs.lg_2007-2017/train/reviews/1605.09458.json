In this paper,via dropping the task-irrelevant input variables the performance of auto-encoders can be obviously improved .Specifically, an importance-based variable selection method is proposed to aim at finding the task-irrelevant input variables and dropping them.It firstly estimates importance of each variable,and then drops the variables with importance value lower than a threshold. In order to obtain better performance, the method can be employed for each layer of stacked auto-encoders. Experimental results show that when combined with our method the stacked denoising auto-encoders achieves significantly improved performance on three challenging datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 May 2016 00:58:47 GMT  (324kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09458v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hui shen", "dehua li", "hong wu", "zhaoxiang zang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.09458"}
