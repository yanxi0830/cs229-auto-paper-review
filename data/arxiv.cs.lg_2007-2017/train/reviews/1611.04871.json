Strongly labeled data can be simply understood as fully supervised data where all labeled instances are available. In weakly supervised learning only weak labels are available. Our proposed framework is motivated by the fact that a small amount of strongly labeled data can give considerable improvement over only weakly supervised learning. The primary problem domain focus of this paper is acoustic event and scene detection in audio recordings. We first propose a naive formulation for leveraging labeled data in both forms. We then propose a more general framework for Supervised and Weakly Supervised Learning (SWSL). Based on this general framework, we propose a graph based approach for SWSL. Our main method is based on manifold regularization on graphs in which we show that the unified learning can be formulated as a constraint optimization problem which can be solved by iterative concave-convex procedure (CCCP). Our experiments show that our proposed framework can address several concerns of audio content analysis using weakly labeled data.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 12 Nov 2016 07:39:50 GMT  (103kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04871v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 23 Nov 2016 23:17:46 GMT  (103kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04871v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 18 Feb 2017 07:18:32 GMT  (103kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04871v3", "IJCNN 2017, 8 pages"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.SD", "authors": ["anurag kumar", "bhiksha raj"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04871"}
