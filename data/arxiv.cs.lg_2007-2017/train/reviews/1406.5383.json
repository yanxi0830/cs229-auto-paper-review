The algorithm has the capacity of adapting to unknown level of label noise in the underlying distribution, making it suitable for model selection under the active learning setting. Compared to other alternative agnostic active learning algorithms, our proposed method is much simpler and achieves the optimal convergence rate in query budget T and data dimension d, if logarithm factors are ignored. Furthermore, our algorithm can handle classification loss functions other than the 0-1 loss, such as hinge and logistic loss, and hence is computationally feasible.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Jun 2014 13:42:30 GMT  (20kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5383v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 6 Mar 2015 20:14:19 GMT  (130kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5383v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 23 Nov 2015 23:09:47 GMT  (140kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5383v3", "16 pages, 2 figures.
