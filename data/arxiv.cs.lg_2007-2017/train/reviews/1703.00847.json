Our approach is based on multivariate Wiener filtering which recovers spurious edges apart from the true edges in the topology reconstruction. The main contribution of this work is to show that all spurious links obtained using Wiener filtering can be eliminated if the underlying topology is a tree based on which we present a three stage network reconstruction procedure for trees. We illustrate the effectiveness of the method developed by applying it on a typical distribution system of the electric grid.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Mar 2017 16:15:49 GMT  (485kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00847v1", "6 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SY", "authors": ["saurav talukdar", "deepjyoti deka", "donatello materassi", "murti v salapaka"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.00847"}
