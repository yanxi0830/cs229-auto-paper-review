This model, called the stock model, is based on a reverse cascade approach and is applied in a distributed context. So transit providers have to learn the right capacities to buy and to stock and, therefore learning theory is applied through an iterative process. We show that transit providers manage to learn how to strategically choose their capacities on each route in order to maximize their benefits, despite the very incomplete information. Finally, we provide and analyse some simulation results given by the application of the model in a simple case where the model quickly converges to a stable state.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Dec 2011 16:34:20 GMT  (2169kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1615v1", "19 pages, 19 figures, IJCNC,this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "19 pages, 19 figures, IJCNC,this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.LG", "authors": ["dominique barth", "boubkeur boudaoud", "thierry mautor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1112.1615"}
