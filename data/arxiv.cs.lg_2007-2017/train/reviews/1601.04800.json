However, the recommendation quality is far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a simple yet promising algorithm. We fill the user-item matrix based on a low-rank assumption and simultaneously keep the original information. To do that, a nonconvex rank relaxation rather than the nuclear norm is adopted to provide a better rank approximation and an efficient optimization strategy is designed. A comprehensive set of experiments on real datasets demonstrates that our method pushes the accuracy of Top-N recommendation to a new level.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 19 Jan 2016 04:48:42 GMT  (70kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04800v1", "AAAI 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "AAAI 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["zhao kang", "chong peng", "qiang cheng"], "accepted": true, "id": "1601.04800"}
