The approach, BOSS (Best of Sampled Set), drives exploration by sampling multiple models from the posterior and selecting actions optimistically. It extends previous work by providing a rule for deciding when to resample and how to combine the models. We show that our algorithm achieves nearoptimal reward with high probability with a sample complexity that is low relative to the speed at which the posterior distribution converges during learning. We demonstrate that BOSS performs quite favorably compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning approaches and illustrate its flexibility by pairing it with a non-parametric model that generalizes across states.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 May 2012 14:42:20 GMT  (262kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2664v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["john asmuth", "lihong li", "michael l littman", "ali nouri", "david wingate"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.2664"}
