The novelty of our bound is that it depends optimally on the parameter $\\delta$, which loosely corresponds to the probability that the algorithm fails to be private, and is the first to smoothly interpolate between approximate differential privacy ($\\delta &gt; 0$) and pure differential privacy ($\\delta = 0$).", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 24 Jan 2015 23:26:21 GMT  (18kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06095v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["thomas steinke", "jonathan ullman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.06095"}
