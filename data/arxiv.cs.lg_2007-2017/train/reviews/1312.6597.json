This distinction becomes important when the datasets have a large number of classes. Therefore, we present a novel solution to imbalanced multiclass learning with several skewed majority classes, which improves minority classes identification. This fact is particularly important for text classification tasks, such as event detection. Our models combined with pre-processing sampling techniques improved the classification results on 6 well-known datasets. Finally, we have also introduced a new metric SG-Mean to overcome the multiplication by zero limitation of G-Mean.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Dec 2013 16:52:56 GMT  (118kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6597v1", "Preliminary version of the paper"], ["v2", "Fri, 24 Jan 2014 23:09:17 GMT  (126kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6597v2", "Preliminary version of the paper"]], "COMMENTS": "Preliminary version of the paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IR", "authors": ["luis marujo", "anatole gershman", "jaime carbonell", "david martins de matos", "jo\\~ao p neto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6597"}
