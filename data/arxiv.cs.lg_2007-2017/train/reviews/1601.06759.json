This task requires an image model that is at once expressive, tractable and scalable. We present a deep neural network that sequentially predicts the pixels in an image along the two spatial dimensions. Our method models the discrete probability of the raw pixel values and encodes the complete set of dependencies in the image. Architectural novelties include fast two-dimensional recurrent layers and an effective use of residual connections in deep recurrent networks. We achieve log-likelihood scores on natural images that are considerably better than the previous state of the art. Our main results also provide benchmarks on the diverse ImageNet dataset. Samples generated from the model appear crisp, varied and globally coherent.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 25 Jan 2016 20:34:24 GMT  (3500kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 15:32:16 GMT  (2385kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 19 Aug 2016 14:10:16 GMT  (2647kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06759v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["a\u00e4ron van den oord", "nal kalchbrenner", "koray kavukcuoglu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1601.06759"}
