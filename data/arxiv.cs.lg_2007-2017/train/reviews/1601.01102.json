With the recent popularity of social media, new types of anomalous behaviors arise, causing concerns from various parties. While a large amount of work have been dedicated to traditional anomaly detection problems, we observe a surge of research interests in the new realm of social media anomaly detection. In this paper, we present a survey on existing approaches to address this problem. We focus on the new type of anomalous phenomena in the social media and review the recent developed techniques to detect those special types of anomalies. We provide a general overview of the problem domain, common formulations, existing methodologies and potential directions. With this work, we hope to call out the attention from the research community on this challenging problem and open up new directions that we can contribute in the future.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Jan 2016 07:42:24 GMT  (1780kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01102v1", "18 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 17 Feb 2016 21:34:31 GMT  (1761kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01102v2", "23 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SI", "authors": ["rose yu", "huida qiu", "zhen wen", "ching-yung lin", "yan liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.01102"}
