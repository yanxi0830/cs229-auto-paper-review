{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Feb-2017", "title": "Learning to Multi-Task by Active Sampling", "abstract": "One of the long-standing challenges in Artificial Intelligence is to build a single agent which can solve multiple tasks. Recent progress in multi-task learning for learning behavior in many goal-directed sequential tasks has been in the form of distillation based learning wherein a single student network learns from multiple task-specific teacher networks by mimicking the task-specific policies of the teacher networks. There has also been progress in the form of Progressive Networks which seek to overcome the catastrophic forgetting problem using gating mechanisms. We propose a simple yet efficient Multi-Tasking framework which solves many tasks in an online or active learning setup.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Feb 2017 16:31:56 GMT  (1939kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06053v1", "9 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 21 Feb 2017 04:38:43 GMT  (1945kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06053v2", "9 pages"], ["v3", "Sat, 25 Feb 2017 08:49:45 GMT  (1981kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06053v3", "10 pages + 3 page appendix"], ["v4", "Sun, 21 May 2017 12:47:34 GMT  (8403kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06053v4", "11 pages + 30 page appendix"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["sahil sharma", "ashutosh jha", "parikshit hegde", "balaraman ravindran"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06053"}
