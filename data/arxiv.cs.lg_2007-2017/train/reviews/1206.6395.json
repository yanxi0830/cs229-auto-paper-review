Differentially private solutions enforce privacy by adding random noise to a function computed over the data, and the challenge in designing such algorithms is to control the added noise in order to optimize the privacy-accuracy-sample size tradeoff.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (346kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6395v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR stat.ML", "authors": ["kamalika chaudhuri", "daniel j hsu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6395"}
