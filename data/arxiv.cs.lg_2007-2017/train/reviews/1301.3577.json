{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Jan-2013", "title": "Saturating Auto-Encoders", "abstract": "We introduce a simple new regularizer for auto-encoders whose hidden-unit activation functions contain at least one zero-gradient (saturated) region. This regularizer explicitly encourages activations in the saturated region(s) of the corresponding activation function. We call these Saturating Auto-Encoders (SATAE). We show that the saturation regularizer explicitly limits the SATAE's ability to reconstruct inputs which are not near the data manifold. Furthermore, we show that a wide variety of features can be learned when different activation functions are used. Finally, connections are established with the Contractive and Sparse Auto-Encoders.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 04:07:46 GMT  (113kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3577v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 13 Feb 2013 00:28:01 GMT  (235kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3577v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 15:37:33 GMT  (776kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3577v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["rostislav goroshin", "yann lecun"], "accepted": true, "id": "1301.3577"}
