While promising, most of the existing works use convex methods, which may be suboptimal in terms of the accuracy of feature selection and parameter estimation. In this paper, we expand a nonconvex paradigm to sparse group feature selection, which is motivated by applications that require identifying the underlying group structure and performing feature selection simultaneously. The main contributions of this article are twofold: (1) statistically, we introduce a nonconvex sparse group feature selection model which can reconstruct the oracle estimator. Therefore, consistent feature selection and parameter estimation can be achieved; (2) computationally, we propose an efficient algorithm that is applicable to large-scale problems. Numerical results suggest that the proposed nonconvex method compares favorably against its competitors on synthetic data and real-world applications, thus achieving desired goal of delivering high performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 May 2012 00:02:01 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5075v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 18 Jan 2013 21:06:49 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5075v2", "Accepted by the 30th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2013)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["shuo xiang", "xiaoshen tong", "jieping ye"], "accepted": true, "id": "1205.5075"}
