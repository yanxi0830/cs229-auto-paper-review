Ranking strategy as the key module needs to be more carefully designed. We find two key factors that affect users' behaviors: attractive item content and compatibility with users' interests. To extract these factors, a ranking model needs to understand users from a human vision perspective. This paper proposes Telepath, a vision-based architecture that simulates the human vision system to extract the key visual signals that attract users to a displayed item and generate vision activations and simulates cerebral cortex to understand users' interest based on the captured activations from browsed items. Telepath is a combination of CNN, RNN and DNN. In practice, the Telepath model has been launched to JD's online recommender system and advertising system. For one of the major item recommendation blocks on the JD app, CTR, GMV and orders have increased 1.59%, 8.16% and 8.71% respectively. For several major advertising publishers of JD DSP, CTR, GMV and ROI have increased 6.58%, 61.72% and 65.57% respectively by the first launch, and further increased 2.95%, 41.75% and 41.37% respectively by the second launch.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Sep 2017 13:29:36 GMT  (1901kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00300v1", "8 pages, 11 figures, 1 table"], ["v2", "Mon, 4 Sep 2017 16:06:57 GMT  (1901kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00300v2", "8 pages, 11 figures, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 11 figures, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["yu wang", "jixing xu", "aohan wu", "mantian li", "yang he", "jinghe hu", "weipeng p yan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.00300"}
