Specifically, we compare two methods to predict the number of feedbacks (i.e., comments) that a blog post is likely to receive. We compare Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and sparse Autoencoder to a baseline method where the data are only centered and scaled, on each of two models: Linear Regression and Regression Tree. We find that unsupervised learning techniques significantly improve the prediction accuracy on both models. For the Linear Regression model, sparse Autoencoder achieves the best result, with an improvement in the root mean squared error (RMSE) on the test set of 42% over the baseline method. For the Regression Tree model, PCA achieves the best result, with an improvement in RMSE of 15% over the baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Nov 2016 22:01:41 GMT  (273kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03894v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["thai pham", "camelia simoiu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.03894"}
