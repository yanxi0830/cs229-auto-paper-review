{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-Jul-2015", "title": "The Information Sieve", "abstract": "We introduce a new framework for unsupervised learning of deep representations based on a novel hierarchical decomposition of information. Intuitively, data is passed through a series of progressively fine-grained sieves. Each layer of the sieve recovers a single latent factor that is maximally informative about multivariate dependence in the data. The data is transformed after each pass so that the remaining unexplained information trickles down to the next layer. Ultimately, we are left with a set of latent factors explaining all the dependence in the original data and remainder information consisting of independent noise. We present a practical implementation of this framework for discrete variables and apply it to a variety of tasks including independent component analysis, lossy and lossless compression, and predicting missing values in data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jul 2015 20:00:42 GMT  (4363kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02284v1", "12 pages, 9 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 29 Apr 2016 20:29:36 GMT  (6820kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02284v2", "Appearing in Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2016. v2: Revised presentation and added link to code. 13 pages, 12 figures"], ["v3", "Thu, 9 Jun 2016 00:12:24 GMT  (6817kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02284v3", "Appearing in Proceedings of the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2016.
