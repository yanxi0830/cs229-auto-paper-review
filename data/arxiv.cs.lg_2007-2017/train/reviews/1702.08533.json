We initiate a study of the interplay between \\emph{exploration and competition}---how such systems balance the exploration for learning and the competition for users. Here the users play three distinct roles: they are customers that generate revenue, they are sources of data for learning, and they are self-interested agents which choose among the competing systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 21:13:57 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08533v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.LG", "authors": ["yishay mansour", "aleksandrs slivkins", "zhiwei steven wu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08533"}
