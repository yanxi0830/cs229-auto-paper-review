{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "21-Mar-2014", "title": "Learning to Optimize via Information-Directed Sampling", "abstract": "This paper proposes information directed sampling--a new algorithm for balancing between exploration and exploitation in online optimization problems in which a decision-maker must learn from partial feedback. The algorithm quantifies the amount learned by selecting an action through an information theoretic measure: the mutual information between the true optimal action and the algorithm's next observation. Actions are then selected by optimizing a myopic objective that balances earning high immediate reward and acquiring information. We show this algorithm is provably efficient and is empirically efficient in simulation trials. We provide novel and general regret bounds that scale with the entropy of the optimal action distribution. Furthermore, as we highlight through several examples, information directed sampling sometimes dramatically outperforms popular approaches like UCB algorithms and Thompson sampling which don't quantify the information provided by different actions.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Mar 2014 02:02:25 GMT  (17kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5556v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1403.5341"], ["v2", "Sun, 8 Jun 2014 20:40:38 GMT  (172kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5556v2", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1403.5341"], ["v3", "Thu, 3 Jul 2014 01:09:22 GMT  (174kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5556v3", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1403.5341"], ["v4", "Tue, 22 Jul 2014 17:59:30 GMT  (175kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5556v4", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1403.5341"], ["v5", "Fri, 12 Aug 2016 06:53:32 GMT  (257kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5556v5", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1403.5341"], ["v6", "Wed, 24 May 2017 00:06:24 GMT  (257kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5556v6", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1403.5341"], ["v7", "Fri, 7 Jul 2017 05:51:15 GMT  (259kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5556v7", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1403.5341"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1403.5341", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["daniel russo 0001", "benjamin van roy"], "accepted": true, "id": "1403.5556"}
