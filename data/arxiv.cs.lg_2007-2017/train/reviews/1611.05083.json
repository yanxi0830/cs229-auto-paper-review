It helps the end users in analyzing the origin of failure. In this work, we show the early experiments with probabilistic analysis approaches in fault localization. Inspired by the Kullback-Leibler Divergence from Bayesian probabilistic theory, we propose a suspiciousness factor to compute the fault contribution for the transitions in the reachability graph of model checking, using which to rank the potential faulty transitions. To automatically locate design faults in the simulation model of detailed design, we propose to use the statistical model Hidden Markov Model (HMM), which provides statistically identical information to component's real behavior. The core of this method is a fault localization algorithm that gives out the set of suspicious ranked faulty components and a backward algorithm that computes the matching degree between the HMM and the simulation model to evaluate the confidence degree of the localization conclusion.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Nov 2016 22:33:48 GMT  (547kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05083v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 18 Nov 2016 11:37:29 GMT  (612kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05083v2", "In International Conference on Embedded Real Time Software and Systems (ERTS 2014)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.LG", "authors": ["ning ge", "marc pantel", "xavier cr\\'egut"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.05083"}
