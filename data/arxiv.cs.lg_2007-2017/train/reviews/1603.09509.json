However, true end-to-end learning, where features are learned directly from waveforms, has only recently reached the performance of hand-tailored representations based on the Fourier transform. In this paper, we detail an approach to use convolutional filters to push past the inherent tradeoff of temporal and frequency resolution that exists for spectral representations. At increased computational cost, we show that increasing temporal resolution via reduced stride and increasing frequency resolution via additional filters delivers significant performance improvements. Further, we find more efficient representations by simultaneously learning at multiple scales, leading to an overall decrease in word error rate on a difficult internal speech test set by 20.7% relative to networks with the same number of parameters trained on spectrograms.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Mar 2016 09:54:44 GMT  (2977kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09509v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 5 Apr 2016 14:17:09 GMT  (2977kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09509v2", "\"fix typo in the title\""]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE cs.SD", "authors": ["zhenyao zhu", "jesse h engel", "awni hannun"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.09509"}
