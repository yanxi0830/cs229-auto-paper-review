For learning a kernel over a large number of objects, existing methods face significant scalability issues inhibiting the application of these methods to settings where a kernel is learned in an online and timely fashion. In this paper we propose a novel framework called Efficient online Relative comparison Kernel LEarning (ERKLE), for efficiently learning the similarity of a large set of objects in an online manner. We learn a kernel from relative comparisons via stochastic gradient descent, one query response at a time, by taking advantage of the sparse and low-rank properties of the gradient to efficiently restrict the kernel to lie in the space of positive semidefinite matrices. In addition, we derive a passive-aggressive online update for minimally satisfying new relative comparisons as to not disrupt the influence of previously obtained comparisons. Experimentally, we demonstrate a considerable improvement in speed while obtaining improved or comparable accuracy compared to current methods in the online learning setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Jan 2015 17:19:06 GMT  (83kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01242v1", "Extended version of the paper appearing in The Proceedings of the 2015 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM15)"], ["v2", "Mon, 12 Jan 2015 14:10:03 GMT  (83kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01242v2", "Extended version of the paper appearing in The Proceedings of the 2015 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM15)"]], "COMMENTS": "Extended version of the paper appearing in The Proceedings of the 2015 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM15)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["eric heim", "matthew berger", "lee m seversky", "milos hauskrecht university of pittsburgh", "air force research laboratory", "information directorate)"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.01242"}
