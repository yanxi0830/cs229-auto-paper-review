However, search differs from MAB in that in MCTS it is usually only the final \"arm pull\" (the actual move selection) that collects a reward, rather than all \"arm pulls\". Therefore, it makes more sense to minimize the simple regret, as opposed to the cumulative regret. We begin by introducing policies for multi-armed bandits with lower finite-time and asymptotic simple regret than UCB, using it to develop a two-stage scheme (SR+CR) for MCTS which outperforms UCT empirically.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Jul 2012 21:13:40 GMT  (133kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.5536v1", "AAAI 2012, 7 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1108.3711"]], "COMMENTS": "AAAI 2012, 7 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1108.3711", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["david tolpin", "solomon eyal shimony"], "accepted": true, "id": "1207.5536"}
