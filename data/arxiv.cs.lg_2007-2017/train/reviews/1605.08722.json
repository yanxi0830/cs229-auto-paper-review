Against adversarial bandits the pseudo-regret is $O(K\\sqrt{n \\log n})$ and against stochastic bandits the pseudo-regret is $O(\\sum_i (\\log n)/\\Delta_i)$. We also show that no algorithm with $O(\\log n)$ pseudo-regret against stochastic bandits can achieve $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ expected regret against adaptive adversarial bandits. This complements previous results of Bubeck and Slivkins (2012) that show $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{n})$ expected adversarial regret with $O((\\log n)^2)$ stochastic pseudo-regret.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2016 17:28:35 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08722v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["peter auer", "chao-kai chiang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.08722"}
