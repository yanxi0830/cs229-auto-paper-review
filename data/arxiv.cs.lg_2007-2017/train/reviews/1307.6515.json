We analyze a modified version of a $k$-nearest neighbor based algorithm recently proposed by Chaudhuri and Dasgupta. The main results of this paper show that under mild assumptions on $f$ and $M$, we obtain rates of convergence that depend on $d$ only but not on the ambient dimension $D$. We also show that similar (albeit non-algorithmic) results can be obtained for kernel density estimators. We sketch a construction of a sample complexity lower bound instance for a natural class of manifold oblivious clustering algorithms. We further briefly consider the known manifold case and show that in this case a spatially adaptive algorithm achieves better rates.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Jul 2013 18:17:53 GMT  (80kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6515v1", "28 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "28 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["sivaraman balakrishnan", "srivatsan narayanan", "alessandro rinaldo", "aarti singh", "larry a wasserman"], "accepted": true, "id": "1307.6515"}
