This paper examines discrete distribution estimation under local privacy, a setting wherein service providers can learn the distribution of a categorical statistic of interest without collecting the underlying data. We present new mechanisms, including hashed K-ary Randomized Response (KRR), that empirically meet or exceed the utility of existing mechanisms at all privacy levels. New theoretical results demonstrate the order-optimality of KRR and the existing RAPPOR mechanism at different privacy regimes.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 03:48:19 GMT  (13262kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07387v1", "23 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ICML 2016"], ["v2", "Wed, 2 Mar 2016 19:08:36 GMT  (13308kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07387v2", "23 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ICML 2016 (under review)"], ["v3", "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 18:26:31 GMT  (7215kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07387v3", "23 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ICML 2016 (under review)"]], "COMMENTS": "23 pages, 12 figures, submitted to ICML 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["peter kairouz", "keith bonawitz", "daniel ramage"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.07387"}
