Target data considered here is either qualitative (a class label) or quantitative (an estimation of the posterior probability). Our main contribution is a SVM inspired formulation of this problem allowing to take into account class label through a hinge loss as well as probability estimates using epsilon-insensitive cost function together with a minimum norm (maximum margin) objective. This formulation shows a dual form leading to a quadratic problem and allows the use of a representer theorem and associated kernel. The solution provided can be used for both decision and posterior probability estimation. Based on empirical evidence our method outperforms regular SVM in terms of probability predictions and classification performances.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Jun 2011 06:55:24 GMT  (2066kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.3397v1", "IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing, Nice: France (2011)"]], "COMMENTS": "IEEE Workshop on Statistical Signal Processing, Nice: France (2011)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["emilie niaf", "r\\'emi flamary", "carole lartizien", "st\\'ephane canu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.3397"}
