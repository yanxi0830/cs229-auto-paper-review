These challenges in online stream of data are known as concept drift. In this paper, we proposed the Adaptive Convolutional ELM method (ACNNELM) as enhancement of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a hybrid Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) model plus adaptive capability. This method is aimed for concept drift handling. We enhanced the CNN as convolutional hiererchical features representation learner combined with Elastic ELM (E$^2$LM) as a parallel supervised classifier. We propose an Adaptive OS-ELM (AOS-ELM) for concept drift adaptability in classifier level (named ACNNELM-1) and matrices concatenation ensembles for concept drift adaptability in ensemble level (named ACNNELM-2). Our proposed Adaptive CNNELM is flexible that works well in classifier level and ensemble level while most current methods only proposed to work on either one of the levels.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Oct 2016 16:53:09 GMT  (1060kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02348v1", "Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics: Systems.
