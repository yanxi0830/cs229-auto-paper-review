Given only a few weight values for each feature it is possible to accurately predict the remaining values. Moreover, we show that not only can the parameter values be predicted, but many of them need not be learned at all. We train several different architectures by learning only a small number of weights and predicting the rest. In the best case we are able to predict more than 95% of the weights of a network without any drop in accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Jun 2013 19:16:26 GMT  (324kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0543v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 27 Oct 2014 11:49:08 GMT  (340kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0543v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML", "authors": ["misha denil", "babak shakibi", "laurent dinh", "marc'aurelio ranzato", "nando de freitas"], "accepted": true, "id": "1306.0543"}
