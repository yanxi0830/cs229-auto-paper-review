Inspired by this connection, we develop deep convolutional networks using a family of structured convolutional matrices and achieve state-of-the-art trade-off between energy efficiency and classification accuracy for well-known image recognition tasks. We also put forward a novel method to train binary convolutional networks by utilising an existing connection between noisy-rectified linear units and binary activations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 05:31:43 GMT  (637kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02407v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["rathinakumar appuswamy", "tapan nayak", "john arthur", "steven esser", "paul merolla", "jeffrey mckinstry", "timothy melano", "myron flickner", "dharmendra modha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.02407"}
