However, generalization error is typically bounded in a non-adaptive model, where all questions are specified before the dataset is drawn. Recent work by Dwork et al. (STOC '15) and Hardt and Ullman (FOCS '14) initiated the formal study of this problem, and gave the first upper and lower bounds on the achievable generalization error for adaptive data analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Mar 2015 20:48:42 GMT  (23kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04843v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 10 Nov 2015 02:01:05 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04843v2", "This paper was merged with another manuscript and is now subsumed byarXiv:1511.02513"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["raef bassily", "adam smith", "thomas steinke", "jonathan ullman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.04843"}
