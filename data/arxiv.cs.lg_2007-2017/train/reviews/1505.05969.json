We introduce a neural network method to encode programs as a linear mapping from an embedded precondition space to an embedded postcondition space and propose an algorithm for feedback at scale using these linear maps as features. We apply our algorithm to assessments from the Code.org Hour of Code and Stanford University's CS1 course, where we propagate human comments on student assignments to orders of magnitude more submissions.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 May 2015 07:03:45 GMT  (2433kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05969v1", "Accepted to International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE cs.SE", "authors": ["chris piech", "jonathan huang", "andy nguyen", "mike phulsuksombati", "mehran sahami", "leonidas j guibas"], "accepted": true, "id": "1505.05969"}
