{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "19-Apr-2017", "title": "A Large Self-Annotated Corpus for Sarcasm", "abstract": "We introduce the Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC), a large corpus for sarcasm research and for training and evaluating systems for sarcasm detection. The corpus has 1.3 million sarcastic statements -- 10 times more than any previous dataset -- and many times more instances of non-sarcastic statements, allowing for learning in regimes of both balanced and unbalanced labels. Each statement is furthermore self-annotated -- sarcasm is labeled by the author and not an independent annotator -- and provided with user, topic, and conversation context. We evaluate the corpus for accuracy, compare it to previous related corpora, and provide baselines for the task of sarcasm detection.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Apr 2017 02:01:39 GMT  (226kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05579v1", "5 pages, 5 figures.
