{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "7-Feb-2016", "title": "Hyperparameter optimization with approximate gradient", "abstract": "Most models in machine learning contain at least one hyperparameter to control for model complexity. Choosing an appropriate set of hyperparameters is both crucial in terms of model accuracy and computationally challenging. In this work we propose an algorithm for the optimization of continuous hyperparameters using inexact gradient information. An advantage of this method is that hyperparameters can be updated before model parameters have fully converged. We also give sufficient conditions for the global convergence of this method, based on regularity conditions of the involved functions and summability of errors. Finally, we validate the empirical performance of this method on the estimation of regularization constants of L2-regularized logistic regression and kernel Ridge regression. Empirical benchmarks indicate that our approach is highly competitive with respect to state of the art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 7 Feb 2016 10:37:13 GMT  (240kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02355v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 9 Feb 2016 11:24:08 GMT  (240kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02355v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 27 May 2016 09:50:52 GMT  (430kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02355v3", "Published at Proceedings of the International conference on Machine Learning (ICML)"], ["v4", "Thu, 9 Jun 2016 15:42:04 GMT  (338kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02355v4", "Proceedings of the International conference on Machine Learning (ICML)"], ["v5", "Sun, 26 Jun 2016 01:02:54 GMT  (255kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02355v5", "Proceedings of the International conference on Machine Learning (ICML)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG math.OC", "authors": ["fabian pedregosa"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.02355"}
