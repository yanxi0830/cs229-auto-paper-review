The data in those applications is mostly categorical and contains multiple fields; a typical representation is to transform it into a high-dimensional sparse binary feature representation via one-hot encoding. Facing with the extreme sparsity, traditional models may limit their capacity of mining shallow patterns from the data, i.e. low-order feature combinations. Deep models like deep neural networks, on the other hand, cannot be directly applied for the high-dimensional input because of the huge feature space. In this paper, we propose a Product-based Neural Networks (PNN) with an embedding layer to learn a distributed representation of the categorical data, a product layer to capture interactive patterns between inter-field categories, and further fully connected layers to explore high-order feature interactions. Our experimental results on two large-scale real-world ad click datasets demonstrate that PNNs consistently outperform the state-of-the-art models on various metrics.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Nov 2016 07:10:22 GMT  (1578kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00144v1", "6 pages, 5 figures, ICDM2016"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 5 figures, ICDM2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IR", "authors": ["yanru qu", "han cai", "kan ren", "weinan zhang", "yong yu", "ying wen", "jun wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00144"}
