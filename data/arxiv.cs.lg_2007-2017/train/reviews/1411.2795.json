It has many diverse application specially in the field of Surveillance, Immigrations at Airport, cyber security, transcription in multi-source of similar sound source, where it is difficult to assign transcription arbitrary. The most commonly speech parametrization used in speaker verification, K-mean, cepstral analysis, is detailed. Gaussian mixture modeling, which is the speaker modeling technique is then explained. Gaussian mixture models (GMM), perhaps the most robust machine learning algorithm has been introduced examine and judge carefully speaker identification in text independent. The application or employment of Gaussian mixture models for monitoring &amp; Analysing speaker identity is encouraged by the familiarity, awareness, or understanding gained through experience that Gaussian spectrum depict the characteristics of speaker's spectral conformational pattern and remarkable ability of GMM to construct capricious densities after that we illustrate 'Expectation maximization' an iterative algorithm which takes some arbitrary value in initial estimation and carry on the iterative process until the convergence of value is observed,so by doing various number of experiments we are able to obtain 79 ~ 82% of identification rate using Vector quantization and 85 ~ 92.6% of identification rate using GMM modeling by Expectation maximization parameter estimation depending on variation of parameter.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Nov 2014 13:20:19 GMT  (290kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2795v1", "7 pages, 5 figures, 1 Table, Signal &amp; Image Processing : An International Journal (SIPIJ) Vol.5, No.5, October 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 5 figures, 1 Table, Signal &amp; Image Processing : An International Journal (SIPIJ) Vol.5, No.5, October 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.LG", "authors": ["nitesh kumar chaudhary"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.2795"}
