In this paper, we develop a novel batch Bayesian optimization algorithm --- the parallel knowledge gradient method. By construction, this method provides the one-step Bayes optimal batch of points to sample. We provide an efficient strategy for computing this Bayes-optimal batch of points, and we demonstrate that the parallel knowledge gradient method finds global optima significantly faster than previous batch Bayesian optimization algorithms on both synthetic test functions and when tuning hyperparameters of practical machine learning algorithms, especially when function evaluations are noisy.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 15:12:01 GMT  (48kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04414v1", "12 pages, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Sat, 29 Oct 2016 05:47:09 GMT  (645kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04414v2", "12 pages, 5 figures, Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2016"], ["v3", "Sat, 21 Jan 2017 20:49:18 GMT  (646kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04414v3", "12 pages, 5 figures.
