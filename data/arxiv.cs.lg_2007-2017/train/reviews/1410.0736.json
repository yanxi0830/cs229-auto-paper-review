This work builds on the intuition that not all classes are equally difficult to distinguish from a true class label. Towards this end, we introduce hierarchical branching CNNs, named as Hierarchical Deep CNN (HD-CNN), wherein classes that can be easily distinguished are classified in the higher layer coarse category CNN, while the most difficult classifications are done on lower layer fine category CNN. We propose utilizing a multinomial logistic loss and a novel temporal sparsity penalty for HD-CNN training. Together they ensure each branching component deals with a subset of categories confusing to each other. This new network architecture adopts coarse-to-fine classification strategy and module design principle. The proposed model achieves superior performance over standard models. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on CIFAR100 benchmark.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Oct 2014 01:17:20 GMT  (1483kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0736v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 19 Dec 2014 07:51:51 GMT  (4582kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0736v2", "Submission to ICLR 2015"], ["v3", "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 03:11:49 GMT  (4638kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0736v3", "Revised based on ICLR 2015 reviews"], ["v4", "Sat, 16 May 2015 03:36:32 GMT  (1000kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0736v4", "Add new results on ImageNet using VGG-16-layer building block net"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["zhicheng yan", "hao zhang", "robinson piramuthu", "vignesh jagadeesh", "dennis decoste", "wei di", "yizhou yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.0736"}
