By minimizing a hinge-loss using the linear expectation operator, we can perform posterior inference efficiently without dealing with a highly nonlinear link likelihood function; by using a fully-Bayesian formulation, we can avoid tuning regularization constants. Experimental results on real datasets appear to demonstrate the benefits inherited from max-margin learning and fully-Bayesian nonparametric inference.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:27:56 GMT  (994kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4659v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["jun zhu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4659"}
