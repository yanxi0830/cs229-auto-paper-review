{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Nov-2015", "title": "Generating Images from Captions with Attention", "abstract": "Motivated by the recent progress in generative models, we introduce a model that generates images from natural language descriptions. The proposed model iteratively draws patches on a canvas, while attending to the relevant words in the description. After training on Microsoft COCO, we compare our model with several baseline generative models on image generation and retrieval tasks. We demonstrate that our model produces higher quality samples than other approaches and generates images with novel scene compositions corresponding to previously unseen captions in the dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Nov 2015 18:18:53 GMT  (889kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02793v1", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v2", "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 17:56:29 GMT  (889kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02793v2", "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["elman mansimov", "emilio parisotto", "jimmy lei ba", "ruslan salakhutdinov"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.02793"}
