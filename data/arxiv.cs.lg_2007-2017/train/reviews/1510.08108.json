{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "27-Oct-2015", "title": "Online Learning with Gaussian Payoffs and Side Observations", "abstract": "We consider a sequential learning problem with Gaussian payoffs and side information: after selecting an action $i$, the learner receives information about the payoff of every action $j$ in the form of Gaussian observations whose mean is the same as the mean payoff, but the variance depends on the pair $(i,j)$ (and may be infinite). The setup allows a more refined information transfer from one action to another than previous partial monitoring setups, including the recently introduced graph-structured feedback case. For the first time in the literature, we provide non-asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds on the regret of any algorithm, which recover existing asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds and finite-time minimax lower bounds available in the literature. We also provide algorithms that achieve the problem-dependent lower bound (up to some universal constant factor) or the minimax lower bounds (up to logarithmic factors).", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 21:59:33 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08108v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["yifan wu", "andr\u00e1s gy\u00f6rgy", "csaba szepesv\u00e1ri"], "accepted": true, "id": "1510.08108"}
