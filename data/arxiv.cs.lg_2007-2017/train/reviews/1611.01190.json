Among other results, we show a generic learning speedup lemma, equivalences between various learning models in the exponential time and subexponential time regimes, a dichotomy between learning and pseudorandomness, consequences of non-trivial learning for circuit lower bounds, Karp-Lipton theorems for probabilistic exponential time, and NC$^1$-hardness for the Minimum Circuit Size Problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Nov 2016 21:08:38 GMT  (745kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01190v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CC cs.CR cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["igor c oliveira", "rahul santhanam"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01190"}
