We introduce probabilistic available bandwidth, which is defined in terms of ingress rates and egress rates of traffic on a path, rather than in terms of capacity and utilization of the constituent links of the path like the standard available bandwidth metric. In this paper, we describe a distributed algorithm, based on a probabilistic graphical model and Bayesian active learning, for simultaneously estimating the probabilistic available bandwidth of multiple paths through a network. Our procedure exploits the fact that each packet train provides information not only about the path it traverses, but also about any path that shares a link with the monitored path. Simulations and PlanetLab experiments indicate that this process can dramatically reduce the number of probes required to generate accurate estimates.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Jan 2010 23:33:49 GMT  (224kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1001.1009v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.LG", "authors": ["frederic thouin", "mark coates", "michael rabbat mcgill university", "montreal", "canada)"], "accepted": false, "id": "1001.1009"}
