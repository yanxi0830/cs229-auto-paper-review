We propose a Feature-rich Compositional Embedding Model (\\fct{}) for relation extraction that is expressive, generalizes to new domains, and is easy-to-implement. The key idea is to combine both (unlexicalized) hand-crafted features with learned word embeddings. The model is able to directly tackle the difficulties met by traditional compositional embeddings models, such as handling arbitrary types of sentence annotations and utilizing global information for composition. We test the proposed model on two relation extraction tasks, and demonstrate that our model outperforms both previous compositional models and traditional feature rich models on the ACE 2005 relation extraction task, and the SemEval 2010 relation classification task. The combination of our model and a log-linear classifier with hand-crafted features gives state-of-the-art results.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 10 May 2015 18:47:06 GMT  (2701kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02419v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 12 May 2015 01:01:34 GMT  (2701kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02419v2", "10 pages"], ["v3", "Tue, 15 Sep 2015 02:01:34 GMT  (2738kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02419v3", "12 pages for EMNLP 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["matthew r gormley", "mo yu", "mark dredze"], "accepted": true, "id": "1505.02419"}
