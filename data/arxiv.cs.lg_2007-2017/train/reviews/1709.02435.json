In this paper, we analyze the impacts that the use of ML as an implementation approach has on ISO 26262 safety lifecycle and ask what could be done to address them. We then provide a set of recommendations on how to adapt the standard to accommodate ML.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 Sep 2017 20:10:56 GMT  (725kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02435v1", "6 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.SE cs.SY", "authors": ["rick salay", "rodrigo queiroz", "krzysztof czarnecki"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.02435"}
