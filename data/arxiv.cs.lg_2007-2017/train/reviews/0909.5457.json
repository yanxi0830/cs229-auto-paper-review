In this paper we propose a simple and fast algorithm SVP (Singular Value Projection) for rank minimization with affine constraints (ARMP) and show that SVP recovers the minimum rank solution for affine constraints that satisfy the \"restricted isometry property\". Our results improve upon a recent breakthrough by Recht, Fazel and Parillo (RFP07) in three significant ways:", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Sep 2009 14:44:54 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.5457v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 19 Oct 2009 19:32:44 GMT  (49kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.5457v2", "An earlier version of this paper was submitted to NIPS-2009 on June 5, 2009"], ["v3", "Mon, 19 Oct 2009 21:21:57 GMT  (49kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.5457v3", "An earlier version of this paper was submitted to NIPS-2009 on June 5, 2009"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IT math.IT", "authors": ["prateek jain 0002", "raghu meka", "inderjit s dhillon"], "accepted": true, "id": "0909.5457"}
