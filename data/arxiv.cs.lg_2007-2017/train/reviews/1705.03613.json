The k-means can effectively optimize this function, but it is too sensitive for initial centers (seeds). This paper proposed a method for initialization of the k-means using the concept of useful nearest center for each data point.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 May 2017 06:19:04 GMT  (388kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03613v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hassan ismkhan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03613"}
