We define a space of kernel structures which are built compositionally by adding and multiplying a small number of base kernels. We present a method for searching over this space of structures which mirrors the scientific discovery process. The learned structures can often decompose functions into interpretable components and enable long-range extrapolation on time-series datasets. Our structure search method outperforms many widely used kernels and kernel combination methods on a variety of prediction tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 14:53:13 GMT  (2806kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4922v1", "9 pages, 7 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 5 Mar 2013 11:48:12 GMT  (2810kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4922v2", "9 pages, 7 figures, Submitted for review"], ["v3", "Fri, 5 Apr 2013 16:53:30 GMT  (2358kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4922v3", "9 pages, 7 figures, Submitted for review"], ["v4", "Mon, 13 May 2013 13:10:31 GMT  (2372kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4922v4", "9 pages, 7 figures, To appear in proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Machine Learning"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG stat.ME", "authors": ["david k duvenaud", "james robert lloyd", "roger b grosse", "joshua b tenenbaum", "zoubin ghahramani"], "accepted": true, "id": "1302.4922"}
