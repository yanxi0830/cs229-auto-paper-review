Moreover, we demonstrate that merging the knowledge in the CNN and LSTM models via model compression further improves the accuracy of the convolutional model.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 22:48:59 GMT  (182kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06433v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 13:43:02 GMT  (163kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06433v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 14 Sep 2016 14:36:53 GMT  (152kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06433v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["krzysztof j geras", "abdel-rahman mohamed", "rich caruana", "gregor urban", "shengjie wang", "ozlem aslan", "matthai philipose", "matthew richardson", "charles sutton"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06433"}
