The proposed sensing policy guides secondary users to focus the search of unused radio spectrum to those frequencies that persistently provide them high data rate. The proposed policy is based on machine learning, which makes it adaptive with the temporally and spatially varying radio spectrum. Furthermore, there is no need for dynamic modeling of the primary activity since it is implicitly learned over time. Energy efficiency is achieved by minimizing the number of assigned sensors per each subband under a constraint on miss detection probability. It is important to control the missed detections because they cause collisions with primary transmissions and lead to retransmissions at both the primary and secondary user. The minimization of the number of active sensors is formulated as a binary integer programming problem. Simulations show that the proposed machine learning based sensing policy improves the overall throughput of the secondary network and improves the energy efficiency while controlling the miss detection probability.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jun 2011 10:40:08 GMT  (441kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1770v1", "10 pages, 13 figures, Submitted to Neurocomputing June 2011"], ["v2", "Wed, 27 Jul 2011 11:08:21 GMT  (753kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1770v2", "10 pages, 13 figures, Accepted to Neurocomputing special issue: MLSP 2011"], ["v3", "Tue, 4 Oct 2011 06:02:16 GMT  (586kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.1770v3", "10 pages, 13 figures, Accepted to Neurocomputing special issue: Machine learning for signal processing, 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 13 figures, Submitted to Neurocomputing June 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jan oksanen", "jarmo lund\\'en", "visa koivunen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.1770"}
