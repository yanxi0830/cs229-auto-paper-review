Our method for transforming deep artificial neural networks into spiking networks is scalable and works with a wide range of neural nonlinearities. We achieve these results by softening the neural response function, such that its derivative remains bounded, and by training the network with noise to provide robustness against the variability introduced by spikes. Our analysis shows that implementations of these networks on neuromorphic hardware will be many times more power-efficient than the equivalent non-spiking networks on traditional hardware.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Nov 2016 04:32:22 GMT  (67kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05141v1", "10 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables; the \"methods\" section of this article draws heavily onarXiv:1510.08829"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables; the \"methods\" section of this article draws heavily onarXiv:1510.08829", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["eric hunsberger", "chris eliasmith"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.05141"}
