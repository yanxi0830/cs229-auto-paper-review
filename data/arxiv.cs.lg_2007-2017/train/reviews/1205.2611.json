{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-May-2012", "title": "Ordinal Boltzmann Machines for Collaborative Filtering", "abstract": "Collaborative filtering is an effective recommendation technique wherein the preference of an individual can potentially be predicted based on preferences of other members. Early algorithms often relied on the strong locality in the preference data, that is, it is enough to predict preference of a user on a particular item based on a small subset of other users with similar tastes or of other items with similar properties. More recently, dimensionality reduction techniques have proved to be equally competitive, and these are based on the co-occurrence patterns rather than locality. This paper explores and extends a probabilistic model known as Boltzmann Machine for collaborative filtering tasks. It seamlessly integrates both the similarity and co-occurrence in a principled manner. In particular, we study parameterisation options to deal with the ordinal nature of the preferences, and propose a joint modelling of both the user-based and item-based processes. Experiments on moderate and large-scale movie recommendation show that our framework rivals existing well-known methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 May 2012 18:35:35 GMT  (255kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2611v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["tran the truyen", "dinh q phung", "svetha venkatesh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.2611"}
