As opposed to learning from multiple views where it is assumed that the exact same instances have multiple representations, we only assume the availability of samples of the same learning task in different domains. We develop an algorithmic framework that is based on mapping the (unlabeled) data followed by adjusting the mapping using the scarcer labeled data. The mapped data from all the outlooks can then be used for a generic classification algorithm. We further provide sample complexity results under the assumption that the different outlooks are inherently low dimension Gaussian mixtures. Experiments with real-world data indicate the performance boost from using multiple outlooks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Apr 2010 21:52:17 GMT  (319kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0027v1", "with full proofs of theorems"], ["v2", "Tue, 14 Jun 2011 06:56:25 GMT  (64kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.0027v2", "with full proofs of theorems and all experiments"]], "COMMENTS": "with full proofs of theorems", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["maayan harel", "shie mannor"], "accepted": true, "id": "1005.0027"}
