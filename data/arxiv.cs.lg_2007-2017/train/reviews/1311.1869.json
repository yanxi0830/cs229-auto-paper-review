First, we recover the Mirror Prox algorithm for offline optimization, prove an extension to Holder-smooth functions, and apply the results to saddle-point type problems. Next, we prove that a version of Optimistic Mirror Descent (which has a close relation to the Exponential Weights algorithm) can be used by two strongly-uncoupled players in a finite zero-sum matrix game to converge to the minimax equilibrium at the rate of O((log T)/T). This addresses a question of Daskalakis et al 2011. Further, we consider a partial information version of the problem. We then apply the results to convex programming and exhibit a simple algorithm for the approximate Max Flow problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Nov 2013 02:47:40 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1869v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GT", "authors": ["alexander rakhlin", "karthik sridharan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1311.1869"}
