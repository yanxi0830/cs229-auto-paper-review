Though neural networks have seen success in computer vision and natural language processing, they have not been as useful in stock market trading. To demonstrate the applicability of a neural network in stock trading, we made a single-layer neural network that recommends buying or selling shares of a stock by comparing the highest high of 10 consecutive days with that of the next 10 days, a process repeated for the stock's year-long historical data. A chi-squared analysis found that the neural network can accurately and appropriately decide whether to buy or sell shares for a given stock, showing that a neural network can make simple decisions about the stock market.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Mar 2017 13:18:35 GMT  (5kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10458v1", "4 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["abhinav madahar", "yuze ma", "kunal patel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.10458"}
