Recently, ideas have begun to emerge related to the analysis of time-varying graph signals. This work aims to elevate the notion of joint harmonic analysis to a full-fledged framework denoted as Time-Vertex Signal Processing, that links together the time-domain signal processing techniques with the new tools of graph signal processing. This entails three main contributions: (a) We provide a formal motivation for harmonic time-vertex analysis as an analysis tool for the state evolution of simple Partial Differential Equations on graphs. (b) We improve the accuracy of joint filtering operators by up-to two orders of magnitude. (c) Using our joint filters, we construct time-vertex dictionaries analyzing the different scales and the local time-frequency content of a signal. The utility of our tools is illustrated in numerous applications and datasets, such as dynamic mesh denoising and classification, still-video inpainting, and source localization in seismic events. Our results suggest that joint analysis of time-vertex signals can bring benefits to regression and learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 May 2017 17:20:32 GMT  (1335kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02307v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["francesco grassi", "reas loukas", "nathana\\\"el perraudin", "benjamin ricaud"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.02307"}
