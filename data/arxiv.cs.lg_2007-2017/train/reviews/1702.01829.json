Our approach uses a recursive neural network and a newly proposed attention mechanism to compute a representation of the text that focuses on salient content, from the perspective of both RST and the task. Experiments consider variants of the approach and illustrate its strengths and weaknesses.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 00:26:56 GMT  (430kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01829v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 6 May 2017 02:08:57 GMT  (448kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01829v2", "ACL 2017 camera ready version"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["yangfeng ji", "noah a smith"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.01829"}
