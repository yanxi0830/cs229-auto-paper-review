We obtain our learning results in two settings. The first is the commonly studied setting where sample access to the bidders' distributions over valuations is given, for both regular distributions and arbitrary distributions with bounded support. Our algorithms require polynomially many samples in the number of items and bidders. The second is a more general max-min learning setting that we introduce, where we are given \"approximate distributions,\" and we seek to compute an auction whose revenue is approximately optimal simultaneously for all \"true distributions\" that are close to the given ones. These results are more general in that they imply the sample-based results, and are also applicable in settings where we have no sample access to the underlying distributions but have estimated them indirectly via market research or by observation of previously run, potentially non-truthful auctions.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Sep 2017 10:07:18 GMT  (66kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00228v1", "Appears in FOCS 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in FOCS 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["yang cai", "constantinos daskalakis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.00228"}
