Frequency modulation FM is a nonlinear encoding of information in a carrier wave. In this paper we present a novel application of software defined radio (SDR) based on LSTM recurrent neural networks to decode audio signal from its noisy frequency demodulated version.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Apr 2017 23:16:33 GMT  (266kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02046v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 10 Apr 2017 14:47:16 GMT  (433kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02046v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 12 Apr 2017 00:47:36 GMT  (437kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02046v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 21 May 2017 11:55:14 GMT  (139kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02046v4", null], ["v5", "Sat, 7 Oct 2017 16:34:18 GMT  (329kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02046v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SD", "authors": ["dan elbaz", "michael zibulevsky"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.02046"}
