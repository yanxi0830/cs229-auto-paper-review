The training data consists of observations of covariates, treatment, and the outcome of the treatment. We recast the problem of learning to personalize from these observational data as a single learning task, which we use to develop four specific machine learning methods to directly address the personalization problem, two with a unique interpretability property. We also show how to validate personalization models on observational data, proposing the new coefficient of personalization as a unitless measure of effectiveness. We demonstrate the power of the new methods in two specific personalized medicine and policymaking applications and show they provide a significant advantage over standard approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 Aug 2016 16:20:59 GMT  (588kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08925v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 22:59:40 GMT  (570kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08925v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 1 Aug 2017 13:12:19 GMT  (673kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08925v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["nathan kallus"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.08925"}
