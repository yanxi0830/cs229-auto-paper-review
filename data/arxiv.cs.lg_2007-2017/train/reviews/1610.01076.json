In this tutorial, we build a neural-based approach to answer questions about images. We base our tutorial on two datasets: (mostly on) DAQUAR, and (a bit on) VQA. With small tweaks the models that we present here can achieve a competitive performance on both datasets, in fact, they are among the best methods that use a combination of LSTM with a global, full frame CNN representation of an image. We hope that after reading this tutorial, the reader will be able to use Deep Learning frameworks, such as Keras and introduced Kraino, to build various architectures that will lead to a further performance improvement on this challenging task.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Oct 2016 16:29:28 GMT  (1299kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01076v1", "The tutorial was presented at '2nd Summer School on Integrating Vision and Language: Deep Learning' in Malta, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "The tutorial was presented at '2nd Summer School on Integrating Vision and Language: Deep Learning' in Malta, 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["mateusz malinowski", "mario fritz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01076"}
