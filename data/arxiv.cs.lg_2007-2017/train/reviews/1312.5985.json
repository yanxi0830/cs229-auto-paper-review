The meaning representations are part of a type-driven tensor-based semantic framework, from the newly emerging field of compositional distributional semantics. Standard techniques from the neural networks literature are used to learn the tensors, which are tested on a selectional preference-style task with a simple 2-dimensional sentence space. Promising results are obtained against a competitive corpus-based baseline. We argue that extending this work beyond transitive verbs, and to higher-dimensional sentence spaces, is an interesting and challenging problem for the machine learning community to consider.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 15:21:15 GMT  (57kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5985v1", "Submitted as part of the open review process for ICLR'14.
