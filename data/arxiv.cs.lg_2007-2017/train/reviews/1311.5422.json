In this paper, we are interested in a less restrictive form of multitask learning, wherein (1) the available features can be organized into subsets according to a notion of similarity and (2) features useful in one task are similar, but not necessarily identical, to the features best suited for other tasks. The main contribution of this paper is a new procedure called Sparse Overlapping Sets (SOS) lasso, a convex optimization that automatically selects similar features for related learning tasks. Error bounds are derived for SOSlasso and its consistency is established for squared error loss. In particular, SOSlasso is motivated by multi- subject fMRI studies in which functional activity is classified using brain voxels as features. Experiments with real and synthetic data demonstrate the advantages of SOSlasso compared to the lasso and group lasso.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Nov 2013 16:45:51 GMT  (448kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5422v1", "To appear in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2013"], ["v2", "Fri, 22 Nov 2013 04:49:54 GMT  (450kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5422v2", "To appear in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["nikhil s rao", "christopher r cox", "robert d nowak", "timothy t rogers"], "accepted": true, "id": "1311.5422"}
