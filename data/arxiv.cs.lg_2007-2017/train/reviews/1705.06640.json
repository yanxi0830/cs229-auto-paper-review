However, systematic testing of large-scale DL systems with thousands of neurons and millions of parameters for all possible corner-cases is a hard problem. Existing DL testing depends heavily on manually labeled data and therefore often fails to expose different erroneous behaviors for rare inputs.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 May 2017 15:09:39 GMT  (7849kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06640v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 4 Jun 2017 23:40:43 GMT  (4771kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06640v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 10 Jul 2017 17:05:40 GMT  (4771kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06640v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 24 Sep 2017 15:55:11 GMT  (5526kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06640v4", "To be published in SOSP'17"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR cs.SE", "authors": ["kexin pei", "yinzhi cao", "junfeng yang", "suman jana"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.06640"}
