This data provides a unique insight into immunological status at the point of tumour removal, tumour classification and post-operative survival. We build on existing research on clustering and machine learning facets of this data to demonstrate a role for an ensemble approach to highlighting patients with clearer prognosis parameters. Results for survival prediction using 3 different approaches are shown for a subset of the data which is most difficult to model. The performance of each model individually is compared with subsets of the data where some agreement is reached for multiple models. Significant improvements in model accuracy on an unseen test set can be achieved for patients where agreement between models is achieved.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Sep 2014 16:52:16 GMT  (585kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0788v1", "IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Virtual Environments for Measurement Systems and Applications (CIVEMSA) 2013, pp. 82 - 86, 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Virtual Environments for Measurement Systems and Applications (CIVEMSA) 2013, pp. 82 - 86, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE", "authors": ["chris roadknight", "uwe aickelin", "john scholefield", "lindy durrant"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.0788"}
