As the volume rises, traditional methods are giving way to machine learning and data science, which are playing an increasingly large part it turning this data into science-driving insights. One rich and interesting source is the bio-logger. These small electronic wearable devices are attached to animals free to roam in their natural habitats, and report back readings from multiple sensors, including GPS and accelerometer bursts. A common use of accelerometer data is for supervised learning of behavioral modes. However, we need unsupervised analysis tools as well, in order to overcome the inherent difficulties of obtaining a labeled dataset, which in some cases is either infeasible or does not successfully encompass the full repertoire of behavioral modes of interest. Here we present a matrix factorization based topic-model method for accelerometer bursts, derived using a linear mixture property of patch features. Our method is validated via comparison to a labeled dataset, and is further compared to standard clustering algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Nov 2015 18:42:04 GMT  (1162kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05082v1", "Invited Extended version of a paper \\cite{resheffmatrix} presented at the international conference \\textit{Data Science and Advanced Analytics}, Paris, France, 19-21 OCtober 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Invited Extended version of a paper \\cite{resheffmatrix} presented at the international conference \\textit{Data Science and Advanced Analytics}, Paris, France, 19-21 OCtober 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yehezkel s resheff", "shay rotics", "ran nathan", "daphna weinshall"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.05082"}
