Existing image description methods are largely restricted by small sets of biased visual paragraph annotations, and fail to cover rich underlying semantics. In this paper, we investigate a semi-supervised paragraph generative framework that is able to synthesize diverse and semantically coherent paragraph descriptions by reasoning over local semantic regions and exploiting linguistic knowledge. The proposed Recurrent Topic-Transition Generative Adversarial Network (RTT-GAN) builds an adversarial framework between a structured paragraph generator and multi-level paragraph discriminators. The paragraph generator generates sentences recurrently by incorporating region-based visual and language attention mechanisms at each step. The quality of generated paragraph sentences is assessed by multi-level adversarial discriminators from two aspects, namely, plausibility at sentence level and topic-transition coherence at paragraph level. The joint adversarial training of RTT-GAN drives the model to generate realistic paragraphs with smooth logical transition between sentence topics. Extensive quantitative experiments on image and video paragraph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our RTT-GAN in both supervised and semi-supervised settings. Qualitative results on telling diverse stories for an image also verify the interpretability of RTT-GAN.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 01:43:12 GMT  (2327kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07022v1", "10 pages, 6 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 20:06:15 GMT  (3728kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07022v2", "10 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["xiaodan liang", "zhiting hu", "hao zhang", "chuang gan", "eric p xing"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07022"}
