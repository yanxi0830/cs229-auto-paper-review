This is usually done through the penalization of predictor functions by Euclidean or Hilbertian norms. In this paper, we explore penalizing by sparsity-inducing norms such as the l1-norm or the block l1-norm. We assume that the kernel decomposes into a large sum of individual basis kernels which can be embedded in a directed acyclic graph; we show that it is then possible to perform kernel selection through a hierarchical multiple kernel learning framework, in polynomial time in the number of selected kernels. This framework is naturally applied to non linear variable selection; our extensive simulations on synthetic datasets and datasets from the UCI repository show that efficiently exploring the large feature space through sparsity-inducing norms leads to state-of-the-art predictive performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 Sep 2008 06:48:10 GMT  (53kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0809.1493v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["francis r bach"], "accepted": true, "id": "0809.1493"}
