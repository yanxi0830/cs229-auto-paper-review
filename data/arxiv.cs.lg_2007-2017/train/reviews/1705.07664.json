In this paper, we introduce a new spectral domain convolutional architecture for deep learning on graphs. The core ingredient of our model is a new class of parametric rational complex functions (Cayley polynomials) allowing to efficiently compute localized regular filters on graphs that specialize on frequency bands of interest. Our model scales linearly with the size of the input data for sparsely-connected graphs, can handle different constructions of Laplacian operators, and typically requires less parameters than previous models. Extensive experimental results show the superior performance of our approach on various graph learning problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 May 2017 11:05:37 GMT  (539kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07664v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ron levie", "federico monti", "xavier bresson", "michael m bronstein"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07664"}
