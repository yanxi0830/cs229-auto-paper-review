The main challenge is how to buck the trend of diminishing returns that is commonly encountered. We present an active learning-style data solicitation algorithm to meet this challenge. We test it, gathering annotations via Amazon Mechanical Turk, and find that we get an order of magnitude increase in performance rates of improvement.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Oct 2014 22:55:48 GMT  (391kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.5877v1", "11 pages, 14 figures; appeared in Proceedings of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, July 2010"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 14 figures; appeared in Proceedings of the 48th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, July 2010", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["michael bloodgood", "chris callison-burch"], "accepted": true, "id": "1410.5877"}
