Two of the challenging questions in such environments are (1) choosing suitable values for MapReduce configuration parameters e.g., number of mappers, number of reducers, and DFS block size, and (2) predicting the amount of resources that a user should lease from the service provider. Currently, the tasks of both choosing configuration parameters and estimating required resources are solely the users responsibilities. In this paper, we present an approach to provision the total CPU usage in clock cycles of jobs in MapReduce environment. For a MapReduce job, a profile of total CPU usage in clock cycles is built from the job past executions with different values of two configuration parameters e.g., number of mappers, and number of reducers. Then, a polynomial regression is used to model the relation between these configuration parameters and total CPU usage in clock cycles of the job. We also briefly study the influence of input data scaling on measured total CPU usage in clock cycles. This derived model along with the scaling result can then be used to provision the total CPU usage in clock cycles of the same jobs with different input data size. We validate the accuracy of our models using three realistic applications (WordCount, Exim MainLog parsing, and TeraSort). Results show that the predicted total CPU usage in clock cycles of generated resource provisioning options are less than 8% of the measured total CPU usage in clock cycles in our 20-node virtual Hadoop cluster.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 14 Mar 2013 22:40:32 GMT  (906kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3632v1", "16 pages- previously published as \"On Modelling and Prediction of Total CPU Usage for Applications in MapReduce Enviornments\" in IEEE 12th International Conference on Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing (ICA3PP-12), Fukuoka, Japan, 4-7 September, 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages- previously published as \"On Modelling and Prediction of Total CPU Usage for Applications in MapReduce Enviornments\" in IEEE 12th International Conference on Algorithms and Architectures for Parallel Processing (ICA3PP-12), Fukuoka, Japan, 4-7 September, 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.LG cs.PF", "authors": ["nikzad babaii rizvandi", "javid taheri", "reza moraveji", "albert y zomaya"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.3632"}
