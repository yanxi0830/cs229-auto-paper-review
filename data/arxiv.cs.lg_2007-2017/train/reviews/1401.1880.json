Music recommendation systems serve as a prominent domain for such works, both from an academic and a commercial perspective. A relatively well known fact in music cognition is that music is experienced in temporal context and in sequence. In this work we present DJ-MC, a reinforcement-learning based framework for music recommendation that does not recommend songs individually but rather song sequences, or playlists, based on a learned model of preferences for both individual songs and song transitions. To reduce exploration time, we initialize a model based on user feedback. This model is subsequently updated by reinforcement. We show our algorithm outperforms a more naive approach, using both real song data and real playlist data to validate our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jan 2014 01:50:09 GMT  (862kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1880v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 25 Mar 2015 18:40:46 GMT  (831kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1880v2", "-Updated to the most recent and completed version (to be presented at AAMAS 2015) -Updated author list. in Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS) 2015, Istanbul, Turkey, May 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["elad liebman", "maytal saar-tsechansky", "peter stone"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.1880"}
