To control overfitting a group p-norm penalty is used to penalize the empirical loss. We consider a reformulation of the problem that lets us implement a randomized version of the proximal point algorithm. The key idea of the new algorithm is to use randomized computation to alleviate the problem of dealing with possibly uncountably many predictors. Finite-time performance bounds are derived that show that under mild conditions the method finds the optimum of the penalized criterion in an efficient manner. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the new algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 May 2012 23:42:57 GMT  (197kb,S)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0288v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 7 Jan 2013 17:42:46 GMT  (120kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.0288v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["arash afkanpour", "andr\u00e1s gy\u00f6rgy", "csaba szepesv\u00e1ri", "michael bowling"], "accepted": true, "id": "1205.0288"}
