This paper presents results from an investigation into using a fuzzy DGP representation within the XCSF Learning Classifier System. In particular, asynchronous Fuzzy Logic Networks are used to represent the traditional condition-action production system rules. It is shown possible to use self-adaptive, open-ended evolution to design an ensemble of such fuzzy dynamical systems within XCSF to solve several well-known continuous-valued test problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Apr 2012 20:40:18 GMT  (47kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.4202v1", "2 page GECCO 2011 poster paper"]], "COMMENTS": "2 page GECCO 2011 poster paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE cs.SY", "authors": ["richard j preen", "larry bull"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.4202"}
