Especially, we focus on more sophisticated units that implement a gating mechanism, such as a long short-term memory (LSTM) unit and a recently proposed gated recurrent unit (GRU). We evaluate these recurrent units on the tasks of polyphonic music modeling and speech signal modeling. Our experiments revealed that these advanced recurrent units are indeed better than more traditional recurrent units such as tanh units. Also, we found GRU to be comparable to LSTM.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Dec 2014 06:46:53 GMT  (856kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.3555v1", "Presented in NIPS 2014 Deep Learning and Representation Learning Workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented in NIPS 2014 Deep Learning and Representation Learning Workshop", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["junyoung chung", "caglar gulcehre", "kyunghyun cho", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.3555"}
