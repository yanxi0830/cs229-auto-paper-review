SAGA improves on the theory behind SAG and SVRG, with better theoretical convergence rates, and has support for composite objectives where a proximal operator is used on the regulariser. Unlike SDCA, SAGA supports non-strongly convex problems directly, and is adaptive to any inherent strong convexity of the problem. We give experimental results showing the effectiveness of our method.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Jul 2014 11:47:56 GMT  (715kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0202v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 22 Jul 2014 06:57:50 GMT  (716kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0202v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 16 Dec 2014 08:44:27 GMT  (725kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0202v3", "Advances In Neural Information Processing Systems, Nov 2014, Montreal, Canada"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.OC stat.ML", "authors": ["aaron defazio", "francis r bach", "simon lacoste-julien"], "accepted": true, "id": "1407.0202"}
