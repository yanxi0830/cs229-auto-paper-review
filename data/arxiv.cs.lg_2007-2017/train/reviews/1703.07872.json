The compositional kernels we use are inspired by the structure of convolutional neural networks and kernels. The resulting scheme yields sparse and efficiently computable features. Each random feature can be represented as an algebraic expression over a small number of (random) paths in a composition tree. Thus, compositional random features can be stored compactly. The discrete nature of the generation process enables de-duplication of repeated features, further compacting the representation and increasing the diversity of the embeddings. Our approach complements and can be combined with previous random feature schemes.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 22:05:04 GMT  (92kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07872v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["amit daniely", "roy frostig", "vineet gupta", "yoram singer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07872"}
