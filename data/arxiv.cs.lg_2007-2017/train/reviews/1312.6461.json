Derived from the integral representation of the neural network, a nonparametric probability distribution of hidden parameters is introduced. In this proposal, hidden parameters are initialized by samples drawn from this distribution, and output parameters are fitted by ordinary linear regression. Numerical experiments show that backpropagation with proposed initialization converges faster than uniformly random initialization. Also it is shown that the proposed method achieves enough accuracy by itself without backpropagation in some cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Dec 2013 03:23:04 GMT  (348kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6461v1", "For ICLR2014"], ["v2", "Tue, 24 Dec 2013 02:54:29 GMT  (349kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6461v2", "For ICLR2014, revised into 9 pages"], ["v3", "Wed, 19 Feb 2014 20:02:05 GMT  (822kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6461v3", "For ICLR2014, revised into 9 pages; revised into 12 pages (with supplements)"]], "COMMENTS": "For ICLR2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["sho sonoda", "noboru murata"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6461"}
