A recurrent neural network is trained to predict the position of an object at time t+1 given a series of selective glimpses into video frames at time steps 1 to t. The proposed recurrent attentive tracking model can be trained using simple gradient-based training. Various settings are explored in experiments on artificial data to justify design choices.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Oct 2015 12:06:56 GMT  (596kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08660v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 21:04:30 GMT  (871kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08660v2", "ICLR 2016 submission"], ["v3", "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 13:47:19 GMT  (907kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08660v3", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v4", "Thu, 28 Apr 2016 07:32:03 GMT  (4670kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08660v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["samira ebrahimi kahou", "vincent michalski", "roland memisevic"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.08660"}
