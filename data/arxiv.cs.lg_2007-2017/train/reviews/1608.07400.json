In particular we study how the long short-term memory (LSTM) can be applied to collaborative filtering, and how it compares to standard nearest neighbors and matrix factorization methods on movie recommendation. We show that the LSTM is competitive in all aspects, and largely outperforms other methods in terms of item coverage and short term predictions.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 Aug 2016 09:20:21 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07400v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 3 Jan 2017 07:41:44 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07400v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["robin devooght", "hugues bersini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.07400"}
