This provides a novel approach, different from the complexity or stability arguments, to study generalization of learning algorithms. We further show that a weak notion of robustness is both sufficient and necessary for generalizability, which implies that robustness is a fundamental property for learning algorithms to work.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 May 2010 01:59:57 GMT  (90kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2243v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["huan xu", "shie mannor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1005.2243"}
