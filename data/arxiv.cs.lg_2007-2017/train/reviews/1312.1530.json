We study a bandit game in which, at each step $t$, an adversary chooses a hidden weight weight vector $s_t$, a player chooses a vertex $\\pi_t$ of the permutahedron and suffers an observed loss of $\\sum_{i=1}^n \\pi(i) s_t(i)$.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 Dec 2013 13:00:23 GMT  (14kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1530v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 6 Jul 2014 12:47:36 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1530v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["nir ailon", "kohei hatano", "eiji takimoto"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.1530"}
