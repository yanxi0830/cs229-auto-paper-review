The presented approach integrates a regression stage to relate topics derived from questions to those derived from question-answer pairs. This helps to avoid problems caused by the differences in vocabulary used within questions and answers, and the tendency for questions to be shorter than answers. The performance of the model is shown to outperform translation methods and topic modelling (without regression) on several real-world datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 12 Jun 2016 23:50:19 GMT  (67kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03783v1", "International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries 2016 (accepted)"]], "COMMENTS": "International Conference on Theory and Practice of Digital Libraries 2016 (accepted)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["pedro chahuara", "thomas lampert", "pierre gancarski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03783"}
