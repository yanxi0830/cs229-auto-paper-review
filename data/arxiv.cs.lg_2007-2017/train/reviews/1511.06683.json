When classes are difficult to discriminate, it makes sense to allow k guesses and evaluate classifiers based on the top-k error instead of the standard zero-one loss. We propose top-k multiclass SVM as a direct method to optimize for top-k performance. Our generalization of the well-known multiclass SVM is based on a tight convex upper bound of the top-k error. We propose a fast optimization scheme based on an efficient projection onto the top-k simplex, which is of its own interest. Experiments on five datasets show consistent improvements in top-k accuracy compared to various baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 16:49:33 GMT  (675kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06683v1", "NIPS 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["maksim lapin", "matthias hein 0001", "bernt schiele"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.06683"}
