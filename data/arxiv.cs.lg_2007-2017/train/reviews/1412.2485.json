While SVMs have been well studied in the batch (offline) setting, there is considerably less work on the streaming (online) setting, which requires only a single pass over the data using sub-linear space. Existing streaming algorithms are not yet competitive with the batch implementation. In this paper, we use the formulation of the SVM as a minimum enclosing ball (MEB) problem to provide a streaming SVM algorithm based off of the blurred ball cover originally proposed by Agarwal and Sharathkumar. Our implementation consistently outperforms existing streaming SVM approaches and provides higher accuracies than libSVM on several datasets, thus making it competitive with the standard SVM batch implementation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Dec 2014 08:46:07 GMT  (177kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2485v1", "2 figures, 8 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "2 figures, 8 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["vikram nathan", "sharath raghvendra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.2485"}
