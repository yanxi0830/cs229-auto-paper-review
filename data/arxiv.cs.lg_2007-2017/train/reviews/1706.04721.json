In particular, we consider how to order targets in the absence of prior knowledge, and how such a curriculum may be enforced when using meta-heuristics to train discrete non-linear models.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 02:08:54 GMT  (458kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04721v1", "Submitted to JMLR Jan. 17"], ["v2", "Wed, 1 Nov 2017 02:57:13 GMT  (459kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04721v2", "Accepted for publication in JMLR issue 18"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to JMLR Jan. 17", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["shannon fenn", "pablo moscato"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.04721"}
