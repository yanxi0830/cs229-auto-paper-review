{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "23-May-2016", "title": "Learning Sensor Multiplexing Design through Back-propagation", "abstract": "Recent progress on many imaging and vision tasks has been driven by the use of deep feed-forward neural networks, which are trained by propagating gradients of a loss defined on the final output, back through the network up to the first layer that operates directly on the image. We propose back-propagating one step further---to learn camera sensor designs jointly with networks that carry out inference on the images they capture. In this paper, we specifically consider the design and inference problems in a typical color camera---where the sensor is able to measure only one color channel at each pixel location, and computational inference is required to reconstruct a full color image. We learn the camera sensor's color multiplexing pattern by encoding it as layer whose learnable weights determine which color channel, from among a fixed set, will be measured at each location. These weights are jointly trained with those of a reconstruction network that operates on the corresponding sensor measurements to produce a full color image. Our network achieves significant improvements in accuracy over the traditional Bayer pattern used in most color cameras. It automatically learns to employ a sparse color measurement approach similar to that of a recent design, and moreover, improves upon that design by learning an optimal layout for these measurements.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 May 2016 16:26:59 GMT  (876kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07078v1", "Project page atthis http URL"], ["v2", "Wed, 2 Nov 2016 18:30:57 GMT  (5465kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07078v2", "NIPS 2016.
