In this paper, we revise the notion of motif support, characterizing it as the number of patterns or repetitions that define a motif. We then propose GENMOTIF, a genetic algorithm to discover motifs with support which, at the same time, is flexible enough to accommodate other motif specifications and task characteristics. GENMOTIF is an anytime algorithm that easily adapts to many situations: searching in a range of segment lengths, applying uniform scaling, dealing with multiple dimensions, using different similarity and grouping criteria, etc. GENMOTIF is also parameter-friendly: it has only two intuitive parameters which, if set within reasonable bounds, do not substantially affect its performance. We demonstrate the value of our approach in a number of synthetic and real-world settings, including traffic volume measurements and accelerometer signals.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Nov 2015 15:14:56 GMT  (2035kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04986v1", "19 pages, 7 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 6 Apr 2016 15:26:45 GMT  (1297kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04986v2", "9 pages, 8 figures"], ["v3", "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 10:12:05 GMT  (1297kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04986v3", "9 pages, 8 figures, code available atthis https URL"], ["v4", "Mon, 5 Dec 2016 13:21:21 GMT  (1338kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04986v4", "9 pages, 8 figures, code available atthis https URL"]], "COMMENTS": "19 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["joan serr\\`a", "aleksandar matic", "josep luis arcos", "alexandros karatzoglou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.04986"}
