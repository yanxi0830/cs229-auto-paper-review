However, this realizability assumption could not be met in practice and few results on the exponential improvement in the sample complexity in the non-realizable case has been obtained. In this paper, we theoretically characterize the sample complexity of active learning in the non-realizable case with Tsybakov noise condition under the multi-view setting. We prove that the sample complexity of active learning with unbounded Tsybakov noise can be $\\widetilde{O}(\\log \\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$, contrasting to that polynomial improvement is the best possible achievement with the same noise condition in single-view setting. We also prove that, contrasting to that in previous polynomial bounds the order of $1/\\epsilon$ is related to the Tsybakov noise condition, in general multi-view setting the sample complexity of active learning with unbounded Tsybakov noise is $\\widetilde{O}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$, where the order of $1/\\epsilon$ is independent of the Tsybakov noise condition.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 May 2010 03:59:35 GMT  (36kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.5581v1", "24 pages, 1 figure"], ["v2", "Fri, 29 Oct 2010 09:44:44 GMT  (35kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.5581v2", "22 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "24 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["wei wang 0028", "zhi-hua zhou"], "accepted": true, "id": "1005.5581"}
