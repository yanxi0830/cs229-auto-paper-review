In this paper, we give a more systematic treatment by summarizing the relevant source information through a convolutional architecture guided by the target information. With different guiding signals during decoding, our specifically designed convolution+gating architectures can pinpoint the parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, and fuse them with the context of entire source sentence to form a unified representation. This representation, together with target language words, are fed to a deep neural network (DNN) to form a stronger NNJM. Experiments on two NIST Chinese-English translation tasks show that the proposed model can achieve significant improvements over the previous NNJM by up to +1.01 BLEU points on average", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Mar 2015 03:04:54 GMT  (343kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01838v1", "10 pages plus 2 pages of references"], ["v2", "Mon, 9 Mar 2015 08:28:32 GMT  (343kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01838v2", "10 pages plus 2 pages of references"], ["v3", "Tue, 10 Mar 2015 01:34:58 GMT  (343kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01838v3", "10 pages plus 2 pages of references"], ["v4", "Fri, 24 Apr 2015 10:07:40 GMT  (343kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01838v4", "10 pages plus 2 pages of references, accepted as a full paper at ACL 2015"], ["v5", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 09:04:14 GMT  (343kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01838v5", "Accepted as a full paper at ACL 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages plus 2 pages of references", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["fandong meng", "zhengdong lu", "mingxuan wang", "hang li", "wenbin jiang", "qun liu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1503.01838"}
