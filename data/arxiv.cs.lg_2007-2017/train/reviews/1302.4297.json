{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-Feb-2013", "title": "Feature Multi-Selection among Subjective Features", "abstract": "When dealing with subjective, noisy, or otherwise nebulous features, the \"wisdom of crowds\" suggests that one may benefit from multiple judgments of the same feature on the same object. We give theoretically-motivated `feature multi-selection' algorithms that choose, among a large set of candidate features, not only which features to judge but how many times to judge each one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for linear regression on a crowdsourced learning task of predicting people's height and weight from photos, using features such as 'gender' and 'estimated weight' as well as culturally fraught ones such as 'attractive'.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Feb 2013 15:00:47 GMT  (145kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4297v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 17 Apr 2013 17:03:56 GMT  (148kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4297v2", "Published in Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2013"], ["v3", "Tue, 14 May 2013 21:35:25 GMT  (136kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4297v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["sivan sabato", "adam kalai"], "accepted": true, "id": "1302.4297"}
