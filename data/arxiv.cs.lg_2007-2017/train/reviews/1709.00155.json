In recent studies, researchers use neural language models and encoder-decoder frameworks for table-to-text generation. However, these neural network-based approaches do not model the order of contents during text generation. When a human writes a summary based on a given table, he or she would probably consider the content order before wording. In a biography, for example, the nationality of a person is typically mentioned before occupation in a biography. In this paper, we propose an order-planning text generation model to capture the relationship between different fields and use such relationship to make the generated text more fluent and smooth. We conducted experiments on the WikiBio dataset and achieve significantly higher performance than previous methods in terms of BLEU, ROUGE, and NIST scores.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Sep 2017 04:46:10 GMT  (1181kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00155v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["lei sha", "lili mou", "tianyu liu", "pascal poupart", "sujian li", "baobao chang", "zhifang sui"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.00155"}
