However, many algorithms used in the process encounter large quantities of patterns, complicating the analysis of the patterns. This fact occurs with association rules, a Data Mining technique that tries to identify intrinsic patterns in large data sets. A method that can help the analysis of the association rules is the use of taxonomies in the step of post-processing knowledge. In this paper, the GART algorithm is proposed, which uses taxonomies to generalize association rules, and the RulEE-GAR computational module, that enables the analysis of the generalized rules.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Dec 2011 23:33:15 GMT  (494kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.1734v1", "ECML/PKDD'05 The Second International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery and Ontologies (KDO'05)"]], "COMMENTS": "ECML/PKDD'05 The Second International Workshop on Knowledge Discovery and Ontologies (KDO'05)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.LG", "authors": ["marcos aur\\'elio domingues", "solange oliveira rezende"], "accepted": false, "id": "1112.1734"}
