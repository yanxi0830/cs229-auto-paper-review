{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "28-Oct-2014", "title": "Non-convex Robust PCA", "abstract": "We propose a new method for robust PCA -- the task of recovering a low-rank matrix from sparse corruptions that are of unknown value and support. Our method involves alternating between projecting appropriate residuals onto the set of low-rank matrices, and the set of sparse matrices; each projection is {\\em non-convex} but easy to compute. In spite of this non-convexity, we establish exact recovery of the low-rank matrix, under the same conditions that are required by existing methods (which are based on convex optimization). For an $m \\times n$ input matrix ($m \\leq n)$, our method has a running time of $O(r^2mn)$ per iteration, and needs $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ iterations to reach an accuracy of $\\epsilon$. This is close to the running time of simple PCA via the power method, which requires $O(rmn)$ per iteration, and $O(\\log(1/\\epsilon))$ iterations. In contrast, existing methods for robust PCA, which are based on convex optimization, have $O(m^2n)$ complexity per iteration, and take $O(1/\\epsilon)$ iterations, i.e., exponentially more iterations for the same accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Oct 2014 15:33:13 GMT  (553kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.7660v1", "Extended abstract to appear in NIPS 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Extended abstract to appear in NIPS 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ML", "authors": ["praneeth netrapalli", "u n niranjan", "sujay sanghavi", "animashree anandkumar", "prateek jain 0002"], "accepted": true, "id": "1410.7660"}
