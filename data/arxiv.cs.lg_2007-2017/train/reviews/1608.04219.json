However, it can be expensive, with worst case complexity doubly exponential in the size of the input. Hence it is important to formulate the problem in the best manner for the CAD algorithm. One possibility is to precondition the input polynomials using Groebner Basis (GB) theory. Previous experiments have shown that while this can often be very beneficial to the CAD algorithm, for some problems it can significantly worsen the CAD performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Aug 2016 09:44:29 GMT  (168kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04219v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SC cs.LG", "authors": ["zongyan huang", "matthew england", "james h davenport", "lawrence c paulson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.04219"}
