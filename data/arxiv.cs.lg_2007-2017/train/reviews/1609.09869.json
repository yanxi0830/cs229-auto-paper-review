They admit an intuitive probabilistic interpretation, have a simple functional form, and enjoy widespread adoption. We introduce a unified algorithm to efficiently learn a broad class of linear and non-linear state space models, including variants where the emission and transition distributions are modeled by deep neural networks. Our learning algorithm simultaneously learns a compiled inference network and the generative model, leveraging a structured variational approximation parameterized by recurrent neural networks to mimic the posterior distribution. We apply the learning algorithm to both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its scalability and versatility. We find that using the structured approximation to the posterior results in models with significantly higher held-out likelihood.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 19:53:11 GMT  (2875kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09869v1", "Main paper: 13 pages, 12 Figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 5 Dec 2016 19:10:10 GMT  (996kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09869v2", "To appear in the Thirty-First AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, February 2017, 13 pages, 11 figures with supplement, changed to AAAI formatting style, added references"]], "COMMENTS": "Main paper: 13 pages, 12 Figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["rahul g krishnan", "uri shalit", "david sontag"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.09869"}
