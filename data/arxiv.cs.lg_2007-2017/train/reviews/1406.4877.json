In this paper, we review and apply these algorithms to music. To evaluate this summarization's performance, we adopt an extrinsic approach: we compare a Fado Genre Classifier's performance using truncated contiguous clips against the summaries extracted with those algorithms on 2 different datasets. We show that Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR), LexRank and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) all improve classification performance in both datasets used for testing.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Jun 2014 20:10:22 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4877v1", "12 pages, 1 table; Submitted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 1 table; Submitted to IEEE Signal Processing Letters", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG cs.SD", "authors": ["francisco raposo", "ricardo ribeiro", "david martins de matos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.4877"}
