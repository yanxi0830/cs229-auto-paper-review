{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "14-Jun-2016", "title": "Logic Tensor Networks: Deep Learning and Logical Reasoning from Data and Knowledge", "abstract": "We propose real logic: a uniform framework for integrating automatic learning and reasoning. Real logic is defined on a full first-order language where formulas have truth-value in the interval [0,1] and semantics defined concretely on the domain of real numbers. Logical constants are interpreted as (feature) vectors of real numbers. Real logic promotes a well-founded integration of deductive reasoning on knowledge-bases with efficient, data-driven relational machine learning. We show how Real Logic can be implemented in deep Tensor Neural Networks with the use of Google's TensorFlow primitives. The paper concludes with experiments on a simple but representative example of knowledge completion.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 15:25:28 GMT  (29kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04422v1", "12 pages, 2 figs, 1 table, 27 references"], ["v2", "Thu, 7 Jul 2016 12:28:57 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04422v2", "12 pages, 2 figs, 1 table, 27 references"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 2 figs, 1 table, 27 references", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.LO cs.NE", "authors": ["luciano serafini", "artur d'avila garcez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04422"}
