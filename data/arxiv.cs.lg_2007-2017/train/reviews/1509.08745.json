They are particularly attractive because of their ability to 'absorb' great quantities of labeled data through millions of parameters. However, as the accuracy and the model sizes increase, so does the memory requirements of the classifiers. This prohibits their usage on resource limited hardware, including cell phones or other embedded devices.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Sep 2015 13:32:30 GMT  (395kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08745v1", "Under review as a conference paper at SPL 2015. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1412.6115by other authors"], ["v2", "Thu, 12 Nov 2015 10:22:13 GMT  (150kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08745v2", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1412.6115by other authors"], ["v3", "Mon, 16 Nov 2015 13:08:50 GMT  (161kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08745v3", null], ["v4", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 12:58:32 GMT  (162kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08745v4", null], ["v5", "Fri, 18 Mar 2016 09:33:01 GMT  (66kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.08745v5", null]], "COMMENTS": "Under review as a conference paper at SPL 2015. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1412.6115by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["guillaume souli\\'e", "vincent gripon", "ma\\\"elys robert"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.08745"}
