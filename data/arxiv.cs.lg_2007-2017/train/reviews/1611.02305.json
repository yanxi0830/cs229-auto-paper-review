Incomplete observations are a major concern as most (online and real-world) social networks are not fully observable. We establish both proper and improper PAC learnability of influence functions under randomly missing observations. Proper PAC learnability under the Discrete-Time Linear Threshold (DLT) and Discrete-Time Independent Cascade (DIC) models is established by reducing incomplete observations to complete observations in a modified graph. Our improper PAC learnability result applies for the DLT and DIC models as well as the Continuous-Time Independent Cascade (CIC) model. It is based on a parametrization in terms of reachability features, and also gives rise to an efficient and practical heuristic. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the ability of our method to compensate even for a fairly large fraction of missing observations.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 21:28:40 GMT  (115kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02305v1", "Full version of paper \"Learning Influence Functions from Incomplete Observations\" in NIPS16"]], "COMMENTS": "Full version of paper \"Learning Influence Functions from Incomplete Observations\" in NIPS16", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["xinran he", "ke xu", "david kempe 0001", "yan liu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.02305"}
