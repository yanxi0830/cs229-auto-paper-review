Such structures arise in the context of social networks or protein interactions where underlying graphs have adjacency matrices which are block-diagonal in the appropriate basis. We introduce a convex mixed penalty which involves $\\ell_1$-norm and trace norm simultaneously. We obtain an oracle inequality which indicates how the two effects interact according to the nature of the target matrix. We bound generalization error in the link prediction problem. We also develop proximal descent strategies to solve the optimization problem efficiently and evaluate performance on synthetic and real data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (632kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6474v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG cs.NA stat.ML", "authors": ["pierre-andr\u00e9 savalle", "emile richard", "nicolas vayatis"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6474"}
