It is implemented in a distributed fashion in order to address these scalability issues. The work is parallelized across a number of computing nodes. It is usually hard to estimate in advance how many nodes to use for a particular workload. We propose a simple framework for estimating the scalability of distributed machine learning algorithms. We measure the scalability by means of the speedup an algorithm achieves with more nodes. We propose time complexity models for gradient descent and graphical model inference. We validate our models with experiments on deep learning training and belief propagation. This framework was used to study the scalability of machine learning algorithms in Apache Spark.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 03:28:40 GMT  (104kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06276v1", "6 pages, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Sat, 25 Mar 2017 02:17:04 GMT  (104kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06276v2", "6 pages, 4 figures, appears at ICDE 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DC", "authors": ["alexander ulanov", "rey simanovsky", "manish marwah"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06276"}
