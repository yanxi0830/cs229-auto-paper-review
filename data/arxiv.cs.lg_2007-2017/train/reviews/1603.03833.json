In addition, these environments and users are not suitable for the collection of massive amounts of training data, as the manipulated objects can be fragile, and the wheelchair-bound users might have difficulty recovering from a failed manipulation task.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 12 Mar 2016 00:47:38 GMT  (1949kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03833v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 15 Sep 2016 23:56:19 GMT  (2964kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03833v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["rouhollah rahmatizadeh", "pooya abolghasemi", "aman behal", "ladislau b\\\"ol\\\"oni"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.03833"}
