Users show differences in their regular behaviours and clustering households into similar groupings based on this variability provides for efficient targeting of initiatives. Those people who are stuck into a regular pattern of activity may be the least receptive to an initiative to change behaviour. A sample of 180 households from the UK are clustered into four groups as an initial test of the concept and useful, actionable groupings are found.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Jul 2013 14:47:42 GMT  (114kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2111v1", "Digital Futures 2012, Aberdeen, UK, 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "Digital Futures 2012, Aberdeen, UK, 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE", "authors": ["ian dent", "tony craig", "uwe aickelin", "tom rodden"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.2111"}
