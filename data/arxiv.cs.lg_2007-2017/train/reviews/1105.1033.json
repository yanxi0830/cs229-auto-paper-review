The algorithm samples responses to adaptively chosen triplet-based relative-similarity queries. Each query has the form \"is object 'a' more similar to 'b' or to 'c'?\" and is chosen to be maximally informative given the preceding responses. The output is an embedding of the objects into Euclidean space (like MDS); we refer to this as the \"crowd kernel.\"", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 May 2011 11:03:03 GMT  (3710kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1033v1", "9 pages, 7 figures, Accepted to the 28th, International Conference on Machine Learning, 2011"], ["v2", "Sat, 25 Jun 2011 21:54:08 GMT  (3805kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.1033v2", "9 pages, 7 figures, Accepted to the 28th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 7 figures, Accepted to the 28th, International Conference on Machine Learning, 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["omer tamuz", "ce liu", "serge j belongie", "ohad shamir", "adam kalai"], "accepted": true, "id": "1105.1033"}
