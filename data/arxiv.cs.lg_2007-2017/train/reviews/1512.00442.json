We argue this is caused in part by inherent deficiencies of space partitioning, which is the underlying strategy used by almost all existing methods. We devise a new strategy that avoids partitioning the vector space and present a novel randomized algorithm that runs in time linear in dimensionality and sub-linear in the size of the dataset and takes space constant in dimensionality and linear in the size of the dataset. The proposed algorithm allows fine-grained control over accuracy and speed on a per-query basis, automatically adapts to variations in dataset density, supports dynamic updates to the dataset and is easy-to-implement. We show appealing theoretical properties and demonstrate empirically that the proposed algorithm outperforms locality-sensitivity hashing (LSH) in terms of approximation quality and speed.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Dec 2015 20:53:16 GMT  (862kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00442v1", "11 pages, 5 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 18:47:10 GMT  (681kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00442v2", "13 pages, 6 figures; International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2016"], ["v3", "Thu, 6 Apr 2017 06:51:49 GMT  (681kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00442v3", "13 pages, 6 figures; International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2016.
