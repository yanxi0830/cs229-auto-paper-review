In this paper, we investigate how to learn cross-modal scene representations that transfer across modalities. To study this problem, we introduce a new cross-modal scene dataset. While convolutional neural networks can categorize scenes well, they also learn an intermediate representation not aligned across modalities, which is undesirable for cross-modal transfer applications. We present methods to regularize cross-modal convolutional neural networks so that they have a shared representation that is agnostic of the modality. Our experiments suggest that our scene representation can help transfer representations across modalities for retrieval. Moreover, our visualizations suggest that units emerge in the shared representation that tend to activate on consistent concepts independently of the modality.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Oct 2016 20:24:36 GMT  (4689kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09003v1", "See more atthis http URLarXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1607.07295"]], "COMMENTS": "See more atthis http URLarXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1607.07295", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.MM", "authors": ["yusuf aytar", "lluis castrejon", "carl vondrick", "hamed pirsiavash", "antonio torralba"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09003"}
