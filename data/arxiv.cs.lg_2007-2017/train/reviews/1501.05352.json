{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "21-Jan-2015", "title": "Optimizing affinity-based binary hashing using auxiliary coordinates", "abstract": "In binary hashing, one wants to learn a function that maps a high-dimensional feature vector to a vector of binary codes, for application to fast image retrieval. This typically results in a difficult optimization problem, nonconvex and nonsmooth, because of the discrete variables involved. Much work has simply relaxed the problem during training, solving a continuous optimization, and truncating the codes a posteriori. This gives reasonable results but is suboptimal. Recent work has applied alternating optimization to the objective over the binary codes and achieved better results, but the hash function was still learned a posteriori, which remains suboptimal. We propose a general framework for learning hash functions using affinity-based loss functions that closes the loop and optimizes jointly over the hash functions and the binary codes. The resulting algorithm can be seen as a corrected, iterated version of the procedure of optimizing first over the codes and then learning the hash function. Compared to this, our optimization is guaranteed to obtain better hash functions while being not much slower, as demonstrated experimentally in various supervised and unsupervised datasets. In addition, the framework facilitates the design of optimization algorithms for arbitrary types of loss and hash functions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 Jan 2015 23:53:47 GMT  (64kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05352v1", "18 pages, 7 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 5 Feb 2016 01:25:26 GMT  (230kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05352v2", "22 pages, 12 figures; added new experiments and references"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV math.OC stat.ML", "authors": ["ramin raziperchikolaei", "miguel \u00e1 carreira-perpi\u00f1\u00e1n"], "accepted": true, "id": "1501.05352"}
