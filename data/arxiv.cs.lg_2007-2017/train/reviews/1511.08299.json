Examining twitter data presents unique challenges in that the samples are short (under 140 characters) and often contain misspellings or abbreviations that are trivial for a human to decipher but difficult for a computer to parse. A variety of query and document expansion techniques are implemented in an effort to improve information retrieval to modest success.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 06:57:06 GMT  (463kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08299v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["matthew long", "aditya jami", "ashutosh saxena"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.08299"}
