{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Mar-2015", "title": "Deep Convolutional Inverse Graphics Network", "abstract": "This paper presents the Deep Convolution Inverse Graphics Network (DC-IGN) that aims to learn an interpretable representation of images that is disentangled with respect to various transformations such as object out-of-plane rotations, lighting variations, and texture. The DC-IGN model is composed of multiple layers of convolution and de-convolution operators and is trained using the Stochastic Gradient Variational Bayes (SGVB) algorithm. We propose training procedures to encourage neurons in the graphics code layer to have semantic meaning and force each group to distinctly represent a specific transformation (pose,light,texture,shape etc.). Given a static face image, our model can re-generate the input image with different pose, lighting or even texture and shape variations from the base face. We present qualitative and quantitative results of the model's efficacy to learn a 3D rendering engine. Moreover, we also utilize the learnt representation for two important visual recognition tasks: (1) an invariant face recognition task and (2) using the representation as a summary statistic for generative modeling.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Mar 2015 04:08:42 GMT  (8277kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03167v1", "First two authors contributed equally"], ["v2", "Mon, 16 Mar 2015 04:57:24 GMT  (8267kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03167v2", "First two authors contributed equally"], ["v3", "Tue, 17 Mar 2015 02:22:07 GMT  (8267kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03167v3", "First two authors contributed equally"], ["v4", "Mon, 22 Jun 2015 02:10:00 GMT  (8878kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03167v4", "First two authors contributed equally"]], "COMMENTS": "First two authors contributed equally", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.GR cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["tejas d kulkarni", "william f whitney", "pushmeet kohli", "joshua b tenenbaum"], "accepted": true, "id": "1503.03167"}
