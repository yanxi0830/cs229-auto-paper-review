Profiling thread behavior, allows the system to allocate each thread its resources in a way that improves overall system performance. We study an online resource al- locationproblem,wherearesourcemanagersimulta- neously allocates resources (exploration), learns the impact on the different consumers (learning) and im- proves allocation towards optimal performance (ex- ploitation). We build on the rich framework of multi- armed bandits and present online and offline algo- rithms. Through extensive experiments with both synthetic data and real-world cache allocation to threads we show the merits and properties of our al- gorithms", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 31 Jan 2016 19:53:49 GMT  (215kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00309v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yonatan glassner", "koby crammer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.00309"}
