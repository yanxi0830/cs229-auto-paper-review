The crucial component here is the choice of the right similarity measure. We make a step towards a general learning-based solution that can be adapted to specific situations and present a metric based on a convolutional neural network. Our network can be trained from scratch even from a few aligned image pairs. The metric is validated on intersubject deformable registration on a dataset different from the one used for training, demonstrating good generalization. In this task, we outperform mutual information by a significant margin.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 17 Sep 2016 21:46:21 GMT  (752kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05396v1", "Accepted to MICCAI 2016; extended version"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to MICCAI 2016; extended version", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["martin simonovsky", "benjam\\'in guti\\'errez-becker", "diana mateus", "nassir navab", "nikos komodakis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.05396"}
