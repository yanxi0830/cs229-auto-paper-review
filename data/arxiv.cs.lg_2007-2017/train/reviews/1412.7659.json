{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "24-Dec-2014", "title": "Transformation Properties of Learned Visual Representations", "abstract": "When a three-dimensional object moves through a scene, a corresponding change occurs on the image plane and in the visual representation constructed by a learning algorithm. Starting with the idea that a good representation is one that transforms linearly under scene motions, we use standard results from group representation theory to show that any such representation is equivalent to a combination of particularly simple irreducible representations. We derive a striking relationship between irreducibility and the statistical dependency structure of the representation. Under partial observability, as induced by the perspective projection of a scene onto the image plane, the motion group does not have a linear action on the space of images, so that it becomes necessary to perform inference over a latent representation that does transform linearly. This idea is demonstrated in a model of rotating NORB objects that employs a latent representation of the non-commutative 3D rotation group SO(3).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Dec 2014 13:19:20 GMT  (437kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7659v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 3 Mar 2015 04:46:00 GMT  (439kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7659v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 7 Apr 2015 21:20:04 GMT  (439kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7659v3", "T.S.
