We study how the concept of object can be grounded in the sensorimotor experience of a naive agent. Without any knowledge about itself or the world it is immersed in, the agent explores its sensorimotor space and identifies objects as consistent networks of sensorimotor transitions, independent from their context. A fundamental drive for prediction is assumed to explain the emergence of such networks from a developmental standpoint. An algorithm is proposed and tested to illustrate the approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 15:05:08 GMT  (1093kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08009v1", "7 pages, 4 figures, ICDL-Epirob 2015 conference"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 4 figures, ICDL-Epirob 2015 conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.LG", "authors": ["alban laflaqui\\`ere", "nikolas hemion"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.08009"}
