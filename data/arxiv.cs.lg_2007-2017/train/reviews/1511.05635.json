This new module is inspired by the inception module, where we replace the original collaborative pooling stage (consisting of a concatenation of the multi-scale filter outputs) by a competitive pooling represented by a maxout activation unit. This extension has the following two objectives: 1) the selection of the maximum response among the multi-scale filters prevents filter co-adaptation and allows the formation of multiple sub-networks within the same model, which has been shown to facilitate the training of complex learning problems; and 2) the maxout unit reduces the dimensionality of the outputs from the multi-scale filters. We show that the use of our proposed module in typical deep ConvNets produces classification results that are either better than or comparable to the state of the art on the following benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 01:19:00 GMT  (1701kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05635v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["zhibin liao", "gustavo carneiro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.05635"}
