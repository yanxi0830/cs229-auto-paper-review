Early approaches to this problem were conservative, in which the main focus was protection against the worst case scenario. But recently several algorithms have been developed for tightening the regret bounds in easy data instances such as sparsity, predictable sequences, and curved losses. In this work we unify some of these existing techniques to obtain new update rules for the cases when these easy instances occur together. First we analyse an adaptive and optimistic update rule which achieves tighter regret bound when the loss sequence is sparse and predictable. Then we explain an update rule that dynamically adapts to the curvature of the loss function and utilizes the predictable nature of the loss sequence as well. Finally we extend these results to composite losses.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Sep 2016 11:52:05 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02383v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["parameswaran kamalaruban"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.02383"}
