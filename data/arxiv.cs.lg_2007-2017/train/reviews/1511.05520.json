{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "17-Nov-2015", "title": "Automatic Instrument Recognition in Polyphonic Music Using Convolutional Neural Networks", "abstract": "Traditional methods to tackle many music information retrieval tasks typically follow a two-step architecture: feature engineering followed by a simple learning algorithm. In these \"shallow\" architectures, feature engineering and learning are typically disjoint and unrelated. Additionally, feature engineering is difficult, and typically depends on extensive domain expertise.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 19:43:53 GMT  (2068kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05520v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.IR cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["peter li", "jiyuan qian", "tian wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.05520"}
