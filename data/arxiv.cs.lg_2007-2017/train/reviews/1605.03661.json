We consider the task of answering counterfactual questions such as, \"Would this patient have lower blood sugar had she received a different medication?\". We propose a new algorithmic framework for counterfactual inference which brings together ideas from domain adaptation and representation learning. In addition to a theoretical justification, we perform an empirical comparison with previous approaches to causal inference from observational data. Our deep learning algorithm significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 May 2016 02:59:40 GMT  (193kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03661v1", "To appear in ICML 2016"], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 17:04:07 GMT  (194kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.03661v2", "Appearing in ICML 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in ICML 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["fredrik d johansson", "uri shalit", "david sontag"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.03661"}
