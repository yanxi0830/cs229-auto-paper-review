In this paper, we provide precise information theoretic bounds on the clustering accuracy and sample complexity of learning a mixture of two isotropic Gaussians in high dimensions under small mean separation. If there is a sparse subset of relevant dimensions that determine the mean separation, then the sample complexity only depends on the number of relevant dimensions and mean separation, and can be achieved by a simple computationally efficient procedure. Our results provide the first step of a theoretical basis for recent methods that combine feature selection and clustering.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 9 Jun 2013 16:28:56 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2035v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG math.ST stat.TH", "authors": ["martin azizyan", "aarti singh", "larry a wasserman"], "accepted": true, "id": "1306.2035"}
