This problem is motivated by modern applications such as recommender systems and social networks where only \"likes\" or \"friendships\" are observed. The problem of learning from only positive and unlabeled examples, called PU (positive-unlabeled) learning, has been studied in the context of binary classification. We consider the PU matrix completion problem, where an underlying real-valued matrix M is first quantized to generate one-bit observations and then a subset of positive entries is revealed. Under the assumption that M has bounded nuclear norm, we provide recovery guarantees for two different observation models: 1) M parameterizes a distribution that generates a binary matrix, 2) M is thresholded to obtain a binary matrix. For the first case, we propose a \"shifted matrix completion\" method that recovers M using only a subset of indices corresponding to ones, while for the second case, we propose a \"biased matrix completion\" method that recovers the (thresholded) binary matrix. Both methods yield strong error bounds --- if M is n by n, the Frobenius error is bounded as O(1/((1-rho)n), where 1-rho denotes the fraction of ones observed. This implies a sample complexity of O(n\\log n) ones to achieve a small error, when M is dense and n is large. We extend our methods and guarantees to the inductive matrix completion problem, where rows and columns of M have associated features. We provide efficient and scalable optimization procedures for both the methods and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for link prediction (on real-world networks consisting of over 2 million nodes and 90 million links) and semi-supervised clustering tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 22 Nov 2014 04:37:15 GMT  (167kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6081v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NA stat.ML", "authors": ["cho-jui hsieh", "nagarajan natarajan", "inderjit s dhillon"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.6081"}
