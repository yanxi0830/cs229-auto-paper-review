Based on a model with a low-rank component plus a sparse perturbation, and an initial graph estimation, our proposed algorithm simultaneously learns the low-rank component and refines the graph. Our evaluations using synthetic and real brain imaging data in unsupervised and supervised classification tasks demonstrate encouraging performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 23:24:27 GMT  (542kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08221v1", "Submitted to ICASSP 2017"], ["v2", "Mon, 9 Jan 2017 03:23:43 GMT  (1172kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08221v2", "Accepted by ICASSP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to ICASSP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["rui liu", "hossein nejati", "ngai-man cheung"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.08221"}
