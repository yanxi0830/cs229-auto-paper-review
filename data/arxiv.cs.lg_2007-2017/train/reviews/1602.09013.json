We consider moment matching techniques for estimation in these models. For that, by drawing explicit links between the new models and a discrete version of independent component analysis (DICA), we first extend the DICA cumulant tensors to the new discrete version of CCA. By further using a close connection with independent component analysis, we introduce generalized covariance matrices, which can replace the cumulant tensors in the moment matching framework, and, therefore, improve sample complexity and simplify derivations and algorithms significantly. As the tensor power method or orthogonal joint diagonalization are not applicable in the new setting, we use non-orthogonal joint diagonalization techniques for matching the cumulants. We demonstrate performance of the proposed models and estimation techniques on experiments with both synthetic and real datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 15:51:50 GMT  (117kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.09013v1", "26 pages, under review"], ["v2", "Fri, 3 Jun 2016 14:06:23 GMT  (130kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.09013v2", "Appears in: Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2016). 22 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "26 pages, under review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["anastasia podosinnikova", "francis r bach", "simon lacoste-julien"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.09013"}
