Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool in discovering dimensionality of data sets with a linear structure; it, however, becomes ineffective when data have a nonlinear structure. In this paper, we propose a new PCA-based method to estimate intrinsic dimension of data with nonlinear structures. Our method works by first finding a minimal cover of the data set, then performing PCA locally on each subset in the cover and finally giving the estimation result by checking up the data variance on all small neighborhood regions. The proposed method utilizes the whole data set to estimate its intrinsic dimension and is convenient for incremental learning. In addition, our new PCA procedure can filter out noise in data and converge to a stable estimation with the neighborhood region size increasing. Experiments on synthetic and real world data sets show effectiveness of the proposed method.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Feb 2010 10:16:57 GMT  (988kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2050v1", "8 pages, submitted for publication"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, submitted for publication", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["mingyu fan", "nannan gu", "hong qiao", "bo zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1002.2050"}
