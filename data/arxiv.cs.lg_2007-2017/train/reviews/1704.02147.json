Motivated by the fact that most work on hierarchical clustering was based on providing algorithms, rather than optimizing a specific objective, Dasgupta framed similarity-based hierarchical clustering as a combinatorial optimization problem, where a `good' hierarchical clustering is one that minimizes some cost function. He showed that this cost function has certain desirable properties.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Apr 2017 09:14:28 GMT  (71kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02147v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["vincent cohen-addad", "varun kanade", "frederik mallmann-trenn", "claire mathieu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.02147"}
