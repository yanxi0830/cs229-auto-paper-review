Temporal data arise in these real-world applications often involves a mixture of long-term and short-term patterns, for which traditional approaches such as Autoregressive models and Gaussian Process may fail. In this paper, we proposed a novel deep learning framework, namely Long- and Short-term Time-series network (LSTNet), to address this open challenge. LSTNet uses the Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to extract short-term local dependency patterns among variables, and the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to discover long-term patterns and trends. In our evaluation on real-world data with complex mixtures of repetitive patterns, LSTNet achieved significant performance improvements over that of several state-of-the-art baseline methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 00:33:36 GMT  (1198kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07015v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 5 Jul 2017 01:24:10 GMT  (1204kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07015v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["guokun lai", "wei-cheng chang", "yiming yang", "hanxiao liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07015"}
