We propose a deep dynamic neural network model built on a dynamic vision network, a motor generation network, and a higher-level network. The proposed model was designed to process and to integrate direct perception of dynamic visuomotor patterns in a hierarchical model characterized by different spatial and temporal constraints imposed on each level. We conducted synthetic robotic experiments in which a robot learned to read human's intention through observing the gestures and then to generate the corresponding goal-directed actions. Results verify that the proposed model is able to learn the tutored skills and to generalize them to novel situations. The model showed synergic coordination of perception, action and decision making, and it integrated and coordinated a set of cognitive skills including visual perception, intention reading, attention switching, working memory, action preparation and execution in a seamless manner. Analysis reveals that coherent internal representations emerged at each level of the hierarchy. Higher-level representation reflecting actional intention developed by means of continuous integration of the lower-level visuo-proprioceptive stream.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 01:15:00 GMT  (1791kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02423v1", "Accepted in the IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems (TCDS), 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted in the IEEE Transactions on Cognitive and Developmental Systems (TCDS), 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO", "authors": ["jungsik hwang", "jun tani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02423"}
