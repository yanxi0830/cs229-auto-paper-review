The first problem is that \"everybody\" wants to format their code differently, leading to either many formatter variants or a ridiculous number of configuration options. Second, the size of each implementation scales with a language's grammar size, leading to hundreds of rules.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Jun 2016 20:04:07 GMT  (203kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08866v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["terence parr", "jurgin vinju"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.08866"}
