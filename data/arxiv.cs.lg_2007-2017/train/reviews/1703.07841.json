Unlike other RNN models that attempt to maximize the overall conditional log probability of sentences against sentences, our model focuses a classification approach of estimating the conditional probability of the next word given the input sequence. This simpler approach using GRUs was hoped to be comparable with more complicated RNN models, but achievements in this implementation were modest and there remains a lot of room for improving this classification approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 20:31:47 GMT  (36kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07841v1", "7 pages, 1 figure; graduate course research project"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 1 figure; graduate course research project", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["ri wang", "maysum panju", "mahmood gohari"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07841"}
