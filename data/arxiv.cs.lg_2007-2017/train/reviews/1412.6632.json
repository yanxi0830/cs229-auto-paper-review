{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Dec-2014", "title": "Deep Captioning with Multimodal Recurrent Neural Networks (m-RNN)", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a multimodal Recurrent Neural Network (m-RNN) model for generating novel image captions. It directly models the probability distribution of generating a word given previous words and an image. Image captions are generated by sampling from this distribution. The model consists of two sub-networks: a deep recurrent neural network for sentences and a deep convolutional network for images. These two sub-networks interact with each other in a multimodal layer to form the whole m-RNN model. The effectiveness of our model is validated on four benchmark datasets (IAPR TC-12, Flickr 8K, Flickr 30K and MS COCO). Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the m-RNN model can be applied to retrieval tasks for retrieving images or sentences, and achieves significant performance improvement over the state-of-the-art methods which directly optimize the ranking objective function for retrieval.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 Dec 2014 08:10:04 GMT  (404kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6632v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1410.1090"], ["v2", "Fri, 26 Dec 2014 08:24:11 GMT  (485kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6632v2", "Add performance comparisons with different variants of m-RNN model to show the importance of different components. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1410.1090"], ["v3", "Tue, 10 Mar 2015 04:17:48 GMT  (486kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6632v3", "Revision according to the comments and suggestions from ICLR 2015 reviewers (e.g. Add some details for section 5, 6; Fix typos).
