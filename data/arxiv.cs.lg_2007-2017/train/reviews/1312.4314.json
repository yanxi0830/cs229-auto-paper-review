This is achieved by training a \"gating\" network that maps each input to a distribution over the experts. Such models show promise for building larger networks that are still cheap to compute at test time, and more parallelizable at training time. In this this work, we extend the Mixture of Experts to a stacked model, the Deep Mixture of Experts, with multiple sets of gating and experts. This exponentially increases the number of effective experts by associating each input with a combination of experts at each layer, yet maintains a modest model size. On a randomly translated version of the MNIST dataset, we find that the Deep Mixture of Experts automatically learns to develop location-dependent (\"where\") experts at the first layer, and class-specific (\"what\") experts at the second layer. In addition, we see that the different combinations are in use when the model is applied to a dataset of speech monophones. These demonstrate effective use of all expert combinations.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Dec 2013 11:15:10 GMT  (1495kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4314v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 19 Feb 2014 17:57:53 GMT  (1496kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4314v2", null], ["v3", "Sun, 9 Mar 2014 20:15:03 GMT  (1496kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4314v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["david eigen", "marc'aurelio ranzato", "ilya sutskever"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.4314"}
