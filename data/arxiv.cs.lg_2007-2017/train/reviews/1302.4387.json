We measure the player's performance using a new notion of regret, also known as policy regret, which better captures the adversary's adaptiveness to the player's behavior. In a setting where losses are allowed to drift, we characterize ---in a nearly complete manner--- the power of adaptive adversaries with bounded memories and switching costs. In particular, we show that with switching costs, the attainable rate with bandit feedback is $\\Theta(T^{2/3})$. Interestingly, this rate is significantly worse than the $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$ rate attainable with switching costs in the full information case. Via a novel reduction from experts to bandits, we also show that a bounded memory adversary can force $\\Theta(T^{2/3})$ regret even in the full information case, proving that switching costs are easier to control than bounded memory adversaries. Our lower bounds rely on a new stochastic adversary strategy that generates loss processes with strong dependencies.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Feb 2013 18:46:37 GMT  (154kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4387v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 1 Jun 2013 09:35:15 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4387v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["nicol\u00f2 cesa-bianchi", "ofer dekel", "ohad shamir"], "accepted": true, "id": "1302.4387"}
