An example for a pattern is a time-series representing a heart rate during a specific time-range, wherein the time-series is a sequence of data points that represent the changes in the heart rate values. A bio-medical simulator system was developed to acquire a collection of 7,871 price patterns of financial instruments. The financial instruments traded in real-time on three American stock exchanges, NASDAQ, NYSE, and AMEX, simulate bio-medical measurements. The system simulates a human in which each price pattern represents one bio-medical sensor. Data provided during trading hours from the stock exchanges allowed real-time classification. Classification is based on new machine learning techniques: self-labeling, which allows the application of supervised learning methods on unlabeled time-series and similarity ranking, which applied on a decision tree learning algorithm to classify time-series regardless of type and quantity.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 12 May 2013 22:00:09 GMT  (400kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0541v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1303.0073"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1303.0073", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE", "authors": ["uri kartoun"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.0541"}
