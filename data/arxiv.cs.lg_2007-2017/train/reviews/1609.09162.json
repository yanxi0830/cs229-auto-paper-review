We also propose a span bound for MU-SVM that can be used for model selection thereby avoiding resampling. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of MU-SVM and the proposed bound.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 00:43:03 GMT  (728kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09162v1", "14 pages, 12 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 12 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["sauptik dhar", "naveen ramakrishnan", "vladimir cherkassky", "mohak shah"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.09162"}
