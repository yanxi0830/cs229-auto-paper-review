We introduce stochastic approximation algorithms that apply this learning scenario to probabilistic structured prediction, with a focus on asymptotic convergence and ease of elicitability of feedback. We present simulation experiments for complex natural language processing tasks, showing fastest empirical convergence and smallest empirical variance for stochastic optimization of a non-convex pairwise preference learning objective compared to stochastic optimization of related non-convex and convex objectives.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 16:06:29 GMT  (25kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00739v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 2 Nov 2016 16:29:42 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00739v2", "30th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["artem sokolov", "julia kreutzer", "stefan riezler", "christopher lo"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.00739"}
