We show how to use order-revealing encryption to separate computationally efficient PAC learning from efficient $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$-differentially private PAC learning. That is, we construct a concept class that is efficiently PAC learnable, but for which every efficient learner fails to be differentially private. This answers a question of Kasiviswanathan et al. (FOCS '08, SIAM J. Comput. '11).", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 3 May 2015 02:23:49 GMT  (36kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00388v1", "28 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "28 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.CC cs.LG", "authors": ["mark bun", "mark zhandry"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.00388"}
