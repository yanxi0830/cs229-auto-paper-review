However, the phonetic information has been largely overlooked by most of existing neural LID methods, although this information has been used in the conventional phonetic LID systems with a great success. We present a phonetic temporal neural model for LID, which is an LSTM-RNN LID system but accepts phonetic features produced by a phone-discriminative DNN as the input, rather than raw acoustic features. This new model is a reminiscence of the old phonetic LID methods, but the phonetic knowledge here is much richer: it is at the frame level and involves compacted information of all phones. Our experiments conducted on the Babel database and the AP16-OLR database demonstrate that the temporal phonetic neural approach is very effective, and significantly outperforms existing acoustic neural models. It also outperforms the conventional i-vector approach on short utterances and in noisy conditions.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 May 2017 02:46:21 GMT  (1604kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03151v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 22 May 2017 11:23:34 GMT  (1536kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03151v2", "Submitted to TASLP"], ["v3", "Fri, 25 Aug 2017 05:23:26 GMT  (1538kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03151v3", "Submitted to TASLP"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["zhiyuan tang", "dong wang", "yixiang chen", "lantian li", "andrew abel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03151"}
