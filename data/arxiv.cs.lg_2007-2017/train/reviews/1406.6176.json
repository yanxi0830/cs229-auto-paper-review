Maximum composite likelihood estimations are statistical approximations of the maximum likelihood estimation which are higher-order generalizations of the maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation. In this paper, we propose a composite likelihood method and investigate its property. Furthermore, we apply our composite likelihood method to restricted Boltzmann machines.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Jun 2014 09:32:10 GMT  (110kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6176v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["muneki yasuda", "shun kataoka", "yuji waizumi", "kazuyuki tanaka"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.6176"}
