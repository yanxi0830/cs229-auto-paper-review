{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "5-Feb-2016", "title": "Compressive PCA for Low-Rank Matrices on Graphs", "abstract": "Randomized algorithms reduce the complexity of low-rank recovery methods only w.r.t dimension p of a big dataset $Y \\in \\Re^{p \\times n}$. However, the case of large n is cumbersome to tackle without sacrificing the recovery. The recently introduced Fast Robust PCA on Graphs (FRPCAG) approximates a recovery method for matrices which are low-rank on graphs constructed between their rows and columns. In this paper we provide a novel framework, Compressive PCA on Graphs (CPCA) for an approximate recovery of such data matrices from sampled measurements. We introduce a RIP condition for low-rank matrices on graphs which enables efficient sampling of the rows and columns to perform FRPCAG on the sampled matrix. Several efficient, parallel and parameter-free decoders are presented along with their theoretical analysis for the low-rank recovery and clustering applications of PCA. On a single core machine, CPCA gains a speed up of p/k over FRPCAG, where k &lt;&lt; p is the subspace dimension. Numerically, CPCA can efficiently cluster 70,000 MNIST digits in less than a minute and recover a low-rank matrix of size 10304 X 1000 in 15 secs, which is 6 and 100 times faster than FRPCAG and exact recovery.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Feb 2016 15:51:34 GMT  (1418kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02070v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 11 Apr 2016 10:51:25 GMT  (1418kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02070v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 2 May 2016 13:49:40 GMT  (1426kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02070v3", null], ["v4", "Tue, 4 Oct 2016 08:35:35 GMT  (1879kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02070v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["nauman shahid", "nathanael perraudin", "gilles puy", "pierre vandergheynst"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.02070"}
