This paper introduces a topic modeling toolbox (TMBP) based on the belief propagation (BP) algorithms. This toolbox is implemented by MEX C++/MATLAB platform for either Windows or Linux. The current version includes various learning algorithms for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), author-topic models (ATM), relational topic models (RTM), and labeled LDA (LaLDA). This toolbox is an ongoing project and more and more BP-based learning algorithms for various LDA-based topic models will be added in the near future. Interested readers may also extend this toolbox for solving more complicated topic modeling problems.
