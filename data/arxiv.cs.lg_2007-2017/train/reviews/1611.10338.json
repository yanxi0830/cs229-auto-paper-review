With a violation of SLA, the provider has to pay penalties. In this paper, we explore two machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Random Forest Classifiers to predict SLA violations. Since SLA violations are a rare event in the real world (~0.2 %), the classification task becomes more challenging. In order to overcome these challenges, we use several re-sampling methods. We find that random forests with SMOTE-ENN re-sampling have the best performance among other methods with the accuracy of 99.88 % and F_1 score of 0.9980.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 20:07:34 GMT  (2584kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10338v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.LG", "authors": ["reyhane askari hemmat", "abdelhakim hafid"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.10338"}
