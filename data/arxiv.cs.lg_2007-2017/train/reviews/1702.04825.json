In our setting, the feedback at any time $t$ is limited in a sense that it is only available to the expert $i^t$ that has been selected by the central algorithm (forecaster), i.e., only the expert $i^t$ receives feedback from the environment and gets to learn at time $t$. We consider a generic black-box approach whereby the forecaster doesn't control or know the learning dynamics of the experts apart from knowing the following no-regret learning property: the average regret of any expert $j$ vanishes at a rate of at least $O(t_j^{\\beta-1})$ with $t_j$ learning steps where $\\beta \\in [0, 1]$ is a parameter. We prove the following hardness result: without any coordination between the forecaster and the experts, it is impossible to design a forecaster achieving no-regret guarantees in the worst-case. In order to circumvent this hardness result, we consider a practical assumption allowing the forecaster to \"guide\" the learning process of the experts by filtering/blocking some of the feedbacks observed by them from the environment, i.e., not allowing the selected expert $i^t$ to learn at time $t$ for some time steps. Then, we design a novel no-regret learning algorithm \\algo for this problem setting by carefully guiding the feedbacks observed by experts. We prove that \\algo achieves the worst-case expected cumulative regret of $O(T^\\frac{1}{2 - \\beta})$ after $T$ time steps and matches the regret bound of $\\Theta(T^\\frac{1}{2})$ for the special case of multi-armed bandits.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Feb 2017 00:22:16 GMT  (258kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04825v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 17 Feb 2017 21:39:29 GMT  (360kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04825v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["adish singla", "hamed hassani", "reas krause"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.04825"}
