Although there are existing techniques to accelerate single Lloyd iterations, none of these are tailored to the case of large $k$, which is increasingly common as dataset sizes grow. We propose a dual-tree algorithm that gives the exact same results as standard $k$-means; when using cover trees, we use adaptive analysis techniques to, under some assumptions, bound the single-iteration runtime of the algorithm as $O(N + k log k)$. To our knowledge these are the first sub-$O(kN)$ bounds for exact Lloyd iterations. We then show that this theoretically favorable algorithm performs competitively in practice, especially for large $N$ and $k$ in low dimensions. Further, the algorithm is tree-independent, so any type of tree may be used.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 14 Jan 2016 21:18:06 GMT  (52kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.03754v1", "supplementary material included; submitted to ICML '16"]], "COMMENTS": "supplementary material included; submitted to ICML '16", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["ryan r curtin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.03754"}
