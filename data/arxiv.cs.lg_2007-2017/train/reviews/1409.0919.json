The results of the weak classifiers are combined using the weighted sum rule. The proposed solution was tested and compared to other solutions using a group of experiments in real life problems. The experimental results show that the proposed classifier outperforms the traditional KNN classifier that uses a different number of neighbors, is competitive with other classifiers, and is a promising classifier with strong potential for a wide range of applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Sep 2014 23:28:22 GMT  (806kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0919v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ahmad basheer hassanat", "mohammad ali abbadi", "ghada awad altarawneh", "ahmad ali alhasanat"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.0919"}
