Deep learning to hash, which improves retrieval quality by end-to-end representation learning and hash encoding, has received increasing attention recently. Subject to the vanishing gradient difficulty in the optimization with binary activations, existing deep learning to hash methods need to first learn continuous representations and then generate binary hash codes in a separated binarization step, which suffer from substantial loss of retrieval quality. This paper presents HashNet, a novel deep architecture for deep learning to hash by continuation method, which learns exactly binary hash codes from imbalanced similarity data where the number of similar pairs is much smaller than the number of dissimilar pairs. The key idea is to attack the vanishing gradient problem in optimizing deep networks with non-smooth binary activations by continuation method, in which we begin from learning an easier network with smoothed activation function and let it evolve during the training, until it eventually goes back to being the original, difficult to optimize, deep network with the sign activation function. Comprehensive empirical evidence shows that HashNet can generate exactly binary hash codes and yield state-of-the-art multimedia retrieval performance on standard benchmarks.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Feb 2017 17:29:24 GMT  (2794kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00758v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 23 Apr 2017 22:14:09 GMT  (3001kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00758v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 20 Jul 2017 14:59:45 GMT  (1900kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00758v3", null], ["v4", "Sat, 29 Jul 2017 17:55:50 GMT  (1900kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00758v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["zhangjie cao", "mingsheng long", "jianmin wang", "philip s yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.00758"}
