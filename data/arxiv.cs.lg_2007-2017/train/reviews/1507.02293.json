Online users are constantly creating new links when exposed to new information sources, and in turn these links are alternating the way information spreads. However, these two highly intertwined stochastic processes, information diffusion and network evolution, have been predominantly studied separately, ignoring their co-evolutionary dynamics.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jul 2015 20:01:32 GMT  (1763kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02293v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 13:51:32 GMT  (4075kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02293v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.LG physics.soc-ph stat.ML", "authors": ["mehrdad farajtabar", "yichen wang", "manuel gomez-rodriguez", "shuang li", "hongyuan zha", "le song"], "accepted": true, "id": "1507.02293"}
