When restricted to the single-agent decision-theoretic setting, inverse optimal control techniques assume that observed behavior is an approximately optimal solution to an unknown decision problem. These techniques learn a utility function that explains the example behavior and can then be used to accurately predict or imitate future behavior in similar observed or unobserved situations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Aug 2013 20:43:47 GMT  (734kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.3506v1", "In submission to JMLR, conference version:arXiv:1103.5254"]], "COMMENTS": "In submission to JMLR, conference version:arXiv:1103.5254", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["kevin waugh", "brian d ziebart", "drew bagnell"], "accepted": true, "id": "1308.3506"}
