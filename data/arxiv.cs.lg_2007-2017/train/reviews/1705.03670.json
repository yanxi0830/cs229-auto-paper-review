However, the quality of the learned features is not sufficiently good, so a complex back-end model, either neural or probabilistic, has to be used to address the residual uncertainty when applied to speaker verification, just as with raw features. This paper presents a convolutional time-delay deep neural network structure (CT-DNN) for speaker feature learning. Our experimental results on the Fisher database demonstrated that this CT-DNN can produce high-quality speaker features: even with a single feature (0.3 seconds including the context), the EER can be as low as 7.68%. This effectively confirmed that the speaker trait is largely a deterministic short-time property rather than a long-time distributional pattern, and therefore can be extracted from just dozens of frames.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 May 2017 09:30:42 GMT  (977kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03670v1", "deep neural networks, speaker verification, speaker feature"]], "COMMENTS": "deep neural networks, speaker verification, speaker feature", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["lantian li", "yixiang chen", "ying shi", "zhiyuan tang", "dong wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03670"}
