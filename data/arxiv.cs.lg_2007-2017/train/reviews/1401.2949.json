When used for reinforcement learning, such rules represent generalisations over the state-action-reward space. Whilst encouraging maximal generality, the niching can potentially hinder the formation of generalisations in the state space which are symmetrical, or very similar, over different actions. This paper introduces the use of rules which contain multiple actions, maintaining accuracy and reward metrics for each action. It is shown that problem symmetries can be exploited, improving performance, whilst not degrading performance when symmetries are reduced.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Jan 2014 12:46:56 GMT  (875kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2949v1", "6 pages, 13 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 13 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["larry bull"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.2949"}
