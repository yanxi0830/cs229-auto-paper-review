The problem has a long history and attracted significant attention for the last decade. However, we do not yet have a complete understanding of the optimal sample complexity of the problem: The state-of-the-art algorithms achieve a sample complexity of $O(\\sum_{i=2}^{n} \\Delta_{i}^{-2}(\\ln\\delta^{-1} + \\ln\\ln\\Delta_i^{-1}))$ ($\\Delta_{i}$ is the difference between the largest mean and the $i^{th}$ mean), while the best known lower bound is $\\Omega(\\sum_{i=2}^{n} \\Delta_{i}^{-2}\\ln\\delta^{-1})$ for general instances and $\\Omega(\\Delta^{-2} \\ln\\ln \\Delta^{-1})$ for the two-arm instances. We propose to study the instance-wise optimality for the BEST-1-ARM problem. Previous work has proved that it is impossible to have an instance optimal algorithm for the 2-arm problem. However, we conjecture that modulo the additive term $\\Omega(\\Delta_2^{-2} \\ln\\ln \\Delta_2^{-1})$ (which is an upper bound and worst case lower bound for the 2-arm problem), there is an instance optimal algorithm for BEST-1-ARM. Moreover, we introduce a new quantity, called the gap entropy for a best-arm problem instance, and conjecture that it is the instance-wise lower bound. Hence, resolving this conjecture would provide a final answer to the old and basic problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2016 00:23:39 GMT  (8kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08481v1", "To appear in COLT 2016 Open Problems"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in COLT 2016 Open Problems", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["lijie chen", "jian li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.08481"}
