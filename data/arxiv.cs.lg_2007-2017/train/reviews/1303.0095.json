The method provides new features calculated by combination of both: network structure information and class labels assigned to nodes. The influence of various features on classification performance has also been studied. The experiments on real-world data have shown that features created owing to the proposed method can lead to significant improvement of classification accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Mar 2013 06:31:02 GMT  (527kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0095v1", "feature extraction, label-dependent features, classification, social network analysis, AMD social network"]], "COMMENTS": "feature extraction, label-dependent features, classification, social network analysis, AMD social network", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.LG", "authors": ["tomasz kajdanowicz", "przemyslaw kazienko", "piotr doskocz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1303.0095"}
