In this paper, we present conditional generative moment- matching networks (CGMMN), which learn a conditional distribution given some input variables based on a conditional maximum mean discrepancy (CMMD) criterion. The learning is performed by stochastic gradient descent with the gradient calculated by back-propagation. We evaluate CGMMN on a wide range of tasks, including predictive modeling, contextual generation, and Bayesian dark knowledge, which distills knowledge from a Bayesian model by learning a relatively small CGMMN student network. Our results demonstrate competitive performance in all the tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 07:11:29 GMT  (1491kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04218v1", "12 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yong ren", "jun zhu", "jialian li", "yucen luo"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.04218"}
