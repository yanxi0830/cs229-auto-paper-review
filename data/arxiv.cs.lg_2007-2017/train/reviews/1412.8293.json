These approximate feature maps arise as Monte Carlo approximations to integral representations of shift-invariant kernel functions (e.g., Gaussian kernel). In this paper, we propose to use Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) approximations instead, where the relevant integrands are evaluated on a low-discrepancy sequence of points as opposed to random point sets as in the Monte Carlo approach. We derive a new discrepancy measure called box discrepancy based on theoretical characterizations of the integration error with respect to a given sequence. We then propose to learn QMC sequences adapted to our setting based on explicit box discrepancy minimization. Our theoretical analyses are complemented with empirical results that demonstrate the effectiveness of classical and adaptive QMC techniques for this problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Dec 2014 10:00:39 GMT  (2218kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8293v1", "A short version of this paper has been presented in ICML 2014"], ["v2", "Sun, 9 Aug 2015 07:20:00 GMT  (1935kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8293v2", "A short version of this paper has been presented in ICML 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "A short version of this paper has been presented in ICML 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG math.NA stat.CO", "authors": ["jiyan yang", "vikas sindhwani", "haim avron", "michael w mahoney"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.8293"}
