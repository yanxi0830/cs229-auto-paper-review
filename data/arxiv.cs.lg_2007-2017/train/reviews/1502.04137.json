All previous non-adaptive algorithms either run in exponential time or have non-optimal query complexity. We give the first polynomial time non-adaptive learning algorithm for learning hypergraph that asks almost optimal number of queries.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Feb 2015 21:32:12 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04137v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hasan abasi", "nader h bshouty", "hanna mazzawi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.04137"}
