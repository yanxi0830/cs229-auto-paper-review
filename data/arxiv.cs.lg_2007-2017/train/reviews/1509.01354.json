Previous supervised hashing methods utilized similarity/dissimilarity matrix to get semantic information. But the matrix is not easy to construct for a new dataset. Rather than to reconstruct the matrix, we proposed a straightforward CNN-based hashing method, i.e. binarilizing the activations of a fully connected layer with threshold 0 and taking the binary result as hash codes. This method achieved the best performance on CIFAR-10 and was comparable with the state-of-the-art on MNIST. And our experiments on CIFAR-10 suggested that the signs of activations may carry more information than the relative values of activations between samples, and that the co-adaption between feature extractor and hash functions is important for hashing.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Sep 2015 07:08:44 GMT  (3761kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01354v1", "16 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["jinma guo", "jianmin li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.01354"}
