While highly effective methods exist for patch-based dictionary learning, these methods may learn redundant features after the pooling stage in a given early vision architecture. In this paper, we offer a novel dictionary learning scheme to efficiently take into account the invariance of learned features after the spatial pooling stage. The algorithm is built on simple clustering, and thus enjoys efficiency and scalability. We discuss the underlying mechanism that justifies the use of clustering algorithms, and empirically show that the algorithm finds better dictionaries than patch-based methods with the same dictionary size.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Jan 2013 18:47:11 GMT  (2733kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.5056v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["yangqing jia", "oriol vinyals", "trevor darrell"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.5056"}
