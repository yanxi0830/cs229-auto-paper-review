Although this variance itself is well known, this is, to the best of our knowledge, the first paper that performs an extensive empirical study on its effects in speech recognition. We view training as sampling from a distribution and show that these distributions can have a substantial variance. These results show the urgent need to rethink the way in which results in the literature are reported and interpreted.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 19:39:41 GMT  (714kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04521v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ewout van den berg", "bhuvana ramabhadran", "michael picheny"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04521"}
