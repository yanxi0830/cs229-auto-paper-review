It is common in signal processing to transform sequences of real values to the complex domain via a set of complex basis functions, such as the Fourier transform. We show how CVNNs can be used to learn complex representations of real valued time-series data. We present methods and results using a framework that can compose holomorphic and non-holomorphic functions in a multi-layer network using a theoretical result called the Wirtinger derivative. We test our methods on a representation learning task for real-valued signals, recurrent complex-valued networks and their real-valued counterparts. Our results show that recurrent complex-valued networks can perform as well as their real-valued counterparts while learning filters that are representative of the domain of the data.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 20:44:10 GMT  (1716kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06351v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["andy m sarroff", "victor shepardson", "michael a casey"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06351"}
