We revisit the method of conditioning for accelerating first-order methods and suggest the use of sketching methods for constructing a cheap conditioner that attains a significant speedup with respect to the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm. While our theoretical guarantees assume convexity, we discuss the applicability of our method to deep neural networks, and experimentally demonstrate its merits.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 15:08:37 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02649v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NA cs.LG", "authors": ["alon gonen", "shai shalev-shwartz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.02649"}
