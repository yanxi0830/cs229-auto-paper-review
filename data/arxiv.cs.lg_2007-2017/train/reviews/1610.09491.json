In this problem the goal is to estimate the energy consumption of each appliance over time based on the total energy-consumption signal of a household. The current state of the art is to model the problem as inference in factorial HMMs, and use quadratic programming to find an approximate solution to the resulting quadratic integer program. Here we take a more principled approach, better suited to integer programming problems, and find an approximate optimum by combining convex semidefinite relaxations randomized rounding, as well as a scalable ADMM method that exploits the special structure of the resulting semidefinite program. Simulation results both in synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 29 Oct 2016 11:48:28 GMT  (313kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09491v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["kiarash shaloudegi", "andr\u00e1s gy\u00f6rgy", "csaba szepesv\u00e1ri", "wilsun xu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.09491"}
