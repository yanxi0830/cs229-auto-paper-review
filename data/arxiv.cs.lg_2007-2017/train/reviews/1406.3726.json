Our objective is to predict green energy using weather forecasts, predict deviations from forecast green energy, find correlation amongst different weather parameters and green energy availability, recover lost or missing energy (/ weather) data. We use historical weather data and weather forecasts for the same.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 14 Jun 2014 13:08:30 GMT  (5kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3726v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ankur sahai"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.3726"}
