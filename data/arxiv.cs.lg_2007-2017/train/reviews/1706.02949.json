The procedure follows a simple and easy way to classify a given data set to a predefined, say K number of clusters. Determination of K is a difficult job and it is not known that which value of K can partition the objects as per our intuition. To overcome this problem we proposed K+ Means algorithm. This algorithm is an enhancement over K-Means algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 10:06:25 GMT  (109kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02949v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 22 Jun 2017 13:25:51 GMT  (87kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02949v2", "Authors: Co-author's name added Section 3: Step (a) and (b) of K+Means algorithm are merged for simplicity.
