Although existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness and feasibility of running deep neural network inference operations on mobile and embedded devices, they overlooked the reliability of mobile computing models. Reliability measurements such as predictive uncertainty estimations are key factors for improving the decision accuracy and user experience. In this work, we propose RDeepSense, the first deep learning model that provides well-calibrated uncertainty estimations for resource-constrained mobile and embedded devices. RDeepSense enables the predictive uncertainty by adopting a tunable proper scoring rule as the training criterion and dropout as the implicit Bayesian approximation, which theoretically proves its correctness.To reduce the computational complexity, RDeepSense employs efficient dropout and predictive distribution estimation instead of model ensemble or sampling-based method for inference operations. We evaluate RDeepSense with four mobile sensing applications using Intel Edison devices. Results show that RDeepSense can reduce around 90% of the energy consumption while producing superior uncertainty estimations and preserving at least the same model accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 9 Sep 2017 16:58:01 GMT  (2787kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02980v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NI", "authors": ["shuochao yao", "yiran zhao", "huajie shao", "aston zhang", "chao zhang", "shen li", "tarek abdelzaher"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.02980"}
