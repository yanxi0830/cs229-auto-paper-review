To achieve this concept, we apply convolutional maps for pre-processing, namely the convovlutional maps are used as input of hand-crafted features. We recorded an increase in the performance rate of +17.06 % (multi-class object recognition) and +24.71 % (car detection) from grayscale input to convolutional maps. Although the framework is straight-forward, the concept should be inherited for an improved representation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 May 2017 03:04:48 GMT  (2464kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03595v1", "CVPR 2017 Workshop Submission"]], "COMMENTS": "CVPR 2017 Workshop Submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["hirokatsu kataoka", "kaori abe", "akio nakamura", "yutaka satoh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03595"}
