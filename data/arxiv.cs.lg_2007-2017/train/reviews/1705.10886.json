We present a simple estimator for such models, give a geometric condition under which the components can be accurately estimated, characterize sample complexity of the estimator, and give high probability non-asymptotic bounds on the componentwise estimation error. We use tools from empirical processes and generic chaining for the statistical analysis, and our results, which substantially generalize prior work on superposition models, are in terms of Gaussian widths of suitable sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 May 2017 23:00:34 GMT  (358kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10886v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["qilong gu", "arindam banerjee"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.10886"}
