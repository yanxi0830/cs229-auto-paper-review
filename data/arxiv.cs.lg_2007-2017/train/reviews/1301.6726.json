This problem is characterized by a huge solution space with a highly multimodal landscape. State-of-the-art approaches all involve using deterministic approaches such as the expectation-maximization algorithm. These approaches are guaranteed to find local maxima, but do not explore the landscape for other modes. Our approach evolves structure and the missing data. We compare our stochastic algorithms and show they all produce accurate results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jan 2013 16:00:06 GMT  (455kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6726v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fifteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1999)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["james w myers", "kathryn blackmond laskey", "tod s levitt"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.6726"}
