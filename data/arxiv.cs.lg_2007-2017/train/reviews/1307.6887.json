Although results in supervised and reinforcement learning show that transfer may significantly improve the learning performance, most of the literature on transfer is focused on batch learning tasks. In this paper we study the problem of \\textit{sequential transfer in online learning}, notably in the multi-armed bandit framework, where the objective is to minimize the cumulative regret over a sequence of tasks by incrementally transferring knowledge from prior tasks. We introduce a novel bandit algorithm based on a method-of-moments approach for the estimation of the possible tasks and derive regret bounds for it.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Jul 2013 22:17:12 GMT  (53kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6887v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["mohammad gheshlaghi azar", "alessandro lazaric", "emma brunskill"], "accepted": true, "id": "1307.6887"}
