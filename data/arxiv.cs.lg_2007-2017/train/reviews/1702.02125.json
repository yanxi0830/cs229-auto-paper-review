The modelling datasets were collected from two classrooms in the Secondary School of Pombal, Portugal. The number of occupants and occupation periods were obtained from class attendance reports. However, post-class occupancy was unknown and the developed model is used to reconstruct the classrooms occupancy by filling the unreported periods. Different model structure and environment variables combination were tested. The model with best accuracy had as input vector 10 variables of five averaged time intervals of relative humidity and carbon dioxide concentration. The model presented a mean square error of 1.99, coefficient of determination of 0.96 with a significance of p-value &lt; 0.001, and a mean absolute error of 1 occupant. These results show promising estimation capabilities in uncertain indoor environment conditions.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 18:17:25 GMT  (227kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02125v1", "6 pages, 2 figures, conference article"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 2 figures, conference article", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["eug\\'enio rodrigues", "lu\\'isa dias pereira", "ad\\'elio rodrigues gaspar", "\\'alvaro gomes", "manuel carlos gameiro da silva"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.02125"}
