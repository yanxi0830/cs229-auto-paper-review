However, recent research has demonstrated virtual memory's strong potential in scaling up graph mining algorithms on a single machine. We propose to use a similar approach for general machine learning. We contribute: (1) our latest finding that memory mapping is also a feasible technique for scaling up general machine learning algorithms like logistic regression and k-means, when data fits in or exceeds RAM (we tested datasets up to 190GB); (2) an approach, called M3, that enables existing machine learning algorithms to work with out-of-core datasets through memory mapping, achieving a speed that is significantly faster than a 4-instance Spark cluster, and comparable to an 8-instance cluster.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Apr 2016 17:12:14 GMT  (1793kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03034v1", "2 pages, 1 figure, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "2 pages, 1 figure, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DC", "authors": ["dezhi fang", "duen horng chau"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.03034"}
