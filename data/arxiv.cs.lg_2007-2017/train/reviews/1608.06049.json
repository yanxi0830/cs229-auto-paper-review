The design principles of LBC are motivated by local binary patterns (LBP). The LBC layer comprises of a set of fixed sparse pre-defined binary convolutional filters that are not updated during the training process, a non-linear activation function and a set of learnable linear weights. The linear weights combine the activated filter responses to approximate the corresponding activated filter responses of a standard convolutional layer. The LBC layer affords significant parameter savings, 9x to 169x in the number of learnable parameters compared to a standard convolutional layer. Furthermore, due to lower model complexity and sparse and binary nature of the weights also results in up to 9x to 169x savings in model size compared to a standard convolutional layer. We demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that our local binary convolution layer is a good approximation of a standard convolutional layer. Empirically, CNNs with LBC layers, called local binary convolutional neural networks (LBCNN), reach state-of-the-art performance on a range of visual datasets (MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, and a subset of ImageNet) while enjoying significant computational savings.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Aug 2016 04:32:21 GMT  (942kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06049v1", "10 pages, 8 figures"], ["v2", "Sat, 1 Jul 2017 17:02:44 GMT  (1699kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06049v2", "To appear in CVPR 2017 as Spotlight"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["felix juefei-xu", "vishnu naresh boddeti", "marios savvides"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.06049"}
