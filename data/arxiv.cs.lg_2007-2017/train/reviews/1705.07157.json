The typical idea is to design a clustering algorithm that outputs a near-optimal solution, provided the data satisfy a natural stability notion. For example, Bilu and Linial (2010) and Awasthi et al. (2012) presented algorithms that output near-optimal solutions, assuming the optimal solution is preserved under small perturbations to the input distances. A drawback to this approach is that the algorithms are often explicitly built according to the stability assumption and give no guarantees in the worst case; indeed, several recent algorithms output arbitrarily bad solutions even when just a small section of the data does not satisfy the given stability notion.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 May 2017 19:30:33 GMT  (172kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07157v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["maria-florina balcan", "colin white"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07157"}
