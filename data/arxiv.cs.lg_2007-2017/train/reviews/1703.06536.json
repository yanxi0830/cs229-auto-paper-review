{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "19-Mar-2017", "title": "The Relationship Between Agnostic Selective Classification Active Learning and the Disagreement Coefficient", "abstract": "A selective classifier (f,g) comprises a classification function f and a binary selection function g, which determines if the classifier abstains from prediction, or uses f to predict. The classifier is called pointwise-competitive if it classifies each point identically to the best classifier in hindsight (from the same class), whenever it does not abstain. The quality of such a classifier is quantified by its rejection mass, defined to be the probability mass of the points it rejects. A \"fast\" rejection rate is achieved if the rejection mass is bounded from above by O(1/m) where m is the number of labeled examples used to train the classifier (and O hides logarithmic factors). Pointwise-competitive selective (PCS) classifiers are intimately related to disagreement-based active learning and it is known that in the realizable case, a fast rejection rate of a known PCS algorithm (called Consistent Selective Strategy) is equivalent to an exponential speedup of the well-known CAL active algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 19 Mar 2017 23:22:31 GMT  (726kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06536v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 30 Mar 2017 11:08:28 GMT  (252kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06536v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["roei gelbhart", "ran el-yaniv"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06536"}
