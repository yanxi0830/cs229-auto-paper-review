State-of- the-art prediction methods include using the maximum entropy framework (also known as logistic regression) and log linear models. However, one unaddressed problem in the previous approaches is the existence of highly non-uniform misprediction costs. In this paper, we present our approach for making cost-sensitive predictions for bidding in online advertising auctions. We show that one can get significant lifts in offline and online performance by using a simple modification of the logistic loss function.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Mar 2016 18:21:55 GMT  (121kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03713v1", "Presented at NIPS 2015 Workshop on E-Commerce:this https URL"], ["v2", "Mon, 19 Sep 2016 14:37:00 GMT  (52kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03713v2", "First version of the paper was presented at NIPS 2015 Workshop on E-Commerce:this https URL"], ["v3", "Wed, 12 Jul 2017 09:30:53 GMT  (866kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03713v3", "First version of the paper was presented at NIPS 2015 Workshop on E-Commerce:this https URLThird version of the paper will be presented at AdKDD 2017 Workshop: adkdd17.wixsite.com/adkddtargetad2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at NIPS 2015 Workshop on E-Commerce:this https URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["flavian vasile", "damien lefortier", "olivier chapelle"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.03713"}
