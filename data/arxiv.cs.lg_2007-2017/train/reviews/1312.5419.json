In this work, we propose to utilize a single-layer Neural Networks approach in large-scale multi-label text classification tasks with recently proposed learning techniques. We carried out experiments on six textual datasets with varying characteristics and size, and show that a simple Neural Networks model equipped with recent advanced techniques for Neural Networks components such as activation layer, optimization, and generalization algorithms performs as well as or even outperforms the previous state-of-the-art approaches on large-scale datasets with diverse characteristics.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Dec 2013 06:53:24 GMT  (161kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5419v1", "12 pages, 3 figures, prepared for ICLR 2014"], ["v2", "Mon, 30 Dec 2013 05:41:15 GMT  (158kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5419v2", "12 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ICLR 2014"], ["v3", "Thu, 15 May 2014 11:32:03 GMT  (497kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5419v3", "16 pages, 4 figures, submitted to ECML 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 3 figures, prepared for ICLR 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jinseok nam", "jungi kim", "eneldo loza menc\\'ia", "iryna gurevych", "johannes f\\\"urnkranz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.5419"}
