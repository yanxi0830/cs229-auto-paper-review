A number of frameworks have been developed to expedite the process of designing and training deep neural networks (DNNs), such as Caffe, Torch and Theano. Currently they can harness multiple GPUs on a single machine, but are unable to use GPUs that are distributed across multiple machines; as even average-sized DNNs can take days to train on a single GPU with 100s of GBs to TBs of data, distributed GPUs present a prime opportunity for scaling up DL. However, the limited bandwidth available on commodity Ethernet networks presents a bottleneck to distributed GPU training, and prevents its trivial realization.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Dec 2015 09:55:37 GMT  (1535kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.06216v1", "14 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.DC", "authors": ["hao zhang", "zhiting hu", "jinliang wei", "pengtao xie", "gunhee kim", "qirong ho", "eric xing"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.06216"}
