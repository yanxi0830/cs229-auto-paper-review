{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-Feb-2016", "title": "A Simple Practical Accelerated Method for Finite Sums", "abstract": "We describe a novel optimization method for finite sums (such as empirical risk minimization problems) building on the recently introduced SAGA method. Our method achieves an accelerated convergence rate on strongly convex smooth problems, matching the conjectured optimal rate. Our method has only one parameter (a step size), and is radically simpler than other accelerated methods for finite sums.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Feb 2016 00:24:01 GMT  (2996kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02442v1", "Draft"], ["v2", "Thu, 27 Oct 2016 23:18:05 GMT  (3000kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02442v2", null]], "COMMENTS": "Draft", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["aaron defazio"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.02442"}
