How accurately can one recover the \"histogram\" (i.e. cumulative density function) of the $p_i$s? While the empirical estimates would recover the histogram to earth mover distance $\\Theta(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{t}})$ (equivalently, $\\ell_1$ distance between the CDFs), we show that, provided $n$ is sufficiently large, we can achieve error $O(\\frac{1}{t})$ which is information theoretically optimal. We also extend our results to the multi-dimensional parameter case, capturing settings where each member of the population has multiple associated parameters. Beyond the theoretical results, we demonstrate that the recovery algorithm performs well in practice on a variety of datasets, providing illuminating insights into several domains, including politics, and sports analytics.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Sep 2017 13:53:26 GMT  (180kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02707v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["kevin tian", "weihao kong", "gregory valiant"], "accepted": true, "id": "1709.02707"}
