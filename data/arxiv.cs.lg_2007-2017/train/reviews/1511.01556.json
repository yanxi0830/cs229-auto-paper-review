We take the lead to explore the research on algorithmically recognizing named entities in literary Chinese for historical studies with language-model based and conditional-random-field based methods, and extend our work to mining the document structures in historical documents. Practical evaluations were conducted with texts that were extracted from more than 220 volumes of local gazetteers (Difangzhi). Difangzhi is a huge and the single most important collection that contains information about officers who served in local government in Chinese history. Our methods performed very well on these realistic tests. Thousands of names and addresses were identified from the texts. A good portion of the extracted names match the biographical information currently recorded in the China Biographical Database (CBDB) of Harvard University, and many others can be verified by historians and will become as new additions to CBDB.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Nov 2015 23:39:46 GMT  (579kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01556v1", "11 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, the Third Workshop on Big Humanities Data (2015 IEEE BigData), the 29th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC 29)"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables, the Third Workshop on Big Humanities Data (2015 IEEE BigData), the 29th Pacific Asia Conference on Language, Information and Computation (PACLIC 29)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.DL cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["chao-lin liu", "chih-kai huang", "hongsu wang", "peter k bol"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.01556"}
