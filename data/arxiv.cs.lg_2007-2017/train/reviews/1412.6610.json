They are conceptually simple and easy to train. Recent theoretical work has shed light on their ability to capture manifold structure, and drawn connections to density modelling. This has motivated researchers to seek ways of auto-encoder scoring, which has furthered their use in classification. Gated auto-encoders (GAEs) are an interesting and flexible extension of auto-encoders which can learn transformations among different images or pixel covariances within images. However, they have been much less studied, theoretically or empirically. In this work, we apply a dynamical systems view to GAEs, deriving a scoring function, and drawing connections to RBMs. On a set of deep learning benchmarks, we also demonstrate their effectiveness for single and multi-label classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 Dec 2014 05:46:05 GMT  (843kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6610v1", "Eight pages plus one page reference and four pages of appendix.
