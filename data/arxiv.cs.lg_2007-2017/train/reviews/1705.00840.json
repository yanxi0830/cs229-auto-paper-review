In this paper we generalize this approach and represent incomplete data as pointed affine subspaces. This allows to perform various affine transformations of data, as whitening or dimensionality reduction. We embed such generalized missing data into a vector space by mapping pointed affine subspace (generalized missing data point) to a vector containing imputed values joined with a corresponding projection matrix. Such an operation preserves the scalar product of the embedding defined for flag vectors and allows to input transformed incomplete data to typical classification methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 May 2017 07:59:01 GMT  (250kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00840v1", "13 pages, 3 figures and 3 tables. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1612.01480"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 3 figures and 3 tables. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1612.01480", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["{\\l}ukasz struski", "marek \\'smieja", "jacek tabor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.00840"}
