I.e. by approximating the similarity between $x$ and $x'$ as the hamming distance between $f(x)$ and $g(x')$, for two distinct binary codes $f,g$, rather than as the hamming distance between $f(x)$ and $f(x')$.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 29 Nov 2013 18:53:32 GMT  (118kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.7662v1", "Accepted to NIPS 2013, 9 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to NIPS 2013, 9 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.IR", "authors": ["behnam neyshabur", "nati srebro", "ruslan salakhutdinov", "yury makarychev", "payman yadollahpour"], "accepted": true, "id": "1311.7662"}
