While computationally efficient, such a representation is unable to maintain any sequential information. We present a continuous and differentiable sequential document representation that goes beyond the bag of words assumption, and yet is efficient and effective. This representation employs smooth curves in the multinomial simplex to account for sequential information. We discuss the representation and its geometric properties and demonstrate its applicability for the task of text classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 16:26:46 GMT  (1442kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6858v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Second Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2006)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["guy lebanon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.6858"}
