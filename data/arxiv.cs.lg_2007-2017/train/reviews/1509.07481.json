This enables the use of techniques from computer vision for feature learning and classification. We used Tiled Convolutional Neural Networks to learn high-level features from individual GAF, MTF, and GAF-MTF images on 12 benchmark time series datasets and two real spatial-temporal trajectory datasets. The classification results of our approach are competitive with state-of-the-art approaches on both types of data. An analysis of the features and weights learned by the CNNs explains why the approach works.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Sep 2015 19:14:20 GMT  (2223kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07481v1", "Submit to JCSS.
