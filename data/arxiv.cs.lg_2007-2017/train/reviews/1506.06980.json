{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "23-Jun-2015", "title": "Strategic Classification", "abstract": "Machine learning relies on the assumption that unseen test instances of a classification problem follow the same distribution as observed training data. However, this principle can break down when machine learning is used to make important decisions about the welfare (employment, education, health) of strategic individuals. Knowing information about the classifier, such individuals may manipulate their attributes in order to obtain a better classification outcome. As a result of this behavior---often referred to as gaming---the performance of the classifier may deteriorate sharply. Indeed, gaming is a well-known obstacle for using machine learning methods in practice; in financial policy-making, the problem is widely known as Goodhart's law. In this paper, we formalize the problem, and pursue algorithms for learning classifiers that are robust to gaming.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Jun 2015 13:22:10 GMT  (114kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06980v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 22 Nov 2015 18:33:34 GMT  (114kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06980v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["moritz hardt", "nimrod megiddo", "christos papadimitriou", "mary wootters"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.06980"}
