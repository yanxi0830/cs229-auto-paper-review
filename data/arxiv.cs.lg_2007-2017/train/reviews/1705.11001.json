However, the existing GANs restrict the discriminator to be a binary classifier, and thus limit their learning capacity for tasks that need to synthesize output with rich structures such as natural language descriptions. In this paper, we propose a novel generative adversarial network, RankGAN, for generating high-quality language descriptions. Rather than train the discriminator to learn and assign absolute binary predicate for individual data sample, the proposed RankGAN is able to analyze and rank a collection of human-written and machine-written sentences by giving a reference group. By viewing a set of data samples collectively and evaluating their quality through relative ranking scores, the discriminator is able to make better assessment which in turn helps to learn a better generator. The proposed RankGAN is optimized through the policy gradient technique. Experimental results on multiple public datasets clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 May 2017 09:21:04 GMT  (592kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.11001v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["kevin lin", "dianqi li", "xiaodong he", "zhengyou zhang", "ming-ting sun"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.11001"}
