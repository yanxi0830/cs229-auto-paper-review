First, we explore metric and curvature properties of PEMs in terms of component manifolds. Next, we propose a SGD method, called C-SGD, by generalizing the SGD methods employed on kernel submanifolds for optimization on product of different collections of kernel submanifolds. Then, we analyze convergence properties of the C-SGD considering sectional curvature properties of PEMs. In the theoretical results, we expound the constraints that can be used to compute adaptive step sizes of the C-SGD in order to assure the asymptotic convergence.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 Jan 2017 05:35:39 GMT  (181kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.06123v1", "3 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "3 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["mete ozay", "takayuki okatani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.06123"}
