This is the idea at the core of multi-task learning. In this context a fundamental question is how to incorporate the tasks structure in the learning problem.We tackle this question by studying a general computational framework that allows to encode a-priori knowledge of the tasks structure in the form of a convex penalty; in this setting a variety of previously proposed methods can be recovered as special cases, including linear and non-linear approaches. Within this framework, we show that tasks and their structure can be efficiently learned considering a convex optimization problem that can be approached by means of block coordinate methods such as alternating minimization and for which we prove convergence to the global minimum.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Apr 2015 09:13:23 GMT  (619kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03101v1", "26 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables"], ["v2", "Fri, 17 Apr 2015 20:03:21 GMT  (891kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.03101v2", "26 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "26 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["carlo ciliberto", "youssef mroueh", "tomaso a poggio", "lorenzo rosasco"], "accepted": true, "id": "1504.03101"}
