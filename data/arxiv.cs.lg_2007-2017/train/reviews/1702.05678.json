In particular, there exist properties for which there is an exponential gap between the power of \\emph{adaptive} testing algorithms, wherein each query may be determined by the answers received to prior queries, and their \\emph{non-adaptive} counterparts, in which all queries are independent of answers obtained from previous queries.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 19 Feb 2017 00:03:09 GMT  (35kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05678v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["clement canonne", "tom gur"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.05678"}
