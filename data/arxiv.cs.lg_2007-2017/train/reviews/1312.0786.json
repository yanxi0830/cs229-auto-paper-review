{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "3-Dec-2013", "title": "Image Representation Learning Using Graph Regularized Auto-Encoders", "abstract": "We consider the problem of image representation for the tasks of unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning. In those learning tasks, the raw image vectors may not provide enough representation for their intrinsic structures due to their highly dense feature space. To overcome this problem, the raw image vectors should be mapped to a proper representation space which can capture the latent structure of the original data and represent the data explicitly for further learning tasks such as clustering.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Dec 2013 11:59:57 GMT  (17kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0786v1", "9pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 19 Feb 2014 11:13:57 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0786v2", "9pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yiyi liao", "yue wang", "yong liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.0786"}
