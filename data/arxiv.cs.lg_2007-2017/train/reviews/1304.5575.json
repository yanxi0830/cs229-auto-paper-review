{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Apr-2013", "title": "Inverse Density as an Inverse Problem: the Fredholm Equation Approach", "abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of estimating the ratio $\\frac{q}{p}$ where $p$ is a density function and $q$ is another density, or, more generally an arbitrary function. Knowing or approximating this ratio is needed in various problems of inference and integration, in particular, when one needs to average a function with respect to one probability distribution, given a sample from another. It is often referred as {\\it importance sampling} in statistical inference and is also closely related to the problem of {\\it covariate shift} in transfer learning as well as to various MCMC methods. It may also be useful for separating the underlying geometry of a space, say a manifold, from the density function defined on it.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 Apr 2013 00:57:35 GMT  (3438kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5575v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 25 Apr 2013 11:46:51 GMT  (3438kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.5575v2", "Fixing a few typos in last version"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["qichao que", "mikhail belkin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1304.5575"}
