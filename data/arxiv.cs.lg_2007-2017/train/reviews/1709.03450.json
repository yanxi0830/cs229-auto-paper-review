Especially in cases where only few data sets need to be processed for a highly accurate result, semi-automatic segmentation techniques exhibit a clear benefit for the user. One area of application is medical image processing during an intervention for a single patient. We propose a learning-based cooperative segmentation approach which includes the computing entity as well as the user into the task. Our system builds upon a state-of-the-art fully convolutional artificial neural network (FCN) as well as an active user model for training. During the segmentation process, a user of the trained system can iteratively add additional hints in form of pictorial scribbles as seed points into the FCN system to achieve an interactive and precise segmentation result. The segmentation quality of interactive FCNs is evaluated. Iterative FCN approaches can yield superior results compared to networks without the user input channel component, due to a consistent improvement in segmentation quality after each interaction.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Sep 2017 15:50:24 GMT  (766kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03450v1", "This work is submitted to the 2017 Eurographics Workshop on Visual Computing for Biology and Medicine"]], "COMMENTS": "This work is submitted to the 2017 Eurographics Workshop on Visual Computing for Biology and Medicine", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["mario amrehn", "sven gaube", "mathias unberath", "frank schebesch", "tim horz", "maddalena strumia", "stefan steidl", "markus kowarschik", "reas maier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.03450"}
