{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "3-May-2013", "title": "Spectral Classification Using Restricted Boltzmann Machine", "abstract": "The spectra of a celestial body is composed of a great number of spectrum, thus it's necessary for us to explore the appropriate latent features to represent the celestial body well. Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) is a bipartite generative graphical model composed of two layers (one visible layer and one hidden layer), which can extract higher level features to represent the original data. Despite generative, RBM can be used for classification when modified with free energy and softmax function. In this paper, to apply the binary RBM for stellar spectral classification, we first perform \"threshold binaryzation\" on the original data by some rule (for detail, c.f. Section 4), then we resort to binary RBM to classify cataclysmic variables (CVs) from non-CVs (one half of all the given data for training and the other half for testing). The experiment result shows state-of-the-art accuracy of 100%, and it outperforms support vector machine (SVM), with accuracy of 99.14%.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 May 2013 10:20:02 GMT  (20kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0665v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 13 Oct 2013 01:03:56 GMT  (111kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0665v2", "8 pages, 2 figures, Accepted in PASA for publication"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["fuqiang chen", "yan wu", "yude bu", "guodong zhao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1305.0665"}
