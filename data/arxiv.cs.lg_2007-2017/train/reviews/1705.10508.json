In this work we propose a stateless variation of Q-learning, which we apply to exploit spatial reuse in a wireless network. In particular, we allow networks to modify both their transmission power and the channel used solely based on the experienced throughput. We concentrate in a completely decentralized scenario in which no information about neighbouring nodes is available to the learners. Our results show that although the algorithm is able to find the best-performing actions to enhance aggregate throughput, there is high variability in the throughput experienced by the individual networks. We identify the cause of this variability as the adversarial setting of our setup, in which the most played actions provide intermittent good/poor performance depending on the neighbouring decisions. We also evaluate the effect of the intrinsic learning parameters of the algorithm on this variability.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 May 2017 08:41:53 GMT  (644kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10508v1", "Conference"], ["v2", "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 09:13:51 GMT  (645kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10508v2", "Conference"]], "COMMENTS": "Conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.LG", "authors": ["francesc wilhelmi", "boris bellalta", "cristina cano", "ers jonsson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10508"}
