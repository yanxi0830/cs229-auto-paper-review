These robust and parameter free algorithms are essentially iterative least-squares updates and very versatile both in theory and in practice. On the theoretical front, we present several variants with convergence guarantees. Owing to their effective use of second-order structure, these algorithms are substantially better than first-order methods in many practical scenarios. On the empirical side, we present a scalable stagewise variant of our approach, which achieves dramatic computational speedups over popular optimization packages such as Liblinear and Vowpal Wabbit on standard datasets (MNIST and CIFAR-10), while attaining state-of-the-art accuracies.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Oct 2013 20:48:58 GMT  (359kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1949v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 21 Oct 2013 15:18:37 GMT  (360kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1949v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["alekh agarwal", "sham m kakade", "nikos karampatziakis", "le song", "gregory valiant"], "accepted": true, "id": "1310.1949"}
