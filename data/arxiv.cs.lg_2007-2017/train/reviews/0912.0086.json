In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing the behavior of $k$-means on well-clustered data. In particular, we study the case when each cluster is distributed as a different Gaussian -- or, in other words, when the input comes from a mixture of Gaussians.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Dec 2009 19:10:46 GMT  (30kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.0086v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["kamalika chaudhuri", "sanjoy dasgupta", "rea vattani"], "accepted": false, "id": "0912.0086"}
