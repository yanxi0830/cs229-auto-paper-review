The key feature of RBoosting lies in introducing a shrinkage degree to re-scale the ensemble estimate in each gradient-descent step. Thus, the shrinkage degree determines the performance of RBoosting.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 17 May 2015 08:09:43 GMT  (152kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04369v1", "11 pages, 27 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 27 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["lin xu", "shaobo lin", "yao wang", "zongben xu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.04369"}
