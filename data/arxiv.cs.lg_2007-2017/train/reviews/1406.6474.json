However, minimizing submodular functions poses a number of algorithmic challenges. Recent work introduced an easy-to-use, parallelizable algorithm for minimizing submodular functions that decompose as the sum of \"simple\" submodular functions. Empirically, this algorithm performs extremely well, but no theoretical analysis was given. In this paper, we show that the algorithm converges linearly, and we provide upper and lower bounds on the rate of convergence. Our proof relies on the geometry of submodular polyhedra and draws on results from spectral graph theory.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Jun 2014 06:52:33 GMT  (43kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6474v1", "19 pages, 3 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 27 Jun 2014 18:12:03 GMT  (43kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6474v2", "19 pages, 3 figures"], ["v3", "Wed, 5 Nov 2014 07:19:00 GMT  (599kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.6474v3", "17 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "19 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.OC cs.DM cs.DS cs.LG cs.NA", "authors": ["robert nishihara", "stefanie jegelka", "michael i jordan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.6474"}
