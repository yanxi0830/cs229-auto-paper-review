{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "12-Nov-2015", "title": "LSTM-based Deep Learning Models for Non-factoid Answer Selection", "abstract": "In this paper, we apply a general deep learning (DL) framework for the answer selection task, which does not depend on manually defined features or linguistic tools. The basic framework is to build the embeddings of questions and answers based on bidirectional long short-term memory (biLSTM) models, and measure their closeness by cosine similarity. We further extend this basic model in two directions. One is to define a more composite representation for questions and answers by combining convolutional neural network with the basic framework, the other is to utilize a simple but efficient attention mechanism in order to generate the answer representation according to the question context. Several variations of models are provided. Experimental results on a public insurance-domain dataset demonstrate that the extended models substantially outperform two state-of-the-art non-DL baselines and a strong DL baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Nov 2015 22:01:54 GMT  (109kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04108v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 15:00:46 GMT  (199kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04108v2", "correct some typos"], ["v3", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 17:56:29 GMT  (130kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04108v3", "added new experiments on TREC-QA"], ["v4", "Mon, 28 Mar 2016 04:12:45 GMT  (122kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04108v4", "added new experiments on TREC-QA"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["ming tan", "cicero dos santos", "bing xiang", "bowen zhou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.04108"}
