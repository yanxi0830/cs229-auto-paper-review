{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "29-Dec-2011", "title": "Building high-level features using large scale unsupervised learning", "abstract": "We consider the problem of building detectors for high-level concepts using only unsupervised feature learning. For example, we would like to understand if it is possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images downloaded from the internet. To answer this question, we trained a simple feature learning algorithm on a large dataset of images (10 million images, each image is 200x200). The simulation is performed on a cluster of 1000 machines with fast network hardware for one week. Extensive experimental results reveal surprising evidence that such high-level concepts can indeed be learned using only unlabeled data and a simple learning algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Dec 2011 00:26:54 GMT  (2624kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6209v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 22 May 2012 08:12:49 GMT  (2978kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6209v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 12 Jun 2012 05:12:56 GMT  (2978kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6209v3", null], ["v4", "Wed, 11 Jul 2012 04:40:33 GMT  (2978kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6209v4", null], ["v5", "Thu, 12 Jul 2012 04:32:50 GMT  (2978kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6209v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["quoc v le", "marc'aurelio ranzato", "rajat monga", "matthieu devin", "greg corrado", "kai chen 0010", "jeffrey dean", "andrew y ng"], "accepted": true, "id": "1112.6209"}
