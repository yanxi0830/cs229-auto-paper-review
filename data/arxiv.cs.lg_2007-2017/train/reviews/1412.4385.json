We show that a novel but simple feature embedding approach provides better performance, by exploiting the feature template structure common in NLP problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 14 Dec 2014 17:44:58 GMT  (145kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4385v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 30 Mar 2015 19:35:12 GMT  (139kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4385v2", "For more details, please refer to the long version of this paper:this http URL"], ["v3", "Thu, 16 Apr 2015 01:44:48 GMT  (139kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.4385v3", "For more details, please refer to the long version of this paper:this http URL"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["yi yang", "jacob eisenstein"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.4385"}
