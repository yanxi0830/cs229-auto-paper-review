The result is a fast and accurate parser for many languages. Compared to other transition-based dependency parsing approaches, our parser provides similar statistical and computational performance with best-known approaches while avoiding various downsides including randomization, extra feature requirements, and custom learning algorithms. We show that it is possible to implement a dependency parser with an open-source learning to search library in about 300 lines of C++ code, while existing systems often requires several thousands of lines.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Mar 2015 23:33:17 GMT  (42kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05615v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 7 May 2015 22:12:11 GMT  (48kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05615v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["kai-wei chang", "he he", "hal daum\\'e iii", "john langford"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.05615"}
