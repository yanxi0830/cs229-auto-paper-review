LogitBoost, BrownBoost and RobustBoost are boosting algorithms claimed to be less sensitive to noise than AdaBoost. We present the results of experiments evaluating these algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets. We compare the performance on each of datasets when the labels are corrupted by different levels of independent label noise. In presence of random label noise, we found that BrownBoost and RobustBoost perform significantly better than AdaBoost and LogitBoost, while the difference between each pair of algorithms is insignificant. We provide an explanation for the difference based on the margin distributions of the algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 Sep 2014 21:36:47 GMT  (251kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2905v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["sunsern cheamanunkul", "evan ettinger", "yoav freund"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.2905"}
