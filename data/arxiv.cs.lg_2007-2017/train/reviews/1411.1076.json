On the one hand, we use information theory, and recent results in probability theory, to establish necessary and sufficient conditions under which the principal component can be estimated using unbounded computational resources. It turns out that this is possible as soon as the signal-to-noise ratio $\\beta$ becomes larger than $C\\sqrt{k\\log k}$ (and in particular $\\beta$ can remain bounded as the problem dimensions increase).", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Nov 2014 21:01:56 GMT  (102kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1076v1", "Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2014 (slightly expanded: 30 pages, 6 figures)"]], "COMMENTS": "Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2014 (slightly expanded: 30 pages, 6 figures)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IT math.IT stat.ML", "authors": ["emile richard", "andrea montanari"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.1076"}
