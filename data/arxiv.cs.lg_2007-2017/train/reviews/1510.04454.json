In this paper, we propose practical online MDP algorithms with policy iteration and theoretically establish a sublinear regret bound. A notable advantage of the proposed algorithm is that it can be easily combined with function approximation, and thus large and possibly continuous state spaces can be efficiently handled. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Oct 2015 09:19:49 GMT  (166kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04454v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yao ma", "hao zhang", "masashi sugiyama"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.04454"}
