Modifying the popular knockout tournament, we propose a maximum-selection algorithm that uses $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{n}{\\epsilon^2}\\log \\frac{1}{\\delta}\\right)$ comparisons, a number tight up to a constant factor. We then derive a general framework that improves the performance of many ranking algorithms, and combine it with merge sort and binary search to obtain a ranking algorithm that uses $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{n\\log n (\\log \\log n)^3}{\\epsilon^2}\\right)$ comparisons for any $\\delta\\ge\\frac1n$, a number optimal up to a $(\\log \\log n)^3$ factor.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 May 2017 17:59:17 GMT  (49kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05366v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["moein falahatgar", "alon orlitsky", "venkatadheeraj pichapati", "ananda theertha suresh"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.05366"}
