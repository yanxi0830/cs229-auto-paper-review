This is an instance of a broader family of problems including machine translation, decipherment, and sentiment modification. The key technical challenge is to separate the content from desired text characteristics such as sentiment. We leverage refined alignment of latent representations across mono-lingual text corpora with different characteristics. We deliberately modify encoded examples according to their characteristics, requiring the reproduced instances to match available examples with the altered characteristics as a population. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this cross-alignment method on three tasks: sentiment modification, decipherment of word substitution ciphers, and recovery of word order.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 May 2017 17:40:12 GMT  (120kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09655v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["tianxiao shen", "tao lei", "regina barzilay", "tommi jaakkola"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.09655"}
