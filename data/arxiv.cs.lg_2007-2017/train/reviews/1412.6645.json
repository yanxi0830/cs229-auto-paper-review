The first task was to discriminate between two same or different words, and the second was to discriminate between two same or different talkers.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 Dec 2014 11:54:41 GMT  (994kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6645v1", "5 pages, 3 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 24 Feb 2015 10:09:09 GMT  (1207kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6645v2", "6 pages, 3 figures"], ["v3", "Mon, 20 Apr 2015 12:35:32 GMT  (1206kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6645v3", "6 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["gabriel synnaeve", "emmanuel dupoux"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.6645"}
