{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "21-May-2017", "title": "CrossNets : A New Approach to Complex Learning", "abstract": "We propose a novel neural network structure called CrossNets, which considers architectures on directed acyclic graphs. This structure builds on previous generalizations of feed forward models, such as ResNets, by allowing for all forward cross connections between layers (both adjacent and non-adjacent). The addition of cross connections among the network increases information flow across the whole network, leading to better training and testing performances. The superior performance of the network is tested against four benchmark datasets: MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. We conclude with a proof of convergence for Crossnets to a local minimum for error, where weights for connections are chosen through backpropagation with momentum.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 21 May 2017 06:50:49 GMT  (1726kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07404v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["chirag agarwal", "mehdi sharifzhadeh", "joe klobusicky", "dan schonfeld"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07404"}
