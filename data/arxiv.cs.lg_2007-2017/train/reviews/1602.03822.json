{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Feb-2016", "title": "Neural Network Support Vector Detection via a Soft-Label, Hybrid K-Means Classifier", "abstract": "We use random geometric graphs to describe clusters of higher dimensional data points which are bijectively mapped to a (possibly) lower dimensional space where an equivalent random cluster model is used to calculate the expected number of modes to be found when separating the data of a multi-modal data set into distinct clusters. Furthermore, as a function of the expected number of modes and the number of data points in the sample, an upper bound on a given distance measure is found such that data points have the greatest correlation if their mutual distances from a common center is less than or equal to the calculated bound. Anomalies are exposed, which lie outside of the union of all regularized clusters of data points.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Feb 2016 18:37:53 GMT  (93kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03822v1", "This paper is a combined replacement for the papers \"A Neural Network Anomaly Detector using the Random Cluster Model\" (arXiv:1501.07227), \"On the Sharp Threshold Interval Length of Partially Connected Random Geometric Graphs During K-Means Classification\" (arXiv:1412.4178) and \"Estimating the Mean Number of K-Means Clusters to Form\" (arXiv:1503.03488), which have all been withdrawn"], ["v2", "Fri, 12 Feb 2016 19:40:52 GMT  (93kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03822v2", "This paper is a combined replacement for the papers \"A Neural Network Anomaly Detector using the Random Cluster Model\" (arXiv:1501.07227), \"On the Sharp Threshold Interval Length of Partially Connected Random Geometric Graphs During K-Means Classification\" (arXiv:1412.4178) and \"Estimating the Mean Number of K-Means Clusters to Form\" (arXiv:1503.03488), which have all been withdrawn"], ["v3", "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 20:15:24 GMT  (93kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03822v3", "This paper is a combined replacement for the papers \"A Neural Network Anomaly Detector using the Random Cluster Model\" (arXiv:1501.07227), \"On the Sharp Threshold Interval Length of Partially Connected Random Geometric Graphs During K-Means Classification\" (arXiv:1412.4178) and \"Estimating the Mean Number of K-Means Clusters to Form\" (arXiv:1503.03488), which have all been withdrawn"], ["v4", "Sun, 10 Apr 2016 19:45:22 GMT  (93kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03822v4", "This paper is a combined replacement for the papers \"A Neural Network Anomaly Detector using the Random Cluster Model\" (arXiv:1501.07227), \"On the Sharp Threshold Interval Length of Partially Connected Random Geometric Graphs During K-Means Classification\" (arXiv:1412.4178) and \"Estimating the Mean Number of K-Means Clusters to Form\" (arXiv:1503.03488), which have all been withdrawn"], ["v5", "Tue, 19 Apr 2016 02:14:02 GMT  (93kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03822v5", "This paper is a combined replacement for the papers \"A Neural Network Anomaly Detector using the Random Cluster Model\" (arXiv:1501.07227), \"On the Sharp Threshold Interval Length of Partially Connected Random Geometric Graphs During K-Means Classification\" (arXiv:1412.4178) and \"Estimating the Mean Number of K-Means Clusters to Form\" (arXiv:1503.03488), which have all been withdrawn"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper is a combined replacement for the papers \"A Neural Network Anomaly Detector using the Random Cluster Model\" (arXiv:1501.07227), \"On the Sharp Threshold Interval Length of Partially Connected Random Geometric Graphs During K-Means Classification\" (arXiv:1412.4178) and \"Estimating the Mean Number of K-Means Clusters to Form\" (arXiv:1503.03488), which have all been withdrawn", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["robert a murphy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.03822"}
