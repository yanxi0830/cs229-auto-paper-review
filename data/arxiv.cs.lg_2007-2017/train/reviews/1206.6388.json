The phenomenon that multiple web sources pick up certain information is often called trend. A central problem in the context of web data mining is to detect those web sources that are first to publish information which will give rise to a trend. We present a simple and efficient method for finding trends dominating a pool of web sources and identifying those web sources that publish the information relevant to a trend before others. We validate our approach on real data collected from influential technology news feeds.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (633kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6388v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML", "authors": ["felix bie\u00dfmann", "jens-michalis papaioannou", "mikio l braun", "andreas harth"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6388"}
