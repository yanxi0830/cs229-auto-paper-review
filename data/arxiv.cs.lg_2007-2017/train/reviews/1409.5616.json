{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "19-Sep-2014", "title": "A Survey on Soft Subspace Clustering", "abstract": "Subspace clustering (SC) is a promising clustering technology to identify clusters based on their associations with subspaces in high dimensional spaces. SC can be classified into hard subspace clustering (HSC) and soft subspace clustering (SSC). While HSC algorithms have been extensively studied and well accepted by the scientific community, SSC algorithms are relatively new but gaining more attention in recent years due to better adaptability. In the paper, a comprehensive survey on existing SSC algorithms and the recent development are presented. The SSC algorithms are classified systematically into three main categories, namely, conventional SSC (CSSC), independent SSC (ISSC) and extended SSC (XSSC). The characteristics of these algorithms are highlighted and the potential future development of SSC is also discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Sep 2014 12:01:08 GMT  (372kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5616v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 8 Apr 2016 02:08:55 GMT  (1234kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5616v2", "This paper has been published in Information Sciences Journal in 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["zhaohong deng", "kup-sze choi", "yizhang jiang", "jun wang", "shitong wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.5616"}
