Instance segmentation is very important in a variety of applications, such as autonomous driving, image captioning, and visual question answering. Techniques that combine large graphical models with low-level vision have been proposed to address this problem; however, we propose an end-to-end recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture with an attention mechanism to model a human-like counting process, and produce detailed instance segmentations. The network is jointly trained to sequentially produce regions of interest as well as a dominant object segmentation within each region. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results on the CVPPP leaf segmentation dataset and KITTI vehicle segmentation dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 May 2016 20:40:20 GMT  (8852kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09410v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 6 Sep 2016 15:09:06 GMT  (8891kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09410v2", null], ["v3", "Sun, 27 Nov 2016 17:41:57 GMT  (8221kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09410v3", null], ["v4", "Mon, 16 Jan 2017 23:08:35 GMT  (8221kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09410v4", null], ["v5", "Thu, 13 Jul 2017 00:53:33 GMT  (5962kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09410v5", "CVPR 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["mengye ren", "richard s zemel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.09410"}
