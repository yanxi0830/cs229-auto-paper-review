A related ongoing revolution---also theoretically not understood---concerns their ability to serve as generative models for complicated types of data such as images and texts. These models are trained using ideas like variational autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 22:21:38 GMT  (37kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07028v1", "Under review for COLT 2017"], ["v2", "Fri, 2 Jun 2017 15:14:17 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07028v2", "Accepted to COLT 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review for COLT 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["holden lee", "rong ge", "tengyu ma", "rej risteski", "sanjeev arora"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07028"}
