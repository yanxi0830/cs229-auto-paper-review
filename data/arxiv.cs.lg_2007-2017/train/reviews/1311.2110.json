We show that the complexity of all three problems depends on the 'curvature' of the submodular function, and provide lower and upper bounds that refine and improve previous results [3, 16, 18, 52]. Our proof techniques are fairly generic. We either use a black-box transformation of the function (for approximation and learning), or a transformation of algorithms to use an appropriate surrogate function (for minimization). Curiously, curvature has been known to influence approximations for submodular maximization [7, 55], but its effect on minimization, approximation and learning has hitherto been open. We complete this picture, and also support our theoretical claims by empirical results.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Nov 2013 23:42:34 GMT  (58kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2110v1", "21 pages.
