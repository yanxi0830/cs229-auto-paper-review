The technique allows us to automatically extract low-dimensional features from high dimensional spectral features in a non-linear, data-driven, unsupervised way. We compared the new stochastic feature extractor with conventional mel-cepstral analysis in analysis-by-synthesis and text-to-speech experiments. Our results confirm that the proposed method increases the quality of synthetic speech in both experiments.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Jun 2015 10:17:59 GMT  (5330kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.05268v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.LG", "authors": ["zhenzhou wu", "shinji takaki", "junichi yamagishi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.05268"}
