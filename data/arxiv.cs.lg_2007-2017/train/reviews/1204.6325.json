In contrast to higher education, primary and secondary education establishments should remain distributed, in order to maintain a balance of urban and rural life in the developing and the developed world. We plan to deploy an ambient and social interactive TV platform (physical installation, authoring tools, interactive content) that supports social communication in a positive way. In particular, we present the physical design and the conceptual model of the system.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Apr 2012 20:10:16 GMT  (3704kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6325v1", "In AVI 2010 Workshop: Mind the Gap - Towards Seamless Remote Social Interaction"], ["v2", "Sun, 3 Jun 2012 08:45:46 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.6325v2", "This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to some errors"]], "COMMENTS": "In AVI 2010 Workshop: Mind the Gap - Towards Seamless Remote Social Interaction", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.LG", "authors": ["konstantinos chorianopoulos", "vassiliki tsaknaki"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.6325"}
