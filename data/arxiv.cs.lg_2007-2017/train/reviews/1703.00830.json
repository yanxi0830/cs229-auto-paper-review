In this work, we present a general framework for designing distributed clustering algorithms that are robust to outliers. Using our framework, we give a distributed approximation algorithm for k-means, k-median, or generally any L_p objective, with z outliers and/or balance constraints, using O(m(k+z)(d+log n)) bits of communication, where m is the number of machines, n is the size of the point set, and d is the dimension. This generalizes and improves over previous work of Bateni et al. and Malkomes et al. As a special case, we achieve the first distributed algorithm for k-median with outliers, answering an open question posed by Malkomes et al. For distributed k-means clustering, we provide the first dimension-dependent communication complexity lower bound for finding the optimal clustering. This improves over the lower bound from Chen et al. which is dimension-agnostic.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Mar 2017 15:27:14 GMT  (167kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00830v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 12 Oct 2017 19:08:04 GMT  (167kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00830v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.DC cs.LG", "authors": ["pranjal awasthi", "maria-florina balcan", "colin white"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.00830"}
