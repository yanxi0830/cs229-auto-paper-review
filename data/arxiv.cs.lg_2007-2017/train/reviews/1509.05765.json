It has recently been demonstrated that SGD can be statistically biased so that certain elements of the training set are learned more rapidly than others. In this article, we place SGD into a feedback loop whereby the probability of selection is proportional to error magnitude. This provides a novelty-driven oddball SGD process that learns more rapidly than traditional SGD by prioritising those elements of the training set with the largest novelty (error). In our DNN example, oddball SGD trains some 50x faster than regular SGD.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Sep 2015 19:58:24 GMT  (299kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05765v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["andrew j r simpson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.05765"}
