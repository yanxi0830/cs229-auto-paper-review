The ability to predict the future course of a patient's disease from high-dimensional genomic profiling will be essential in realizing the promise of genomic medicine, but presents significant challenges for state-of-the-art survival analysis methods. In this abstract we present an investigation in learning genomic representations with neural networks to predict patient survival in cancer. We demonstrate the advantages of this approach over existing survival analysis methods using brain tumor data.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 27 Sep 2016 20:53:16 GMT  (150kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08663v1", "ICLR 2016 Workshop Track- May 2nd 2016 International Conference on Learning Representations"]], "COMMENTS": "ICLR 2016 Workshop Track- May 2nd 2016 International Conference on Learning Representations", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["safoora yousefi", "congzheng song", "nelson nauata", "lee cooper"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.08663"}
