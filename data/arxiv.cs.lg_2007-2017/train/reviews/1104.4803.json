We want to organize the nodes into disjoint clusters so that there is relatively dense (observed) connectivity within clusters, and sparse across clusters.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 25 Apr 2011 20:33:55 GMT  (64kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4803v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 28 Apr 2011 19:08:49 GMT  (1684kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4803v2", "Accepted to ICML 2011"], ["v3", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 21:27:20 GMT  (443kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4803v3", "Appeared in ICML 2011"], ["v4", "Thu, 24 Jul 2014 00:44:05 GMT  (442kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.4803v4", "This is the final version published in Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR).
