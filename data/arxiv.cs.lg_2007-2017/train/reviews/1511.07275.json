{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "23-Nov-2015", "title": "Learning Simple Algorithms from Examples", "abstract": "We present an approach for learning simple algorithms such as copying, multi-digit addition and single digit multiplication directly from examples. Our framework consists of a set of interfaces, accessed by a controller. Typical interfaces are 1-D tapes or 2-D grids that hold the input and output data. For the controller, we explore a range of neural network-based models which vary in their ability to abstract the underlying algorithm from training instances and generalize to test examples with many thousands of digits. The controller is trained using $Q$-learning with several enhancements and we show that the bottleneck is in the capabilities of the controller rather than in the search incurred by $Q$-learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Nov 2015 15:31:54 GMT  (1414kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07275v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 24 Nov 2015 03:28:35 GMT  (1414kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07275v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["wojciech zaremba", "tomas mikolov", "armand joulin", "rob fergus"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.07275"}
