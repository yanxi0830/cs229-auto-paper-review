These neural networks are constructed recursively by taking inspiration from the backward chaining algorithm as used in Prolog. Specifically, we replace symbolic unification with a differentiable computation on vector representations of symbols using a radial basis function kernel, thereby combining symbolic reasoning with learning subsymbolic vector representations. By using gradient descent, the resulting neural network can be trained to infer facts from a given incomplete knowledge base. It learns to (i) place representations of similar symbols in close proximity in a vector space, (ii) make use of such similarities to prove facts, (iii) induce logical rules, and (iv) use provided and induced logical rules for complex multi-hop reasoning. We demonstrate that this architecture outperforms ComplEx, a state-of-the-art neural link prediction model, on four benchmark knowledge bases while at the same time inducing interpretable function-free first-order logic rules.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 May 2017 11:40:57 GMT  (32kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.11040v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.LG cs.LO", "authors": ["tim rockt\\\"aschel", "sebastian riedel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.11040"}
