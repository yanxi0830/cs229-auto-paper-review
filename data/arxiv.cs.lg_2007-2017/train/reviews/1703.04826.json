{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "14-Mar-2017", "title": "Encoding Sentences with Graph Convolutional Networks for Semantic Role Labeling", "abstract": "Semantic role labeling (SRL) is the task of identifying the predicate-argument structure of a sentence. It is typically regarded as an important step in the standard natural language processing pipeline, providing information to downstream tasks such as information extraction and question answering. As the semantic representations are closely related to syntactic ones, we exploit syntactic information in our model. We propose a version of graph convolutional networks (GCNs), a recent class of multilayer neural networks operating on graphs, suited to modeling syntactic dependency graphs. GCNs over syntactic dependency trees are used as sentence encoders, producing latent feature representations of words in a sentence and capturing information relevant to predicting the semantic representations. We observe that GCN layers are complementary to LSTM ones: when we stack both GCN and LSTM layers, we obtain a substantial improvement over an already state-of-the-art LSTM SRL model, resulting in the best reported scores on the standard benchmark (CoNLL-2009) both for Chinese and English.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Mar 2017 23:25:34 GMT  (431kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04826v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 23 May 2017 09:47:59 GMT  (436kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04826v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 24 May 2017 09:48:05 GMT  (437kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04826v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 30 Jul 2017 17:24:38 GMT  (437kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04826v4", "To appear in EMNLP 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["diego marcheggiani", "ivan titov"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.04826"}
