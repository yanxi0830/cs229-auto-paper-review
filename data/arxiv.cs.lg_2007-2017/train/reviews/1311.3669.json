This influence estimation problem is very challenging since both the time-sensitive nature of the problem and the issue of scalability need to be addressed simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a randomized algorithm for influence estimation in continuous-time diffusion networks. Our algorithm can estimate the influence of every node in a network with |V| nodes and |E| edges to an accuracy of $\\varepsilon$ using $n=O(1/\\varepsilon^2)$ randomizations and up to logarithmic factors O(n|E|+n|V|) computations. When used as a subroutine in a greedy influence maximization algorithm, our proposed method is guaranteed to find a set of nodes with an influence of at least (1-1/e)OPT-2$\\varepsilon$, where OPT is the optimal value. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed method can easily scale up to networks of millions of nodes while significantly improves over previous state-of-the-arts in terms of the accuracy of the estimated influence and the quality of the selected nodes in maximizing the influence.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 14 Nov 2013 21:01:15 GMT  (234kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3669v1", "To appear in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.LG", "authors": ["nan du", "le song", "manuel gomez-rodriguez", "hongyuan zha"], "accepted": true, "id": "1311.3669"}
