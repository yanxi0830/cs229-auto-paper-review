This issue poses challenges in statistical inference and cluster stability. In this contribution, we state sufficient conditions for uniqueness of expectation and mean. The proposed conditions show that a unique mean is neither exceptional nor generic. To cope with this issue, we introduce homogeneity as a measure of how likely is a unique mean for a sample of partitions. We show that homogeneity is related to cluster stability. This result points to a possible conflict between cluster stability and diversity in consensus clustering. To assess homogeneity in a practical setting, we propose an efficient way to compute a lower bound of homogeneity. Empirical results using the k-means algorithm suggest that uniqueness of the mean partition is not exceptional for real-world data. Moreover, for samples of high homogeneity, uniqueness can be enforced by increasing the number of data points or by removing outlier partitions. In a broader context, this contribution can be placed as a further step towards a statistical theory of partitions.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Feb 2016 12:28:57 GMT  (1486kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02543v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["brijnesh j jain"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.02543"}
