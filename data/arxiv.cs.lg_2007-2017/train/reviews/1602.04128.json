While these two families of algorithms might seem different to a distract eye, the proof methods are indeed very similar, making the reader wonder if such a connection is only accidental.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 Feb 2016 17:11:42 GMT  (34kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04128v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 27 Jun 2016 20:16:44 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04128v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 28 Oct 2016 16:43:55 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04128v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 4 Nov 2016 01:30:29 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04128v4", "Fixed an compilation error in the latex"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["francesco orabona", "d\u00e1vid p\u00e1l"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.04128"}
