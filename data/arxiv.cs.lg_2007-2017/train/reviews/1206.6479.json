A substantial research effort is devoted to such modeling when x is high dimensional. We consider, instead, the case of a high dimensional y, where x is either low dimensional or high dimensional. Our approach is based on selecting a small subset y_L of the dimensions of y, and proceed by modeling (i) x \\to y_L and (ii) y_L \\to y. Composing these two models, we obtain a conditional model x \\to y that possesses convenient statistical properties. Multi-label classification and multivariate regression experiments on several datasets show that this model outperforms the one vs. all approach as well as several sophisticated multiple output prediction methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (170kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6479v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["krishnakumar balasubramanian", "guy lebanon"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6479"}
