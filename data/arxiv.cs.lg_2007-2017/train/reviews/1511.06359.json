However, synthesis dictionary learning involves NP-hard sparse coding and expensive learning steps. Recently, sparsifying transform learning received interest for its cheap computation and closed-form solution. In this work, we develop a methodology for learning of Flipping and Rotation Invariant Sparsifying Transform, dubbed FRIST, to better represent natural images that contain textures with various geometrical directions. The proposed alternating learning algorithm involves simple closed-form solutions. Preliminary experiments show the usefulness of adaptive sparse representation by FRIST for image compression, denoising and inpainting with promising performances.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 20:55:49 GMT  (2990kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06359v1", "11 pages (including the references and supplementary material), under review as conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v2", "Fri, 8 Jan 2016 06:43:38 GMT  (3720kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06359v2", "11 pages (including the references and supplementary material), under review as conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v3", "Tue, 17 May 2016 03:54:47 GMT  (2220kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06359v3", "25 pages (including the references and supplementary material)"], ["v4", "Mon, 16 Oct 2017 02:42:20 GMT  (1806kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06359v4", "Published in Inverse Problems"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages (including the references and supplementary material), under review as conference paper at ICLR 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["bihan wen", "saiprasad ravishankar", "yoram bresler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06359"}
