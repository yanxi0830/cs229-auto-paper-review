Our motivation rests in the Thurstonian view that many discrete data types can be considered as being generated from a subset of underlying latent continuous variables, and in the observation that each realisation of a discrete type imposes certain inequalities on those variables. Thus learning and inference in TBM reduce to making sense of a set of inequalities. Our proposed TBM naturally supports the following types: Gaussian, intervals, censored, binary, categorical, muticategorical, ordinal, (in)-complete rank with and without ties. We demonstrate the versatility and capacity of the proposed model on three applications of very different natures; namely handwritten digit recognition, collaborative filtering and complex social survey analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Aug 2014 00:32:32 GMT  (903kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0055v1", "Proceedings of the 30 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, 2013.
