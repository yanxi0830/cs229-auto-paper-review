Such algorithms were recently proposed by Sutton, Mahmood, and White (2015) as an improved solution to the problem of divergence of off-policy temporal-difference learning with linear function approximation. We present in this paper the first convergence proofs for two emphatic algorithms, ETD($\\lambda$) and ELSTD($\\lambda$). We prove, under general off-policy conditions, the convergence in $L^1$ for ELSTD($\\lambda$) iterates, and the almost sure convergence of the approximate value functions calculated by both algorithms using a single infinitely long trajectory. Our analysis involves new techniques with applications beyond emphatic algorithms leading, for example, to the first proof that standard TD($\\lambda$) also converges under off-policy training for $\\lambda$ sufficiently large.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 16:42:10 GMT  (75kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02582v1", "44 pages; a shorter version to appear at the 28th Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT), 2015"], ["v2", "Wed, 12 Aug 2015 23:06:08 GMT  (75kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02582v2", "45 pages; an oversight in a proof in Appendix C of the first version has been corrected.
