In this paper, we illustrate an intrinsic connection between these two concepts by showing that the dynamic regret can be expressed in terms of the adaptive regret and the functional variation. This observation implies that strongly adaptive algorithms can be directly leveraged to minimize the dynamic regret. As a result, we present a series of strongly adaptive algorithms whose dynamic regrets are minimax optimal for convex functions, exponentially concave functions, and strongly convex functions, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is first time that such kind of dynamic regret bound is established for exponentially concave functions. Moreover, all of those adaptive algorithms do not need any prior knowledge of the functional variation, which is a significant advantage over previous specialized methods for minimizing dynamic regret.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Jan 2017 03:54:21 GMT  (18kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07570v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 22 Feb 2017 15:12:55 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07570v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["lijun zhang", "tianbao yang", "rong jin", "zhi-hua zhou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.07570"}
