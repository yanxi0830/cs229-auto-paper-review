Examples include news recommendation where texts to be recommended are constantly published everyday. However, most existing recommendation techniques, such as matrix factorization based methods, mainly rely on interaction histories to learn representations of items. While latent factors of items can be learned effectively from user interaction data, in many cases, such data is not available, especially for newly emerged items.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 4 Jun 2017 14:48:28 GMT  (1494kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01084v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 23 Jun 2017 21:55:56 GMT  (1494kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01084v2", "typo fixes"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["ting chen", "liangjie hong", "yue shi", "yizhou sun"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.01084"}
