It is widely used in network planning, resource management and network security. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a specific recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture that is well-suited to learn from experience to classify, process and predict time series with time lags of unknown size. LSTMs have been shown to model temporal sequences and their long-range dependencies more accurately than conventional RNNs. In this paper, we propose a LSTM RNN framework for predicting short and long term Traffic Matrix (TM) in large networks. By validating our framework on real-world data from GEANT network, we show that our LSTM models converge quickly and give state of the art TM prediction performance for relatively small sized models.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 May 2017 12:57:24 GMT  (358kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05690v1", "Submitted for peer review"], ["v2", "Sat, 20 May 2017 12:33:10 GMT  (358kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05690v2", "Submitted for peer review"], ["v3", "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 12:31:20 GMT  (469kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05690v3", "Submitted for peer review. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1402.1128by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted for peer review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.LG", "authors": ["abdelhadi azzouni", "guy pujolle"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05690"}
