Through this framework we investigate issue of invariance of the optimization, data dependence and the connection with natural gradients.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 20:27:45 GMT  (107kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06747v1", "12 pages, 3 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 14 Dec 2015 20:52:51 GMT  (109kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06747v2", "14 pages, 3 figures"], ["v3", "Fri, 8 Jan 2016 20:13:03 GMT  (134kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06747v3", "17 pages, 3 figures"], ["v4", "Tue, 19 Jan 2016 20:57:47 GMT  (294kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06747v4", "17 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["behnam neyshabur", "ryota tomioka", "ruslan salakhutdinov", "nathan srebro"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.06747"}
