We present a simple baseline that utilizes probabilities from softmax distributions. Correctly classified examples tend to have greater maximum softmax probabilities than erroneously classified and out-of-distribution examples, allowing for their detection. We assess performance by defining several tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and automatic speech recognition, showing the effectiveness of this baseline across all. We then show the baseline can sometimes be surpassed, demonstrating the room for future research on these underexplored detection tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Oct 2016 04:06:01 GMT  (55kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02136v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 18:11:25 GMT  (59kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02136v2", "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017. 1 Figure and 1 Appendix on Confidence Calibration"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["dan hendrycks", "kevin gimpel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.02136"}
