We demonstrate a successful initial method for radio control which allows naive learning of search without the need for expert features, heuristics, or search strategies. We also introduce Kerlym, an open Keras based reinforcement learning agent collection for OpenAI's Gym.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 May 2016 13:23:04 GMT  (585kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09221v1", "7 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["timothy j o'shea", "t charles clancy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.09221"}
