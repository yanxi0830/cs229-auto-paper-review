Prior domain adversarial adaptation methods could not align complex multimode distributions since the discriminative structures and inter-layer interactions across multiple domain-specific layers have not been exploited for distribution alignment. In this paper, we present randomized multilinear adversarial networks (RMAN), which exploit multiple feature layers and the classifier layer based on a randomized multilinear adversary to enable both deep and discriminative adversarial adaptation. The learning can be performed by stochastic gradient descent with the gradients computed by back-propagation in linear-time. Experiments demonstrate that our models exceed the state-of-the-art results on standard domain adaptation datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 May 2017 00:50:36 GMT  (1220kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10667v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1605.06636"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1605.06636", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["mingsheng long", "zhangjie cao", "jianmin wang", "michael i jordan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10667"}
