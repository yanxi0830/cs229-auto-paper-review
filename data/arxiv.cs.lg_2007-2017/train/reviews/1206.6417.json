We propose a framework for multi-task learn- ing that enables one to selectively share the information across the tasks. We assume that each task parameter vector is a linear combi- nation of a finite number of underlying basis tasks. The coefficients of the linear combina- tion are sparse in nature and the overlap in the sparsity patterns of two tasks controls the amount of sharing across these. Our model is based on on the assumption that task pa- rameters within a group lie in a low dimen- sional subspace but allows the tasks in differ- ent groups to overlap with each other in one or more bases. Experimental results on four datasets show that our approach outperforms competing methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (192kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6417v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["abhishek kumar 0001", "hal daum\u00e9 iii"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6417"}
