Unlike previous models that directly map images or sentences into a common embedding space, our model works on a finer level and embeds fragments of images (objects) and fragments of sentences (typed dependency tree relations) into a common space. In addition to a ranking objective seen in previous work, this allows us to add a new fragment alignment objective that learns to directly associate these fragments across modalities. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that reasoning on both the global level of images and sentences and the finer level of their respective fragments significantly improves performance on image-sentence retrieval tasks. Additionally, our model provides interpretable predictions since the inferred inter-modal fragment alignment is explicit.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 Jun 2014 06:22:50 GMT  (5227kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5679v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["andrej karpathy", "armand joulin", "fei-fei li"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.5679"}
