This algorithm named the \"Reverse Ripple Effect(R.R.E)\", achieves 100% learning accuracy but is computationally expensive upon classification. The R.R.E is a (deterministic) algorithm that super imposes Gaussian weighted functions on training points. In this work, the R.R.E algorithm is compared against known learning and classification techniques/algorithms such as: the Perceptron Criterion algorithm, Linear Support Vector machines, the Linear Fisher Discriminant and a simple Neural Network. The classification accuracy of the R.R.E algorithm is evaluated using simulations conducted in MATLAB. The R.R.E algorithm's behaviour is analyzed under linearly and non-linearly separable data sets. For the comparison with the Neural Network, the classical XOR problem is considered.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Sep 2014 08:17:07 GMT  (1916kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6440v1", "45 Pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 31 Oct 2014 17:46:07 GMT  (1916kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6440v2", "43 Pages"]], "COMMENTS": "45 Pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["rashid khogali"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.6440"}
