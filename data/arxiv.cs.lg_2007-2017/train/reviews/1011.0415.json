To any such model can be associated a network (namely a directed graph) describing which degrees of freedom interact under the dynamics. We tackle the problem of learning such a network from observation of the system trajectory over a time interval $T$.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Nov 2010 19:09:57 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0415v1", "This publication is to appear in NIPS 2010"]], "COMMENTS": "This publication is to appear in NIPS 2010", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.ST cond-mat.stat-mech cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.TH", "authors": ["jos\u00e9 bento", "morteza ibrahimi", "andrea montanari"], "accepted": true, "id": "1011.0415"}
