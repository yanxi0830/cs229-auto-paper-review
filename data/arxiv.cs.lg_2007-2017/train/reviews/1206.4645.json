New piecewise linear convex regression methods are fast and scalable, but can have instability when used to approximate constraints or objective functions for optimization. Ensemble methods, like bagging, smearing and random partitioning, can alleviate this problem and maintain the theoretical properties of the underlying estimator. We empirically examine the performance of ensemble methods for prediction and optimization, and then apply them to device modeling and constraint approximation for geometric programming based circuit design.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:19:58 GMT  (349kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4645v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NA stat.ME stat.ML", "authors": ["lauren hannah", "david b dunson"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4645"}
