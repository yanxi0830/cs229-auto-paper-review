Audio emotion recognition (AER) attempts to understand emotional states of human with the given utterance signals, and has been studied abroad for its further development on friendly human-machine interfaces. Distinguish from other existing works, the person-dependent patterns of audio emotions are conducted, and fractal dimension features are calculated for acoustic feature extraction. Furthermore, it is able to efficiently learn intrinsic characteristics of auditory emotions, while the utterance features are learned from fractal dimensions of each sub-bands. Experimental results show the proposed method is able to provide comparative performance for audio emotion recognition.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 1 Jul 2016 00:54:10 GMT  (2253kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00087v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 13:12:35 GMT  (2251kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00087v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.SD", "authors": ["miao cheng", "ah chung tsoi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1607.00087"}
