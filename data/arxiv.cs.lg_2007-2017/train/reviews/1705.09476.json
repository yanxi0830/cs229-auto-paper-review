In this paper, we propose a new method to learn non-linear robust features by taking advantage of the data manifold structure. We first follow the commonly used trick of the trade, that is learning robust features with artificially corrupted data, which are training samples with manually injected noise. Following the idea of the auto-encoder, we first assume features should contain much information to well reconstruct the input from its corrupted copies. However, merely reconstructing clean input from its noisy copies could make data manifold in the feature space noisy. To address this problem, we propose a new method, called Incremental Auto-Encoders, to iteratively denoise the extracted features. We assume the noisy manifold structure is caused by a diffusion process. Consequently, we reverse this specific diffusion process to further contract this noisy manifold, which results in an incremental optimization of model parameters . Furthermore, we show these learned non-linear features can be stacked into a hierarchy of features. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the proposed method can achieve better classification performances.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 May 2017 08:30:41 GMT  (1840kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.09476v1", "This work was completed in Feb, 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "This work was completed in Feb, 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["yanan li", "donghui wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.09476"}
