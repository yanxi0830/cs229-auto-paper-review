BCM brings the intuitive power of CBR to a Bayesian generative framework. The BCM learns prototypes, the \"quintessential\" observations that best represent clusters in a dataset, by performing joint inference on cluster labels, prototypes and important features. Simultaneously, BCM pursues sparsity by learning subspaces, the sets of features that play important roles in the characterization of the prototypes. The prototype and subspace representation provides quantitative benefits in interpretability while preserving classification accuracy. Human subject experiments verify statistically significant improvements to participants' understanding when using explanations produced by BCM, compared to those given by prior art.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Mar 2015 23:25:55 GMT  (1372kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01161v1", "Published in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2014, Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Published in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2014, Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["been kim", "cynthia rudin", "julie a shah"], "accepted": true, "id": "1503.01161"}
