In this paper, we propose a new method that achieves this goal with only image-level labels of whether the objects are present or not. Our approach combines a discriminative submodular cover problem for automatically discovering a set of positive object windows with a smoothed latent SVM formulation. The latter allows us to leverage efficient Quasi-Newton optimization techniques. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach provides approximately 70% relative improvement in average precision over the current state of the art on standard benchmark datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Mar 2014 07:21:20 GMT  (8077kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1024v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 14 Mar 2014 00:50:26 GMT  (8077kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1024v2", "10 pages"], ["v3", "Mon, 17 Mar 2014 21:04:49 GMT  (8077kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1024v3", "10 pages"], ["v4", "Thu, 15 May 2014 22:08:59 GMT  (3437kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.1024v4", null]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["hyun oh song", "ross b girshick", "stefanie jegelka", "julien mairal", "za\u00efd harchaoui", "trevor darrell"], "accepted": true, "id": "1403.1024"}
