The objectives of feature selection include: building simpler and more comprehensible models, improving data mining performance, and preparing clean, understandable data. The recent proliferation of big data has presented some substantial challenges and opportunities of feature selection algorithms. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and structured overview of recent advances in feature selection research. Motivated by current challenges and opportunities in the big data age, we revisit feature selection research from a data perspective, and review representative feature selection algorithms for generic data, structured data, heterogeneous data and streaming data. Methodologically, to emphasize the differences and similarities of most existing feature selection algorithms for generic data, we generally categorize them into four groups: similarity based, information theoretical based, sparse learning based and statistical based methods. Finally, to facilitate and promote the research in this community, we also present a open-source feature selection repository that consists of most of the popular feature selection algorithms (", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 29 Jan 2016 08:32:10 GMT  (1780kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07996v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 26 Feb 2016 00:29:42 GMT  (1780kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07996v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 22:24:56 GMT  (1780kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07996v3", null], ["v4", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 10:32:12 GMT  (1780kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.07996v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jundong li", "kewei cheng", "suhang wang", "fred morstatter", "robert p trevino", "jiliang tang", "huan liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.07996"}
