Recently, character-level and multi-channel CNNs have exhibited excellent performance for sentence classification tasks. We apply CNNs to large-scale authorship attribution, which aims to determine an unknown text's author among many candidate authors, motivated by their ability to process character-level signals and to differentiate between a large number of classes, while making fast predictions in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. We extensively evaluate CNN-based approaches that leverage word and character channels and compare them against state-of-the-art methods for a large range of author numbers, shedding new light on traditional approaches. We show that character-level CNNs outperform the state-of-the-art on four out of five datasets in different domains. Additionally, we present the first application of authorship attribution to reddit.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 Sep 2016 19:08:15 GMT  (335kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06686v1", "9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["sebastian ruder", "parsa ghaffari", "john g breslin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.06686"}
