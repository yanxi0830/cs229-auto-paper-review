{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "30-Sep-2016", "title": "Optimal spectral transportation with application to music transcription", "abstract": "Many spectral unmixing methods rely on the non-negative decomposition of spectral data onto a dictionary of spectral templates. In particular, state-of-the-art music transcription systems decompose the spectrogram of the input signal onto a dictionary of representative note spectra. The typical measures of fit used to quantify the adequacy of the decomposition compare the data and template entries frequency-wise. As such, small displacements of energy from a frequency bin to another as well as variations of timber can disproportionally harm the fit. We address these issues by means of optimal transportation and propose a new measure of fit that treats the frequency distributions of energy holistically as opposed to frequency-wise. Building on the harmonic nature of sound, the new measure is invariant to shifts of energy to harmonically-related frequencies, as well as to small and local displacements of energy. Equipped with this new measure of fit, the dictionary of note templates can be considerably simplified to a set of Dirac vectors located at the target fundamental frequencies (musical pitch values). This in turns gives ground to a very fast and simple decomposition algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance on real musical data.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Sep 2016 16:28:12 GMT  (540kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09799v1", "NIPS 2016"], ["v2", "Mon, 10 Oct 2016 06:42:07 GMT  (636kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09799v2", "NIPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG cs.SD", "authors": ["r\u00e9mi flamary", "c\u00e9dric f\u00e9votte", "nicolas courty", "valentin emiya"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.09799"}
