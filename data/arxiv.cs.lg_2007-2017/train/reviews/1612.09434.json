These discretized operators usually depend on bandwidth parameters whose tuning remains a theoretical and practical problem. In this paper, we address this problem for the unnormalized graph Laplacian by establishing an oracle inequality that opens the door to a well-founded data-driven procedure for the bandwidth selection. Our approach relies on recent results by Lacour and Massart [LM15] on the so-called Lepski's method.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Dec 2016 09:33:07 GMT  (234kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.09434v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CG cs.LG math.ST stat.TH", "authors": ["fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric chazal", "ilaria giulini", "bertrand michel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.09434"}
