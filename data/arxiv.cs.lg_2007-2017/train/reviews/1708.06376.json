{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "21-Aug-2017", "title": "Automated Feature Extraction for Website Fingerprinting through Deep Learning", "abstract": "Several studies have shown that the network traffic that is generated by a visit to a website over Tor reveals information specific to the website through the timing and sizes of network packets. By capturing traffic traces between users and their Tor entry guard, a network eavesdropper can leverage this meta-data to reveal which website Tor users are visiting. The success of such attacks heavily depends on the particular set of traffic features that are used to construct the fingerprint. Typically, these features are manually engineered and, as such, any change introduced to the Tor network can render these carefully constructed features ineffective. In this paper, we show that an adversary can automate the feature engineering process, and thus automatically deanonymize Tor traffic by applying our novel method based on deep learning. We evaluate our approach on a dataset comprised of more than three million network traces, which is the largest dataset of web traffic ever gathered for website fingerprinting, and find that the performance achieved by deep learning techniques is comparable to known approaches which include various research efforts spanning over multiple years. Furthermore, it eliminates the need for feature design and selection which is a tedious work and has been one of the main focus of prior work. We conclude that the ability to automatically construct the most relevant traffic features and perform accurate traffic recognition makes our deep learning based approach an efficient, flexible and robust technique for website fingerprinting.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Aug 2017 18:32:08 GMT  (461kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06376v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["vera rimmer", "davy preuveneers", "marc juarez", "tom van goethem", "wouter joosen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.06376"}
