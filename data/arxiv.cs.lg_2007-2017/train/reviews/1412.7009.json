(2013) proposes a sampling procedure for denoising autoencoders which involves learning the transition operator of a Markov chain. The transition operator is typically unimodal, which limits its capacity to model complex data. In order to perform efficient sampling from conditional distributions, we extend this work, both theoretically and algorithmically, to gated autoencoders (Memisevic, 2013), The proposed model is able to generate convincing class-conditional samples when trained on both the MNIST and TFD datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 14:57:05 GMT  (2522kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7009v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 00:16:55 GMT  (2523kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7009v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 9 Apr 2015 01:54:33 GMT  (2523kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7009v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["jan rudy", "graham taylor"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.7009"}
