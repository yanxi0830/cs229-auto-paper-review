The results demonstrate the superiority of this distance metric over the traditional and most-used distances, such as Manhattan distance and Euclidian distance. Moreover, we proved that the Hassanat distance metric is invariant to data scale, noise and outliers. Throughout this work, it is clearly notable that both ENN and IINC performed very well with the distance investigated, as their accuracy increased significantly by 3.3% and 3.1% respectively, with no significant advantage of the ENN over the IINC in terms of accuracy. Correspondingly, it can be noted from our results that there is no optimal algorithm that can solve all real-life problems perfectly; this is supported by the no-free-lunch theorem", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 4 Jan 2015 15:37:20 GMT  (220kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00687v1", "Canadian Journal of Pure and Applied Sciences (CJPAS). volume 9, issue 1, Feb 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Canadian Journal of Pure and Applied Sciences (CJPAS). volume 9, issue 1, Feb 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["mouhammd alkasassbeh", "ghada a altarawneh", "ahmad b a hassanat"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.00687"}
