Numerous attempts have been done to improve the quality of the games including more realistic artistic production and computer science. Assessing the player's behavior, a task known as player modeling, is currently the need of the hour which leads to possible improvements in terms of: (i) better game interaction experience, (ii) better exploitation of the relationship between players, and (iii) increasing/maintaining the number of players interested in the game. In this paper we model players using the basic four behaviors proposed in \\cite{BartleArtigo}, namely: achiever, explorer, socializer and killer. Our analysis is carried out using data obtained from the game \"World of Warcraft\" over 3 years (2006 $-$ 2009). We employ a semi-supervised learning technique in order to find out characteristics that possibly impact player's behavior.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 21:48:46 GMT  (4229kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02780v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["marcelo souza nery", "roque", "erson teixeira", "victor do nascimento silva", "adriano alonso veloso"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02780"}
