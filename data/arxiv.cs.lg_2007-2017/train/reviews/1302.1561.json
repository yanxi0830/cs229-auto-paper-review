Causal interaction models are models that have independent mechanisms where a mechanism can have several causes. In addition to introducing several particular types of causal interaction models, we show how we can apply the Bayesian approach to learning causal interaction models obtaining approximate posterior distributions for the models and obtain MAP and ML estimates for the parameters. We illustrate the approach with a simulation study of learning model posteriors.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:58:24 GMT  (1929kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1561v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"], ["v2", "Sat, 16 May 2015 23:30:56 GMT  (227kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1561v2", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["christopher meek", "david heckerman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1561"}
