This knowledge provides valuable feedback which allows them to further develop the next generation of their product. In this paper, sentiment analysis of a product is performed by extracting tweets about that product and classifying the tweets showing it as positive and negative sentiment. The authors propose a hybrid approach which combines unsupervised learning in the form of K-means clustering to cluster the tweets and then performing supervised learning methods such as Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines for classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Sep 2015 16:36:04 GMT  (97kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02437v1", "5 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.LG cs.SI", "authors": ["rishabh soni", "k james mathai"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.02437"}
