{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "1-Oct-2014", "title": "A Multi-World Approach to Question Answering about Real-World Scenes based on Uncertain Input", "abstract": "We propose a method for automatically answering questions about images by bringing together recent advances from natural language processing and computer vision. We combine discrete reasoning with uncertain predictions by a multi-world approach that represents uncertainty about the perceived world in a bayesian framework. Our approach can handle human questions of high complexity about realistic scenes and replies with range of answer like counts, object classes, instances and lists of them. The system is directly trained from question-answer pairs. We establish a first benchmark for this task that can be seen as a modern attempt at a visual turing test.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Oct 2014 12:59:16 GMT  (927kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0210v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 29 Oct 2014 16:29:44 GMT  (3240kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0210v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 11 Nov 2014 12:13:18 GMT  (3240kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0210v3", "Published in NIPS 2014"], ["v4", "Tue, 5 May 2015 17:39:10 GMT  (1493kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.0210v4", "Published in NIPS 2014"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["mateusz malinowski", "mario fritz"], "accepted": true, "id": "1410.0210"}
