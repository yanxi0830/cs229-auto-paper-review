We use a multi-layer recurrent highway network to model the temporal nature of spoken speech, and show that it learns to extract both form and meaning-based linguistic knowledge from the input signal. We carry out an in-depth analysis of the representations used by different components of the trained model and show that encoding of semantic aspects tends to become richer as we go up the hierarchy of layers, whereas encoding of form-related aspects of the language input tends to initially increase and then plateau or decrease.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 13:02:09 GMT  (738kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01991v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 12:57:36 GMT  (742kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01991v2", "Accepted at ACL 2017"], ["v3", "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 07:34:55 GMT  (742kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01991v3", "Accepted at ACL 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["grzegorz chrupala", "lieke gelderloos", "afra alishahi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.01991"}
