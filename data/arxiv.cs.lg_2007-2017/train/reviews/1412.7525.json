{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "23-Dec-2014", "title": "Difference Target Propagation", "abstract": "Back-propagation has been the workhorse of recent successes of deep learning but it relies on infinitesimal effects (partial derivatives) in order to perform credit assignment. This could become a serious issue as one considers deeper and more non-linear functions, e.g., consider the extreme case of non-linearity where the relation between parameters and cost is actually discrete. Inspired by the biological implausibility of back-propagation, a few approaches have been proposed in the past that could play a similar credit assignment role as back-prop. In this spirit, we explore a novel approach to credit assignment in deep networks that we call target propagation. The main idea is to compute targets rather than gradients, at each layer. Like gradients, they are propagated backwards. In a way that is related but different from previously proposed proxies for back-propagation which rely on a backwards network with symmetric weights, target propagation relies on auto-encoders at each layer. Unlike back-propagation, it can be applied even when units exchange stochastic bits rather than real numbers. We show that a linear correction for the imperfectness of the auto-encoders is very effective to make target propagation actually work, along with adaptive learning rates.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Dec 2014 20:57:59 GMT  (327kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7525v1", "11 pages, 8 figures, Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2015"], ["v2", "Tue, 3 Mar 2015 16:54:57 GMT  (313kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7525v2", "11 pages, 8 figures, Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2015"], ["v3", "Sat, 18 Apr 2015 01:01:54 GMT  (418kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7525v3", "13 pages, 8 figures, Workshop paper at ICLR 2015"], ["v4", "Sat, 14 Nov 2015 07:05:40 GMT  (418kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7525v4", "13 pages, 8 figures, Workshop paper at ICLR 2015"], ["v5", "Wed, 25 Nov 2015 02:30:41 GMT  (413kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7525v5", "13 pages, 8 figures, Accepted in ECML/PKDD 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 8 figures, Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["dong-hyun lee", "saizheng zhang", "asja fischer", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.7525"}
