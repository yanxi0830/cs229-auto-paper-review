We call such an observable maximally informative. Regardless whether categorical perception is real, maximally informative observables can form the basis of a theory of perception. We conclude with the implications of such a theory for the problem of speech perception.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Dec 2012 17:40:07 GMT  (232kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5091v1", "9 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SD", "authors": ["elaine tsiang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.5091"}
