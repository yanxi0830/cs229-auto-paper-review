{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "30-May-2016", "title": "The Bayesian Linear Information Filtering Problem", "abstract": "We present a Bayesian sequential decision-making formulation of the information filtering problem, in which an algorithm presents items (news articles, scientific papers, tweets) arriving in a stream, and learns relevance from user feedback on presented items. We model user preferences using a Bayesian linear model, similar in spirit to a Bayesian linear bandit. We compute a computational upper bound on the value of the optimal policy, which allows computing an optimality gap for implementable policies. We then use this analysis as motivation in introducing a pair of new Decompose-Then-Decide (DTD) heuristic policies, DTD-Dynamic-Programming (DTD-DP) and DTD-Upper-Confidence-Bound (DTD-UCB). We compare DTD-DP and DTD-UCB against several benchmarks on real and simulated data, demonstrating significant improvement, and show that the achieved performance is close to the upper bound.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 May 2016 02:35:07 GMT  (1127kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09088v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 22 Oct 2016 18:48:14 GMT  (1147kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09088v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["bangrui chen", "peter i frazier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.09088"}
