In this paper we investigate whether deep convolutional networks can be used to directly represent and learn this knowledge. We train a large 12-layer convolutional neural network by supervised learning from a database of human professional games. The network correctly predicts the expert move in 55% of positions, equalling the accuracy of a 6 dan human player. When the trained convolutional network was used directly to play games of Go, without any search, it beat the traditional search program GnuGo in 97% of games, and matched the performance of a state-of-the-art Monte-Carlo tree search that simulates a million positions per move.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 Dec 2014 00:31:30 GMT  (156kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6564v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 10 Apr 2015 19:03:34 GMT  (419kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6564v2", "Minor edits and included captures in Figure 2"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["chris j maddison", "aja huang", "ilya sutskever", "david silver"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.6564"}
