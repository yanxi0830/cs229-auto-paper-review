This definition covers first-order logical inference or probabilistic inference. It also includes much simpler manipulations commonly used to build large learning systems. For instance, we can build an optical character recognition system by first training a character segmenter, an isolated character recognizer, and a language model, using appropriate labeled training sets. Adequately concatenating these modules and fine tuning the resulting system can be viewed as an algebraic operation in a space of models. The resulting model answers a new question, that is, converting the image of a text page into a computer readable text.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Feb 2011 08:25:36 GMT  (1213kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1808v1", "15 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 10 Feb 2011 03:18:15 GMT  (1248kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1808v2", "15 pages - minor changes for version 2"], ["v3", "Fri, 11 Feb 2011 05:10:57 GMT  (1248kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.1808v3", "15 pages - fix broken pagination in v2"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["leon bottou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.1808"}
