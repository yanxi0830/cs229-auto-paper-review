Data augmentation by blocks mixing and domain adaptation using a novel method of test mixing are proposed and evaluated in regard to making the method robust to unseen data. The contributions of two kinds of acoustic features (dominant frequency and log mel-band energy) and their combinations are studied in the context of bird audio detection. Our best achieved AUC measure on five cross-validations of the development data is 95.5% and 88.1% on the unseen evaluation data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Jun 2017 05:09:41 GMT  (684kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02047v1", "Accepted for European Signal Processing Conference 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for European Signal Processing Conference 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.LG", "authors": ["sharath adavanne", "konstantinos drossos", "emre \\c{c}ak{\\i}r", "tuomas virtanen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02047"}
