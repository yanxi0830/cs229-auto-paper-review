{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "1-Oct-2012", "title": "Inference algorithms for pattern-based CRFs on sequence data", "abstract": "We consider Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with pattern-based potentials defined on a chain. In this model the energy of a string (labeling) $x_1 ... x_n$ is the sum of terms over intervals $[i,j]$ where each term is non-zero only if the substring $x_i ... x_j$ equals a prespecified pattern $\\alpha$. Such CRFs were used in computer vision, and can be naturally applied to many sequence tagging problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Oct 2012 19:13:59 GMT  (63kb,DS)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0508v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 23 Oct 2012 16:16:58 GMT  (64kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0508v2", "improved complexity for one of the cases"], ["v3", "Thu, 8 Nov 2012 00:11:30 GMT  (65kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0508v3", null], ["v4", "Sat, 29 Dec 2012 22:13:01 GMT  (72kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0508v4", null], ["v5", "Fri, 20 Jan 2017 08:00:44 GMT  (60kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.0508v5", "Algorithmica accepted version"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["rustem takhanov", "vladimir kolmogorov"], "accepted": true, "id": "1210.0508"}
