{"conference": "HLT-NAACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-Apr-2015", "title": "Unsupervised Dependency Parsing: Let's Use Supervised Parsers", "abstract": "We present a self-training approach to unsupervised dependency parsing that reuses existing supervised and unsupervised parsing algorithms. Our approach, called `iterated reranking' (IR), starts with dependency trees generated by an unsupervised parser, and iteratively improves these trees using the richer probability models used in supervised parsing that are in turn trained on these trees. Our system achieves 1.8% accuracy higher than the state-of-the-part parser of Spitkovsky et al. (2013) on the WSJ corpus.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 Apr 2015 00:23:16 GMT  (83kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04666v1", "11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["phong le", "willem h zuidema"], "accepted": true, "id": "1504.04666"}
