{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "29-Nov-2016", "title": "Cost-Sensitive Reference Pair Encoding for Multi-Label Learning", "abstract": "We propose a novel cost-sensitive multi-label classification algorithm called cost-sensitive random pair encoding (CSRPE). CSRPE reduces the cost-sensitive multi-label classification problem to many cost-sensitive binary classification problems through the label powerset approach followed by the classic one-versus-one decomposition. While such a naive reduction results in exponentially-many classifiers, we resolve the training challenge of building the many classifiers by random sampling, and the prediction challenge of voting from the many classifiers by nearest-neighbor decoding through casting the one-versus-one decomposition as a special case of error-correcting code. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that CSRPE achieves stable convergence and reaches better performance than other ensemble-learning and error-correcting-coding algorithms for multi-label classification. The results also justify that CSRPE is competitive with state-of-the-art cost-sensitive multi-label classification algorithms for cost-sensitive multi-label classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 02:41:28 GMT  (2153kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09461v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 07:26:05 GMT  (5624kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09461v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yao-yuan yang", "kuan-hao huang", "chih-wei chang", "hsuan-tien lin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.09461"}
