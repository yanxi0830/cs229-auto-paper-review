First, big data, machine learning (ML), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are discussed to familiarize the reader with the importance of such a system. Next, the benefits and detriments of implementing such a system in Python are presented. Lastly, the specifics of the system are explained, and some experimental results are presented to prove the effectiveness of the system.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 25 Oct 2015 21:04:12 GMT  (2115kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07303v1", "8 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["clay mcleod"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.07303"}
