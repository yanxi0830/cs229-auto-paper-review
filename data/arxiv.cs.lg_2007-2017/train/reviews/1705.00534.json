Compared with existing deep CNN based methods, our method achieves much better results with fewer training examples and model parameters. The advantages of our method come from the usage of dilated convolution, skip connection architecture and soft-weight-sum inference. Experimental evaluation on the NYU Depth V2 dataset shows that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by a margin.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Apr 2017 06:07:05 GMT  (1068kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00534v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["bo li", "yuchao dai", "huahui chen", "mingyi he"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.00534"}
