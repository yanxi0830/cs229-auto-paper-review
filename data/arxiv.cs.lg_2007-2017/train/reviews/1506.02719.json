We describe two algorithms for this task: one based on density estimation, and a novel algorithm benefiting from solid theoretical guarantees and with a very favorable running-time complexity of $O(n S \\log (n S))$, where $n$ is the sample size and $S$ the number of slots. Our theoretical guarantees are more favorable than those previously presented in the literature. Additionally, we show that even if bidders do not play at an equilibrium, our second algorithm is still well defined and minimizes a quantity of interest. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply learning algorithms to the problem of reserve price optimization in GSP auctions. Finally, we present the first convergence analysis of empirical equilibrium bidding functions to the unique symmetric Bayesian-Nash equilibrium of a GSP.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 22:45:30 GMT  (778kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02719v1", "To be published in Proceedings of UAI 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "To be published in Proceedings of UAI 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GT", "authors": ["mehryar mohri", "andres munoz medina"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.02719"}
