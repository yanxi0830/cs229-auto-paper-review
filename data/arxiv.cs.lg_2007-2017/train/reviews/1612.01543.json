It compresses the size of the storage for a large number of network parameters in a neural network by quantizing them and encoding the quantized values into binary codewords of smaller sizes. In this paper, we aim to design network quantization schemes that minimize the expected loss due to quantization while maximizing the compression ratio. To this end, we analyze the quantitative relation of quantization errors to the loss function of a neural network and identify that the Hessian-weighted distortion measure is locally the right objective function that we need to optimize for minimizing the loss due to quantization. As a result, Hessian-weighted k-means clustering is proposed for clustering network parameters to quantize when fixed-length binary encoding follows. When optimal variable-length binary codes, e.g., Huffman codes, are employed for further compression of quantized values after clustering, we derive that the network quantization problem can be related to the entropy-constrained scalar quantization (ECSQ) problem in information theory and consequently propose two solutions of ECSQ for network quantization, i.e., uniform quantization and an iterative algorithm similar to Lloyd's algorithm for k-means clustering. Finally, using the simple uniform quantization followed by Huffman coding, our experiment results show that the compression ratios of 51.25, 22.17 and 40.65 are achievable (i.e., the sizes of the compressed models are 1.95%, 4.51% and 2.46% of the original model sizes) for LeNet, ResNet and AlexNet, respectively, at no or marginal performance loss.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 Dec 2016 21:04:17 GMT  (400kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01543v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["yoojin choi", "mostafa el-khamy", "jungwon lee"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.01543"}
