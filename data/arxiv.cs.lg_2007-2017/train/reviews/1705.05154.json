We bridge this gap for models that exhibit a bipartite structure, including, most notably, the Restricted/Deep Boltzmann Machine. The de facto implementation for these models scans variables in a layerwise fashion. We show that the Gibbs sampler with a layerwise alternating scan order has its relaxation time (in terms of epochs) no larger than that of a random-update Gibbs sampler (in terms of variable updates). We also construct examples to show that this bound is asymptotically tight. Through standard inequalities, our result also implies a comparison on the mixing times.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 May 2017 11:00:25 GMT  (121kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05154v1", "15 pages"], ["v2", "Mon, 9 Oct 2017 11:03:50 GMT  (122kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05154v2", "v2: typo fixes and improved presentation"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["heng guo", "kaan kara", "ce zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05154"}
