We generalize factorized asymptotic Bayesian inference (FAB), which has been recently developed for model selection on independent hidden variables (i.e., mixture models), for time-dependent hidden variables. As with FAB in mixture models, FAB for HMMs is derived as an iterative lower bound maximization algorithm of a factorized information criterion (FIC). It inherits, from FAB for mixture models, several desirable properties for learning HMMs, such as asymptotic consistency of FIC with marginal log-likelihood, a shrinkage effect for hidden state selection, monotonic increase of the lower FIC bound through the iterative optimization. Further, it does not have a tunable hyper-parameter, and thus its model selection process can be fully automated. Experimental results shows that FAB outperforms states-of-the-art variational Bayesian HMM and non-parametric Bayesian HMM in terms of model selection accuracy and computational efficiency.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:37:59 GMT  (599kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4679v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["ryohei fujimaki", "kohei hayashi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4679"}
