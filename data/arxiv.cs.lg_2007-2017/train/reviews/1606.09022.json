SSL significantly reduces labeling related costs and is able to handle large data sets. The primary objective is the extraction of robust inference rules. Decision support systems (DSSs) who utilize SSL have significant advantages. Only a small amount of labelled data is required for the initialization. Then, new (unlabeled) data can be utilized and improve system's performance. Thus, the DSS is continuously adopted to new conditions, with minimum effort. Techniques which are cost effective and easily adopted to dynamic systems, can be beneficial for many practical applications. Such applications fields are: (a) industrial assembly lines monitoring, (b) sea border surveillance, (c) elders' falls detection, (d) transportation tunnels inspection, (e) concrete foundation piles defect recognition, (f) commercial sector companies financial assessment and (g) image advanced filtering for cultural heritage applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 29 Jun 2016 09:47:29 GMT  (5758kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.09022v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:math/0604233,arXiv:1208.2128,arXiv:1406.5298by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:math/0604233,arXiv:1208.2128,arXiv:1406.5298by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["eftychios protopapadakis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.09022"}
