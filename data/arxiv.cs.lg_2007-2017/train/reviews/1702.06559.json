This paper combines reinforcement learning with one-shot learning, allowing the model to decide, during classification, which examples are worth labeling. We introduce a classification task in which a stream of images are presented and, on each time step, a decision must be made to either predict a label or pay to receive the correct label. We present a recurrent neural network based action-value function, and demonstrate its ability to learn how and when to request labels. Through the choice of reward function, the model can achieve a higher prediction accuracy than a similar model on a purely supervised task, or trade prediction accuracy for fewer label requests.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Feb 2017 19:31:46 GMT  (279kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06559v1", "NIPS 2016, Deep Reinforcement Learning Workshop, Barcelona, Spain.
