We are motivated by applications such as clinical diagnosis where a patient is subjected to a sequence of (possibly expensive) tests before a decision is made. Our goal is to develop strategies for minimizing max-costs. The problem is known to be NP hard and greedy methods based on specialized impurity functions have been proposed. We develop a broad class of \\emph{admissible} impurity functions that admit monomials, classes of polynomials, and hinge-loss functions that allow for flexible impurity design with provably optimal approximation bounds. This flexibility is important for datasets when max-cost can be overly sensitive to \"outliers.\" Outliers bias max-cost to a few examples that require a large number of tests for classification. We design admissible functions that allow for accuracy-cost trade-off and result in $O(\\log n)$ guarantees of the optimal cost among trees with corresponding classification accuracy levels.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Jan 2015 16:33:47 GMT  (491kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02702v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["feng nan", "joseph wang", "venkatesh saligrama"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.02702"}
