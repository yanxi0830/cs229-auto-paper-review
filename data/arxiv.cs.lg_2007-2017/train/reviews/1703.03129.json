We present a large-scale life-long memory module for use in deep learning. The module exploits fast nearest-neighbor algorithms for efficiency and thus scales to large memory sizes. Except for the nearest-neighbor query, the module is fully differentiable and trained end-to-end with no extra supervision. It operates in a life-long manner, i.e., without the need to reset it during training.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Mar 2017 04:36:15 GMT  (89kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03129v1", "Conference paper accepted for ICLR'17"]], "COMMENTS": "Conference paper accepted for ICLR'17", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["{\\l}ukasz kaiser", "ofir nachum", "aurko roy", "samy bengio"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.03129"}
