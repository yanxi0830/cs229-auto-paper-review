At the same time, one continuously gathers vast amounts of data about these problems. Current constraint programming software does not exploit such data to update schedules, resources and plans. We propose a new framework, that we call the Inductive Constraint Programming loop. In this approach data is gathered and analyzed systematically, in order to dynamically revise and adapt constraints and optimization criteria. Inductive Constraint Programming aims at bridging the gap between the areas of data mining and machine learning on the one hand, and constraint programming on the other hand.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Oct 2015 14:51:03 GMT  (776kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03317v1", "17 pages, 9 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 9 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["christian bessiere", "luc de raedt", "tias guns", "lars kotthoff", "mirco nanni", "siegfried nijssen", "barry o'sullivan", "anastasia paparrizou", "dino pedreschi", "helmut simonis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.03317"}
