In this paper, we revisit both models from a unified perspective. Based on this new view, we study the properties of both models and propose new efficient training algorithms. Key to our approach is to cast parameter learning as a low-rank symmetric tensor estimation problem, which we solve by multi-convex optimization. We demonstrate our approach on regression and recommender system tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 29 Jul 2016 13:54:51 GMT  (664kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08810v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["mathieu blondel", "masakazu ishihata", "akinori fujino", "naonori ueda"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.08810"}
