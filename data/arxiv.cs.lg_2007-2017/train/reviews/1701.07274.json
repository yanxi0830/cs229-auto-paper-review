{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "25-Jan-2017", "title": "Deep Reinforcement Learning: An Overview", "abstract": "We give an overview of recent exciting achievements of deep reinforcement learning (RL). We start with background of deep learning and reinforcement learning, as well as introduction of testbeds. Next we discuss Deep Q-Network (DQN) and its extensions, asynchronous methods, policy optimization, reward, and planning. After that, we talk about attention and memory, unsupervised learning, and learning to learn. Then we discuss various applications of RL, including games, in particular, AlphaGo, robotics, spoken dialogue systems (a.k.a. chatbot), machine translation, text sequence prediction, neural architecture design, personalized web services, healthcare, finance, and music generation. We mention topics/papers not reviewed yet. After listing a collection of RL resources, we close with discussions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 11:52:11 GMT  (54kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07274v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1605.07669by other authors"], ["v2", "Thu, 26 Jan 2017 16:38:08 GMT  (54kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07274v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 15 Jul 2017 01:49:43 GMT  (194kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07274v3", "major updates for both content and organization"], ["v4", "Sun, 3 Sep 2017 12:39:11 GMT  (162kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07274v4", null], ["v5", "Fri, 15 Sep 2017 13:12:26 GMT  (163kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07274v5", null]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1605.07669by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yuxi li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.07274"}
