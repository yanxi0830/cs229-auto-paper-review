We introduce the PNN-training algorithm and use it for training the support vector machine (SVM) with a few numbers of labeled data and a large number of unlabeled data. We try to find the best labels for unlabeled data and then use SVM to enhance the classification rate. We test our method on two famous benchmarks and show the efficiency of our method in comparison with pervious methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Sep 2015 20:30:19 GMT  (306kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01271v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hamidreza farhidzadeh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.01271"}
