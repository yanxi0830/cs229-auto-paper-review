One simple approach to this is to use online Monte Carlo methods, such as SGLD (stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics). Unfortunately, such a method needs to store many copies of the parameters (which wastes memory), and needs to make predictions using many versions of the model (which wastes time).", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 14 Jun 2015 16:22:16 GMT  (384kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04416v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 7 Jul 2015 18:38:47 GMT  (383kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04416v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 6 Nov 2015 23:51:30 GMT  (394kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04416v3", "final version submitted to NIPS 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["anoop korattikara balan", "vivek rathod", "kevin p murphy", "max welling"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.04416"}
