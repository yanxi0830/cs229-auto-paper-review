While several methods have been proposed to accomplish this task, their relative merits and limitations remain somewhat obscure. By analyzing a number of concrete examples, we show that low-complexity algorithms systematically fail when the Markov random field develops long-range correlations. More precisely, this phenomenon appears to be related to the Ising model phase transition (although it does not coincide with it).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Oct 2009 01:10:44 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.5761v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cond-mat.stat-mech cs.LG", "authors": ["andrea montanari", "jose ayres pereira"], "accepted": true, "id": "0910.5761"}
