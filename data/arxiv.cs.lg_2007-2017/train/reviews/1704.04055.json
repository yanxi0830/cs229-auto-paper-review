How to efficiently analyze such kind of information is still an open question in the remote sensing field. Recently, deep learning methods proved suitable to deal with remote sensing data mainly for scene classification (i.e. Convolutional Neural Networks - CNNs - on single images) while only very few studies exist involving temporal deep learning approaches (i.e Recurrent Neural Networks - RNNs) to deal with remote sensing time series. In this letter we evaluate the ability of Recurrent Neural Networks, in particular the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) model, to perform land cover classification considering multi-temporal spatial data derived from a time series of satellite images. We carried out experiments on two different datasets considering both pixel-based and object-based classification. The obtained results show that Recurrent Neural Networks are competitive compared to state-of-the-art classifiers, and may outperform classical approaches in presence of low represented and/or highly mixed classes. We also show that using the alternative feature representation generated by LSTM can improve the performances of standard classifiers.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 Apr 2017 09:47:12 GMT  (251kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04055v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["dino ienco", "raffaele gaetano", "claire dupaquier", "pierre maurel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.04055"}
