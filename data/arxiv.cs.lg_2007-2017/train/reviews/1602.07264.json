We performed a complete data analysis and during the exploratory phase, we selected a list of differentially expressed genes. Despite their association with the diseased state, we could not use them as a biomarker tool. Therefore, our research was extended to include a multivariate analysis approach resulting in the identification and selection of a group of 20 genes that showed a clear potential in detecting and correctly classify Parkinson Disease samples even in the presence of other neurodegenerative disorders.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 May 2015 00:55:17 GMT  (659kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07264v1", "5 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, published at the Research Day at Pace University, New York.
