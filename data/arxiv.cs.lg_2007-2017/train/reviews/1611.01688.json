{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "5-Nov-2016", "title": "Oracle-Efficient Online Learning and Auction Design", "abstract": "We consider the design of online no-regret algorithms that are computationally efficient, given access to an offline optimization oracle. We present an algorithm we call Generalized Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader and provide conditions under which it achieves vanishing regret and is oracle-efficient. Our second main contribution is introducing a new adversarial auction-design framework for revenue maximization and applying our oracle-efficient learning results to the adaptive optimization of auctions.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 5 Nov 2016 18:54:59 GMT  (656kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01688v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 13 Apr 2017 08:21:30 GMT  (243kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01688v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS cs.GT", "authors": ["miroslav dud\\'ik", "nika haghtalab", "haipeng luo", "robert e schapire", "vasilis syrgkanis", "jennifer wortman vaughan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01688"}
