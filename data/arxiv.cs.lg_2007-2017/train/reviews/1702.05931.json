In this paper, we propose a system for CRC tissue classification based on convolutional networks (ConvNets). We investigate the importance of stain normalization in tissue classification of CRC tissue samples in H&amp;E-stained images. Furthermore, we report the performance of ConvNets on a cohort of rectal cancer samples and on an independent publicly available dataset of colorectal H&amp;E images.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Feb 2017 11:11:50 GMT  (2855kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05931v1", "Accepted for oral presentation at the IEEE Internatioal Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2017"], ["v2", "Tue, 23 May 2017 12:34:17 GMT  (2855kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05931v2", "Published in Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for oral presentation at the IEEE Internatioal Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["francesco ciompi", "oscar geessink", "babak ehteshami bejnordi", "gabriel silva de souza", "alexi baidoshvili", "geert litjens", "bram van ginneken", "iris nagtegaal", "jeroen van der laak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.05931"}
