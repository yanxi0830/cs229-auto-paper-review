Unlike traditional regression methods which produce point predictions, Conformal Predictors output predictive regions that satisfy a given confidence level. The regions produced by any Conformal Predictor are automatically valid, however their tightness and therefore usefulness depends on the nonconformity measure used by each CP. In effect a nonconformity measure evaluates how strange a given example is compared to a set of other examples based on some traditional machine learning algorithm. We define six novel nonconformity measures based on the k-Nearest Neighbours Regression algorithm and develop the corresponding CPs following both the original (transductive) and the inductive CP approaches. A comparison of the predictive regions produced by our measures with those of the typical regression measure suggests that a major improvement in terms of predictive region tightness is achieved by the new measures.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 05:12:21 GMT  (331kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3880v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["harris papadopoulos", "vladimir vovk", "alex gammerman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3880"}
