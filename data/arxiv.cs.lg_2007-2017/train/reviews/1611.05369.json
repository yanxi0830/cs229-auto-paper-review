{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Nov-2016", "title": "Fast On-Line Kernel Density Estimation for Active Object Localization", "abstract": "A major goal of computer vision is to enable computers to interpret visual situations---abstract concepts (e.g., \"a person walking a dog,\" \"a crowd waiting for a bus,\" \"a picnic\") whose image instantiations are linked more by their common spatial and semantic structure than by low-level visual similarity. In this paper, we propose a novel method for prior learning and active object localization for this kind of knowledge-driven search in static images. In our system, prior situation knowledge is captured by a set of flexible, kernel-based density estimations---a situation model---that represent the expected spatial structure of the given situation. These estimations are efficiently updated by information gained as the system searches for relevant objects, allowing the system to use context as it is discovered to narrow the search.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Nov 2016 17:04:35 GMT  (2836kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05369v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1607.00548"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1607.00548", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["anthony d rhodes", "max h quinn", "melanie mitchell"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.05369"}
