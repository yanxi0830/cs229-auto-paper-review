However, such architecture might be difficult to train and time-consuming. Instead, we propose to drastically simplify the word embeddings computation through a Hellinger PCA of the word co-occurence matrix. We compare those new word embeddings with some well-known embeddings on NER and movie review tasks and show that we can reach similar or even better performance. Although deep learning is not really necessary for generating good word embeddings, we show that it can provide an easy way to adapt embeddings to specific tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Dec 2013 13:31:11 GMT  (215kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5542v1", "9 pages, 5 tables. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1103.0398by other authors"], ["v2", "Tue, 18 Mar 2014 10:23:35 GMT  (219kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5542v2", "9 pages, 5 tables"], ["v3", "Wed, 4 Jan 2017 17:01:11 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5542v3", "9 pages, 5 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 5 tables. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1103.0398by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["r\\'emi lebret", "ronan collobert"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.5542"}
