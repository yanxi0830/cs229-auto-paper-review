We propose a vector-space model which provides a formal foundation for a distributional semantics of entailment. Using a mean-field approximation, we develop approximate inference procedures and entailment operators over vectors of probabilities of features being known (versus unknown). We use this framework to reinterpret an existing distributional-semantic model (Word2Vec) as approximating an entailment-based model of the distributions of words in contexts, thereby predicting lexical entailment relations. In both unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on hyponymy detection, we get substantial improvements over previous results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Jul 2016 15:08:26 GMT  (58kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03780v1", "To appear in Proc. 54th Annual Meeting of the Association Computational Linguistics (ACL 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in Proc. 54th Annual Meeting of the Association Computational Linguistics (ACL 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["james henderson", "diana nicoleta popa"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.03780"}
