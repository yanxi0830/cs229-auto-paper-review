{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "19-May-2017", "title": "PixColor: Pixel Recursive Colorization", "abstract": "We propose a novel approach to automatically produce multiple colorized versions of a grayscale image. Our method results from the observation that the task of automated colorization is relatively easy given a low-resolution version of the color image. We first train a conditional PixelCNN to generate a low resolution color for a given grayscale image. Then, given the generated low-resolution color image and the original grayscale image as inputs, we train a second CNN to generate a high-resolution colorization of an image. We demonstrate that our approach produces more diverse and plausible colorizations than existing methods, as judged by human raters in a \"Visual Turing Test\".", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 May 2017 22:10:51 GMT  (5605kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07208v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 5 Jun 2017 18:38:01 GMT  (5600kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07208v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["sergio guadarrama", "ryan dahl", "david bieber", "mohammad norouzi", "jonathon shlens", "kevin murphy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07208"}
