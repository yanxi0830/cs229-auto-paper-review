The well-known Hammersley-Clifford theorem uses these conditional independences to factorize a Gibbs distribution into a set of factors. However, an important issue of using a graph to represent independences is that it cannot encode some types of independence relations, such as the context-specific independences (CSIs). They are a particular case of conditional independences that is true only for a certain assignment of its conditioning set; in contrast to conditional independences that must hold for all its assignments. This work presents a method for factorizing a Markov random field according to CSIs present in a distribution, and formally guarantees that this factorization is correct. This is presented in our main contribution, the context-specific Hammersley-Clifford theorem, a generalization to CSIs of the Hammersley-Clifford theorem that applies for conditional independences.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Jun 2013 19:36:31 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2295v1", "7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["alejandro edera", "facundo bromberg", "federico schl\\\"uter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.2295"}
