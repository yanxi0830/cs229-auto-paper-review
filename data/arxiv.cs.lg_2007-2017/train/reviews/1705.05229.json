Most of the recommendation models fall into two primary species, collaborative filtering based and content based approaches. Variants of instantiations of collaborative filtering approach suffer from the common issues of so called \"cold start\" and \"long tail\" problems where there is not much user interaction data to reveal user opinions or affinities on the content and also the distortion towards the popular content. Content-based approaches are sometimes limited by the richness of the available content data resulting in a heavily biased and coarse recommendation result. In recent years, the deep neural network has enjoyed a great success in large-scale image and video recognitions. In this paper, we propose and experiment using deep convolutional neural network to imitate how human brain processes hierarchical structures in the auditory signals, such as music, speech, etc., at various timescales. This approach can be used to discover the latent factor models of the music based upon acoustic hyper-images that are extracted from the raw audio waves of music. These latent embeddings can be used either as features to feed to subsequent models, such as collaborative filtering, or to build similarity metrics between songs, or to classify music based on the labels for training such as genre, mood, sentiment, etc.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 May 2017 01:08:31 GMT  (3815kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05229v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.LG", "authors": ["zhou xing", "eddy baik", "yan jiao", "nilesh kulkarni", "chris li", "gautam muralidhar", "marzieh parandehgheibi", "erik reed", "abhishek singhal", "fei xiao", "chris pouliot"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05229"}
