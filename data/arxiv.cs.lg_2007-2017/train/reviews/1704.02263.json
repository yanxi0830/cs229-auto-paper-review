Our system is a voting ensemble, where each base classifier is trained in a different feature space. The first space is a bag-of-words model and has a Linear SVM as base classifier. The second and third spaces are two different strategies of combining word embeddings to represent sentences and use a Linear SVM and a Logistic Regressor as base classifiers. The proposed system was ranked 18th out of 38 systems considering F1 score and 20th considering recall.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Apr 2017 15:27:10 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02263v1", "Published in Proceedings of SemEval-2017, 5 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Published in Proceedings of SemEval-2017, 5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["edilson a corr\\^ea jr", "vanessa queiroz marinho", "leandro borges dos santos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.02263"}
