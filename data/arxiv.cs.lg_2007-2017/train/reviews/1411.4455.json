To tackle the sparsity and noise challenges, we propose solving the classification problem using matrix completion on factorized matrix of minimized rank. We formulate relation classification as completing the unknown labels of testing items (entity pairs) in a sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features with training labels. Our algorithmic framework is based on the assumption that the rank of item-by-feature and item-by-label joint matrix is low. We apply two optimization models to recover the underlying low-rank matrix leveraging the sparsity of feature-label matrix. The matrix completion problem is then solved by the fixed point continuation (FPC) algorithm, which can find the global optimum. Experiments on two widely used datasets with different dimensions of textual features demonstrate that our low-rank matrix completion approach significantly outperforms the baseline and the state-of-the-art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Nov 2014 12:43:30 GMT  (1872kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4455v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["miao fan", "deli zhao", "qiang zhou", "zhiyuan liu", "thomas fang zheng", "edward y chang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.4455"}
