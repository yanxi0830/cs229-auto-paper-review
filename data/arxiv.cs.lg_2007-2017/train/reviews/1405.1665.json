Specifically we study the problem of estimating the mean \\vectheta of an unknown d dimensional normal distribution in the distributed setting. In this problem, the samples from the unknown distribution are distributed among m different machines. The goal is to estimate the mean \\vectheta at the optimal minimax rate while communicating as few bits as possible. We show that in this simple setting, the communication cost scales linearly in the number of dimensions i.e. one needs to deal with different dimensions individually.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 May 2014 16:44:21 GMT  (8kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1665v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 8 Nov 2014 03:06:04 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1665v2", "to appear at NIPS'14 with oral presentation"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IT math.IT", "authors": ["ankit garg", "tengyu ma", "huy l nguyen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1405.1665"}
