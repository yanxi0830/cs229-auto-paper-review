We apply the EUNN in Recurrent Neural Networks, and test its performance on the standard copying task and the MNIST digit recognition benchmark, finding that it significantly outperforms a non-unitary RNN, an LSTM network, an exclusively partial space URNN and a projective URNN with comparable parameter numbers.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Dec 2016 20:39:15 GMT  (1624kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05231v1", "9 pages, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Sun, 26 Feb 2017 19:00:50 GMT  (3179kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05231v2", "9 pages, 4 figures"], ["v3", "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 17:13:38 GMT  (3180kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.05231v3", "9 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML", "authors": ["li jing", "yichen shen", "tena dubcek", "john peurifoy", "scott a skirlo", "yann lecun", "max tegmark", "marin soljacic"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.05231"}
