Our model learns to generate small-scale splash detail for fluid-implicit-particle methods using training data acquired from physically accurate, high-resolution simulations. We use neural networks to model the regression of splash formation using a classifier together with a velocity modification term. More specifically, we employ a heteroscedastic model for the velocity updates. Our simulation results demonstrate that our model significantly improves visual fidelity with a large amount of realistic droplet formation and yields splash detail much more efficiently than finer discretizations. We show this for two different spatial scales and simulation setups.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:28:37 GMT  (3192kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04456v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GR cs.LG", "authors": ["kiwon um", "xiangyu hu", "nils thuerey"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.04456"}
