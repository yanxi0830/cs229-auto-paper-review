{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Jan-2014", "title": "Bayesian Nonparametric Multilevel Clustering with Group-Level Contexts", "abstract": "We present a Bayesian nonparametric framework for multilevel clustering which utilizes group-level context information to simultaneously discover low-dimensional structures of the group contents and partitions groups into clusters. Using the Dirichlet process as the building block, our model constructs a product base-measure with a nested structure to accommodate content and context observations at multiple levels. The proposed model possesses properties that link the nested Dirichlet processes (nDP) and the Dirichlet process mixture models (DPM) in an interesting way: integrating out all contents results in the DPM over contexts, whereas integrating out group-specific contexts results in the nDP mixture over content variables. We provide a Polya-urn view of the model and an efficient collapsed Gibbs inference procedure. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the advantage of utilizing context information via our model in both text and image domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jan 2014 12:08:07 GMT  (5460kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1974v1", "Full version of ICML 2014"], ["v2", "Mon, 13 Jan 2014 06:28:03 GMT  (5101kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1974v2", "Full version of ICML 2014"], ["v3", "Mon, 27 Jan 2014 08:13:58 GMT  (5167kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1974v3", "Full version of ICML 2014"], ["v4", "Wed, 29 Jan 2014 01:54:57 GMT  (5170kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1974v4", "Full version of ICML 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Full version of ICML 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["tien-vu nguyen", "dinh quoc phung", "xuanlong nguyen", "svetha venkatesh", "hung hai bui"], "accepted": true, "id": "1401.1974"}
