This work provides two main technical results that lift this conclusion to games of incomplete information, a.k.a., Bayesian games. First, near-optimal welfare in Bayesian games follows directly from the smoothness-based proof of near-optimal welfare in the same game when the private information is public. Second, no-regret learning dynamics converge to Bayesian coarse correlated equilibrium in these incomplete information games. These results are enabled by interpretation of a Bayesian game as a stochastic game of complete information.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Jul 2015 03:27:32 GMT  (50kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00418v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 23:45:14 GMT  (57kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00418v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.LG", "authors": ["jason d hartline", "vasilis syrgkanis", "\u00e9va tardos"], "accepted": true, "id": "1507.00418"}
