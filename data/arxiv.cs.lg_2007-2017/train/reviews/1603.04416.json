This leads to an important class of criteria of efficiency that we call probabilistic; it turns out that the most standard criteria of efficiency used in literature on conformal prediction are not probabilistic.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Mar 2016 19:49:07 GMT  (21kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04416v1", "16 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 14 Sep 2016 12:57:51 GMT  (38kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04416v2", "31 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["vladimir vovk", "ilia nouretdinov", "valentina fedorova", "ivan petej", "alex gammerman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.04416"}
