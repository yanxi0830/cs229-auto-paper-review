Algorithms mining longitudinal observation databases are not restricted by many of the limitations associated with the more conventional methods that have been developed for spontaneous reporting system databases. In this paper we investigate the robustness of four recently developed algorithms that mine longitudinal observational databases by applying them to The Health Improvement Network (THIN) for six drugs with well document known negative side effects. Our results show that none of the existing algorithms was able to consistently identify known adverse drug reactions above events related to the cause of the drug and no algorithm was superior.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Jul 2013 11:24:55 GMT  (379kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1584v1", "UKCI 2012, the 12th Annual Workshop on Computational Intelligence, Heriot-Watt University, pp 1-8, 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "UKCI 2012, the 12th Annual Workshop on Computational Intelligence, Heriot-Watt University, pp 1-8, 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE cs.DB", "authors": ["jenna reps", "jonathan m garibaldi", "uwe aickelin", "daniele soria", "jack e gibson", "richard b hubbard"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.1584"}
