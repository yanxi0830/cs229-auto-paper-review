Exogenic and/or endogenic factors often give rise to anomalies, making it very challenging to maintain high availability, while also delivering high performance. Given that service-oriented architectures (SOA) typically have a large number of services, with each service having a large set of metrics, automatic detection of anomalies is non-trivial.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 06:09:48 GMT  (4201kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07706v1", "13 pages, 12 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 12 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jordan hochenbaum", "owen s vallis", "arun kejariwal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.07706"}
