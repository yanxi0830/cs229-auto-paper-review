In the context of the biometric authentication, this means that more intruders will be classified as valid user, and in case of speaker identification system, user A will be classified user B. In this paper, we examine poisoning attack against SVM and introduce - Curie - a method to protect the SVM classifier from the poisoning attack. The basic idea of our method is to identify the poisoned data points injected by the adversary and filter them out. Our method is light weight and can be easily integrated into existing systems. Experimental results shows that it works very well in filtering out the poisoned data.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 5 Jun 2016 23:42:56 GMT  (416kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01584v1", "19 pages, 10 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 00:41:08 GMT  (416kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01584v2", "19 pages, 10 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "19 pages, 10 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["ricky laishram", "vir virander phoha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.01584"}
