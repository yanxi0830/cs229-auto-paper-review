However, compared to general feedforward neural networks, RNNs have feedback loops, which makes it a little hard to understand the backpropagation step. Thus, we focus on basics, especially the error backpropagation to compute gradients with respect to model parameters. Further, we go into detail on how error backpropagation algorithm is applied on long short-term memory (LSTM) by unfolding the memory unit.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 8 Oct 2016 21:10:40 GMT  (840kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02583v1", "9 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 17 Oct 2017 04:48:14 GMT  (842kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02583v2", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["gang chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.02583"}
