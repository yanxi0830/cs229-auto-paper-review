{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "27-May-2016", "title": "PAC-Bayesian Theory Meets Bayesian Inference", "abstract": "We exhibit a strong link between frequentist PAC-Bayesian bounds and the Bayesian marginal likelihood. That is, for the negative log-likelihood loss function, we show that the minimization of PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds maximizes the Bayesian marginal likelihood. This provides an alternative explanation to the Bayesian Occam's razor criteria, under the assumption that the data is generated by a i.i.d. distribution. Moreover, as the negative log-likelihood is an unbounded loss function, we motivate and propose a PAC-Bayesian theorem tailored for the sub-Gamma loss family, and we show that our approach is sound on classical Bayesian linear regression tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2016 13:41:33 GMT  (525kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08636v1", "under review"], ["v2", "Tue, 1 Nov 2016 14:49:05 GMT  (530kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08636v2", "To appear at NIPS 2016"], ["v3", "Sat, 3 Dec 2016 22:48:15 GMT  (529kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08636v3", "To appear at NIPS 2016 (revised version)"], ["v4", "Mon, 13 Feb 2017 17:14:52 GMT  (530kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08636v4", "Published at NIPS 2015 (this http URL)"]], "COMMENTS": "under review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["pascal germain", "francis r bach", "alexandre lacoste", "simon lacoste-julien"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.08636"}
