Interestingly, randomization has also been proposed to improve security of learning algorithms against evasion attacks, as it results in hiding information about the classifier to the attacker. Recent work has proposed game-theoretical formulations to learn secure classifiers, by simulating different evasion attacks and modifying the classification function accordingly. However, both the classification function and the simulated data manipulations have been modeled in a deterministic manner, without accounting for any form of randomization. In this work, we overcome this limitation by proposing a randomized prediction game, namely, a non-cooperative game-theoretic formulation in which the classifier and the attacker make randomized strategy selections according to some probability distribution defined over the respective strategy set. We show that our approach allows one to improve the trade-off between attack detection and false alarms with respect to state-of-the-art secure classifiers, even against attacks that are different from those hypothesized during design, on application examples including handwritten digit recognition, spam and malware detection.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 3 Sep 2016 09:30:51 GMT  (1288kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.00804v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GT", "authors": ["samuel rota bul\\`o", "battista biggio", "ignazio pillai", "marcello pelillo", "fabio roli"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.00804"}
