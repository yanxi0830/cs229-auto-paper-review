In this paper, we use Kinect and propose a feature graph fusion (FGF) for robot recognition. Our feature fusion utilizes RGB and depth information to construct fused feature from Kinect. FGF involves multi-Jaccard similarity to compute a robust graph and utilize word embedding method to enhance the recognition results. We also collect DUT RGB-D face dataset and a benchmark datset to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. The experimental results illustrate FGF is robust and effective to face and object datasets in robot applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Mar 2017 11:58:14 GMT  (2353kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08378v1", "Assembly Automation"]], "COMMENTS": "Assembly Automation", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO", "authors": ["shenglan liu", "muxin sun", "wei wang", "feilong wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08378"}
