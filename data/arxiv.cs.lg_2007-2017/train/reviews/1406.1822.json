{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "6-Jun-2014", "title": "Logarithmic Time Online Multiclass prediction", "abstract": "We study the problem of multiclass classification with an extremely large number of classes, with the goal of obtaining train and test time complexity logarithmic in the number of classes. We develop top-down tree construction approaches for constructing logarithmic depth trees. On the theoretical front, we formulate a new objective function, which is optimized at each node of the tree and creates dynamic partitions of the data which are both pure (in terms of class labels) and balanced. We demonstrate that under favorable conditions, we can construct logarithmic depth trees that have leaves with low label entropy. However, the objective function at the nodes is challenging to optimize computationally. We address the empirical problem with a new online decision tree construction procedure. Experiments demonstrate that this online algorithm quickly achieves small error rates relative to more common O(k) approaches and simultaneously achieves significant improvement in test error compared to other logarithmic training time approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Jun 2014 21:52:25 GMT  (31kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1822v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 6 Aug 2014 08:44:27 GMT  (29kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1822v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 7 Aug 2014 16:53:01 GMT  (29kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1822v3", null], ["v4", "Sat, 25 Oct 2014 22:57:31 GMT  (27kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1822v4", null], ["v5", "Sun, 14 Dec 2014 20:43:46 GMT  (28kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1822v5", null], ["v6", "Fri, 6 Feb 2015 00:54:09 GMT  (59kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1822v6", null], ["v7", "Fri, 27 Mar 2015 21:04:14 GMT  (59kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1822v7", null], ["v8", "Mon, 18 May 2015 00:08:13 GMT  (371kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1822v8", null], ["v9", "Tue, 19 May 2015 01:14:10 GMT  (371kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1822v9", null], ["v10", "Fri, 22 May 2015 23:35:53 GMT  (371kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1822v10", null], ["v11", "Wed, 3 Jun 2015 16:29:53 GMT  (371kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1822v11", null], ["v12", "Thu, 6 Aug 2015 04:02:41 GMT  (372kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1822v12", null], ["v13", "Sat, 14 Nov 2015 23:02:33 GMT  (372kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.1822v13", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["anna choromanska", "john langford"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.1822"}
