OneR is utilized as horizontal com-pression for attribute reduction, and affinity propagation is employed as vertical compression to select small representative exemplars from large training data. As to be able to computationally compress the larger volume of training data with scalability, MapReduce based parallelization approach is then implemented and evaluated for each step of the model compression process abovementioned, on which common but efficient classification methods can be directly used. Experimental application study on two publicly available datasets of intrusion detection, KDD99 and CMDC2012, demonstrates that the classification using the compressed model proposed can effectively speed up the detection procedure at up to 184 times, most importantly at the cost of a minimal accuracy difference with less than 1% on average.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 May 2014 08:47:31 GMT  (1130kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.3410v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR", "authors": ["tieming chen", "xu zhang", "shichao jin", "okhee kim"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.3410"}
