We propose the method of Deep Shifting, which remembers previously calculated results of convolution operations in order to minimize the number of calculations. The reduction in complexity is at least a constant and in the best case quadratic. We demonstrate that this method does indeed save significant computation time in a practical implementation, especially when the networks receives a large number of time-frames.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Mar 2016 15:16:09 GMT  (912kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03657v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["koen groenland", "sander bohte"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.03657"}
