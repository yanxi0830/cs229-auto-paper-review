We propose a neural machine translation (NMT) framework for simultaneous translation in which an agent learns to make decisions on when to translate from the interaction with a pre-trained NMT environment. To trade off quality and delay, we extensively explore various targets for delay and design a method for beam-search applicable in the simultaneous MT setting. Experiments against state-of-the-art baselines on two language pairs demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework both quantitatively and qualitatively.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 02:11:03 GMT  (1464kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00388v1", "9 pages, 8 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 00:46:39 GMT  (1467kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00388v2", "10 pages, 8 figures (with additional related works)"], ["v3", "Tue, 10 Jan 2017 21:07:56 GMT  (2974kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00388v3", "10 pages, camera ready"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["jiatao gu", "graham neubig", "kyunghyun cho", "victor o k li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.00388"}
