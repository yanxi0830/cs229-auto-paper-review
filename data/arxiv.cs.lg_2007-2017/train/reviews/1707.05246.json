Inspired by work on curriculum learning, we propose to \\emph{learn} data selection measures using Bayesian Optimization and evaluate them across models, domains and tasks. Our learned measures outperform existing domain similarity measures significantly on three tasks: sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and parsing. We show the importance of complementing similarity with diversity, and that learned measures are -- to some degree -- transferable across models, domains, and even tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Jul 2017 15:53:18 GMT  (259kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.05246v1", "EMNLP 2017.
