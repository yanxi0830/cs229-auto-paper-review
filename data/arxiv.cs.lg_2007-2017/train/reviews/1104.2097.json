However, the theorem is only valid under special assumptions of measurability of the class, in which case the PAC learnability even becomes consistent. Otherwise, there is a classical example, constructed under the Continuum Hypothesis by Dudley and Durst and further adapted by Blumer, Ehrenfeucht, Haussler, and Warmuth, of a concept class of VC dimension one which is neither uniform Glivenko-Cantelli nor consistently PAC learnable. We show that, rather surprisingly, under an additional set-theoretic hypothesis which is much milder than the Continuum Hypothesis (Martin's Axiom), PAC learnability is equivalent to finite VC dimension for every concept class.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 Apr 2011 01:15:03 GMT  (70kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2097v1", "Revised submission to IJCNN'2011"]], "COMMENTS": "Revised submission to IJCNN'2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["vladimir pestov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1104.2097"}
