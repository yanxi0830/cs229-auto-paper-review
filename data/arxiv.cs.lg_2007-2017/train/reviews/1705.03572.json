Imaging-based, or radiomics-driven, detection methods have been developed to aid diagnosticians, but largely rely on hand-crafted features which may not fully encapsulate the differences between cancerous and healthy tissue. Recently, the concept of discovery radiomics was introduced, where custom abstract features are discovered from readily available imaging data. We propose a novel evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach based on evolutionary deep intelligence. Motivated by patient privacy concerns and the idea of operational artificial intelligence, the evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery approach organically evolves increasingly more efficient deep radiomic sequencers that produce significantly more compact yet similarly descriptive radiomic sequences over multiple generations. As a result, this framework improves operational efficiency and enables diagnosis to be run locally at the radiologist's computer while maintaining detection accuracy. We evaluated the evolved deep radiomic sequencer (EDRS) discovered via the proposed evolutionary deep radiomic sequencer discovery framework against state-of-the-art radiomics-driven and discovery radiomics methods using clinical lung CT data with pathologically-proven diagnostic data. The evolved deep radiomic sequencer shows state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy (88.78%) relative to previous radiomics approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 May 2017 00:20:23 GMT  (2778kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03572v1", "8 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 20 Oct 2017 00:01:27 GMT  (1508kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03572v2", "26 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["mohammad javad shafiee", "audrey g chung", "farzad khalvati", "masoom a haider", "alexander wong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03572"}
