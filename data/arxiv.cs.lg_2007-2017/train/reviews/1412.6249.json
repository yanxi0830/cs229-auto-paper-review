In Purine, a deep network is expressed as a bipartite graph (bi-graph), which is composed of interconnected operators and data tensors. With the bi-graph abstraction, networks are easily solvable with event-driven task dispatcher. We then demonstrate that different parallelism schemes over GPUs and/or CPUs on single or multiple PCs can be universally implemented by graph composition. Scheduled by the task dispatcher, memory transfers are fully overlapped with other computations, which greatly reduce the communication overhead and help us achieve approximate linear acceleration. This eases researchers from coding for various parallelization schemes, and the same dispatcher can be used for solving variant graphs.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Dec 2014 08:20:10 GMT  (942kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6249v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 03:18:46 GMT  (943kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6249v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 20 Jan 2015 02:17:39 GMT  (943kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6249v3", "Submitted to ICLR 2015 workshop"], ["v4", "Mon, 16 Mar 2015 16:13:46 GMT  (943kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6249v4", "Submitted to ICLR 2015 workshop"], ["v5", "Thu, 16 Apr 2015 13:09:33 GMT  (943kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6249v5", "Submitted to ICLR 2015 workshop"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["min lin", "shuo li", "xuan luo", "shuicheng yan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.6249"}
