Feature selection is a useful technique for alleviating the curse of dimensionality in multi-view learning. In this paper, we study unsupervised feature selection for multi-view data, as class labels are usually expensive to obtain. Traditional feature selection methods are mostly designed for single-view data and cannot fully exploit the rich information from multi-view data. Existing multi-view feature selection methods are usually based on noisy cluster labels which might not preserve sufficient information from multi-view data. To better utilize multi-view information, we propose a method, CDMA-FS, to select features for each view by performing alignment on a cross diffused matrix. We formulate it as a constrained optimization problem and solve it using Quasi-Newton based method. Experiments results on four real-world datasets show that the proposed method is more effective than the state-of-the-art methods in multi-view setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 May 2017 07:12:59 GMT  (1739kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00825v1", "8 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["xiaokai wei", "bokai cao", "philip s yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.00825"}
