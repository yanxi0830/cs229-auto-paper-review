Though previous work along this research line has shown some promising results, most existing methods either fail to significantly compress a well-trained deep network or require a heavy retraining process for the pruned deep network to re-boost its prediction performance. In this paper, we propose a new layer-wise pruning method for deep neural networks. In our proposed method, parameters of each individual layer are pruned independently based on second order derivatives of a layer-wise error function with respect to the corresponding parameters. We prove that the final prediction performance drop after pruning is bounded by a linear combination of the reconstructed errors caused at each layer. Therefore, there is a guarantee that one only needs to perform a light retraining process on the pruned network to resume its original prediction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our pruning method compared with several state-of-the-art baseline methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 May 2017 05:54:37 GMT  (139kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07565v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["xin dong", "shangyu chen", "sinno jialin pan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.07565"}
