Such a test enables one to answer whether one source variable is significantly more dependent on the first target variable or the second. Dependence is measured via the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), resulting in a pair of empirical dependence measures (source-target 1, source-target 2). Modeling the covariance between these HSIC statistics leads to a provably more powerful test than the construction of independent HSIC statistics by sub sampling. The resulting test is consistent and unbiased, and (being based on U-statistics) has favorable convergence properties. The test can be computed in quadratic time, matching the computational complexity of standard empirical HSIC estimators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the test on a real-world linguistics problem of identifying language groups from a multilingual corpus.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 Jun 2014 19:23:11 GMT  (1079kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3852v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 11 Jul 2014 17:12:58 GMT  (313kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3852v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 27 May 2015 08:25:19 GMT  (978kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3852v3", "International Conference on Machine Learning, Jul 2015, Lille, France"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO", "authors": ["wacha bounliphone", "arthur gretton", "arthur tenenhaus", "matthew b blaschko"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.3852"}
