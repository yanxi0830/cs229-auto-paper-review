{"conference": "nips", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-Feb-2013", "title": "Minimax Optimal Algorithms for Unconstrained Linear Optimization", "abstract": "We design and analyze minimax-optimal algorithms for online linear optimization games where the player's choice is unconstrained. The player strives to minimize regret, the difference between his loss and the loss of a post-hoc benchmark strategy. The standard benchmark is the loss of the best strategy chosen from a bounded comparator set. When the the comparison set and the adversary's gradients satisfy L_infinity bounds, we give the value of the game in closed form and prove it approaches sqrt(2T/pi) as T -&gt; infinity.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Feb 2013 23:16:04 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2176v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["h brendan mcmahan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1302.2176"}
