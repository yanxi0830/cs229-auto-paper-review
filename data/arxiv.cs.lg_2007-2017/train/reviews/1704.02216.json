We use Onset Strength Signal (OSS) to detect the onsets and estimate the tempos. Then, we form Cumulative Beat Strength Signal (CBSS) by taking advantage of OSS and estimated tempos. Next, we perform peak detection by extracting the periodic sequence of beats among all CBSS peaks. In simulations, we can see that our proposed algorithm, Online Beat TrAckINg (OBTAIN), outperforms state-of-art results in terms of prediction accuracy while maintaining comparable and practical computational complexity. The real-time performance is tractable visually as illustrated in the simulations.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Apr 2017 13:15:15 GMT  (355kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02216v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 27 Oct 2017 19:36:55 GMT  (1249kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02216v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.IR cs.LG cs.MM", "authors": ["ali mottaghi", "kayhan behdin", "ashkan esmaeili", "mohammadreza heydari", "farokh marvasti"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.02216"}
