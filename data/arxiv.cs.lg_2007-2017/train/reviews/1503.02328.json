Stocks are characterized by 125 features ranging from gross domestic product to EDIBTA, and are labeled by discrepancies between stock and market price returns. An artificial neural network (Self-Organizing Map) is fitted to train on more than a million data points to predict \"good investments\" given testing stocks from 2013 and after.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 8 Mar 2015 21:45:07 GMT  (5294kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02328v1", "12 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CE cs.LG", "authors": ["mike wu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.02328"}
