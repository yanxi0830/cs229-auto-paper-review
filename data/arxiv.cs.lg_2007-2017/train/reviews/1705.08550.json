Traditional methods rely on regions of interest (ROIs) which require great efforts to annotate. Inspired by the success of using deep convolutional features for natural image analysis and multi-instance learning (MIL) for labeling a set of instances/patches, we propose end-to-end trained deep multi-instance networks for mass classification based on whole mammogram without the aforementioned ROIs. We explore three different schemes to construct deep multi-instance networks for whole mammogram classification. Experimental results on the INbreast dataset demonstrate the robustness of proposed networks compared to previous work using segmentation and detection annotations.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 May 2017 22:16:20 GMT  (952kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08550v1", "MICCAI 2017 Camera Ready"]], "COMMENTS": "MICCAI 2017 Camera Ready", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["wentao zhu", "qi lou", "yeeleng scott vang", "xiaohui xie"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.08550"}
