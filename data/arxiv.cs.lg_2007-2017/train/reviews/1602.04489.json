The architecture is based on convolutionally-applied sparse feature extraction, using trees or ferns, and a linear voting layer. Several structure and optimization variants are considered, including novel decision functions, tree learning algorithm, and distillation from CNN to CTE architecture. Accuracy improvements of 24-45% over related art of similar speed are demonstrated on standard object recognition benchmarks. Using Pareto speed-accuracy curves, we show that CTE can provide better accuracy than Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for a certain range of classification time constraints, or alternatively provide similar error rates with 5-200X speedup.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 14 Feb 2016 19:21:17 GMT  (413kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04489v1", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["aharon bar-hillel", "eyal krupka", "noam bloom"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.04489"}
