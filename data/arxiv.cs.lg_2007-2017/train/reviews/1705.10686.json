In previous work, we showed that it is effective against several earlier methods for generating adversarial examples. In this short note, we report on recent results showing that simple feature squeezing techniques also make deep learning models significantly more robust against the Carlini/Wagner attacks, which are the best known adversarial methods discovered to date.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 May 2017 15:00:55 GMT  (360kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10686v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["weilin xu", "david evans", "yanjun qi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.10686"}
