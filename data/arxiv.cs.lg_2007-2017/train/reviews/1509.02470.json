Although promising results have been achieved in some empirical studies, such type of representations still suffer from the well-known issue of semantic gap. This paper proposes so-called deep attribute framework to alleviate this issue from three aspects. First, we introduce object region proposals as intermedia to represent target images, and extract features from region proposals. Second, we study aggregating features from different CNN layers for all region proposals. The aggregation yields a holistic yet compact representation of input images. Results show that cross-region max-pooling of soft-max layer output outperform all other layers. As soft-max layer directly corresponds to semantic concepts, this representation is named \"deep attributes\". Third, we observe that only a small portion of generated regions by object proposals algorithm are correlated to classification target. Therefore, we introduce context-aware region refining algorithm to pick out contextual regions and build context-aware classifiers.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Sep 2015 17:53:54 GMT  (1789kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02470v1", "10 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["jianwei luo", "jianguo li", "jun wang", "zhiguo jiang", "yurong chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.02470"}
