We develop two quantum algorithms for perceptron learning. The first algorithm exploits quantum information processing to determine a separating hyperplane using a number of steps sublinear in the number of data points $N$, namely $O(\\sqrt{N})$. The second algorithm illustrates how the classical mistake bound of $O(\\frac{1}{\\gamma^2})$ can be further improved to $O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\gamma}})$ through quantum means, where $\\gamma$ denotes the margin. Such improvements are achieved through the application of quantum amplitude amplification to the version space interpretation of the perceptron model.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Feb 2016 20:45:35 GMT  (173kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04799v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "quant-ph cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["ashish kapoor", "nathan wiebe", "krysta marie svore"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.04799"}
