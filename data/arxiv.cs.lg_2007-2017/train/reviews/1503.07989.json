{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "27-Mar-2015", "title": "Discriminative Bayesian Dictionary Learning for Classification", "abstract": "We propose a Bayesian approach to learn discriminative dictionaries for sparse representation of data. The proposed approach infers probability distributions over the atoms of a discriminative dictionary using a Beta Process. It also computes sets of Bernoulli distributions that associate class labels to the learned dictionary atoms. This association signifies the selection probabilities of the dictionary atoms in the expansion of class-specific data. Furthermore, the non-parametric character of the proposed approach allows it to infer the correct size of the dictionary. We exploit the aforementioned Bernoulli distributions in separately learning a linear classifier. The classifier uses the same hierarchical Bayesian model as the dictionary, which we present along the analytical inference solution for Gibbs sampling. For classification, a test instance is first sparsely encoded over the learned dictionary and the codes are fed to the classifier. We performed experiments for face and action recognition; and object and scene-category classification using five public datasets and compared the results with state-of-the-art discriminative sparse representation approaches. Experiments show that the proposed Bayesian approach consistently outperforms the existing approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Mar 2015 08:36:15 GMT  (1156kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07989v1", "15 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["naveed akhtar", "faisal shafait", "ajmal mian"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.07989"}
