The paper addresses some specific challenges of this domain: a large number of compounds (training examples), high-dimensionality of feature space, sparseness and a strong class imbalance. A variant of conformal predictors called Inductive Mondrian Conformal Predictor is applied to deal with these challenges. Results are presented for several non-conformity measures (NCM) extracted from underlying algorithms and different kernels. A number of performance measures are used in order to demonstrate the flexibility of Inductive Mondrian Conformal Predictors in dealing with such a complex set of data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Mar 2016 23:37:37 GMT  (272kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.04506v1", "17 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["paolo toccacheli", "ilia nouretdinov", "alexander gammerman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.04506"}
