{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Mar-2015", "title": "Compositional Distributional Semantics with Long Short Term Memory", "abstract": "We are proposing an extension of the recursive neural network that makes use of a variant of the long short-term memory architecture. The extension allows information low in parse trees to be stored in a memory register (the `memory cell') and used much later higher up in the parse tree. This provides a solution to the vanishing gradient problem and allows the network to capture long range dependencies. Experimental results show that our composition outperformed the traditional neural-network composition on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Mar 2015 15:13:38 GMT  (173kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02510v1", "10 pages, 7 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 17 Apr 2015 23:54:37 GMT  (173kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02510v2", "10 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["phong le", "willem zuidema"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.02510"}
