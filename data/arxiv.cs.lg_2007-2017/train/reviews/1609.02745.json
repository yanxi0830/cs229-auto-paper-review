{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Sep-2016", "title": "A Hierarchical Model of Reviews for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis", "abstract": "Opinion mining from customer reviews has become pervasive in recent years. Sentences in reviews, however, are usually classified independently, even though they form part of a review's argumentative structure. Intuitively, sentences in a review build and elaborate upon each other; knowledge of the review structure and sentential context should thus inform the classification of each sentence. We demonstrate this hypothesis for the task of aspect-based sentiment analysis by modeling the interdependencies of sentences in a review with a hierarchical bidirectional LSTM. We show that the hierarchical model outperforms two non-hierarchical baselines, obtains results competitive with the state-of-the-art, and outperforms the state-of-the-art on five multilingual, multi-domain datasets without any hand-engineered features or external resources.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Sep 2016 11:16:15 GMT  (912kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02745v1", "To be published at EMNLP 2016, 7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "To be published at EMNLP 2016, 7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["sebastian ruder", "parsa ghaffari", "john g breslin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.02745"}
