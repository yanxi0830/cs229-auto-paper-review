We derive the analytic form of the induced solution, and analyze the properties. In order to make the proposed framework trainable in practice, we introduce two effective approximation techniques. Empirically, the experiment results closely match our theoretical analysis, verifying the discriminator is able to recover the energy of data distribution.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Feb 2017 16:30:13 GMT  (8827kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01691v1", "Accepted into ICLR 2017"], ["v2", "Fri, 24 Feb 2017 01:38:09 GMT  (9079kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01691v2", "ICLR 2017 camera ready"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted into ICLR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["zihang dai", "amjad almahairi", "philip bachman", "eduard hovy", "aaron courville"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.01691"}
