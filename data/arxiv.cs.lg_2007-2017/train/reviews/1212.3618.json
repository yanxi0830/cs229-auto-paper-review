{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "14-Dec-2012", "title": "Machine Learning in Proof General: Interfacing Interfaces", "abstract": "We present ML4PG, a machine learning extension for Proof General. It allows one to gather proof statistics related to shapes of goals, sequences of applied tactics, and proof tree structures from the libraries of interactive higher-order proofs written in Coq and SSReflect. The gathered data is clustered using the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms available in Matlab and Weka. ML4PG provides automated interfacing between Proof General and Matlab/Weka. The results of clustering are used by ML4PG to provide proof hints in the process of interactive proof development.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Dec 2012 21:06:34 GMT  (1381kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3618v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 8 Jul 2013 05:19:38 GMT  (504kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.3618v2", "In Proceedings UITP 2012,arXiv:1307.1528"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.LO", "authors": ["ekaterina komendantskaya", "j\\'onathan heras", "gudmund grov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.3618"}
