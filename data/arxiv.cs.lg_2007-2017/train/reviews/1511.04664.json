We consider the problem of human activity recognition using triaxial accelerometers and deep learning paradigms. This paper shows that deep activity recognition models (a) provide better recognition accuracy of human activities, (b) avoid the expensive design of handcrafted features in existing systems, and (c) utilize the massive unlabeled acceleration samples for unsupervised feature extraction. Moreover, a hybrid approach of deep learning and hidden Markov models (DL-HMM) is presented for sequential activity recognition. This hybrid approach integrates the hierarchical representations of deep activity recognition models with the stochastic modeling of temporal sequences in the hidden Markov models. We show substantial recognition improvement on real world datasets over state-of-the-art methods of human activity recognition using triaxial accelerometers.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 Nov 2015 06:23:40 GMT  (1222kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04664v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 25 Oct 2016 07:39:29 GMT  (1232kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04664v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.HC cs.NE", "authors": ["mohammad abu alsheikh", "ahmed selim", "dusit niyato", "linda doyle", "shaowei lin", "hwee-pink tan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.04664"}
