However, most of the k-means variants tend to compute distance of each data point to each cluster centroid for every iteration. We propose a fast heuristic to overcome this bottleneck with only marginal increase in MSE. We observe that across all iterations of K-means, a data point changes its membership only among a small subset of clusters. Our heuristic predicts such clusters for each data point by looking at nearby clusters after the first iteration of k-means. We augment well known variants of k-means with our heuristic to demonstrate effectiveness of our heuristic. For various synthetic and real-world datasets, our heuristic achieves speed-up of up-to 3 times when compared to efficient variants of k-means.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Jan 2017 10:00:51 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04600v1", "6 pages, Accepted at ECIR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, Accepted at ECIR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IR", "authors": ["siddhesh khandelwal", "amit awekar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.04600"}
