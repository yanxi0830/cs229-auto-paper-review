However, it is worth noting that this research field lacks theoretical guarantees that can be expected on the generalization capacity of the classifier associated to a learned metric. The theoretical framework of $(\\epsilon, \\gamma, \\tau)$-good similarity functions has been one of the first attempts to draw a link between the properties of a similarity function and those of a linear classifier making use of it. In this paper, we extend this theory to a setting where the metric and the separator are jointly learned in a semi-supervised way. We furthermore provide a generalization bound for the associated classifier based on the algorithmic robustness framework. The behavior of our method is illustrated via some experimental results.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Dec 2014 17:43:26 GMT  (106kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6452v1", "ICLR 2015 conference submission - under review"], ["v2", "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 15:36:14 GMT  (196kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6452v2", "ICLR 2015 conference submission - under review"], ["v3", "Tue, 31 Mar 2015 11:10:43 GMT  (27kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6452v3", "ICLR 2015 Workshop - accepted"]], "COMMENTS": "ICLR 2015 conference submission - under review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["maria-irina nicolae", "marc sebban", "amaury habrard", "\\'eric gaussier", "massih-reza amini"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.6452"}
