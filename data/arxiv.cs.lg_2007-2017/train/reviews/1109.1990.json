In this paper, we introduce a new penalty function which takes into account the correlation of the design matrix to stabilize the estimation. This norm, called the trace Lasso, uses the trace norm, which is a convex surrogate of the rank, of the selected covariates as the criterion of model complexity. We analyze the properties of our norm, describe an optimization algorithm based on reweighted least-squares, and illustrate the behavior of this norm on synthetic data, showing that it is more adapted to strong correlations than competing methods such as the elastic net.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Sep 2011 13:01:41 GMT  (129kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.1990v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["edouard grave", "guillaume obozinski", "francis r bach"], "accepted": true, "id": "1109.1990"}
