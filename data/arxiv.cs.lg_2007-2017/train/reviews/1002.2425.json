A system for analyzing students results based on cluster analysis and uses standard statistical algorithms to arrange their scores data according to the level of their performance is described. In this paper, we also implemented k mean clustering algorithm for analyzing students result data. The model was combined with the deterministic model to analyze the students results of a private Institution in Nigeria which is a good benchmark to monitor the progression of academic performance of students in higher Institution for the purpose of making an effective decision by the academic planners.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Feb 2010 20:41:28 GMT  (819kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2425v1", "IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, IJCSIS January 2010, ISSN 1947 5500,this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "IEEE format, International Journal of Computer Science and Information Security, IJCSIS January 2010, ISSN 1947 5500,this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CY", "authors": ["o j oyelade", "o o oladipupo", "i c obagbuwa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1002.2425"}
