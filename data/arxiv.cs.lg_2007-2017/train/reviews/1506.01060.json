However, existing approaches do not adapt both local structure and self reconstruction very well. We propose local-structure adaptive sparse subspace learning (ASSL) model for unsupervised feature selection. In this paper, we formulate the feature selection process as a subspace learning problem and incorporate a regularization term to preserve the local structure of the data. Furthermore, we develop a greedy algorithm to establish the basic model and an iterative strategy based on an accelerated block coordinate descent is used to solve the local-structure ASSL problem. We also provide the global convergence analysis of the proposed ASSL algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world datasets to show the superiority of the proposed approach over several state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Jun 2015 21:02:16 GMT  (377kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01060v1", "25 page, 6 figures and 51 references"], ["v2", "Mon, 19 Oct 2015 18:13:24 GMT  (411kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01060v2", "32 page, 6 figures and 60 references"]], "COMMENTS": "25 page, 6 figures and 51 references", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["nan zhou", "yangyang xu", "hong cheng", "jun fang", "witold pedrycz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.01060"}
