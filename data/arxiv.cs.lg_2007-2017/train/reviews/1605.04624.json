This paper presents our approach to achieving this by mining various data sources available in LinkedIn to infer searchers' intents (such as hiring, job seeking, etc.), as well as extending the concept of homophily to capture the searcher-result similarities on many aspects. Then, learning-to-rank (LTR) is applied to combine these signals with standard search features.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 May 2016 00:59:07 GMT  (531kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04624v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["viet ha-thuc", "shakti sinha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.04624"}
