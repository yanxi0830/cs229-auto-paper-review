In this work, we first show that web links have an intrinsic \\emph{multi-level feedback structure}. For example, consider a $2$-level feedback web link: the $1$st level feedback provides the Click-Through Rate (CTR) and the $2$nd level feedback provides the potential revenue, which collectively produce the compound $2$-level revenue. We consider the context-free links selection problem of selecting links for a homepage so as to maximize the total compound $2$-level revenue while keeping the total $1$st level feedback above a preset threshold. We further generalize the problem to links with $n~(n\\ge2)$-level feedback structure. The key challenge is that the links' multi-level feedback structures are unobservable unless the links are selected on the homepage. To our best knowledge, we are the first to model the links selection problem as a constrained multi-armed bandit problem and design an effective links selection algorithm by learning the links' multi-level structure with provable \\emph{sub-linear} regret and violation bounds. We uncover the multi-level feedback structures of web links in two real-world datasets. We also conduct extensive experiments on the datasets to compare our proposed \\textbf{LExp} algorithm with two state-of-the-art context-free bandit algorithms and show that \\textbf{LExp} algorithm is the most effective in links selection while satisfying the constraint.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Sep 2017 11:55:00 GMT  (1180kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02664v1", "8 pages (with full proof), 4 figures, ICDM 2017 technical report"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages (with full proof), 4 figures, ICDM 2017 technical report", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["kechao cai", "kun chen", "longbo huang", "john c s lui"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.02664"}
