The model is trained on a visual search task requiring the classification of an object embedded in a visual scene amidst background distractors using the smallest number of fixations. We explore the tiling properties that emerge in the model's retinal sampling lattice after training. Specifically, we show that this lattice resembles the eccentricity dependent sampling lattice of the primate retina, with a high resolution region in the fovea surrounded by a low resolution periphery. Furthermore, we find conditions where these emergent properties are amplified or eliminated providing clues to their function.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Nov 2016 23:39:20 GMT  (794kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09430v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 21 Oct 2017 08:26:16 GMT  (792kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09430v2", "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["brian cheung", "eric weiss", "bruno olshausen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.09430"}
