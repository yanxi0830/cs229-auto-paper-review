Two important tasks are to identify those cells which bear interesting phenotypes, and to identify sub-populations enriched for these phenotypes. This exploratory data analysis usually involves dimensionality reduction followed by clustering, in the hope that clusters represent a phenotype. We propose the use of stacked de-noising auto-encoders to perform dimensionality reduction for high-content screening. We demonstrate the superior performance of our approach over PCA, Local Linear Embedding, Kernel PCA and Isomap.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Jan 2015 02:13:09 GMT  (1278kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01348v1", "5 pages, 3 figures.
