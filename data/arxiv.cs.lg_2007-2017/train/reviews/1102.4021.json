We provide a theoretical analysis of the security of this procedure and experimental results for the problem of large scale spam detection. High performance spam filters often use character n-grams as features which result in large sparse vectors to which applying our protocol directly is not feasible. We explore various dimensionality reduction and parallelization approaches and provide a detailed analysis of the speed and accuracy trade-off. Our results show that we can achieve the accuracy of state of the art spam filters at comparable training and testing time of non-private version of logistic regression.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Feb 2011 20:40:56 GMT  (206kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4021v1", "9 pages"], ["v2", "Sun, 18 Sep 2011 05:37:43 GMT  (208kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.4021v2", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR", "authors": ["manas a pathak", "mehrbod sharifi", "bhiksha raj"], "accepted": false, "id": "1102.4021"}
