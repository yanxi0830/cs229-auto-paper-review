In this paper, for the first time, it is applied to BCI regression problems, an important category of BCI applications. More specifically, we propose a new feature extraction approach for Electroencephalogram (EEG) based BCI regression problems: a spatial filter is first used to increase the signal quality of the EEG trials and also to reduce the dimensionality of the covariance matrices, and then Riemannian tangent space features are extracted. We validate the performance of the proposed approach in reaction time estimation from EEG signals measured in a large-scale sustained-attention psychomotor vigilance task, and show that compared with the traditional powerband features, the tangent space features can reduce the root mean square estimation error by 4.30-8.30%, and increase the estimation correlation coefficient by 6.59-11.13%.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Apr 2017 12:30:05 GMT  (456kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08533v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1702.02914"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1702.02914", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.LG", "authors": ["dongrui wu", "brent j lance", "vernon j lawhern", "stephen gordon", "tzyy-ping jung", "chin-teng lin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.08533"}
