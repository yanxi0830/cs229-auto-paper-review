We give an approximation algorithm that given an instance from this model finds a solution of value (1+ \\delta)opt-cost + O_{\\delta}(n log^3 n) with high probability, where opt-cost is the value of the optimal solution (for every \\delta &gt; 0).", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 Jun 2014 03:07:55 GMT  (17kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5667v1", "13 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 12 May 2015 19:33:12 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5667v2", "To appear at Conference on Learning Theory (COLT) 2015.
