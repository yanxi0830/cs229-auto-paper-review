Our modification consists in allowing the method adaptively change the probability distribution over the dual variables throughout the iterative process. AdaSDCA achieves provably better complexity bound than SDCA with the best fixed probability distribution, known as importance sampling. However, it is of a theoretical character as it is expensive to implement. We also propose AdaSDCA+: a practical variant which in our experiments outperforms existing non-adaptive methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 20:54:03 GMT  (2315kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.08053v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.OC cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["dominik csiba", "zheng qu", "peter richt\u00e1rik"], "accepted": true, "id": "1502.08053"}
