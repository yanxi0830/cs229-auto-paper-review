This paper proposes a simple technique for predicting probabilities based on optimizing a ranking loss, followed by isotonic regression. This semi-parametric technique offers both good ranking and regression performance, and models a richer set of probability distributions than statistical workhorses such as logistic regression. We provide experimental results that show the effectiveness of this technique on real-world applications of probability prediction.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:30:13 GMT  (218kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4661v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["aditya krishna menon", "xiaoqian jiang", "shankar vembu", "charles elkan", "lucila ohno-machado"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4661"}
