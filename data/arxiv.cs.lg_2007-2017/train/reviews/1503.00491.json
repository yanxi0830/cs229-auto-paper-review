{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "2-Mar-2015", "title": "Utility-Theoretic Ranking for Semi-Automated Text Classification", "abstract": "\\emph{Semi-Automated Text Classification} (SATC) may be defined as the task of ranking a set $\\mathcal{D}$ of automatically labelled textual documents in such a way that, if a human annotator validates (i.e., inspects and corrects where appropriate) the documents in a top-ranked portion of $\\mathcal{D}$ with the goal of increasing the overall labelling accuracy of $\\mathcal{D}$, the expected increase is maximized. An obvious SATC strategy is to rank $\\mathcal{D}$ so that the documents that the classifier has labelled with the lowest confidence are top-ranked. In this work we show that this strategy is suboptimal. We develop new utility-theoretic ranking methods based on the notion of \\emph{validation gain}, defined as the improvement in classification effectiveness that would derive by validating a given automatically labelled document. We also propose a new effectiveness measure for SATC-oriented ranking methods, based on the expected reduction in classification error brought about by partially validating a list generated by a given ranking method. We report the results of experiments showing that, with respect to the baseline method above, and according to the proposed measure, our utility-theoretic ranking methods can achieve substantially higher expected reductions in classification error.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 2 Mar 2015 12:09:23 GMT  (200kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00491v1", "Forthcoming on ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data"]], "COMMENTS": "Forthcoming on ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["giacomo berardi", "rea esuli", "fabrizio sebastiani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.00491"}
