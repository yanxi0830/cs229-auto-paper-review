This method has been shown to have strong theoretical guarantee and impressive numerical performance. In this paper, we generalize HTP from compressive sensing to a generic problem setup of sparsity-constrained convex optimization. The proposed algorithm iterates between a standard gradient descent step and a hard thresholding step with or without debiasing. We prove that our method enjoys the strong guarantees analogous to HTP in terms of rate of convergence and parameter estimation accuracy. Numerical evidences show that our method is superior to the state-of-the-art greedy selection methods in sparse logistic regression and sparse precision matrix estimation tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 Nov 2013 13:52:07 GMT  (296kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5750v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1102.2233by other authors"], ["v2", "Mon, 25 Nov 2013 04:19:39 GMT  (296kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.5750v2", null]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1102.2233by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NA stat.ML", "authors": ["xiaotong yuan", "ping li 0001", "tong zhang 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1311.5750"}
