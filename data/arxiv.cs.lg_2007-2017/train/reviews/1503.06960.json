Namely, if a concept $C \\subseteq \\Sigma^X$ is properly PAC learnable with $d$ samples, then $C$ has a sample compression scheme of size $2^{O(d)}$. In particular, every boolean concept class with constant VC dimension has a sample compression scheme of constant size. This answers a question of Littlestone and Warmuth (1986). The proof uses an approximate minimax phenomenon for boolean matrices of low VC dimension.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Mar 2015 09:30:33 GMT  (10kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06960v1", "11 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 14 Apr 2015 12:18:14 GMT  (13kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06960v2", "14 pages.
