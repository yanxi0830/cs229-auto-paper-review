{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Nov-2014", "title": "Bounded Regret for Finite-Armed Structured Bandits", "abstract": "We study a new type of K-armed bandit problem where the expected return of one arm may depend on the returns of other arms. We present a new algorithm for this general class of problems and show that under certain circumstances it is possible to achieve finite expected cumulative regret. We also give problem-dependent lower bounds on the cumulative regret showing that at least in special cases the new algorithm is nearly optimal.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Nov 2014 18:55:35 GMT  (27kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2919v1", "16 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["tor lattimore", "r\u00e9mi munos"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.2919"}
