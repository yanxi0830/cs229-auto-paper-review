The proposed method first extracts supervectors from an unsupervised universal background model, then reduces the dimension of the high-dimensional supervectors by multilayer bootstrap network, and finally conducts unsupervised speaker recognition by clustering the low-dimensional data. The comparison results with 2 unsupervised and 1 supervised speaker recognition techniques demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Sep 2015 02:28:44 GMT  (185kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06095v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SD", "authors": ["xiao-lei zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.06095"}
