We call this new problem interactive submodular set cover. Applications include advertising in social networks with hidden information. We give an approximation guarantee for a greedy algorithm and give a hardness of approximation result which matches up to constant factors. We also discuss the adaptivity gap for the problem and present encouraging early experimental results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Feb 2010 18:43:59 GMT  (116kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3345v1", "12 pages, 1 figure"], ["v2", "Thu, 20 May 2010 23:39:23 GMT  (133kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3345v2", "15 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["andrew guillory", "jeff a bilmes"], "accepted": true, "id": "1002.3345"}
