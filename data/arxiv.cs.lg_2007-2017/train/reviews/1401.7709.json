Our primary example, and the focus of this paper, is the joint inference of label types such as hometown, current city, and employers, for users connected by a social network. Standard label propagation fails to consider the properties of the label types and the interactions between them. Our proposed method, called EdgeExplain, explicitly models these, while still enabling scalable inference under a distributed message-passing architecture. On a billion-node subset of the Facebook social network, EdgeExplain significantly outperforms label propagation for several label types, with lifts of up to 120% for recall@1 and 60% for recall@3.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jan 2014 00:38:53 GMT  (362kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7709v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SI stat.ML", "authors": ["deepayan chakrabarti", "stanislav funiak", "jonathan chang", "sofus a macskassy"], "accepted": true, "id": "1401.7709"}
