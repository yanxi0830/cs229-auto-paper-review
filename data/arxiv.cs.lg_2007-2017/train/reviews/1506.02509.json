Object Recognition with Deep Convolutional Features from ImageNet", "abstract": "Deep learning with a convolutional neural network (CNN) has been proved to be very effective in feature extraction and representation of images. For image classification problems, this work aim at finding which classifier is more competitive based on high-level deep features of images. In this report, we have discussed the nearest neighbor, support vector machines and extreme learning machines for image classification under deep convolutional activation feature representation. Specifically, we adopt the benchmark object recognition dataset from multiple sources with domain bias for evaluating different classifiers. The deep features of the object dataset are obtained by a well-trained CNN with five convolutional layers and three fully-connected layers on the challenging ImageNet. Experiments demonstrate that the ELMs outperform SVMs in cross-domain recognition tasks. In particular, state-of-the-art results are obtained by kernel ELM which outperforms SVMs with about 4% of the average accuracy. The features and codes are available in", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 13:58:01 GMT  (1767kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02509v1", "7 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["lei zhang", "david zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.02509"}
