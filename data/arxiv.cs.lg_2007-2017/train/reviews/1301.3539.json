The proposed model, structure-adapting multi-view harmonium (SA-MVH) has switch parameters that control the connection between hidden nodes and input views, and learn the switch parameter while training. Numerical experiments on synthetic and a real-world dataset demonstrate the useful behavior of the SA-MVH, compared to existing multi-view feature extraction methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 01:07:38 GMT  (347kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3539v1", "3 pages, 2 figures, ICLR2013 workshop track submission"]], "COMMENTS": "3 pages, 2 figures, ICLR2013 workshop track submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yoonseop kang", "seungjin choi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3539"}
