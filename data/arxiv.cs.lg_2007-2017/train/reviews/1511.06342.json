{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "19-Nov-2015", "title": "Actor-Mimic: Deep Multitask and Transfer Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "The ability to act in multiple environments and transfer previous knowledge to new situations can be considered a critical aspect of any intelligent agent. Towards this goal, we define a novel method of multitask and transfer learning that enables an autonomous agent to learn how to behave in multiple tasks simultaneously, and then generalize its knowledge to new domains. This method, termed \"Actor-Mimic\", exploits the use of deep reinforcement learning and model compression techniques to train a single policy network that learns how to act in a set of distinct tasks by using the guidance of several expert teachers. We then show that the representations learnt by the deep policy network are capable of generalizing to new tasks, speeding up learning in novel environments. Although our method can in general be applied to a wide range of problems, we use Atari games as a testing environment to demonstrate these methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 20:17:27 GMT  (150kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06342v1", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v2", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 20:54:04 GMT  (943kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06342v2", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v3", "Wed, 6 Jan 2016 06:57:34 GMT  (1652kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06342v3", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v4", "Mon, 22 Feb 2016 19:59:40 GMT  (1661kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06342v4", "Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["emilio parisotto", "jimmy lei ba", "ruslan salakhutdinov"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.06342"}
