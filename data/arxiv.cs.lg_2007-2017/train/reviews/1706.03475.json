Popular independent ensembles (IE) relying on naive averaging/voting scheme have been of typical choice for most applications involving deep neural networks, but they do not consider advanced collaboration among ensemble models. In this paper, we propose new ensemble methods specialized for deep neural networks, called confident multiple choice learning (CMCL): it is a variant of multiple choice learning (MCL) via addressing its overconfidence issue.In particular, the proposed major components of CMCL beyond the original MCL scheme are (i) new loss, i.e., confident oracle loss, (ii) new architecture, i.e., feature sharing and (iii) new training method, i.e., stochastic labeling. We demonstrate the effect of CMCL via experiments on the image classification on CIFAR and SVHN, and the foreground-background segmentation on the iCoseg. In particular, CMCL using 5 residual networks provides 14.05% and 6.60% relative reductions in the top-1 error rates from the corresponding IE scheme for the classification task on CIFAR and SVHN, respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 05:55:38 GMT  (1471kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03475v1", "Accepted in ICML 2017"], ["v2", "Fri, 22 Sep 2017 05:56:57 GMT  (1480kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03475v2", "Accepted in ICML 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted in ICML 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["kimin lee", "changho hwang", "kyoungsoo park", "jinwoo shin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.03475"}
