Recently, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have found extensive applications in many practical forecasting problems. However, the standard backpropagation ANN training algorithm has some critical issues, e.g. it has a slow convergence rate and often converges to a local minimum, the complex pattern of error surfaces, lack of proper training parameters selection methods, etc. To overcome these drawbacks, various improved training methods have been developed in literature; but, still none of them can be guaranteed as the best for all problems. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted ensemble scheme which intelligently combines multiple training algorithms to increase the ANN forecast accuracies. The weight for each training algorithm is determined from the performance of the corresponding ANN model on the validation dataset. Experimental results on four important time series depicts that our proposed technique reduces the mentioned shortcomings of individual ANN training algorithms to a great extent. Also it achieves significantly better forecast accuracies than two other popular statistical models.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 25 Feb 2013 20:09:19 GMT  (419kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6210v1", "8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, 26 references, international journal"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, 26 references, international journal", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["ratnadip adhikari", "r k agrawal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.6210"}
