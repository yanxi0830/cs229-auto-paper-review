We assessed two different dimension reduction variants: feature selection by ANOVA F-test and feature transformation by PCA. On the reduced datasets, we applied common learning algorithms using 5-fold cross-validation. Training, tuning of the hyperparameters, as well as the performance evaluation of the classifiers was conducted using two different performance measures: Accuracy, and Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC). Our hypothesis is supported by experimental results.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 26 May 2015 11:33:04 GMT  (189kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06907v1", "Presented at OAGM Workshop, 2015 (arXiv:1505.01065)"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at OAGM Workshop, 2015 (arXiv:1505.01065)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["andreas gr\\\"unauer", "markus vincze"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.06907"}
