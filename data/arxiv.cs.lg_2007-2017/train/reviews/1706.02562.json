{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-Jun-2017", "title": "Pain-Free Random Differential Privacy with Sensitivity Sampling", "abstract": "Popular approaches to differential privacy, such as the Laplace and exponential mechanisms, calibrate randomised smoothing through global sensitivity of the target non-private function. Bounding such sensitivity is often a prohibitively complex analytic calculation. As an alternative, we propose a straightforward sampler for estimating sensitivity of non-private mechanisms. Since our sensitivity estimates hold with high probability, any mechanism that would be $(\\epsilon,\\delta)$-differentially private under bounded global sensitivity automatically achieves $(\\epsilon,\\delta,\\gamma)$-random differential privacy (Hall et al., 2012), without any target-specific calculations required. We demonstrate on worked example learners how our usable approach adopts a naturally-relaxed privacy guarantee, while achieving more accurate releases even for non-private functions that are black-box computer programs.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 13:06:34 GMT  (121kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02562v1", "12 pages, 9 figures, 1 table; full report of paper accepted into ICML'2017"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 9 figures, 1 table; full report of paper accepted into ICML'2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR cs.DB stat.ML", "authors": ["benjamin i p rubinstein", "francesco ald\u00e0"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.02562"}
