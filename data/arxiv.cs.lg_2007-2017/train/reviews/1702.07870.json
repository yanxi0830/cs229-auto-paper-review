We devise an algorithm that obtains a tight regret bound of $\\widetilde{O}(\\epsilon T + N + \\sqrt{NT})$, where $N$ is the empirical $\\epsilon$-covering number of the sequence of loss functions generated by the environment. In addition, we present a hedging procedure that allows us to find the optimal $\\epsilon$ in hindsight.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 25 Feb 2017 10:27:29 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07870v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["alon cohen", "shie mannor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07870"}
