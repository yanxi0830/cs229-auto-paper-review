While many approaches have been proposed to solve this problem, there is only little work that focuses on reasoning about the observed behavior. We assume that, in many practical problems, an agent makes its decision based on latent features, indicating a certain action. Therefore, we propose a generative model for the states and actions. Inference reveals the number of features, the features, and the policies, allowing us to learn and to analyze the underlying structure of the observed behavior. Further, our approach enables prediction of actions for new states. Simulations are used to assess the performance of the algorithm based upon this model. Moreover, the problem of learning a driver's behavior is investigated, demonstrating the performance of the proposed model in a real-world scenario.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 26 Feb 2017 08:34:26 GMT  (418kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08001v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["j\\\"urgen hahn", "abdelhak m zoubir"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08001"}
