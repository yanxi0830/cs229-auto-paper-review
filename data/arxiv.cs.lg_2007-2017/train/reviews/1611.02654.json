The task of organizing a given set of sentences into a coherent order has been commonly used to build and evaluate models that understand such structure. In this work we propose an end-to-end neural approach based on the recently proposed set to sequence mapping framework to address the sentence ordering problem. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance in the order discrimination task on two datasets widely used in the literature. We also consider a new interesting task of ordering abstracts from conference papers and research proposals and demonstrate strong performance against recent methods. Visualizing the sentence representations learned by the model shows that the model has captured high level logical structure in these paragraphs. The model also learns rich semantic sentence representations by learning to order texts, performing comparably to recent unsupervised representation learning methods in the sentence similarity and paraphrase detection tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Nov 2016 19:04:09 GMT  (1389kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02654v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["lajanugen logeswaran", "honglak lee", "dragomir radev"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.02654"}
