However, supervised learning requires annotated data that are often hard to obtain. In a classification task with limited resources, Active Learning (AL) promises to guide annotators to examples that bring the most value for a classifier. AL can be successfully combined with self-training, i.e., extending a training set with the unlabelled examples for which a classifier is the most certain. We report our experiences on using AL in a systematic manner to train an SVM classifier for Stack Overflow posts discussing performance of software components. We show that the training examples deemed as the most valuable to the classifier are also the most difficult for humans to annotate. Despite carefully evolved annotation criteria, we report low inter-rater agreement, but we also propose mitigation strategies. Finally, based on one annotator's work, we show that self-training can improve the classification accuracy. We conclude the paper by discussing implication for future text miners aspiring to use AL and self-training.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 20:47:36 GMT  (443kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02395v1", "Preprint of paper accepted for the Proc. of the 21st International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering, 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Preprint of paper accepted for the Proc. of the 21st International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering, 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.HC cs.LG cs.SE", "authors": ["markus borg", "iben lennerstad", "rasmus ros", "elizabeth bjarnason"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.02395"}
