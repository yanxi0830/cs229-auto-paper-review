This is a result of using dense matrix multiplications and convolutions. However, sparse computations are known to be much more efficient. In this work, we train and build neural networks which implicitly use sparse computations. We introduce additional gate variables to perform parameter selection and show that this is equivalent to using a spike-and-slab prior. We experimentally validate our method on both small and large networks and achieve state-of-the-art compression results for sparse neural network models.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Nov 2016 09:24:24 GMT  (76kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06694v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["suraj srinivas", "akshayvarun subramanya", "r venkatesh babu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.06694"}
