We present Where4: a portfolio-based approach to discharge Why3 proof obligations. We use data analysis and machine learning techniques on static metrics derived from program source code. Our approach benefits software engineers by providing a single utility to delegate proof obligations to the solvers most likely to return a useful result. It does this in a time-efficient way using existing Why3 and solver installations - without requiring low-level knowledge about SMT solver operation from the user.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 03:32:24 GMT  (104kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08466v1", "In Proceedings F-IDE 2016,arXiv:1701.07925"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings F-IDE 2016,arXiv:1701.07925", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.LG cs.LO", "authors": ["andrew healy", "rosemary monahan", "james f power"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08466"}
