{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "4-May-2015", "title": "Reinforcement Learning Neural Turing Machines - Revised", "abstract": "The expressive power of a machine learning model is closely related to the number of sequential computational steps it can learn. For example, Deep Neural Networks have been more successful than shallow networks because they can perform a greater number of sequential computational steps (each highly parallel). The Neural Turing Machine (NTM) is a model that can compactly express an even greater number of sequential computational steps, so it is even more powerful than a DNN. Its memory addressing operations are designed to be differentiable; thus the NTM can be trained with backpropagation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 May 2015 04:14:54 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00521v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 21 Nov 2015 19:37:59 GMT  (2622kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00521v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 12 Jan 2016 06:35:48 GMT  (2622kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00521v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["wojciech zaremba", "ilya sutskever"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.00521"}
