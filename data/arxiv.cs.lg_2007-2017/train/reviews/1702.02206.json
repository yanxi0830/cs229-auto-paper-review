We propose a novel training framework, the Generative Domain-Adaptive Nets. In this framework, we train a generative model to generate questions based on the unlabeled text, and combine model-generated questions with human-generated questions for training question answering models. We develop novel domain adaptation algorithms, based on reinforcement learning, to alleviate the discrepancy between the model-generated data distribution and the human-generated data distribution. Experiments show that our proposed framework obtains substantial improvement from unlabeled text.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 21:23:01 GMT  (154kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02206v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 22 Apr 2017 20:31:01 GMT  (185kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02206v2", "Accepted as a long paper at ACL2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["zhilin yang", "junjie hu", "ruslan salakhutdinov", "william w cohen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.02206"}
