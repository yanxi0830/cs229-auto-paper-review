To some degree, the optimization of SVM depends on its kernel function and Slack variable, the determinant of which is its parameters $\\delta$ and c in the classification function. That is to say,to optimize the SVM algorithm, the optimization of the two parameters play a huge role. Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is optimization algorithm which simulate ants to find the optimal path.In the available literature, we mix the ACO algorithm and Parallel algorithm together to find a well parameters.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 May 2014 03:50:21 GMT  (137kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4589v1", "3 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables"], ["v2", "Tue, 20 May 2014 11:53:39 GMT  (142kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4589v2", "3 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "3 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["chao zhang", "hong-cen mei", "hao yang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.4589"}
