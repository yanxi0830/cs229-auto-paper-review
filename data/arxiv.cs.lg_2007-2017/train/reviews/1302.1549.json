PI models cannot be learned correctly by many algorithms that rely on a single link search. Earlier work on learning PI models has suggested a straightforward multi-link search algorithm. However, when a domain contains recursively embedded PI submodels, it may escape the detection of such an algorithm. In this paper, we propose an improved algorithm that ensures the learning of all embedded PI submodels whose sizes are upper bounded by a predetermined parameter. We show that this improved learning capability only increases the complexity slightly beyond that of the previous algorithm. The performance of the new algorithm is demonstrated through experiment.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Feb 2013 15:56:57 GMT  (815kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.1549v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Thirteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1997)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["jun hu", "yang xiang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.1549"}
