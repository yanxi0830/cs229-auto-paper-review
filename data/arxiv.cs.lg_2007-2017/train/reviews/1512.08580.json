For example, New York City Taxi Limousine Commission regularly releases source-destination information about trips in the taxis they regulate. Taxi data provide information about traffic patterns, and thus enable the study of urban flow -- what will traffic between two locations look like at a certain date and time in the future? Existing big data methods try to outdo each other in terms of complexity and algorithmic sophistication. In the spirit of \"big data beats algorithms\", we present a very simple baseline which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, including Bing Maps and Baidu Maps (whose APIs permit large scale experimentation). Such a travel time estimation baseline has several important uses, such as navigation (fast travel time estimates can serve as approximate heuristics for A search variants for path finding) and trip planning (which uses operating hours for popular destinations along with travel time estimates to create an itinerary).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Dec 2015 20:31:38 GMT  (5294kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08580v1", "12 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CY", "authors": ["hongjian wang", "zhenhui li", "yu-hsuan kuo", "dan kifer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.08580"}
