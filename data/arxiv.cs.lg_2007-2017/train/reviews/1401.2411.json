The geometric model is a Riemannian manifold with a Riemannian metric, ${g}_{ij}({\\bf x})$, which we interpret as a measure of dissimilarity. The probabilistic model consists of a stochastic process with an invariant probability measure which matches the density of the sample input data. The link between the two models is a potential function, $U({\\bf x})$, and its gradient, $\\nabla U({\\bf x})$. We use the gradient to define the dissimilarity metric, which guarantees that our measure of dissimilarity will depend on the probability measure. Finally, we use the dissimilarity metric to define a coordinate system on the embedded Riemannian manifold, which gives us a low-dimensional encoding of our original data.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Jan 2014 17:36:23 GMT  (2078kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.2411v1", "55 pages, 13 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "55 pages, 13 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["l thorne mccarty"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.2411"}
