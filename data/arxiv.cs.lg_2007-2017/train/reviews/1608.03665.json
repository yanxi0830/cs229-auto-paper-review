In this work, we propose a Structured Sparsity Learning (SSL) method to regularize the structures (i.e., filters, channels, filter shapes, and layer depth) of DNNs. SSL can: (1) learn a compact structure from a bigger DNN to reduce computation cost; (2) obtain a hardware-friendly structured sparsity of DNN to efficiently accelerate the DNNs evaluation. Experimental results show that SSL achieves on average 5.1x and 3.1x speedups of convolutional layer computation of AlexNet against CPU and GPU, respectively, with off-the-shelf libraries. These speedups are about twice speedups of non-structured sparsity; (3) regularize the DNN structure to improve classification accuracy. The results show that for CIFAR-10, regularization on layer depth can reduce 20 layers of a Deep Residual Network (ResNet) to 18 layers while improve the accuracy from 91.25% to 92.60%, which is still slightly higher than that of original ResNet with 32 layers. For AlexNet, structure regularization by SSL also reduces the error by around ~1%.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 Aug 2016 03:20:43 GMT  (2809kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03665v1", "10 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables"], ["v2", "Mon, 15 Aug 2016 20:46:15 GMT  (2809kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03665v2", "10 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables in NIPS 2016"], ["v3", "Fri, 19 Aug 2016 05:58:48 GMT  (2809kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03665v3", "10 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables in NIPS 2016"], ["v4", "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 04:03:41 GMT  (2811kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.03665v4", "Accepted by NIPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["wei wen", "chunpeng wu", "yandan wang", "yiran chen", "hai li 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.03665"}
