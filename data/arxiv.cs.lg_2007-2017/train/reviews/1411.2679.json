Our method answers questions about Twitter users like {\\em Does this user like sushi?} or {\\em Is this user a New York Knicks fan?} by building a probabilistic model that reasons over user attributes (the user's location or gender) and the social network (the user's friends and spouse), via inferences like homophily (I am more likely to like sushi if spouse or friends like sushi, I am more likely to like the Knicks if I live in New York). The algorithm uses distant supervision, semi-supervised data harvesting and vector space models to extract user attributes (e.g. spouse, education, location) and preferences (likes and dislikes) from text. The extracted propositions are then fed into a probabilistic reasoner (we investigate both Markov Logic and Probabilistic Soft Logic). Our experiments show that probabilistic logical reasoning significantly improves the performance on attribute and relation extraction, and also achieves an F-score of 0.791 at predicting a users likes or dislikes, significantly better than two strong baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Nov 2014 01:53:21 GMT  (106kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2679v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["jiwei li", "alan ritter", "dan jurafsky"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.2679"}
