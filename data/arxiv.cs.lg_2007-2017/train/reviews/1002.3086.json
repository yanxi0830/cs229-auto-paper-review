{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Feb-2010", "title": "Convergence of Bayesian Control Rule", "abstract": "Recently, new approaches to adaptive control have sought to reformulate the problem as a minimization of a relative entropy criterion to obtain tractable solutions. In particular, it has been shown that minimizing the expected deviation from the causal input-output dependencies of the true plant leads to a new promising stochastic control rule called the Bayesian control rule. This work proves the convergence of the Bayesian control rule under two sufficient assumptions: boundedness, which is an ergodicity condition; and consistency, which is an instantiation of the sure-thing principle.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Feb 2010 14:14:59 GMT  (76kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.3086v1", "8 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["pedro a ortega", "daniel a braun"], "accepted": false, "id": "1002.3086"}
