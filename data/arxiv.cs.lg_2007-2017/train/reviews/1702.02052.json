Previous Deep Learning-based approaches to domain adaptation need to be trained jointly on source and target domain data and are therefore unappealing in scenarios where models need to be adapted to a large number of domains or where a domain is evolving, e.g. spam detection where attackers continuously change their tactics.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Feb 2017 14:59:45 GMT  (3529kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02052v1", "11 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["sebastian ruder", "parsa ghaffari", "john g breslin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.02052"}
