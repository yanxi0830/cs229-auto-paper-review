Traditional methods include feature-rich classifiers or formal reasoning. However, they are usually limited in terms of accuracy and scope. Recently, the renewed prosperity neural networks has made many improvements in a variety of NLP tasks. In particular, the tree-based convolutional neural network (TBCNN) proposed in our previous work has achieved high performance in several sentence-level classification tasks. But whether TBCNN is applicable to recognize entailment and contradiction between two sentences remains unknown. In this paper, we propose TBCNN-pair model for entailment/contradiction recognition. Experimental results in a large dataset verifies the rationale of using TBCNN as the sentence-level model; leveraging additional heuristics like element-wise product/difference further improves the result, and outperforms published results by a large margin.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Dec 2015 14:28:21 GMT  (225kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08422v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 22 Apr 2016 17:49:46 GMT  (238kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08422v2", "Accepted by ACL'16 as a short paper"], ["v3", "Fri, 13 May 2016 16:24:56 GMT  (238kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.08422v3", "Accepted by ACL'16 as a short paper"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["lili mou", "rui men", "ge li", "yan xu", "lu zhang 0023", "rui yan", "zhi jin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.08422"}
