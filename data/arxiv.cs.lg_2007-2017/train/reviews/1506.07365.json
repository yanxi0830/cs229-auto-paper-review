E2C consists of a deep generative model, belonging to the family of variational autoencoders, that learns to generate image trajectories from a latent space in which the dynamics is constrained to be locally linear. Our model is derived directly from an optimal control formulation in latent space, supports long-term prediction of image sequences and exhibits strong performance on a variety of complex control problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Jun 2015 13:48:51 GMT  (4350kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07365v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 25 Jun 2015 21:08:02 GMT  (4351kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07365v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 14:49:18 GMT  (4346kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07365v3", "Final NIPS version"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML", "authors": ["manuel watter", "jost tobias springenberg", "joschka boedecker", "martin a riedmiller"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.07365"}
