We present methods addressing the problem of automatic video highlight prediction based on joint visual features and textual analysis of the real-world audience discourse with complex slang, in both English and traditional Chinese. We present a novel dataset based on League of Legends championships recorded from North American and Taiwanese Twitch.tv channels (will be released for further research), and demonstrate strong results on these using multimodal, character-level CNN-RNN model architectures.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Jul 2017 17:44:38 GMT  (638kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08559v1", "EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG cs.MM", "authors": ["cheng-yang fu", "joon lee", "mohit bansal", "alexander c berg"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.08559"}
