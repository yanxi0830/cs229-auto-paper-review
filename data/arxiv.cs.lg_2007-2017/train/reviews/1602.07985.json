The idea is to outsource the grading task to the students themselves as follows. After the end of an exam, each student is asked to rank ---in terms of quality--- a bundle of exam papers by fellow students. An aggregation rule will then combine the individual rankings into a global one that contains all students. We define a broad class of simple aggregation rules and present a theoretical framework for assessing their effectiveness. When statistical information about the grading behaviour of students is available, the framework can be used to compute the optimal rule from this class with respect to a series of performance objectives. For example, a natural rule known as Borda is proved to be optimal when students grade correctly. In addition, we present extensive simulations and a field experiment that validate our theory and prove it to be extremely accurate in predicting the performance of aggregation rules even when only rough information about grading behaviour is available.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Feb 2016 16:37:57 GMT  (434kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07985v1", "23 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "23 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["ioannis caragiannis", "george a krimpas", "alexandros a voudouris"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.07985"}
