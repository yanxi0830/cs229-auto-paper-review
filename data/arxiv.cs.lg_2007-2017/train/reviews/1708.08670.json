Their comparative analysis was performed and conclusions were made as to the advantages and disadvantages of these platforms. The performance tests for the de facto standard MNIST data set were carried out on H2O framework for deep learning algorithms designed for CPU and GPU platforms for single-threaded and multithreaded modes of operation Also, we present the results of testing neural networks architectures on H2O platform for various activation functions, stopping metrics, and other parameters of machine learning algorithm. It was demonstrated for the use case of MNIST database of handwritten digits in single-threaded mode that blind selection of these parameters can hugely increase (by 2-3 orders) the runtime without the significant increase of precision. This result can have crucial influence for optimization of available and new machine learning methods, especially for image recognition problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 09:54:28 GMT  (396kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08670v1", "15 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables; this paper summarizes the activities which were started recently and described shortly in the previous conference presentationsarXiv:1706.02248andarXiv:1707.04940; it is accepted for Springer book series \"Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing\""]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables; this paper summarizes the activities which were started recently and described shortly in the previous conference presentationsarXiv:1706.02248andarXiv:1707.04940; it is accepted for Springer book series \"Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing\"", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.DC cs.PF", "authors": ["yuriy kochura", "sergii stirenko", "oleg alienin", "michail novotarskiy", "yuri gordienko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.08670"}
