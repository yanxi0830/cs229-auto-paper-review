Algorithms that approximate the crowd can intelligently stretch a limited budget for a crowdsourcing task. We present an algorithm, \"CrowdSense,\" that works in an online fashion to dynamically sample subsets of labelers based on an exploration/exploitation criterion. The algorithm produces a weighted combination of a subset of the labelers' votes that approximates the crowd's opinion.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Apr 2012 19:39:13 GMT  (1100kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.3611v1", "Presented at Collective Intelligence conference, 2012 (arXiv:1204.2991)"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented at Collective Intelligence conference, 2012 (arXiv:1204.2991)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.LG", "authors": ["seyda ertekin", "haym hirsh", "cynthia rudin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.3611"}
