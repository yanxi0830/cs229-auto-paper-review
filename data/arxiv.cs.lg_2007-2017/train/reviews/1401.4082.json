{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Jan-2014", "title": "Stochastic Backpropagation and Approximate Inference in Deep Generative Models", "abstract": "We marry ideas from deep neural networks and approximate Bayesian inference to derive a generalised class of deep, directed generative models, endowed with a new algorithm for scalable inference and learning. Our algorithm introduces a recognition model to represent approximate posterior distributions, and that acts as a stochastic encoder of the data. We develop stochastic back-propagation -- rules for back-propagation through stochastic variables -- and use this to develop an algorithm that allows for joint optimisation of the parameters of both the generative and recognition model. We demonstrate on several real-world data sets that the model generates realistic samples, provides accurate imputations of missing data and is a useful tool for high-dimensional data visualisation.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jan 2014 16:33:23 GMT  (4873kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4082v1", "Under review"], ["v2", "Fri, 9 May 2014 12:53:17 GMT  (33347kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4082v2", "Appears in Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), Beijing, China, 2014"], ["v3", "Fri, 30 May 2014 10:00:36 GMT  (33346kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.4082v3", "Appears In Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), JMLR: W\\&amp;CP volume 32, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG stat.CO stat.ME", "authors": ["danilo jimenez rezende", "shakir mohamed", "daan wierstra"], "accepted": true, "id": "1401.4082"}
