We argue that to tackle concept drift it is important to develop the capacity to describe and analyze it. We propose tools for this purpose, arguing for the importance of quantitative descriptions of drift in marginal distributions. We present quantitative drift analysis techniques along with methods for communicating their results. We demonstrate their effectiveness by application to three real-world learning tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 2 Apr 2017 20:57:04 GMT  (8436kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00362v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["geoffrey i webb", "loong kuan lee", "fran\\c{c}ois petitjean", "bart goethals"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.00362"}
