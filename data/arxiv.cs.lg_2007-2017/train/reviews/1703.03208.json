For almost all results in this literature, the structure is represented by sparsity in a well-chosen basis. We show how to achieve guarantees similar to standard compressed sensing but without employing sparsity at all. Instead, we suppose that vectors lie near the range of a generative model $G: \\mathbb{R}^k \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$. Our main theorem is that, if $G$ is $L$-Lipschitz, then roughly $O(k \\log L)$ random Gaussian measurements suffice for an $\\ell_2/\\ell_2$ recovery guarantee. We demonstrate our results using generative models from published variational autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. Our method can use $5$-$10$x fewer measurements than Lasso for the same accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Mar 2017 10:11:03 GMT  (1604kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03208v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "authors": ["ashish bora", "ajil jalal", "eric price", "alexandros g dimakis"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.03208"}
