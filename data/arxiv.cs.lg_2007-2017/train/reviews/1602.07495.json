Active learning works by selecting the most informative sample among unlabeled data and querying the label of that point from user. Many different methods such as uncertainty sampling and minimum risk sampling have been utilized to select the most informative sample in active learning. Although many active learning algorithms have been proposed so far, most of them work with binary or multi-class classification problems and therefore can not be applied to problems in which only samples from one class as well as a set of unlabeled data are available.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 13:32:36 GMT  (755kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07495v1", "6 pages, presented at IEEE ICDM 2011 Workshops"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, presented at IEEE ICDM 2011 Workshops", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["alireza ghasemi", "hamid r rabiee", "mohsen fadaee", "mohammad t manzuri", "mohammad h rohban"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.07495"}
