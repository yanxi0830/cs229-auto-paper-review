The key idea behind LAL is to train a regressor that predicts the expected error reduction for a potential sample in a particular learning state. By treating the query selection procedure as a regression problem we are not restricted to dealing with existing AL heuristics; instead, we learn strategies based on experience from previous active learning experiments. We show that LAL can be learnt from a simple artificial 2D dataset and yields strategies that work well on real data from a wide range of domains. Moreover, if some domain-specific samples are available to bootstrap active learning, the LAL strategy can be tailored for a particular problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Mar 2017 17:36:52 GMT  (970kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03365v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 31 Mar 2017 07:33:28 GMT  (973kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03365v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 14 Jul 2017 12:59:12 GMT  (803kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03365v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ksenia konyushkova", "raphael sznitman", "pascal fua"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.03365"}
