These kinds of rule lists are inspired by healthcare applications where patients would be stratified into risk sets and the highest at-risk patients should be considered first. We provide a Bayesian framework for learning falling rule lists that does not rely on traditional greedy decision tree learning methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Nov 2014 15:01:56 GMT  (200kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5899v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 27 Jan 2015 04:41:38 GMT  (293kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5899v2", "Accepted at AISTATS 2015.
