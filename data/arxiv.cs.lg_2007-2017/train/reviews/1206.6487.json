In particular, the new algorithm achieves the minimax regret, within logarithmic factors, for both \"easy\" and \"hard\" problems. For easy problems, it additionally achieves logarithmic individual regret. Most importantly, the algorithm is adaptive in the sense that if the opponent strategy is in an \"easy region\" of the strategy space then the regret grows as if the problem was easy. As an implication, we show that under some reasonable additional assumptions, the algorithm enjoys an O(\\sqrt{T}) regret in Dynamic Pricing, proven to be hard by Bartok et al. (2011).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (697kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6487v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GT stat.ML", "authors": ["g\u00e1bor bart\u00f3k", "navid zolghadr", "csaba szepesv\u00e1ri"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6487"}
