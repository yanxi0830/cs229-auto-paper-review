Value iteration networks are suitable for making predictions about outcomes that involve planning-based reasoning, such as predicting a desired trajectory from an observation of a map. Key to our approach is a novel differentiable approximation of the value-iteration algorithm, which can be represented as a convolutional neural network, and trained end-to-end using standard backpropagation. We evaluate our value iteration networks on the task of predicting optimal obstacle-avoiding trajectories from an image of a landscape, both on synthetic data, and on challenging raw images of the Mars terrain.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 Feb 2016 05:44:36 GMT  (309kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02867v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 29 May 2016 18:33:04 GMT  (416kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02867v2", "Update: new experiments on continuous domain and language task, more focus on generalization property of value iteration networks"], ["v3", "Sun, 5 Feb 2017 20:06:14 GMT  (1195kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02867v3", "NIPS final version"], ["v4", "Mon, 20 Mar 2017 21:41:51 GMT  (1195kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02867v4", "Fixed missing table values"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML", "authors": ["aviv tamar", "sergey levine", "pieter abbeel", "yi wu", "garrett thomas"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.02867"}
