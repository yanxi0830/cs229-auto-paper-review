We have proposed a time efficient two-stage cascaded classifier for the prediction of buy sessions and purchased items within such sessions. Based on the model, several interesting features found, and formation of our own test bed, we have achieved a reasonable score. Usage of Random Forests helps us to cope with the effect of the multiplicity of good models depending on varying subsets of features in the purchased items prediction and, in its turn, boosting is used as a suitable technique to overcome severe class imbalance of the buy-session prediction.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 16 Aug 2015 19:27:35 GMT  (28kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03856v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["sheikh muhammad sarwar", "mahamudul hasan", "dmitry i ignatov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.03856"}
