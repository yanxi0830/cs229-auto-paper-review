By applying deep recurrent neural networks we learn to discriminate between several application layer traffic types on top of a constant envelope modulation without using an expert demodulation algorithm. We show that complex protocol sequences can be learned and used for both classification and generation tasks using this approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Oct 2016 14:22:19 GMT  (2957kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.00564v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NI", "authors": ["timothy j o'shea", "seth hitefield", "johnathan corgan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.00564"}
