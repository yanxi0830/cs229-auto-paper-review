An important variant is the sparse NMF problem which arises when we explicitly require the learnt features to be sparse. A natural measure of sparsity is the L$_0$ norm, however its optimization is NP-hard. Mixed norms, such as L$_1$/L$_2$ measure, have been shown to model sparsity robustly, based on intuitive attributes that such measures need to satisfy. This is in contrast to computationally cheaper alternatives such as the plain L$_1$ norm. However, present algorithms designed for optimizing the mixed norm L$_1$/L$_2$ are slow and other formulations for sparse NMF have been proposed such as those based on L$_1$ and L$_0$ norms. Our proposed algorithm allows us to solve the mixed norm sparsity constraints while not sacrificing computation time. We present experimental evidence on real-world datasets that shows our new algorithm performs an order of magnitude faster compared to the current state-of-the-art solvers optimizing the mixed norm and is suitable for large-scale datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Jan 2013 23:11:05 GMT  (1027kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3527v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 18 Mar 2013 22:42:11 GMT  (822kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3527v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NA", "authors": ["vamsi k potluru", "sergey m plis", "jonathan le roux", "barak a pearlmutter", "vince d calhoun", "thomas p hayes"], "accepted": true, "id": "1301.3527"}
