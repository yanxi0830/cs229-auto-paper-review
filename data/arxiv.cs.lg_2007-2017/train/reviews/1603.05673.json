In this work, we apply linguistic analytics to restaurant reviews, from Yelp, in order to automatically predict official health inspection reports. We consider two types of feature sets, i.e., keyword detection and topic model features, and use these in several classification methods. Our empirical analysis shows that these extracted features can predict public health inspection reports with over 90% accuracy using simple support vector machines.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 Mar 2016 20:20:32 GMT  (348kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05673v1", "7 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["samantha wong", "hamidreza chinaei", "frank rudzicz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.05673"}
