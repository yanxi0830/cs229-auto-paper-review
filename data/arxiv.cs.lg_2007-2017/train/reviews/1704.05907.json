Our method automatically creates various views of its input text, each taking the form of soft attention weights that distribute the classifier's focus among a set of base features. For a bag-of-words representation, each view focuses on a different subset of the text's words. Aggregating many such views results in a more discriminative and robust representation. Through a novel architecture that both stacks and concatenates views, we produce a network that emphasizes both depth and width, allowing training to converge quickly. Using our multi-view architecture, we establish new state-of-the-art accuracies on two benchmark tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Apr 2017 19:33:38 GMT  (3166kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05907v1", "6 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["hongyu guo", "colin cherry", "jiang su"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.05907"}
