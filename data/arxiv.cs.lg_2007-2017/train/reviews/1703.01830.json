We provide improved running time estimates for the state-of-the-art continuous algorithms for the problem using combinatorial arguments. We also provide a systematic experimental comparison of the two types of methods, based on a clear distinction between level-0 and level-1 algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 12:06:58 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01830v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["alina ene", "huy l nguyen", "l\\'aszl\\'o a v\\'egh"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.01830"}
