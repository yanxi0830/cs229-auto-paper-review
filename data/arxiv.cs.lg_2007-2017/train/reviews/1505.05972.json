In particular, gradient descent is a sequential process and the resulting serial dependencies mean that DNN training cannot be parallelized effectively. Here, we show that a DNN may be replicated over a massive parallel architecture and used to provide a cumulative sampling of local solution space which results in rapid and robust learning. We introduce a complimentary convolutional bootstrapping approach that enhances performance of the parallel architecture further. Our parallelized convolutional bootstrapping DNN out-performs an identical fully-trained traditional DNN after only a single iteration of training.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 22 May 2015 07:24:14 GMT  (336kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05972v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 21 May 2016 09:33:33 GMT  (262kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05972v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["andrew j r simpson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.05972"}
