Such measures have spurred much interest and pose specific challenges to learning algorithms since their non-additive nature precludes a direct application of well-studied large scale optimization methods such as stochastic gradient descent.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 26 May 2015 05:59:33 GMT  (86kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06812v1", "To appear in proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["harikrishna narasimhan", "purushottam kar", "prateek jain 0002"], "accepted": true, "id": "1505.06812"}
