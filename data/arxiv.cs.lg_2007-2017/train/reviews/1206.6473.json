Option models are temporal abstractions that, like macro-operators in classical planning, jump directly from a start state to an end state. Prior work has focused on constructing option models from primitive actions, by intra-option model learning; or on using option models to construct a value function, by inter-option planning. We present a unified view of intra- and inter-option model learning, based on a major generalisation of the Bellman equation. Our fundamental operation is the recursive composition of option models into other option models. This key idea enables compositional planning over many levels of abstraction. We illustrate our framework using a dynamic programming algorithm that simultaneously constructs optimal option models for multiple subgoals, and also searches over those option models to provide rapid progress towards other subgoals.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (366kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6473v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["david silver", "kamil ciosek"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6473"}
