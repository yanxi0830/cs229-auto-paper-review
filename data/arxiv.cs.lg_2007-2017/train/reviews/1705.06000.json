In contrast to multi-task learning paradigm that learns similar tasks using a shared representation, the proposed framework leverages two representations at different levels and simultaneously discriminates between foreground and background at the bounding box and superpixel level using discriminative clustering. We show empirically that constraining the two problems at different scales enables the transfer of semantic localization cues to improve cosegmentation output whereas local appearance based segmentation cues help colocalization. The unified framework outperforms strong baseline approaches, of learning the two problems separately, by a large margin on four benchmark datasets. Furthermore, it obtains competitive results compared to the state of the art for cosegmentation on two benchmark datasets and second best result for colocalization on Pascal VOC 2007.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 May 2017 04:18:19 GMT  (1271kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06000v1", "8 pages, Under Review"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, Under Review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["abhishek sharma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.06000"}
