All modeling assumptions are rigorously explained, and all model parameters have a physical interpretation. This approach results in a transparent and intuitive model. With respect to the state of the art beam model this paper: (i) proposes a different functional form for the probability of range measurements caused by unmodeled objects, (ii) intuitively explains the discontinuity encountered in te state of the art beam model, and (iii) reduces the number of model parameters, while maintaining the same representational power for experimental data. The proposed beam model is called RBBM, short for Rigorously Bayesian Beam Model. A maximum likelihood and a variational Bayesian estimator (both based on expectation-maximization) are proposed to learn the model parameters.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 04:49:23 GMT  (3761kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3432v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["tinne de laet", "joris de schutter", "herman bruyninckx"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3432"}
