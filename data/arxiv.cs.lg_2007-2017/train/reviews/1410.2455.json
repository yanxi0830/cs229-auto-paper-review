Instead it trains directly on monolingual data and extracts a bilingual signal from a smaller set of raw-text sentence-aligned data. We introduce a novel sampled bag-of-words cross-lingual objective and use it to regularize two noise-contrastive language models for efficient cross-lingual feature learning. We evaluate our model on cross-lingual document classification and lexical translation on the WMT11 data. Our code will be made available as part of the open-source word2vec toolkit.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Oct 2014 13:41:18 GMT  (307kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2455v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 4 Dec 2014 20:52:32 GMT  (242kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2455v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 4 Feb 2016 05:51:59 GMT  (627kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2455v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["stephan gouws", "yoshua bengio", "greg corrado"], "accepted": true, "id": "1410.2455"}
