Ideally, auxiliary objectives should be helpful. However, in practice, objectives may be efficient on some optimization stages but obstructive on others. In this paper we propose a modification of the EA+RL method which dynamically selects optimized objectives using reinforcement learning. The proposed modification prevents from losing the best found solution. We analysed the proposed modification and compared it with the EA+RL method and Random Local Search on XdivK, Generalized OneMax and LeadingOnes problems. The proposed modification outperforms the EA+RL method on all problem instances. It also outperforms the single objective approach on the most problem instances. We also provide detailed analysis of how different components of the considered algorithms influence efficiency of optimization. In addition, we present theoretical analysis of the proposed modification on the XdivK problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 12:52:51 GMT  (106kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07187v1", "this is a full version of a paper which has been accepted as a student workshop paper to GECCO conference 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "this is a full version of a paper which has been accepted as a student workshop paper to GECCO conference 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["irina petrova", "arina buzdalova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.07187"}
