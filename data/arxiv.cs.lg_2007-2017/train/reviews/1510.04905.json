With a focus on computational efficiency, however, forsaking solutions quality and accuracy becomes the trade-off. In this paper, we investigate compressed least-squares problems and propose new models and algorithms that address the issue of error and noise introduced by compression. While maintaining computational efficiency, our models provide robust solutions that are more accurate--relative to solutions of uncompressed least-squares--than those of classical compressed variants. We introduce tools from robust optimization together with a form of partial compression to improve the error-time trade-offs of compressed least-squares solvers. We develop an efficient solution algorithm for our Robust Partially-Compressed (RPC) model based on a reduction to a one-dimensional search. We also derive the first approximation error bounds for Partially-Compressed least-squares solutions. Empirical results comparing numerous alternatives suggest that robust and partially compressed solutions are effectively insulated against aggressive randomized transforms.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Oct 2015 14:59:04 GMT  (450kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04905v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["stephen becker", "ban kawas", "marek petrik"], "accepted": true, "id": "1510.04905"}
