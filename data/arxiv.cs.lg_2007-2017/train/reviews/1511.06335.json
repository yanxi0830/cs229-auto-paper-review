Relatively little work has focused on learning representations for clustering. In this paper, we propose Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC), a method that simultaneously learns feature representations and cluster assignments using deep neural networks. DEC learns a mapping from the data space to a lower-dimensional feature space in which it iteratively optimizes a clustering objective. Our experimental evaluations on image and text corpora show significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 20:06:14 GMT  (2482kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06335v1", "iclr2016"], ["v2", "Tue, 24 May 2016 22:27:35 GMT  (1433kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06335v2", "icml2016"]], "COMMENTS": "iclr2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["junyuan xie", "ross b girshick", "ali farhadi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.06335"}
