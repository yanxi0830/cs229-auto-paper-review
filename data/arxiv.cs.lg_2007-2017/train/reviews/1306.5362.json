For example, by using the empirical statistical leverage scores as an importance sampling distribution, the method of algorithmic leveraging samples and rescales rows/columns of data matrices to reduce the data size before performing computations on the subproblem. This method has been successful in improving computational efficiency of algorithms for matrix problems such as least-squares approximation, least absolute deviations approximation, and low-rank matrix approximation. Existing work has focused on algorithmic issues such as worst-case running times and numerical issues associated with providing high-quality implementations, but none of it addresses statistical aspects of this method.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 23 Jun 2013 00:31:15 GMT  (119kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.5362v1", "44 pages, 17 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "44 pages, 17 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ME cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["ping ma", "michael w mahoney", "bin yu 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1306.5362"}
