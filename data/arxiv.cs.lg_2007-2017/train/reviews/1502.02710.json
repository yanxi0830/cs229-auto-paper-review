Though a naive implementation of our proposal would require training individual classifiers for each label, we show that for natural datasets and linear classifiers we can sidestep this by leveraging techniques from randomized linear algebra. Moreover, our algorithm applies equally well to multiclass classification. The end result is an algorithm that scales to very large multilabel and multiclass problems, and offers state of the art accuracy on many datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Feb 2015 22:18:26 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02710v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 20 Apr 2015 21:08:19 GMT  (44kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02710v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["nikos karampatziakis", "paul mineiro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.02710"}
