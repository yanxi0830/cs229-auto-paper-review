We use a realtime topic modeling technique to build a semantic perception model of the environment, using which, we plan a path through the locations in the world with high semantic information content. The life-long learning behavior of the proposed perception model makes it suitable for long-term exploration missions. We validate the approach using simulated exploration experiments using aerial and underwater data, and demonstrate an implementation on the Aqua underwater robot in a variety of scenarios. We find that the proposed exploration paths that are biased towards locations with high topic perplexity, produce better terrain models with high discriminative power. Moreover, we show that the proposed algorithm implemented on Aqua robot is able to do tasks such as coral reef inspection, diver following, and sea floor exploration, without any prior training or preparation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 26 Sep 2015 13:16:52 GMT  (5498kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07975v1", "20 pages, in-press, Autonomous Robots, 2015. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1310.6767"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages, in-press, Autonomous Robots, 2015. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1310.6767", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["yogesh girdhar", "gregory dudek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.07975"}
