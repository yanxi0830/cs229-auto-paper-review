The approach comprises data cleaning, normalization, capping, time-based compression, and finally classification with a recurrent neural network. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in a case study with 279 participants. On the basis of sparse sensor events, the network continually predicts whether the participants would attend to a notification within 10 minutes. Compared to a random baseline, the classifier achieves a 40% performance increase (AUC of 0.702) on a withheld test set. This approach allows to forgo resource-intensive, domain-specific, error-prone feature engineering, which may drastically increase the applicability of machine learning to mobile phone sensor data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 May 2017 15:55:53 GMT  (448kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06224v1", "6 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.HC", "authors": ["kleomenis katevas", "ilias leontiadis", "martin pielot", "joan serr\\`a"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.06224"}
