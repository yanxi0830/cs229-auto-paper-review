Motivated by such a desire, this work presents the context tree, a new hierarchical data structure that summarises the context behind user actions in a single model. We propose a method for context tree construction that augments geospatial trajectories with land usage data to identify such contexts. Through evaluation of the construction method and analysis of the properties of generated context trees, we demonstrate the foundation for understanding and modelling behaviour afforded. Summarising user contexts into a single data structure gives easy access to information that would otherwise remain latent, providing the basis for better understanding and predicting the actions and behaviours of individuals and groups. Finally, we also present a method for pruning context trees, for use in applications where it is desirable to reduce the size of the tree while retaining useful information.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 09:27:29 GMT  (3410kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04269v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["alasdair thomason", "nathan griffiths", "victor sanchez"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04269"}
