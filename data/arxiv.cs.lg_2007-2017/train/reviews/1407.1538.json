Conventional multi-label learning approaches mainly focus on exploiting label correlations. It is usually assumed, explicitly or implicitly, that the label sets for training instances are fully labeled without any missing labels. However, in many real-world multi-label datasets, the label assignments for training instances can be incomplete. Some ground-truth labels can be missed by the labeler from the label set. This problem is especially typical when the number instances is very large, and the labeling cost is very high, which makes it almost impossible to get a fully labeled training set. In this paper, we study the problem of large-scale multi-label learning with incomplete label assignments. We propose an approach, called MPU, based upon positive and unlabeled stochastic gradient descent and stacked models. Unlike prior works, our method can effectively and efficiently consider missing labels and label correlations simultaneously, and is very scalable, that has linear time complexities over the size of the data. Extensive experiments on two real-world multi-label datasets show that our MPU model consistently outperform other commonly-used baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 6 Jul 2014 20:13:48 GMT  (154kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.1538v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["xiangnan kong", "zhaoming wu", "li-jia li", "ruofei zhang", "philip s yu", "hang wu", "wei fan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1407.1538"}
