We study scenarios in which each client sends one bit per dimension. We first show that for $d$ dimensional data with $n$ clients, a naive stochastic rounding approach yields a mean squared error $\\Theta(d/n)$. We then show by applying a structured random rotation of the data (an $\\mathcal{O}(d \\log d)$ algorithm), the error can be reduced to $\\mathcal{O}((\\log d)/n)$. The algorithms and the analysis make no distributional assumptions on the data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Nov 2016 00:16:18 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00429v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 17:37:14 GMT  (77kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00429v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 25 Sep 2017 15:10:54 GMT  (77kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00429v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ananda theertha suresh", "felix x yu", "sanjiv kumar", "h brendan mcmahan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.00429"}
