This fundamental question has received tremendous attention in statistics, focusing primarily on asymptotic analysis, and more recently in information theory and theoretical computer science, where the emphasis has been on small sample size and computational complexity. Nevertheless, even for basic properties of distributions such as monotonicity, log-concavity, unimodality, independence, and monotone-hazard rate, the optimal sample complexity is unknown.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Jul 2015 19:52:56 GMT  (986kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05952v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 22 Jul 2015 14:12:33 GMT  (806kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05952v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 8 Dec 2015 20:00:11 GMT  (77kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.05952v3", "31 pages, extended abstract appeared as a spotlight in NIPS 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.IT cs.LG math.IT math.ST stat.TH", "authors": ["jayadev acharya", "constantinos daskalakis", "gautam kamath"], "accepted": true, "id": "1507.05952"}
