{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Dec-2014", "title": "Representation Learning for cold-start recommendation", "abstract": "A standard approach to Collaborative Filtering (CF), i.e. prediction of user ratings on items, relies on Matrix Factorization techniques. Representations for both users and items are computed from the observed ratings and used for prediction. Unfortunatly, these transductive approaches cannot handle the case of new users arriving in the system, with no known rating, a problem known as user cold-start. A common approach in this context is to ask these incoming users for a few initialization ratings. This paper presents a model to tackle this twofold problem of (i) finding good questions to ask, (ii) building efficient representations from this small amount of information. The model can also be used in a more standard (warm) context. Our approach is evaluated on the classical CF problem and on the cold-start problem on four different datasets showing its ability to improve baseline performance in both cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 21:58:06 GMT  (80kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7156v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 18:56:23 GMT  (392kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7156v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 27 Mar 2015 09:59:25 GMT  (392kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7156v3", "Accepted as workshop contribution at ICLR 2015"], ["v4", "Wed, 8 Apr 2015 15:37:19 GMT  (392kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7156v4", "Accepted as workshop contribution at ICLR 2015"], ["v5", "Mon, 22 Jun 2015 14:01:33 GMT  (392kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7156v5", "Accepted as workshop contribution at ICLR 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["gabriella contardo", "ludovic denoyer", "thierry artieres"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.7156"}
