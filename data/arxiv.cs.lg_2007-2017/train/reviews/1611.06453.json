However, these classifiers are relatively heavyweight, so that applying them to classify video is costly. We show that day-to-day video exhibits highly skewed class distributions over the short term, and that these distributions can be classified by much simpler models. We formulate the problem of detecting the short-term skews online and exploiting models based on it as a new sequential decision making problem dubbed the Online Bandit Problem, and present a new algorithm to solve it. When applied to recognizing faces in TV shows and movies, we realize end-to-end classification speedups of 2.5-8.5x/2.8-12.7x (on GPU/CPU) relative to a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network, at competitive accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 20 Nov 2016 00:21:32 GMT  (4052kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06453v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 2 Jul 2017 02:17:00 GMT  (4068kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.06453v2", "Accepted at IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["haichen shen", "seungyeop han", "matthai philipose", "arvind krishnamurthy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.06453"}
