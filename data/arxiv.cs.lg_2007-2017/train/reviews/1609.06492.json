The document is mapped into a uniformly coded text of numerical values. It is derived from the position of the letters in the text line, based on their typographical characteristics. Each code is considered as a gray level. Accordingly, the coded text determines a 1-D image, on which texture analysis by run-length statistics and local binary pattern is performed. It defines feature vectors representing the script content of the document. A modified clustering approach employed on document feature vector groups documents written in the same script. Experimentation performed on two custom oriented databases of historical documents in old Cyrillic, angular and round Glagolitic as well as Antiqua and Fraktur scripts demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method with respect to well-known methods in the state-of-the-art.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 Sep 2016 10:52:03 GMT  (1315kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06492v1", "8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["darko brodic", "alessia amelio", "zoran n milivojevic", "milena jevtic"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.06492"}
