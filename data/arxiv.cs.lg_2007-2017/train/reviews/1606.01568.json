To this aim, we propose a principled algorithm to 1) avoid computationally expensive iterative solutions while 2) adapting the Huber loss threshold in a data-driven fashion and 3) actively balancing the use of labelled data to remove noisy or inconsistent annotations from the training stage. In a wide experimental evaluation, dealing with diverse applications, we assess the superiority of our paradigm which is able to combine strong performance and robustness to noise at a low computational cost.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 5 Jun 2016 21:59:34 GMT  (4477kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01568v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 26 Jun 2016 07:24:43 GMT  (4476kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01568v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["jacopo cavazza", "vittorio murino"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.01568"}
