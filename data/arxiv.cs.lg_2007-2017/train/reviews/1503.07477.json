Earlier technologies were not able to handle storage and processing of huge data thus Big Data concept comes into existence. This is a tedious job for users unstructured data. So, there should be some mechanism which classify unstructured data into organized form which helps user to easily access required data. Classification techniques over big transactional database provide required data to the users from large datasets more simple way. There are two main classification techniques, supervised and unsupervised. In this paper we focused on to study of different supervised classification techniques. Further this paper shows a advantages and limitations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Mar 2015 17:56:19 GMT  (377kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07477v1", "7 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables in IJAFRC, Vol.1, Issue 11, November 2014, ISSN: 2348-4853"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables in IJAFRC, Vol.1, Issue 11, November 2014, ISSN: 2348-4853", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["praful koturwar", "sheetal girase", "debajyoti mukhopadhyay"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.07477"}
