Through the use of the Kronecker product and some basic facts of tensor algebra, we propose a simple model of nonlinearity, one that can be interpreted as a product of the outputs of K FIR linear filters, and compute its cost function together with its gradient, which allows for some analysis of the optimization problem. We use these results it in a stochastic gradient framework, from which we derive an LMS-like algorithm and investigate the problems of multi-modality in the mean-square error surface and the choice of adequate initial conditions. Its computational complexity is calculated. The new algorithm is tested in a system identification setup and is compared with other polynomial algorithms from the literature, presenting favorable convergence and/or computational complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Mar 2016 19:53:02 GMT  (214kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00427v1", "5 pages, one of references, plus extra page attached"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, one of references, plus extra page attached", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.LG", "authors": ["felipe c pinheiro", "c\\'assio g lopes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.00427"}
