It is known that dynamics based on generic no-regret algorithms may not converge to Nash equilibria in general, but to a larger set of outcomes, namely coarse correlated equilibria. Moreover, convergence results based on generic no-regret algorithms typically use a weaker notion of convergence: the convergence of the average plays instead of the actual plays. Some work has been done showing that when using a specific no-regret algorithm, the well-known multiplicative updates algorithm, convergence of actual plays to equilibria can be shown and better quality of outcomes in terms of the price of anarchy can be reached for atomic congestion games and load balancing games. Are there more cases of natural no-regret dynamics that perform well in suitable classes of games in terms of convergence and quality of outcomes that the dynamics converge to?", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 May 2016 08:32:48 GMT  (41kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07774v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 13 Oct 2016 02:51:10 GMT  (41kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07774v2", "In Artificial Intelligence, Volume 241, Dec 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.LG", "authors": ["po-an chen", "chi-jen lu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.07774"}
