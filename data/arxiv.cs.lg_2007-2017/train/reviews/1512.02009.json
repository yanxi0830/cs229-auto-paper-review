The goal of this research is to capture the document intent structure by modeling documents as a mixture of topic words and rhetorical words. While the topics are relatively unchanged through one document, the rhetorical functions of sentences usually change following certain orders in discourse. We propose GMM-LDA, a topic modeling based Bayesian unsupervised model, to analyze the document intent structure cooperated with order information. Our model is flexible that has the ability to combine the annotations and do supervised learning. Additionally, entropic regularization can be introduced to model the significant divergence between topics and intents. We perform experiments in both unsupervised and supervised settings, results show the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Dec 2015 12:16:58 GMT  (264kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02009v1", "Accepted by AAAI 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by AAAI 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["bei chen", "jun zhu", "nan yang", "tian tian 0001", "ming zhou", "bo zhang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.02009"}
