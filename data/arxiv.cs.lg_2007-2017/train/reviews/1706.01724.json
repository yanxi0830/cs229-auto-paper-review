For the Poisson gamma belief network (PGBN), a recently proposed deep discrete LVM, we derive an alternative representation that is referred to as deep latent Dirichlet allocation (DLDA). Exploiting data augmentation and marginalization techniques, we derive a block-diagonal Fisher information matrix and its inverse for the simplex-constrained global model parameters of DLDA. Exploiting that Fisher information matrix with stochastic gradient MCMC, we present topic-layer-adaptive stochastic gradient Riemannian (TLASGR) MCMC that jointly learns simplex-constrained global parameters across all layers and topics, with topic and layer specific learning rates. State-of-the-art results are demonstrated on big data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Jun 2017 12:15:42 GMT  (1176kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01724v1", "Appearing in ICML 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Appearing in ICML 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO", "authors": ["yulai cong", "bo chen", "hongwei liu", "mingyuan zhou"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.01724"}
