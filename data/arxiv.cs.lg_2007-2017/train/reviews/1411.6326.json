In this work we present the first implementation of receding horizon control, which is widely used in ground vehicles, with monocular vision as the only sensing mode for autonomous UAV flight in dense clutter. We make it feasible on UAVs via a number of contributions: novel coupling of perception and control via relevant and diverse, multiple interpretations of the scene around the robot, leveraging recent advances in machine learning to showcase anytime budgeted cost-sensitive feature selection, and fast non-linear regression for monocular depth prediction. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our novel pipeline via real world experiments of more than 2 kms through dense trees with a quadrotor built from off-the-shelf parts. Moreover our pipeline is designed to combine information from other modalities like stereo and lidar as well if available.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Nov 2014 02:09:59 GMT  (9124kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6326v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["debadeepta dey", "kumar shaurya shankar", "sam zeng", "rupesh mehta", "m talha agcayazi", "christopher eriksen", "shreyansh daftry", "martial hebert", "j", "rew bagnell"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.6326"}
