Their comparative analysis was performed and conclusions were made as to the advantages and disadvantages of these platforms. The performance tests for the de facto standard MNIST data set were carried out on H2O framework for deep learning algorithms designed for CPU and GPU platforms for single-threaded and multithreaded modes of operation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Jun 2017 16:41:21 GMT  (410kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02248v1", "4 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables; XIIth International Scientific and Technical Conference on Computer Sciences and Information Technologies (CSIT 2017), Lviv, Ukraine"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables; XIIth International Scientific and Technical Conference on Computer Sciences and Information Technologies (CSIT 2017), Lviv, Ukraine", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.DC", "authors": ["yuriy kochura", "sergii stirenko", "anis rojbi", "oleg alienin", "michail novotarskiy", "yuri gordienko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02248"}
