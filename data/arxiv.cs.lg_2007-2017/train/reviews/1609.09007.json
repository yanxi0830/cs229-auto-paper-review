We evaluate our approach on tag in- duction. Our approach outperforms existing generative models and is competitive with the state-of-the-art though with a simpler model easily extended to include additional context.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Sep 2016 16:55:52 GMT  (351kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09007v1", "accepted at EMNLP 2016, Workshop on Structured Prediction for NLP.
