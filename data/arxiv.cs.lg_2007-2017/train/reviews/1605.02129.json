In this paper, we focus on the spoken language understanding pilot task, which consists of tagging a given utterance with speech acts and semantic slots. We compare different classifiers: the best system obtains 0.52 and 0.67 F1-scores on the test set for speech act recognition for the tourist and the guide respectively, and 0.52 F1-score for semantic tagging for both the guide and the tourist.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 May 2016 01:55:51 GMT  (68kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02129v1", "Paper accepted at IWSDS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Paper accepted at IWSDS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["franck dernoncourt", "ji young lee", "trung h bui", "hung h bui"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.02129"}
