We present efficient online learning algorithms that eschew projections in favor of much more efficient linear optimization steps using the Frank-Wolfe technique. We obtain a range of regret bounds for online convex optimization, with better bounds for specific cases such as stochastic online smooth convex optimization.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:26:34 GMT  (359kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4657v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["elad hazan", "satyen kale"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4657"}
