However, most of the existing deep models are structurally very complex, making them difficult to be deployed on the mobile platforms with limited computational power. In this paper, we propose a novel network compression method called dynamic network surgery, which can remarkably reduce the network complexity by making on-the-fly connection pruning. Unlike the previous methods which accomplish this task in a greedy way, we properly incorporate connection splicing into the whole process to avoid incorrect pruning and make it as a continual network maintenance. The effectiveness of our method is proved with experiments. Without any accuracy loss, our method can efficiently compress the number of parameters in LeNet-5 and AlexNet by a factor of $\\bm{108}\\times$ and $\\bm{17.7}\\times$ respectively, proving that it outperforms the recent pruning method by considerable margins. Code will be made publicly available.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Aug 2016 06:23:05 GMT  (1327kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04493v1", "Accepted by NIPS 2016"], ["v2", "Thu, 10 Nov 2016 00:17:25 GMT  (1229kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04493v2", "Accepted by NIPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by NIPS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["yiwen guo", "anbang yao", "yurong chen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.04493"}
