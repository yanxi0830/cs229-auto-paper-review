We give prediction error guarantees that depend on the noisy-margin properties of the input sample, and are competitive with those obtained by previously proposed passive learners. We prove that the label complexity of MARMANN is significantly lower than that of any passive learner with similar error guarantees. Our algorithm is based on a generalized sample compression scheme and a new label-efficient active model-selection procedure.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 May 2016 14:00:27 GMT  (23kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06792v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 16 Oct 2016 08:23:18 GMT  (37kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06792v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.ST stat.TH", "authors": ["aryeh kontorovich", "sivan sabato", "ruth urner"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.06792"}
