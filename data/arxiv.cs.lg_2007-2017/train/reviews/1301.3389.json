In NMF, a matrix of non-negative data is approximated by the low-rank product of two matrices with non-negative entries. In this paper, the approximation quality is measured by the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the data and its low-rank reconstruction. The existence of the simple multiplicative update (MU) algorithm for computing the matrix factors has contributed to the success of NMF. Despite the availability of algorithms showing faster convergence, MU remains popular due to its simplicity. In this paper, a diagonalized Newton algorithm (DNA) is proposed showing faster convergence while the implementation remains simple and suitable for high-rank problems. The DNA algorithm is applied to various publicly available data sets, showing a substantial speed-up on modern hardware.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Jan 2013 15:59:46 GMT  (249kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3389v1", "8 pages + references; International Conference on Learning Representations, 2013"], ["v2", "Mon, 18 Mar 2013 09:15:29 GMT  (251kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3389v2", "8 pages + references; International Conference on Learning Representations, 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages + references; International Conference on Learning Representations, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NA cs.LG", "authors": ["hugo van hamme"], "accepted": true, "id": "1301.3389"}
