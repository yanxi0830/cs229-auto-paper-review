This paper introduces an algorithm aimed at reducing the complexity of applying linear operators in high dimension by approximately factorizing the corresponding matrix into few sparse factors. The approach relies on recent advances in non-convex optimization. It is first explained and analyzed in details and then demonstrated experimentally on various problems including dictionary learning for image denoising, and the approximation of large matrices arising in inverse problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Jun 2015 10:02:13 GMT  (570kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07300v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 07:56:08 GMT  (491kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.07300v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["luc le magoarou", "r\\'emi gribonval"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.07300"}
