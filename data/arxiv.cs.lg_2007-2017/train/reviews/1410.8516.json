{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "30-Oct-2014", "title": "NICE: Non-linear Independent Components Estimation", "abstract": "We propose a deep learning framework for modeling complex high-dimensional densities via Non-linear Independent Component Estimation (NICE). It is based on the idea that a good representation is one in which the data has a distribution that is easy to model. For this purpose, a non-linear deterministic transformation of the data is learned that maps it to a latent space so as to make the transformed data conform to a factorized distribution, i.e., resulting in independent latent variables. We parametrize this transformation so that computing the determinant of the Jacobian and inverse Jacobian is trivial, yet we maintain the ability to learn complex non-linear transformations, via a composition of simple building blocks, each based on a deep neural network. The training criterion is simply the exact log-likelihood, which is tractable, and unbiased ancestral sampling is also easy. We show that this approach yields good generative models on four image datasets and can be used for inpainting.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Oct 2014 19:44:20 GMT  (2325kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 19 Dec 2014 22:40:18 GMT  (1454kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 6 Jan 2015 18:10:44 GMT  (1454kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516v3", "11 pages, under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2015"], ["v4", "Mon, 9 Mar 2015 18:06:58 GMT  (1455kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516v4", "11 pages, under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2015"], ["v5", "Thu, 12 Mar 2015 06:25:20 GMT  (1456kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516v5", "10 pages and 2 pages Appendix, under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2015"], ["v6", "Fri, 10 Apr 2015 12:27:56 GMT  (1457kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8516v6", "11 pages and 2 pages Appendix, workshop paper at ICLR 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["laurent dinh", "david krueger", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": true, "id": "1410.8516"}
