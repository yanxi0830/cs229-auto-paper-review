{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-Jun-2012", "title": "A Hybrid Algorithm for Convex Semidefinite Optimization", "abstract": "We present a hybrid algorithm for optimizing a convex, smooth function over the cone of positive semidefinite matrices. Our algorithm converges to the global optimal solution and can be used to solve general large-scale semidefinite programs and hence can be readily applied to a variety of machine learning problems. We show experimental results on three machine learning problems (matrix completion, metric learning, and sparse PCA) . Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 14:44:28 GMT  (247kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4608v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS cs.NA stat.ML", "authors": ["s\u00f6ren laue"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4608"}
