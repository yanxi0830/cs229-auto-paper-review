{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Jun-2015", "title": "WordRank: Learning Word Embeddings via Robust Ranking", "abstract": "Embedding words in a vector space has gained a lot of research attention in recent years. While state-of-the-art methods provide efficient computation of word similarities via a low-dimensional matrix embedding, their motivation is often left unclear. In this paper, we argue that word embedding can be naturally viewed as a ranking problem. Then, based on this insight, we propose a novel framework WordRank that efficiently estimates word representations via robust ranking. The performance of WordRank is measured in word similarity and word analogy benchmarks, and the results are compared to the state-of-the-art word embedding techniques. Our algorithm produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 77.4% accuracy on a popular word similarity benchmark and 76% on the Google word analogy benchmark. WordRank performs especially well on small corpora.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 Jun 2015 03:08:06 GMT  (108kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02761v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 6 Feb 2016 06:02:56 GMT  (71kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02761v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 23 Feb 2016 06:40:14 GMT  (69kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02761v3", null], ["v4", "Tue, 27 Sep 2016 21:11:56 GMT  (69kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02761v4", "Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), November 1-5, 2016, Austin, Texas, USA"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["shihao ji", "hyokun yun", "pinar yanardag", "shin matsushima", "s v n vishwanathan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.02761"}
