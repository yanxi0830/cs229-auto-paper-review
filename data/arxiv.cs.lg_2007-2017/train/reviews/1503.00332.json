However, maximum likelihood estimation of parametric models leads to degenerate trajectories and inferential performance is poor in nonparametric models. We take a small-variance asymptotics (SVA) approach to overcome these limitations. We derive the small-variance asymptotics for parametric and nonparametric MJPs for both directly observed and hidden state models. In the parametric case we obtain a novel objective function which leads to non-degenerate trajectories. To derive the nonparametric version we introduce the gamma-gamma process, a novel extension to the gamma-exponential process. We propose algorithms for each of these formulations, which we call \\emph{JUMP-means}. Our experiments demonstrate that JUMP-means is competitive with or outperforms widely used MJP inference approaches in terms of both speed and reconstruction accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 1 Mar 2015 18:59:12 GMT  (3573kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00332v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 31 May 2015 23:26:53 GMT  (3949kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00332v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 5 Jun 2015 16:11:10 GMT  (3949kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00332v3", "In Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2015)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["jonathan h huggins", "karthik narasimhan", "ardavan saeedi", "vikash k mansinghka"], "accepted": true, "id": "1503.00332"}
