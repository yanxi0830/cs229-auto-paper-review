While providing valuable speed-ups on modern many-core devices in case both a large number of reference and query points are given, buffer k-d trees are limited by the amount of points that can fit on a single device. In this work, we show how to modify the original data structure and the associated workflow to make the overall approach capable of dealing with massive data sets. We further provide a simple yet efficient way of using multiple devices given in a single workstation. The applicability of the modified framework is demonstrated in the context of astronomy, a field that is faced with huge amounts of data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Dec 2015 12:28:12 GMT  (148kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02831v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["fabian gieseke", "cosmin eugen oancea", "ashish mahabal", "christian igel", "tom heskes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.02831"}
