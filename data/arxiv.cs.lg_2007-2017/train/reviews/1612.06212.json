We prove that our model has simple, predicable and non-chaotic dynamics. This stands in stark contrast to more standard gated architectures, whose underlying dynamical systems exhibit chaotic behavior.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Dec 2016 14:59:14 GMT  (684kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.06212v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["thomas laurent", "james von brecht"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.06212"}
