We prove that our algorithm converges in polynomial time to a near-optimal allocation policy; prior results for similar problems in stochastic inventory control guaranteed only asymptotic convergence and examined variants in which each venue could be treated independently. Our analysis bears a strong resemblance to that of efficient exploration/ exploitation schemes in the reinforcement learning literature. We describe an extensive experimental evaluation of our algorithm on the Dark Pool Problem using real trading data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 May 2012 15:16:31 GMT  (241kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2646v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GT", "authors": ["kuzman ganchev", "michael kearns", "yuriy nevmyvaka", "jennifer wortman vaughan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.2646"}
