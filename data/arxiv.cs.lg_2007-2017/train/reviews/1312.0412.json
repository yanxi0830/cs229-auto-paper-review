While the stochastic variational paradigm has successfully been applied to an uncollapsed representation of the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), no attempts to apply this type of inference in a collapsed setting of non-parametric topic modeling have been put forward so far. In this paper we explore such a collapsed stochastic variational Bayes inference for the HDP. The proposed online algorithm is easy to implement and accounts for the inference of hyper-parameters. First experiments show a promising improvement in predictive performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 2 Dec 2013 10:58:01 GMT  (125kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.0412v1", "NIPS Workshop; Topic Models: Computation, Application, and Evaluation"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS Workshop; Topic Models: Computation, Application, and Evaluation", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["arnim bleier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.0412"}
