Most approaches do not consider that the relationships of prerequisites between the skills are fuzzy relationships. In this article, we describe a new approach of a practical application of fuzzy logic techniques to the construction of learning hierarchies. For this, we use a learning hierarchy predefined by one or more experts of a specific field. However, the relationships of prerequisites between the skills in the learning hierarchy are not definitive and they are fuzzy relationships. Indeed, we measure relevance degree of all relationships existing in this learning hierarchy and we try to answer to the following question: Is the relationships of prerequisites predefined in initial learning hierarchy are correctly established or not?", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Dec 2014 18:34:07 GMT  (499kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2689v1", "58-66"]], "COMMENTS": "58-66", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["ali aajli", "karim afdel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.2689"}
