This problem arises in various unsupervised learning scenarios, for example in learning topic models from a corpus of documents spanning several topics. We show how to learn the constituents (the topic distributions and the mixture weights) of a mixture of $k$ (constant) arbitrary distributions over a large discrete domain $[n]={1,2,...,n}$, using $O(n\\polylog n)$ samples.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Dec 2012 04:03:06 GMT  (34kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1527v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 9 Apr 2013 18:41:14 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1527v2", "Update of previous version, which includes aperture and sample-size lower bounds"], ["v3", "Wed, 18 Sep 2013 04:18:49 GMT  (40kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1527v3", "Update of previous version with improved aperture and sample-size lower bounds"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["yuval rabani", "leonard schulman", "chaitanya swamy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.1527"}
