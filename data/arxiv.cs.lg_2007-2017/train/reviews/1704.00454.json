Traditionally, the differential-geometric structure of the probability simplex has been used either by (i) setting the Riemannian metric tensor to the Fisher information matrix of the categorical distributions, or (ii) defining the information-geometric structure induced by a smooth dissimilarity measure, called a divergence. In this paper, we introduce a novel computationally-friendly non-Riemannian framework for modeling the probability simplex: Hilbert simplex geometry. We discuss the pros and cons of those three statistical modelings, and compare them experimentally for clustering tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 07:23:37 GMT  (5820kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00454v1", "18 pages"], ["v2", "Sun, 30 Apr 2017 15:30:07 GMT  (8419kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00454v2", "26 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["frank nielsen", "ke sun"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.00454"}
