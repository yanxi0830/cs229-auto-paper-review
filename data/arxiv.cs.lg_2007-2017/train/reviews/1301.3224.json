{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-Jan-2013", "title": "Efficient Learning of Domain-invariant Image Representations", "abstract": "We present an algorithm that learns representations which explicitly compensate for domain mismatch and which can be efficiently realized as linear classifiers. Specifically, we form a linear transformation that maps features from the target (test) domain to the source (training) domain as part of training the classifier. We optimize both the transformation and classifier parameters jointly, and introduce an efficient cost function based on misclassification loss. Our method combines several features previously unavailable in a single algorithm: multi-class adaptation through representation learning, ability to map across heterogeneous feature spaces, and scalability to large datasets. We present experiments on several image datasets that demonstrate improved accuracy and computational advantages compared to previous approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Jan 2013 04:39:32 GMT  (177kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3224v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 17 Jan 2013 01:36:31 GMT  (179kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3224v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 11 Mar 2013 05:09:12 GMT  (179kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3224v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 17 Mar 2013 19:39:37 GMT  (179kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3224v4", null], ["v5", "Tue, 9 Apr 2013 01:10:49 GMT  (179kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3224v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["judy hoffman", "erik rodner", "jeff donahue", "trevor darrell", "kate saenko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3224"}
