In this paper, we propose an unsupervised label propagation approach for this task. Our approach effectively captures the multimodal semantics of queries and videos using state-of-the-art deep neural networks and creates a summary that is both semantically coherent and visually attractive. We describe the theoretical framework of our graph-based approach and empirically evaluate its effectiveness in creating relevant and attractive trailers. Finally, we showcase example video trailers generated by our system.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Sep 2016 03:35:54 GMT  (864kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01819v1", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["harrie oosterhuis", "sujith ravi", "michael bendersky"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.01819"}
