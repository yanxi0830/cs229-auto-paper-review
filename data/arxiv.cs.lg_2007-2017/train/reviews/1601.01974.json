We achieve adaptiveness to the norms of the loss vectors by scale invariance, i.e., our algorithms make exactly the same decisions if the sequence of loss vectors is multiplied by any positive constant. One of our algorithms works for any decision set, bounded or unbounded. For unbounded decisions sets, this is the first adaptive algorithm for online linear optimization with a non-vacuous regret bound.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Jan 2016 18:47:18 GMT  (27kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01974v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1502.05744"], ["v2", "Wed, 14 Dec 2016 18:32:39 GMT  (27kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.01974v2", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1502.05744"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1502.05744", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["francesco orabona", "d\\'avid p\\'al"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.01974"}
