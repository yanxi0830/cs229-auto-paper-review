In many applications, however, the predictions are used to make decisions that select which observations are made. This makes calibration difficult, as adjusting predictions to achieve calibration changes future data. We focus on click-through-rate (CTR) prediction for search ad auctions. Here, CTR predictions are used by an auction that determines which ads are shown, and we want to maximize the value generated by the auction.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Nov 2012 17:07:33 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.3955v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.GT cs.LG", "authors": ["h brendan mcmahan", "omkar muralidharan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1211.3955"}
