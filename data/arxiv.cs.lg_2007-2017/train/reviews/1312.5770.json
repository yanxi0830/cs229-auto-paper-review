While most work on the subject has concentrated on establishing the soundness of the Additive Noise Model, the statistical consistency of the resulting inference methods has received little attention. We derive general conditions under which the given family of inference methods consistently infers the causal direction in a nonparametric setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Dec 2013 22:15:40 GMT  (55kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5770v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 23 Dec 2013 16:59:04 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5770v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 5 Feb 2014 03:37:30 GMT  (65kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5770v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["samory kpotufe", "eleni sgouritsa", "dominik janzing", "bernhard sch\u00f6lkopf"], "accepted": true, "id": "1312.5770"}
