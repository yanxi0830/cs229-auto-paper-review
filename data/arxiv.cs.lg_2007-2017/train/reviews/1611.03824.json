{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Nov-2016", "title": "Learning to Learn without Gradient Descent by Gradient Descent", "abstract": "We present a learning to learn approach for training recurrent neural networks to perform black-box global optimization. In the meta-learning phase we use a large set of smooth target functions to learn a recurrent neural network (RNN) optimizer, which is either a long-short term memory network or a differentiable neural computer. After learning, the RNN can be applied to learn policies in reinforcement learning, as well as other black-box learning tasks, including continuous correlated bandits and experimental design. We compare this approach to Bayesian optimization, with emphasis on the issues of computation speed, horizon length, and exploration-exploitation trade-offs.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Nov 2016 19:33:01 GMT  (2836kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03824v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 18 Nov 2016 14:13:13 GMT  (2836kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03824v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 21:32:13 GMT  (2836kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03824v3", "Accepted by Deep Reinforcement Learning Workshop, NIPS 2016"], ["v4", "Tue, 9 May 2017 07:59:07 GMT  (658kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03824v4", "Previous version \"Learning to Learn for Global Optimization of Black Box Functions\" was published in the Deep Reinforcement Learning Workshop, NIPS 2016"], ["v5", "Mon, 5 Jun 2017 14:15:01 GMT  (1138kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03824v5", "Accepted by ICML 2017.
