We would like to build a versatile robot that can learn multiple tasks, but using RL for each of them would be prohibitively expensive in terms of both time and wear-and-tear on the robot. To remedy this problem, we use the Policy Gradient Efficient Lifelong Learning Algorithm (PG-ELLA), an online multi-task RL algorithm that enables the robot to efficiently learn multiple consecutive tasks by sharing knowledge between these tasks to accelerate learning and improve performance. We implemented and evaluated three RL methods--Q-learning, policy gradient RL, and PG-ELLA--on a ground robot whose task is to find a target object in an environment under different surface conditions. In this paper, we discuss our implementations as well as present an empirical analysis of their learning performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 29 Nov 2015 04:33:51 GMT  (1976kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08967v1", "7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO", "authors": ["lisa lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.08967"}
