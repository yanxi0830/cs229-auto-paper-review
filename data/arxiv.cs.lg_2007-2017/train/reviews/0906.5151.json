We show that it is possible to reduce unsupervised learning to supervised learning and demonstrate a high-quality unsupervised shift-reduce parsing model. We additionally show a close connection between unsupervised Searn and expectation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of a semi-supervised extension. The key idea that enables this is an application of the predict-self idea for unsupervised learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 Jun 2009 17:47:22 GMT  (66kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0906.5151v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hal daum\u00e9 iii"], "accepted": true, "id": "0906.5151"}
