Such a synthesis problem can be formally defined in SyGuS-IF, a language that is built on top of SMT-LIB.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Nov 2016 03:17:40 GMT  (1336kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.07627v1", "In Proceedings SYNT 2016,arXiv:1611.07178. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1602.01170"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings SYNT 2016,arXiv:1611.07178. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1602.01170", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SE cs.LG cs.LO", "authors": ["rajeev alur", "dana fisman", "rishabh singh", "armando solar-lezama"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.07627"}
