The resulting Hybrid Isolation Forest (HIF) that we propose is first evaluated on a synthetic dataset to analyze the effect of the new meta-parameters that are introduced and verify that the addressed limitation of the IF algorithm is effectively overcame. We hen compare the two algorithms on the ISCX benchmark dataset, in the context of a network intrusion detection application. Our experiments show that HIF outperforms IF, but also challenges the 1-class and 2-classes SVM baselines with computational efficiency.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 May 2017 14:42:30 GMT  (1725kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.03800v1", "24 pages, working paper"]], "COMMENTS": "24 pages, working paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["pierre-fran\\c{c}ois marteau", "saeid soheily-khah", "nicolas b\\'echet"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.03800"}
