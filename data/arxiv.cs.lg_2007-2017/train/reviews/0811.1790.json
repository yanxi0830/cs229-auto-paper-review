It is shown in this paper that the solution to Lasso, in addition to its sparsity, has robustness properties: it is the solution to a robust optimization problem. This has two important consequences. First, robustness provides a connection of the regularizer to a physical property, namely, protection from noise. This allows a principled selection of the regularizer, and in particular, generalizations of Lasso that also yield convex optimization problems are obtained by considering different uncertainty sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Nov 2008 22:46:10 GMT  (91kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1790v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "authors": ["huan xu", "constantine caramanis", "shie mannor"], "accepted": true, "id": "0811.1790"}
