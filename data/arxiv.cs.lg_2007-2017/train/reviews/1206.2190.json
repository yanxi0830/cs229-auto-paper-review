Based on the synchronous belief propagation (BP) algorithm, we first develop a parallel belief propagation (PBP) algorithm on the parallel architecture. Because the extensive communication delay often causes a low efficiency of parallel topic modeling, we further use Zipf's law to reduce the total communication cost in PBP. Extensive experiments on different data sets demonstrate that CE-PBP achieves a higher topic modeling accuracy and reduces more than 80% communication cost than the state-of-the-art parallel Gibbs sampling (PGS) algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Jun 2012 13:00:51 GMT  (1064kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.2190v1", "9 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jian-feng yan", "zhi-qiang liu", "yang gao", "jia zeng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.2190"}
