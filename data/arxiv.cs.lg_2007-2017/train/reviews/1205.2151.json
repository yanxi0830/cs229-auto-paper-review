We specially choose this regularization because it is known that Tikhonov regularized least square (LS) is the more preferable form in solving linear inverse problems than the conventional LS. Because an NMF problem can be decomposed into LS subproblems, it can be expected that Tikhonov regularized NMF will be the more appropriate approach in solving NMF problems. The algorithm is derived using additive update rules which have been shown to have convergence guarantee. We equip the algorithm with a mechanism to automatically determine the regularization parameters based on the L-curve, a well-known concept in the inverse problems community, but is rather unknown in the NMF research. The introduction of this algorithm thus solves two inherent problems in Tikhonov regularized NMF algorithm research, i.e., convergence guarantee and regularization parameters determination.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 May 2012 03:31:39 GMT  (140kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2151v1", "Preliminary result without experimental result"]], "COMMENTS": "Preliminary result without experimental result", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["andri mirzal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.2151"}
