In these environments, agents must learn communication protocols in order to share information that is needed to solve the tasks. By embracing deep neural networks, we are able to demonstrate end-to-end learning of protocols in complex environments inspired by communication riddles and multi-agent computer vision problems with partial observability. We propose two approaches for learning in these domains: Reinforced Inter-Agent Learning (RIAL) and Differentiable Inter-Agent Learning (DIAL). The former uses deep Q-learning, while the latter exploits the fact that, during learning, agents can propagate error derivatives through (noisy) communication channels. Hence, this approach uses centralised learning but decentralised execution. Our experiments introduce new environments for studying the learning of communication protocols and present a set of engineering innovations that are essential for success in these domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 21 May 2016 17:20:04 GMT  (1052kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06676v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 24 May 2016 18:16:56 GMT  (3387kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06676v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.MA", "authors": ["jakob n foerster", "yannis m assael", "nando de freitas", "shimon whiteson"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.06676"}
