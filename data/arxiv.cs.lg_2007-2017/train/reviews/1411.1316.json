Yet, while difficulty and player learning have been explored in the context of games, there has been little work analyzing skill per se, and how it pertains to a player's input. To this end, we present a data set of 476 game logs from over 40 players of a first-person shooter game (Red Eclipse) as a basis of a case study. We then analyze different metrics of skill and show that some of these can be predicted using only a few seconds of keyboard and mouse input. We argue that the techniques used here are useful for adapting games to match players' skill levels rapidly, perhaps more rapidly than solutions based on performance averaging such as TrueSkill.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Nov 2014 16:41:12 GMT  (1242kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1316v1", "16 pages, 28 figures, journal paper submission"], ["v2", "Thu, 6 Nov 2014 13:04:25 GMT  (1437kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1316v2", "16 pages, 28 figures, journal paper submission"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 28 figures, journal paper submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.LG", "authors": ["david buckley", "ke chen", "joshua knowles"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.1316"}
