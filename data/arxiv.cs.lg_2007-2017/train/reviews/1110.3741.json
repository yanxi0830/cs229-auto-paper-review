In most anomaly detection algorithms, the dissimilarity between data samples is calculated by a single criterion. When dissimilarities are calculated by multiple criteria, one might perform anomaly detection using a linear combination of the multiple dissimilarities. If the importance of the different criteria are not known in advance, the algorithm may need to be executed multiple times with different choices of weights in the linear combination, perhaps selected by grid search.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Oct 2011 17:48:22 GMT  (619kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3741v1", "17 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 6 Nov 2012 22:12:52 GMT  (642kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3741v2", "To appear in NIPS 2012"], ["v3", "Mon, 7 Jan 2013 17:18:42 GMT  (642kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.3741v3", "Removed an unnecessary line from Algorithm 1"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.DB stat.ML", "authors": ["ko-jen hsiao", "kevin s xu 0001", "jeff calder", "alfred o hero iii"], "accepted": true, "id": "1110.3741"}
