The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated in a table-top object reaching task where a 7 DoF arm is controlled in velocity mode to reach a blue cuboid in clutter through visual observations. The learned visuo-motor policies are robust to novel (not seen in training) objects in clutter and even a moving target, achieving a 93.3% success rate and 2.2 cm control accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 02:27:02 GMT  (3504kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05746v1", "Under review for the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2018. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1610.06781"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review for the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2018. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1610.06781", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG cs.SY", "authors": ["fangyi zhang", "j\\\"urgen leitner", "michael milford", "peter corke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.05746"}
