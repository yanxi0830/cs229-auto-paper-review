The approach is based on the following two-stage procedure. First, a real-valued function is learned by minimizing a surrogate loss for binary classification, such as logistic loss, on the training sample. Then, a threshold is tuned on a separate validation sample, by direct optimization of AMS. We show that the regret of the resulting (thresholded) classifier measured with respect to the squared AMS, is upperbounded by the regret of the underlying real-valued function measured with respect to the logistic loss. Hence, we prove that minimizing logistic surrogate is a consistent method of optimizing AMS.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Dec 2014 19:28:15 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2106v1", "9 pages, HEPML workshop at NIPS 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, HEPML workshop at NIPS 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["wojciech kot{\\l}owski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.2106"}
