Our experiments show that our approach yields interaction extraction systems that are more robust in environments where there is a significant mismatch between training and test conditions.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Dec 2015 22:58:29 GMT  (356kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01587v1", "Appearing in Proceedings of the Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-16)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appearing in Proceedings of the Thirtieth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-16)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "authors": ["sahil garg", "aram galstyan", "ulf hermjakob", "daniel marcu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.01587"}
