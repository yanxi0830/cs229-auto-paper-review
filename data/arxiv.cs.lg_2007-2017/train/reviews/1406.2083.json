Both these methods have been suggested for high-dimensional problems, and sometimes claimed to be unaffected by increasing dimensionality of the samples. We will show theoretically and practically that the power of both methods (for different reasons) does actually decrease polynomially with dimension. We also analyze the median heuristic, which is a method for choosing tuning parameters of translation invariant kernels. We show that different bandwidth choices could result in the MMD decaying polynomially or even exponentially in dimension.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 Jun 2014 05:59:21 GMT  (96kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2083v1", "15 pages, 7 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 24 Nov 2014 00:23:35 GMT  (97kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2083v2", "19 pages, 9 figures, published in AAAI-15: The 29th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (with author order reversed from ArXiv)"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT math.ST stat.ME stat.TH", "authors": ["aaditya ramdas", "sashank jakkam reddi", "barnab\u00e1s p\u00f3czos", "aarti singh", "larry a wasserman"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.2083"}
