We propose a very natural asymptotic notion of consistency, and show that simple consistent algorithms exist, under most general non-parametric assumptions. The notion of consistency is as follows: two samples should be put into the same cluster if and only if they were generated by the same distribution. With this notion of consistency, clustering generalizes such classical statistical problems as homogeneity testing and process classification. We show that, for the case of a known number of clusters, consistency can be achieved under the only assumption that the joint distribution of the data is stationary ergodic (no parametric or Markovian assumptions, no assumptions of independence, neither between nor within the samples). If the number of clusters is unknown, consistency can be achieved under appropriate assumptions on the mixing rates of the processes. (again, no parametric or independence assumptions). In both cases we give examples of simple (at most quadratic in each argument) algorithms which are consistent.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Apr 2010 06:38:47 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.5194v1", "in proceedings of ICML 2010. arXiv-admin note: for version 2 of this article please see:arXiv:1005.0826v1"]], "COMMENTS": "in proceedings of ICML 2010. arXiv-admin note: for version 2 of this article please see:arXiv:1005.0826v1", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IT math.IT stat.ML", "authors": ["daniil ryabko"], "accepted": true, "id": "1004.5194"}
