Generally book document is multipage document. So it becomes necessary to detect Table of Content page for easy navigation of multipage document and also to make information retrieval faster for desirable data from the multipage document. All the Table of content pages follow the different layout, different way of presenting the contents of the document like chapter, section, subsection etc. This paper introduces a new method to detect Table of content using machine learning technique with different features. With the main aim to detect Table of Content pages is to structure the document according to their contents.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Jun 2013 08:08:22 GMT  (412kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.4631v1", "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Applications, May-2013"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Applications, May-2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DL cs.IR", "authors": ["rachana parikh", "avani r vasant"], "accepted": false, "id": "1306.4631"}
