To the best of our knowledge, this problem has not been addressed yet in the field of recommender system. The prediction of a movie genre has many practical applications including complementing the items categories given by experts and providing a surprise effect in the recommendations given to a user. We employ mulitnomial event model to estimate a likelihood of a movie given genre and the Bayes rule to evaluate the posterior probability of a genre given a movie. Experiments with the MovieLens dataset validate our approach. We achieved 70% prediction rate using only 15% of the whole set for training.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 25 Mar 2016 08:49:39 GMT  (4244kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07849v1", "5 pages, 4 figures, 8th International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing, Hong Kong"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 4 figures, 8th International Conference on Machine Learning and Computing, Hong Kong", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["eric makita", "artem lenskiy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.07849"}
