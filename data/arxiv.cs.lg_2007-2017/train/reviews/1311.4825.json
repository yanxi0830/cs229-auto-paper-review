The upper bounds we derive on the cumulative regret for this generic algorithm improve by an exponential factor the previously known bounds for algorithms like GP-UCB. We also introduce the novel Gaussian Process Mutual Information algorithm (GP-MI), which significantly improves further these upper bounds for the cumulative regret. We confirm the efficiency of this algorithm on synthetic and real tasks against the natural competitor, GP-UCB, and also the Expected Improvement heuristic.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 19 Nov 2013 18:29:19 GMT  (888kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.4825v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 20 May 2014 18:25:19 GMT  (888kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.4825v2", "Proceedings of The 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2014)"], ["v3", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 13:27:19 GMT  (889kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.4825v3", "Proceedings of The 31st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2014)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["emile contal", "vianney perchet", "nicolas vayatis"], "accepted": true, "id": "1311.4825"}
