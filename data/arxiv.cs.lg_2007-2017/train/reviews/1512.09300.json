By combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a generative adversarial network (GAN) we can use learned feature representations in the GAN discriminator as basis for the VAE reconstruction objective. Thereby, we replace element-wise errors with feature-wise errors that better capture the data distribution while offering invariance towards e.g. translation. We apply our method to images of faces and show that our method outperforms VAEs with element-wise similarity measures in terms of visual fidelity. Moreover, we show that our method learns an embedding in which high-level abstract visual features (e.g. wearing glasses) can be modified using simple arithmetic.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 31 Dec 2015 14:53:39 GMT  (1033kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.09300v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 10 Feb 2016 21:18:27 GMT  (1305kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.09300v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML", "authors": ["anders boesen lindbo larsen", "s\u00f8ren kaae s\u00f8nderby", "hugo larochelle", "ole winther"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.09300"}
