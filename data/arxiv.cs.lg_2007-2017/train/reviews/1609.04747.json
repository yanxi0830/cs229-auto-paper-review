This article aims to provide the reader with intuitions with regard to the behaviour of different algorithms that will allow her to put them to use. In the course of this overview, we look at different variants of gradient descent, summarize challenges, introduce the most common optimization algorithms, review architectures in a parallel and distributed setting, and investigate additional strategies for optimizing gradient descent.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Sep 2016 17:32:34 GMT  (2226kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04747v1", "12 pages, 6 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 13:21:04 GMT  (7304kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.04747v2", "Added derivations of AdaMax and Nadam"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["sebastian ruder"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.04747"}
