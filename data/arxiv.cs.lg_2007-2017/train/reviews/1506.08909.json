This provides a unique resource for research into building dialogue managers based on neural language models that can make use of large amounts of unlabeled data. The dataset has both the multi-turn property of conversations in the Dialog State Tracking Challenge datasets, and the unstructured nature of interactions from microblog services such as Twitter. We also describe two neural learning architectures suitable for analyzing this dataset, and provide benchmark performance on the task of selecting the best next response.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Jun 2015 00:37:09 GMT  (1018kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08909v1", "Accepted as a conference submission to SIGDIAL 2015. 10 pages, 5 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 21 Jul 2015 16:11:29 GMT  (1019kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08909v2", "Accepted as a conference submission to SIGDIAL 2015. 10 pages, 5 figures.
