Our goal is to maintain the high accuracy of these learning algorithms while reducing the degree to which they discriminate against individuals because of their membership in a protected group.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 Jan 2016 19:48:07 GMT  (122kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05764v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CY", "authors": ["benjamin fish", "jeremy kun", "\\'ad\\'am d lelkes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.05764"}
