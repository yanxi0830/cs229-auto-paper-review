We suggest improvements to the existing C4.5 decision tree algorithm. In this paper attribute oriented induction (AOI) and relevance analysis are incorporated with concept hierarchys knowledge and HeightBalancePriority algorithm for construction of decision tree along with Multi level mining. The assignment of priorities to attributes is done by evaluating information entropy, at different levels of abstraction for building decision tree using HeightBalancePriority algorithm. Modified DMQL queries are used to understand and explore the shortcomings of the decision trees generated by C4.5 classifier for education dataset and the results are compared with the proposed approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Feb 2013 10:29:17 GMT  (528kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2436v1", "15 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, International Journal of Information Sciences and Techniques (IJIST) Vol.3, No.1, January 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, International Journal of Information Sciences and Techniques (IJIST) Vol.3, No.1, January 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["mohd mahmood ali", "mohd s qaseem", "lakshmi rajamani", "a govardhan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.2436"}
