Unfortunately, many of these matrix operations so time and memory expensive that they are prohibitive when the scale of data is large. In real-world applications, since the data themselves are noisy, machine-precision matrix operations are not necessary at all, and one can sacrifice a reasonable amount of accuracy for computational efficiency.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 28 May 2015 07:33:21 GMT  (393kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07570v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 3 Jun 2015 14:33:48 GMT  (394kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07570v2", null], ["v3", "Sun, 7 Jun 2015 07:52:43 GMT  (399kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07570v3", null], ["v4", "Wed, 29 Jul 2015 09:26:48 GMT  (399kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07570v4", null], ["v5", "Mon, 17 Aug 2015 06:39:40 GMT  (399kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07570v5", null], ["v6", "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 03:26:49 GMT  (832kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07570v6", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MS cs.LG", "authors": ["shusen wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.07570"}
