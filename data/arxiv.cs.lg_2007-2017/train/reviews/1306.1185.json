{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "5-Jun-2013", "title": "Multiclass Total Variation Clustering", "abstract": "Ideas from the image processing literature have recently motivated a new set of clustering algorithms that rely on the concept of total variation. While these algorithms perform well for bi-partitioning tasks, their recursive extensions yield unimpressive results for multiclass clustering tasks. This paper presents a general framework for multiclass total variation clustering that does not rely on recursion. The results greatly outperform previous total variation algorithms and compare well with state-of-the-art NMF approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Jun 2013 17:42:57 GMT  (47kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.1185v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG math.OC", "authors": ["xavier bresson", "thomas laurent 0001", "david uminsky", "james h von brecht"], "accepted": true, "id": "1306.1185"}
