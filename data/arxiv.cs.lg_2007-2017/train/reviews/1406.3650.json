In Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI), the inference problem is mapped to an optimization problem involving stochastic gradients. While this scheme was shown to scale up to massive data sets, the intrinsic noise of the stochastic gradients impedes a fast convergence. Inspired by gradient averaging methods from stochastic optimization, we propose a variance reduction scheme tailored to SVI by averaging successively over the sufficient statistics of the local variational parameters. Its simplicity comes at the cost of biased stochastic gradients. We show that we can eliminate large parts of the bias while obtaining the same variance reduction as in simple gradient averaging schemes. We explore the tradeoff between variance and bias based on the example of Latent Dirichlet Allocation.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Jun 2014 21:19:09 GMT  (487kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3650v1", "8 pages, 6 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 18 Nov 2014 03:12:37 GMT  (812kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3650v2", "Appears in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["stephan mandt", "david m blei"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.3650"}
