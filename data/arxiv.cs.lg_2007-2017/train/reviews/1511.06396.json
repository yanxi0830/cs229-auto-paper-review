In previous work, textual patterns are parametrized as a single embedding, preventing generalization to unseen textual patterns. In this paper we employ an LSTM to compositionally capture the semantics of relational text. We dramatically demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by evaluating in a multilingual setting, in which the English training data entities overlap with the seed KB, but the Spanish text does not. Additional improvements are obtained by tying word embeddings across languages. In extensive experiments on the English and Spanish TAC KBP benchmark, our techniques provide substantial accuracy improvements. Furthermore we find that training with the additional non-overlapping Spanish also improves English relation extraction accuracy. Our approach is thus suited to broad-coverage automated knowledge base construction in low-resource domains and languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 21:42:23 GMT  (36kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06396v1", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v2", "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 20:28:36 GMT  (313kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06396v2", "Accepted to NAACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["patrick verga", "david belanger", "emma strubell", "benjamin roth", "andrew mccallum"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.06396"}
