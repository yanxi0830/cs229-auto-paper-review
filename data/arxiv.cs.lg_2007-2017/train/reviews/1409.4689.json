In this paper, we connect the performance of Sparse Filtering in image classification pipelines to spectral properties of the corresponding feature matrices. This connection provides new insights into Sparse Filtering; in particular, it suggests stopping Sparse Filtering early. We therefore introduce the Optimal Roundness Criterion (ORC), a novel stopping criterion for Sparse Filtering. We show that this stopping criterion is related with pre-processing procedures such as Statistical Whitening and that it can make image classification with Sparse Filtering considerably faster and more accurate.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Sep 2014 16:31:07 GMT  (172kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4689v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 24 May 2015 09:16:03 GMT  (697kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4689v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["johannes lederer", "sergio guadarrama"], "accepted": true, "id": "1409.4689"}
