We are mainly concerned with two theoretical questions: 1) under what conditions does RMTL perform better with a smaller task sample size than STL? 2) under what conditions is RMTL generalizable and can guarantee the consistency of each task during simultaneous learning?", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 28 Aug 2014 03:27:27 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6617v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["chao zhang", "dacheng tao", "tao hu", "xiang li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1408.6617"}
