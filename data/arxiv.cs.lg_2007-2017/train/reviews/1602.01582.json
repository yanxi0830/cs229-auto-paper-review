We describe variants of SDCA that do not require explicit regularization and do not rely on duality. We prove linear convergence rates even if individual loss functions are non-convex, as long as the expected loss is strongly convex.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Feb 2016 08:14:06 GMT  (11kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01582v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 21 May 2016 12:33:05 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01582v2", "ICML 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["shai shalev-shwartz"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.01582"}
