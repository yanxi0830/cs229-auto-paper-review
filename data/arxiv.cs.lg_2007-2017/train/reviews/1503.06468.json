In this approach, machine learning algorithms are used to classify measurements as being either secure or attacked. An attack detection framework is provided to exploit any available prior knowledge about the system and surmount constraints arising from the sparse structure of the problem in the proposed approach. Well-known batch and online learning algorithms (supervised and semi-supervised) are employed with decision and feature level fusion to model the attack detection problem. The relationships between statistical and geometric properties of attack vectors employed in the attack scenarios and learning algorithms are analyzed to detect unobservable attacks using statistical learning methods. The proposed algorithms are examined on various IEEE test systems. Experimental analyses show that machine learning algorithms can detect attacks with performances higher than the attack detection algorithms which employ state vector estimation methods in the proposed attack detection framework.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 Mar 2015 19:38:45 GMT  (1962kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06468v1", "14 pages, 11 Figures"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 11 Figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR cs.SY", "authors": ["mete ozay", "inaki esnaola", "fatos t yarman vural", "sanjeev r kulkarni", "h vincent poor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.06468"}
