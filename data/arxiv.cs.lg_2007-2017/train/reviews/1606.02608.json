The approach follows state-of-the-art work on online density estimation, but was redesigned with computational efficiency, numerical robustness, and extensibility in mind. Our approach produces comparable or better results than the current state-of-the-art, while achieving significant computational performance gains and improved numerical stability. The use of diagonal covariance Gaussian kernels, which further improve performance and stability, at a small loss of modelling quality, is also explored. Our approach is up to 40 times faster, while requiring 90\\% less memory than the closest state-of-the-art counterpart.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 15:39:17 GMT  (92kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02608v1", "17 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables, submission to Pattern Recognition Letters, review version"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables, submission to Pattern Recognition Letters, review version", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["jaime ferreira", "david martins de matos", "ricardo ribeiro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.02608"}
