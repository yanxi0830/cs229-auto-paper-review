We first describe the basic CF-NADE model for CF tasks. Then we propose to improve the model by sharing parameters between different ratings. A factored version of CF-NADE is also proposed for better scalability. Furthermore, we take the ordinal nature of the preferences into consideration and propose an ordinal cost to optimize CF-NADE, which shows superior performance. Finally, CF-NADE can be extended to a deep model, with only moderately increased computational complexity. Experimental results show that CF-NADE with a single hidden layer beats all previous state-of-the-art methods on MovieLens 1M, MovieLens 10M, and Netflix datasets, and adding more hidden layers can further improve the performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 May 2016 03:07:06 GMT  (282kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09477v1", "Accepted by ICML2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by ICML2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["yin zheng", "bangsheng tang", "wenkui ding", "hanning zhou"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.09477"}
