Swapout samples from a rich set of architectures including dropout, stochastic depth and residual architectures as special cases. When viewed as a regularization method swapout not only inhibits co-adaptation of units in a layer, similar to dropout, but also across network layers. We conjecture that swapout achieves strong regularization by implicitly tying the parameters across layers. When viewed as an ensemble training method, it samples a much richer set of architectures than existing methods such as dropout or stochastic depth. We propose a parameterization that reveals connections to exiting architectures and suggests a much richer set of architectures to be explored. We show that our formulation suggests an efficient training method and validate our conclusions on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 matching state of the art accuracy. Remarkably, our 32 layer wider model performs similar to a 1001 layer ResNet model.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 May 2016 18:39:33 GMT  (206kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06465v1", "Submitted to NIPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to NIPS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["saurabh singh", "derek hoiem", "david a forsyth"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.06465"}
