We propose two heuristic search algorithms to minimize J for a continuum of $\\lambda$-values, yielding a sequence of coarse to fine approximations. Continuation Single Best Replacement is a bidirectional greedy algorithm adapted from the Single Best Replacement algorithm previously proposed for minimizing J for fixed $\\lambda$. $\\ell_0$ regularization path track is a more complex algorithm exploiting that the $\\ell_2$-$\\ell_0$ regularization path is piecewise constant with respect to $\\lambda$. Tracking the $\\ell_0$ regularization path is done in a sub-optimal manner by maintaining (i) a list of subsets that are candidates to be solution supports for decreasing $\\lambda$'s and (ii) the list of critical $\\lambda$-values around which the solution changes. Both algorithms gradually construct the $\\ell_0$ regularization path by performing single replacements, i.e., adding or removing a dictionary atom from a subset. A straightforward adaptation of these algorithms yields sub-optimal solutions to $\\min_x \\|y-Ax\\|_2^2$ subject to $\\|x\\|_0\\leq k$ for contiguous values of $k\\geq 0$ and to $\\min_x \\|x\\|_0$ subject to $\\|y-Ax\\|_2^2\\leq\\varepsilon$ for continuous values of $\\varepsilon$. Numerical simulations show the effectiveness of the algorithms on a difficult sparse deconvolution problem inducing a highly correlated dictionary A.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 31 Jan 2014 22:26:17 GMT  (723kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4802v1", "28 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Mar 2015 16:37:16 GMT  (183kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4802v2", "38 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "28 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NA cs.LG", "authors": ["charles soussen", "j\\'er\\^ome idier", "junbo duan", "david brie"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.4802"}
