Important recent results show that the problem can be solved efficiently under the assumption that the unknown matrix is incoherent and the subsample is drawn uniformly at random. Are these assumptions necessary?", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Feb 2014 23:43:11 GMT  (24kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2331v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 10 Apr 2014 07:30:37 GMT  (27kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2331v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CC cs.LG", "authors": ["moritz hardt", "raghu meka", "prasad raghavendra", "benjamin weitz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.2331"}
