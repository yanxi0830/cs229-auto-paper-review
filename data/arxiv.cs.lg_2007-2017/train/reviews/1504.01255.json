We prove its usefulness in supervised learning under certain conditions. The result explains the effectiveness of some existing methods such as word embedding. Based on this theory, we propose a new semi-supervised learning framework that learns a multi-view embedding of small text regions with convolutional neural networks. The method derived from this framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on sentiment classification and topic categorization.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Apr 2015 10:42:07 GMT  (251kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01255v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 24 Sep 2015 11:32:44 GMT  (184kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.01255v2", "The older version has a different title, and the results there are obsolete.
