These systems help users find relevant information, recommendations, and their preferred items. Matrix Factorization is a popular method in Recommendation Systems showing promising results in accuracy and complexity. In this paper we propose an extension of matrix factorization that uses the clustering paradigm to cluster similar users and items in several communities. We then establish their effects on the prediction model then. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed model outperforms all other published recommender methods in accuracy and complexity. For instance, our proposed method's accuracy is 0.8122 on the Netflix dataset which is better than the Netflix prize winner's accuracy of 0.8567.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 28 Jan 2013 20:01:57 GMT  (202kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6659v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 8 Feb 2013 22:16:44 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6659v2", "This paper has been withdrawn by the authors.
