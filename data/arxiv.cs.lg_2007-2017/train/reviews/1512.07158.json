In fact, security researchers have shown that sparse microdata containing information about online activities of a user although anonymous, can still be used to disclose the identity of the user by cross-referencing the data with other data sources. To preserve the privacy of a user, in existing works several methods (k-anonymity, l-diversity, differential privacy) are proposed that ensure a dataset which is meant to share or publish bears small identity disclosure risk. However, the majority of these methods modify the data in isolation, without considering their utility in subsequent knowledge discovery tasks, which makes these datasets less informative. In this work, we consider labeled data that are generally used for classification, and propose two methods for feature selection considering two goals: first, on the reduced feature set the data has small disclosure risk, and second, the utility of the data is preserved for performing a classification task. Experimental results on various real-world datasets show that the method is effective and useful in practice.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Dec 2015 17:06:01 GMT  (47kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07158v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 13 Feb 2016 03:05:36 GMT  (54kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07158v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 19 Feb 2016 02:01:57 GMT  (54kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07158v3", null], ["v4", "Thu, 17 Mar 2016 02:30:33 GMT  (55kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07158v4", null], ["v5", "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 01:05:59 GMT  (35kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07158v5", null], ["v6", "Tue, 31 Jan 2017 15:47:47 GMT  (202kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07158v6", "Transactions on Data Privacy 2017"], ["v7", "Mon, 6 Feb 2017 01:14:37 GMT  (201kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07158v7", "Transactions on Data Privacy 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR", "authors": ["baichuan zhang", "noman mohammed", "vachik dave", "mohammad al hasan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.07158"}
