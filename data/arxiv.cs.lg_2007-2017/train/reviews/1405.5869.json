Our proposal is also the first hashing algorithm for searching with (un-normalized) inner product as the underlying similarity measure. Finding hashing schemes for MIPS was considered hard. We formally show that the existing Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) framework is insufficient for solving MIPS, and then we extend the existing LSH framework to allow asymmetric hashing schemes. Our proposal is based on an interesting mathematical phenomenon in which inner products, after independent asymmetric transformations, can be converted into the problem of approximate near neighbor search. This key observation makes efficient sublinear hashing scheme for MIPS possible. In the extended asymmetric LSH (ALSH) framework, we provide an explicit construction of provably fast hashing scheme for MIPS. The proposed construction and the extended LSH framework could be of independent theoretical interest. Our proposed algorithm is simple and easy to implement. We evaluate the method, for retrieving inner products, in the collaborative filtering task of item recommendations on Netflix and Movielens datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 May 2014 19:42:57 GMT  (379kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5869v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.DS cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["anshumali shrivastava", "ping li 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1405.5869"}
