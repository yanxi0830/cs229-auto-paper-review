The coordinates of the centers of clusters have been put in correspondence with summarizing time series data the centroids of the clusters. A description of time series, the centroids of the clusters, is implemented with the use of forecasting models. They are based on strict binary trees and a modified clonal selection algorithm. With the help of such forecasting models, the possibility of forming analytic dependences is shown. It is suggested to use a common forecasting model, which is constructed for time series the centroid of the cluster, in forecasting the private (individual) time series in the cluster. The promising application of the suggested method for grouped time series forecasting is demonstrated.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Sep 2015 17:15:08 GMT  (784kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.04705v1", "18 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["n n astakhova", "l a demidova", "e v nikulchev"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.04705"}
