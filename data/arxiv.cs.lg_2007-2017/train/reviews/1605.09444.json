The current signal corresponding to one-fourth of the post fault cycle is used as input to proposed modular LS-SVM classifier. The proposed scheme uses four binary classifier; three for selection of three phases and fourth for ground detection. The proposed classification scheme is found to be accurate and reliable in presence of noise as well. The simulation results validate the efficacy of proposed scheme for accurate classification of fault in a series compensated transmission line.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 May 2016 23:11:00 GMT  (366kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09444v1", "5 Pages, 6 Figures, 3 Tables"]], "COMMENTS": "5 Pages, 6 Figures, 3 Tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SY cs.LG", "authors": ["harishchandra dubey", "a k tiwari", "nandita", "p k ray", "s r mohanty", "nand kishor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.09444"}
