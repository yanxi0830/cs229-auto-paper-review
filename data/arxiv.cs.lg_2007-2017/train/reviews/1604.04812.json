A new sparsity function is imposed on the extracted featuremap to capture the structure and shape of the learned object, extracting interpretable features to improve the prediction performance. The proposed algorithm is based on organizing the activation within and across featuremap by constraining the node activities through $\\ell_{2}$ and $\\ell_{1}$ normalization in a structured form.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 17 Apr 2016 00:26:57 GMT  (7747kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04812v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 17:40:29 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04812v2", "The paper need some improvements"], ["v3", "Mon, 2 Jan 2017 18:33:43 GMT  (7747kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04812v3", "The paper need some improvements"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["ehsan hosseini-asl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.04812"}
