{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-Jul-2015", "title": "Combinatorial Cascading Bandits", "abstract": "We consider learning to maximize reward in combinatorial cascading bandits, a new learning setting that unifies cascading and combinatorial bandits. The unification of these frameworks presents unique challenges in the analysis but allows for modeling a rich set of partial monitoring problems, such as learning to route in a communication network to minimize the probability of losing routed packets and recommending diverse items. We propose CombCascade, a computationally-efficient UCB-like algorithm for solving our problem; and derive gap-dependent and gap-free upper bounds on its regret. Our analysis builds on recent results in stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits but also addresses two novel challenges of our learning setting, a non-linear objective and partial observability. We evaluate CombCascade on two real-world problems and demonstrate that it performs well even when our modeling assumptions are violated. We also demonstrate that our setting requires new learning algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jul 2015 13:30:46 GMT  (90kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04208v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 2 Nov 2015 19:34:21 GMT  (87kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04208v2", "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28"], ["v3", "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 20:27:44 GMT  (87kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04208v3", "Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["branislav kveton", "zheng wen", "azin ashkan", "csaba szepesv\u00e1ri"], "accepted": true, "id": "1507.04208"}
