While various methods have been proposed to speed up their convergence, the model selection phase is often ignored. In fact, in theoretical works most of the time assumptions are made, for example, on the prior knowledge of the norm of the optimal solution, while in the practical world validation methods remain the only viable approach. In this paper, we propose a new kernel-based stochastic gradient descent algorithm that performs model selection while training, with no parameters to tune, nor any form of cross-validation. The algorithm builds on recent advancement in online learning theory for unconstrained settings, to estimate over time the right regularization in a data-dependent way. Optimal rates of convergence are proved under standard smoothness assumptions on the target function, using the range space of the fractional integral operator associated with the kernel.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 Jun 2014 13:34:27 GMT  (139kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3816v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["francesco orabona"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.3816"}
