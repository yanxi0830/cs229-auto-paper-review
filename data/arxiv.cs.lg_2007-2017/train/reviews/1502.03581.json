Neural Network based technologies have high ability of adaption as well as generalization. As per our knowledge, very little work has been done in this field using neural network. We present this paper to fill this gap. This paper evaluates performance of three supervised learning algorithms of artificial neural network by creating classifiers for the complex problem of latest web spam pattern classification. These algorithms are Conjugate Gradient algorithm, Resilient Backpropagation learning, and Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Feb 2015 09:58:23 GMT  (364kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03581v1", "10 Pages in Advanced Computational Intelligence: An International Journal (ACII), Vol.2, No.1, January 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "10 Pages in Advanced Computational Intelligence: An International Journal (ACII), Vol.2, No.1, January 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["ashish chandra", "mohammad suaib", "dr rizwan beg"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.03581"}
