{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "14-Jun-2016", "title": "DeepMath - Deep Sequence Models for Premise Selection", "abstract": "We study the effectiveness of neural sequence models for premise selection in automated theorem proving, one of the main bottlenecks in the formalization of mathematics. We propose a two stage approach for this task that yields good results for the premise selection task on the Mizar corpus while avoiding the hand-engineered features of existing state-of-the-art models. To our knowledge, this is the first time deep learning has been applied to theorem proving.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 16:27:41 GMT  (904kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04442v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 26 Jan 2017 19:35:16 GMT  (1067kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04442v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.LO", "authors": ["geoffrey irving", "christian szegedy", "alexander a alemi", "niklas e\u00e9n", "fran\u00e7ois chollet", "josef urban"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.04442"}
