{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "5-Mar-2017", "title": "LR-GAN: Layered Recursive Generative Adversarial Networks for Image Generation", "abstract": "We present LR-GAN: an adversarial image generation model which takes scene structure and context into account. Unlike previous generative adversarial networks (GANs), the proposed GAN learns to generate image background and foregrounds separately and recursively, and stitch the foregrounds on the background in a contextually relevant manner to produce a complete natural image. For each foreground, the model learns to generate its appearance, shape and pose. The whole model is unsupervised, and is trained in an end-to-end manner with gradient descent methods. The experiments demonstrate that LR-GAN can generate more natural images with objects that are more human recognizable than DCGAN.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 5 Mar 2017 05:17:56 GMT  (7175kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01560v1", "21 pages, 22 figures, published as conference paper at ICLR 2017"], ["v2", "Sat, 1 Jul 2017 10:30:54 GMT  (7378kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01560v2", "21 pages, 22 figures, published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017, code available"], ["v3", "Wed, 2 Aug 2017 03:51:57 GMT  (7378kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01560v3", "21 pages, 22 figures, published as a conference paper at ICLR 2017, code available on GitHub"]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages, 22 figures, published as conference paper at ICLR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["jianwei yang", "anitha kannan", "dhruv batra", "devi parikh"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.01560"}
