MKL formulations have been devised and solved for a broad spectrum of machine learning problems, including Multi-Task Learning (MTL). Solving different MKL formulations usually involves designing algorithms that are tailored to the problem at hand, which is, typically, a non-trivial accomplishment.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Jan 2014 01:16:44 GMT  (51kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.5136v1", "17 pages, 1 figure.
