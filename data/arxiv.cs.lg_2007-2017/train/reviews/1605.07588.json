We characterize a large class of loss functions that allows to naturally embed structured outputs in a linear space. We exploit this fact to design learning algorithms using a surrogate loss approach and regularization techniques. We prove universal consistency and finite sample bounds characterizing the generalization properties of the proposed methods. Experimental results are provided to demonstrate the practical usefulness of the proposed approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 May 2016 19:06:43 GMT  (528kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07588v1", "39 pages, 2 Tables, 1 Figure"], ["v2", "Thu, 26 May 2016 15:55:37 GMT  (528kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07588v2", "39 pages, 2 Tables, 1 Figure"], ["v3", "Fri, 28 Jul 2017 09:36:05 GMT  (528kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07588v3", "39 pages, 2 Tables, 1 Figure"]], "COMMENTS": "39 pages, 2 Tables, 1 Figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["carlo ciliberto", "lorenzo rosasco", "alessandro rudi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.07588"}
