From Groups to Individuals using Fuzzy C Means Clustering", "abstract": "Changes in the UK electricity market mean that domestic users will be required to modify their usage behaviour in order that supplies can be maintained. Clustering allows usage profiles collected at the household level to be clustered into groups and assigned a stereotypical profile which can be used to target marketing campaigns. Fuzzy C Means clustering extends this by allowing each household to be a member of many groups and hence provides the opportunity to make personalised offers to the household dependent on their degree of membership of each group. In addition, feedback can be provided on how user's changing behaviour is moving them towards more \"green\" or cost effective stereotypical usage.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Jul 2013 15:55:33 GMT  (282kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1385v1", "Digital Engagement 11, Newcastle, November 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "Digital Engagement 11, Newcastle, November 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CE cs.LG", "authors": ["ian dent", "christian wagner", "uwe aickelin", "tom rodden"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.1385"}
