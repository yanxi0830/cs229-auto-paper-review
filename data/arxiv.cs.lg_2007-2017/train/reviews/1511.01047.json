Samples may only be weakly atypical individually, whereas they may be strongly atypical when considered jointly. What makes this group anomaly detection problem quite challenging is that it is a priori unknown which subset of features jointly manifests a particular group of anomalies. Moreover, it is unknown how many anomalous groups are present in a given data batch. In this work, we develop a group anomaly detection (GAD) scheme to identify the subset of samples and subset of features that jointly specify an anomalous cluster. We apply our approach to network intrusion detection to detect BotNet and peer-to-peer flow clusters. Unlike previous studies, our approach captures and exploits statistical dependencies that may exist between the measured features. Experiments on real world network traffic data demonstrate the advantage of our proposed system, and highlight the importance of exploiting feature dependency structure, compared to the feature (or test) independence assumption made in previous studies.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Jun 2015 15:13:59 GMT  (85kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01047v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["zhicong qiu", "david j miller", "george kesidis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.01047"}
