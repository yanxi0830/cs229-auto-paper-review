The cumulative path is a combination of the previous steps realized by the algorithm, where the importance of each step decreases with time. This article studies the CSA-ES on composites of strictly increasing with affine linear functions through the investigation of its underlying Markov chains. Rigorous results on the change and the variation of the step size are derived with and without cumulation. The step-size diverges geometrically fast in most cases. Furthermore, the influence of the cumulation parameter is studied.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Jun 2012 13:03:31 GMT  (171kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1208v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 29 Jun 2012 18:56:20 GMT  (157kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1208v2", "Parallel Problem Solving From Nature (2012)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["alexandre adrien chotard", "anne auger", "nikolaus hansen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.1208"}
