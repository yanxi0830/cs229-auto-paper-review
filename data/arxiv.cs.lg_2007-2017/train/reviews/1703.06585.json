Specifically, we pose a cooperative 'image guessing' game between two agents -- Qbot and Abot -- who communicate in natural language dialog so that Qbot can select an unseen image from a lineup of images. We use deep reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the policies of these agents end-to-end -- from pixels to multi-agent multi-round dialog to game reward.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Mar 2017 03:50:57 GMT  (5750kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06585v1", "11 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, webpage:this http URL"], ["v2", "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 17:41:23 GMT  (5750kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06585v2", "11 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, webpage:this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, webpage:this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["abhishek das", "satwik kottur", "jos\\'e m f moura", "stefan lee", "dhruv batra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06585"}
