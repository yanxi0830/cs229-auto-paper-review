Using the MNIST set of handwritten digits and Restricted Boltzmann Machines, it is possible to reach a classification performance competitive to semi-supervised learning if we first train a model in an unsupervised fashion on unlabeled data only, and then manually add labels to model samples instead of training data samples with the help of a GUI. This approach can benefit from the fact that model samples can be presented to the human labeler in a video-like fashion, resulting in a higher number of labeled examples. Also, after some initial training, hard-to-classify examples can be distinguished from easy ones automatically, saving manual work.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Sep 2015 12:13:37 GMT  (144kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01053v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["malte probst", "franz rothlauf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.01053"}
