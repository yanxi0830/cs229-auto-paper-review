Most of the existing work do pure feature engineering and extract a lot of session-style features and then train a ranking model. Here we proposed a novel way to model both long term and short term user behavior using Multi-armed bandit algorithm. Our algorithm can generalize session information across users well, and as an Explore-Exploit style algorithm, it can generalize to new urls and new users well. Experiments show that our algorithm can improve performance over the default ranking and outperforms several popular Multi-armed bandit algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Feb 2015 22:37:37 GMT  (112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01057v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["li zhou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.01057"}
