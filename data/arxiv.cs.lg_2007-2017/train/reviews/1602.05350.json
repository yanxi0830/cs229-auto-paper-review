The norm in this space describes a distance, which we call the kernel distance. The random Fourier features (of Rahimi and Recht) describe an oblivious approximate mapping into finite dimensional Euclidean space that behaves similar to the RKHS. We show in this paper that for the Gaussian kernel the Euclidean norm between these mapped to features has $(1+\\epsilon)$-relative error with respect to the kernel distance. When there are $n$ data points, we show that $O((1/\\epsilon^2) \\log(n))$ dimensions of the approximate feature space are sufficient and necessary.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Feb 2016 09:35:08 GMT  (643kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05350v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 20 Sep 2016 17:13:17 GMT  (714kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05350v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["di chen", "jeff m phillips"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.05350"}
