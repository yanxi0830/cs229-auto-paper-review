We combine and compare three models, Neural Machine Translation, Neural Turing Machine, and Memory Networks for a simulated QA data set. This paper is the first one that uses Neural Machine Translation and Neural Turing Machines for solving QA tasks. Our results suggest that the combination of attention and memory have potential to solve certain QA problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Oct 2015 16:03:27 GMT  (215kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07526v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 16:56:48 GMT  (215kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07526v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 15:36:56 GMT  (231kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07526v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["yang yu", "wei zhang", "chung-wei hang", "bing xiang", "bowen zhou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.07526"}
