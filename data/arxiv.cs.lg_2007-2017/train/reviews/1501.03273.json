{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "14-Jan-2015", "title": "Classification with Low Rank and Missing Data", "abstract": "We consider classification and regression tasks where we have missing data and assume that the (clean) data resides in a low rank subspace. Finding a hidden subspace is known to be computationally hard. Nevertheless, using a non-proper formulation we give an efficient agnostic algorithm that classifies as good as the best linear classifier coupled with the best low-dimensional subspace in which the data resides. A direct implication is that our algorithm can linearly (and non-linearly through kernels) classify provably as well as the best classifier that has access to the full data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Jan 2015 08:16:50 GMT  (38kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03273v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["elad hazan", "roi livni", "yishay mansour"], "accepted": true, "id": "1501.03273"}
