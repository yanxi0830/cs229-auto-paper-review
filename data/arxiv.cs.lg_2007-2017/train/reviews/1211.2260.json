Existing algorithms fail to achieve sub-linear regret in this setting unless constraints on the comparator point x^* are known in advance. We present algorithms that, without such prior knowledge, offer near-optimal regret bounds with respect to any choice of x^*. In particular, regret with respect to x^* = 0 is constant. We then prove lower bounds showing that our guarantees are near-optimal in this setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Nov 2012 22:13:10 GMT  (25kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2260v1", "To appear"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["matthew j streeter", "h brendan mcmahan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1211.2260"}
