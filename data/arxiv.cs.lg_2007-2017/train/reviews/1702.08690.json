However, collecting and labeling so much data might be infeasible in many cases. In this paper, we introduce a source-target selective joint fine-tuning scheme for improving the performance of deep learning tasks with insufficient training data. In this scheme, a target learning task with insufficient training data is carried out simultaneously with another source learning task with abundant training data. However, the source learning task does not use all existing training data. Our core idea is to identify and use a subset of training images from the original source learning task whose low-level characteristics are similar to those from the target learning task, and jointly fine-tune shared convolutional layers for both tasks. Specifically, we compute descriptors from linear or nonlinear filter bank responses on training images from both tasks, and use such descriptors to search for a desired subset of training samples for the source learning task.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 08:40:44 GMT  (1310kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08690v1", "To appear in 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2017)"], ["v2", "Tue, 6 Jun 2017 11:51:03 GMT  (1264kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08690v2", "To appear in 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2017)"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in 2017 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR 2017)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["weifeng ge", "yizhou yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08690"}
