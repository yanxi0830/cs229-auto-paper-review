{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "25-Sep-2014", "title": "A Boosting Framework on Grounds of Online Learning", "abstract": "By exploiting the duality between boosting and online learning, we present a boosting framework which proves to be extremely powerful thanks to employing the vast knowledge available in the online learning area. Using this framework, we develop various algorithms to address multiple practically and theoretically interesting questions including sparse boosting, smooth-distribution boosting, agnostic learning and some generalization to double-projection online learning algorithms, as a by-product.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Sep 2014 10:02:01 GMT  (21kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7202v1", "Accepted in NIPS 2014"], ["v2", "Mon, 3 Nov 2014 11:05:29 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7202v2", "Accepted in NIPS 2014"], ["v3", "Sun, 23 Nov 2014 14:46:24 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7202v3", "Accepted in NIPS 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted in NIPS 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["tofigh naghibi mohamadpoor", "beat pfister"], "accepted": true, "id": "1409.7202"}
