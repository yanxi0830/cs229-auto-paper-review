{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Nov-2012", "title": "Random Utility Theory for Social Choice", "abstract": "Random utility theory models an agent's preferences on alternatives by drawing a real-valued score on each alternative (typically independently) from a parameterized distribution, and then ranking the alternatives according to scores. A special case that has received significant attention is the Plackett-Luce model, for which fast inference methods for maximum likelihood estimators are available. This paper develops conditions on general random utility models that enable fast inference within a Bayesian framework through MC-EM, providing concave loglikelihood functions and bounded sets of global maxima solutions. Results on both real-world and simulated data provide support for the scalability of the approach and capability for model selection among general random utility models including Plackett-Luce.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 11 Nov 2012 23:09:02 GMT  (2140kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2476v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MA cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["hossein azari soufiani", "david c parkes", "lirong xia"], "accepted": true, "id": "1211.2476"}
