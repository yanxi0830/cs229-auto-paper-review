These are two fundamental problems in data analysis and scientific computing with numerous applications in machine learning and statistics (Shi and Malik, 2000; Hardoon et al., 2004; Witten et al., 2009).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Apr 2016 19:57:46 GMT  (317kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03930v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 27 May 2016 18:03:11 GMT  (316kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03930v2", "International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.OC stat.ML", "authors": ["rong ge 0001", "chi jin", "sham m kakade", "praneeth netrapalli", "aaron sidford"], "accepted": true, "id": "1604.03930"}
