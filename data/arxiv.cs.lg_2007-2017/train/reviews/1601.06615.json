However, of late, deep learning techniques have offered a compelling alternative -- that of automatically learning problem-specific features. With this new paradigm, every problem in computer vision is now being re-examined from a deep learning perspective. Therefore, it has become important to understand what kind of deep networks are suitable for a given problem. Although general surveys of this fast-moving paradigm (i.e. deep-networks) exist, a survey specific to computer vision is missing. We specifically consider one form of deep networks widely used in computer vision - convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We start with \"AlexNet\" as our base CNN and then examine the broad variations proposed over time to suit different applications. We hope that our recipe-style survey will serve as a guide, particularly for novice practitioners intending to use deep-learning techniques for computer vision.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 25 Jan 2016 14:25:07 GMT  (1306kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06615v1", "Published in Frontiers in Robotics and AI (this http URL)"]], "COMMENTS": "Published in Frontiers in Robotics and AI (this http URL)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.MM", "authors": ["suraj srinivas", "ravi kiran sarvadevabhatla", "konda reddy mopuri", "nikita prabhu", "srinivas s s kruthiventi", "r venkatesh babu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.06615"}
