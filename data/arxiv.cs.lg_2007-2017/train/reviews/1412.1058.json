This paper studies CNN on text categorization to exploit the 1D structure (namely, word order) of text data for accurate prediction. We directly apply CNN to high-dimensional text data, instead of low-dimensional word vectors as is often done. Two types of CNN are studied: a straightforward adaptation of CNN from image to text, and a simple but new variation which employs bag-of-word conversion in the convolution layer. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, as well as previous CNN models for text, which are more complex and expensive to train.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Dec 2014 16:19:51 GMT  (235kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1058v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 26 Mar 2015 12:59:35 GMT  (270kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1058v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["rie johnson", "tong zhang 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.1058"}
