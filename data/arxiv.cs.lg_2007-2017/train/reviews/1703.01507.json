The Lemma has an existential form saying that there exists a JL transformation $f$ of the data points into lower dimensional space such that all of them fall into predefined error range $\\delta$. We formulate in this paper a theorem stating that we can choose the target dimensionality in a random projection type JL linear transformation in such a way that with probability $1-\\epsilon$ all of them fall into predefined error range $\\delta$ for any user-predefined failure probability $\\epsilon$. This result is important for applications such a data clustering where we want to have a priori dimensionality reducing transformation instead of trying out a (large) number of them, as with traditional Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 4 Mar 2017 19:08:22 GMT  (32kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01507v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 15 May 2017 17:56:29 GMT  (52kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01507v2", "34 pages, 6 Figures"], ["v3", "Thu, 7 Sep 2017 08:06:18 GMT  (54kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01507v3", "38 pages, 6 Figures"], ["v4", "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 08:35:17 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01507v4", "38 pages, 6 Figures"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["mieczys{\\l}aw a k{\\l}opotek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.01507"}
