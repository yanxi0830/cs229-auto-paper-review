{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "25-Aug-2014", "title": "Improved Distributed Principal Component Analysis", "abstract": "We study the distributed computing setting in which there are multiple servers, each holding a set of points, who wish to compute functions on the union of their point sets. A key task in this setting is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), in which the servers would like to compute a low dimensional subspace capturing as much of the variance of the union of their point sets as possible. Given a procedure for approximate PCA, one can use it to approximately solve problems such as $k$-means clustering and low rank approximation. The essential properties of an approximate distributed PCA algorithm are its communication cost and computational efficiency for a given desired accuracy in downstream applications. We give new algorithms and analyses for distributed PCA which lead to improved communication and computational costs for $k$-means clustering and related problems. Our empirical study on real world data shows a speedup of orders of magnitude, preserving communication with only a negligible degradation in solution quality. Some of these techniques we develop, such as a general transformation from a constant success probability subspace embedding to a high success probability subspace embedding with a dimension and sparsity independent of the success probability, may be of independent interest.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 25 Aug 2014 16:24:43 GMT  (292kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5823v1", "23 pages"], ["v2", "Mon, 1 Sep 2014 01:32:30 GMT  (292kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5823v2", "23 pages"], ["v3", "Thu, 13 Nov 2014 14:51:43 GMT  (312kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5823v3", "23 pages"], ["v4", "Sun, 21 Dec 2014 01:13:00 GMT  (346kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5823v4", null], ["v5", "Tue, 23 Dec 2014 03:17:19 GMT  (346kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5823v5", null]], "COMMENTS": "23 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yingyu liang", "maria-florina balcan", "vandana kanchanapally", "david p woodruff"], "accepted": true, "id": "1408.5823"}
