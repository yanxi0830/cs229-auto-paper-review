In this paper, we address this question by introducing a generalization of the principle of maximum entropy. Applying this principle to sets of distributions with a proposed structure, we develop a general minimax approach for supervised learning problems, that reduces to the maximum likelihood problem over generalized linear models. Through this framework, we develop two classification algorithms called the minimax SVM and the minimax Brier classifier. The minimax SVM, which is a relaxed version of the standard SVM, minimizes the worst-case 0-1 loss over the structured set of distribution, and by our numerical experiments can outperform the SVM. We also explore the application of the developed framework in robust feature selection.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Jun 2016 16:39:09 GMT  (205kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02206v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 1 Aug 2016 01:20:30 GMT  (207kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02206v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 4 Aug 2016 23:03:43 GMT  (207kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02206v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 6 Nov 2016 23:19:58 GMT  (284kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02206v4", null], ["v5", "Tue, 4 Jul 2017 01:56:04 GMT  (855kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02206v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "authors": ["farzan farnia", "david tse"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.02206"}
