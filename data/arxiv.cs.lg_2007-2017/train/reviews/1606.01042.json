We focus primarily on Machine Learning-based spam filters and their variants, and report on a broad review ranging from surveying the relevant ideas, efforts, effectiveness, and the current progress. The initial exposition of the background examines the basics of e-mail spam filtering, the evolving nature of spam, spammers playing cat-and-mouse with e-mail service providers (ESPs), and the Machine Learning front in fighting spam. We conclude by measuring the impact of Machine Learning-based filters and explore the promising offshoots of latest developments.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Jun 2016 10:58:37 GMT  (496kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01042v1", "Journal. 27 Pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Journal. 27 Pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR", "authors": ["alexy bhowmick", "shyamanta m hazarika"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.01042"}
