A good k-way partition is a partition of the vertices of a graph into disjoint clusters (subsets) $\\{S_i\\}_{i=1}^k$, such that each cluster is better connected on the inside than towards the outside. This problem is a key building block in algorithm design, and has wide applications in community detection and network analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 7 Nov 2014 20:23:50 GMT  (48kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2021v1", "32 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 17:08:00 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2021v2", "28 pages.
