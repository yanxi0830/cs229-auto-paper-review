Screening rules leverage the known sparsity of the solution by ignoring some variables in the optimization, hence speeding up solvers. When the procedure is proven not to discard features wrongly the rules are said to be \\emph{safe}. In this paper we derive new safe rules for generalized linear models regularized with $\\ell_1$ and $\\ell_1/\\ell_2$ norms. The rules are based on duality gap computations and spherical safe regions whose diameters converge to zero. This allows to discard safely more variables, in particular for low regularization parameters. The GAP Safe rule can cope with any iterative solver and we illustrate its performance on coordinate descent for multi-task Lasso, binary and multinomial logistic regression, demonstrating significant speed ups on all tested datasets with respect to previous safe rules.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Jun 2015 16:25:36 GMT  (504kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03736v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 10:07:20 GMT  (534kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03736v2", "in Proceedings of the 29-th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG math.OC stat.CO", "authors": ["eug\u00e8ne ndiaye", "olivier fercoq", "alexandre gramfort", "joseph salmon"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.03736"}
