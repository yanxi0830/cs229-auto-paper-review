It is a challenging problem, especially when the images have clutter background, occlusions or different lighting conditions. Many vision features have been proposed which aid object categorization even in such adverse conditions. Past research has shown that, employing multiple features rather than any single features leads to better recognition. Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) framework has been developed for learning an optimal combination of features for object categorization. Existing MKL methods use linear combination of base kernels which may not be optimal for object categorization. Real-world object categorization may need to consider complex combination of kernels(non-linear) and not only linear combination. Evolving non-linear functions of base kernels using Genetic Programming is proposed in this report. Experiment results show that non-kernel generated using genetic programming gives good accuracy as compared to linear combination of kernels.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Apr 2016 15:33:30 GMT  (451kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02376v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 22 Apr 2016 23:16:20 GMT  (668kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02376v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["jyothi korra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.02376"}
