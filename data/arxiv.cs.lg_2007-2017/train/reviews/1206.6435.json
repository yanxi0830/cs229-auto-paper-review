{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "27-Jun-2012", "title": "Rethinking Collapsed Variational Bayes Inference for LDA", "abstract": "We propose a novel interpretation of the collapsed variational Bayes inference with a zero-order Taylor expansion approximation, called CVB0 inference, for latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). We clarify the properties of the CVB0 inference by using the alpha-divergence. We show that the CVB0 inference is composed of two different divergence projections: alpha=1 and -1. This interpretation will help shed light on CVB0 works.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (175kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6435v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["issei sato", "hiroshi nakagawa"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6435"}
