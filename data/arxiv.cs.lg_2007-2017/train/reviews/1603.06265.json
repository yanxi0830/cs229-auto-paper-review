In each round, one user wishes to make a prediction, and must choose which expert to follow. The users would like to share their experiences in order to learn faster--ideally they could amortize the same total regret cross the whole community of users. However, some of the users may behave maliciously, distorting their reported payoffs in order to manipulate the honest users of the system. And even if all users behave honestly, different experts may perform better for different users, such that sharing data can be counterproductive.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 20 Mar 2016 20:34:32 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06265v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 6 Apr 2016 20:41:12 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06265v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 8 Apr 2016 00:36:06 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06265v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["paul christiano"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.06265"}
