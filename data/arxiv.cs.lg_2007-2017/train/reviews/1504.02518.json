In this work we study unsupervised feature learning in the context of temporally coherent video data. We focus on feature learning from unlabeled video data, using the assumption that adjacent video frames contain semantically similar information. This assumption is exploited to train a convolutional pooling auto-encoder regularized by slowness and sparsity. We establish a connection between slow feature learning to metric learning and show that the trained encoder can be used to define a more temporally and semantically coherent metric.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Apr 2015 23:26:26 GMT  (4472kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02518v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1412.6056"], ["v2", "Wed, 15 Apr 2015 23:08:30 GMT  (4471kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02518v2", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1412.6056"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1412.6056", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["ross goroshin", "joan bruna", "jonathan tompson", "david eigen", "yann lecun"], "accepted": true, "id": "1504.02518"}
