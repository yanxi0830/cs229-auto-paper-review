Most of the current works on detection of audio events is driven through supervised learning approaches. We propose a weakly supervised learning framework which can make use of the tremendous amount of web multimedia data with significantly reduced annotation effort and expense. Specifically, we use several multiple instance learning algorithms to show that audio event detection through weak labels is feasible. We also propose a novel scalable multiple instance learning algorithm and show that its competitive with other multiple instance learning algorithms for audio event detection tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 12 Jun 2016 04:07:45 GMT  (27kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03664v1", "ICME 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "ICME 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.LG cs.MM", "authors": ["anurag kumar", "bhiksha raj"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03664"}
