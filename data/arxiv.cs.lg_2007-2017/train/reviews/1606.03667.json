A specified number of discussion threads predicted to be popular are recommended, chosen from a fixed window of recent comments to track. Novel deep reinforcement learning architectures are studied for effective modeling of the value function associated with actions comprised of interdependent sub-actions. The proposed model, which represents dependence between sub-actions through a bi-directional LSTM, gives the best performance across different experimental configurations and domains, and it also generalizes well with varying numbers of recommendation requests.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 12 Jun 2016 05:38:20 GMT  (5418kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03667v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 16 Jun 2016 22:31:36 GMT  (5730kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03667v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 8 Sep 2016 06:38:20 GMT  (1281kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03667v3", "To be published in EMNLP 2016, 11 pages"], ["v4", "Sat, 17 Sep 2016 00:52:43 GMT  (1281kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03667v4", "To be published in EMNLP 2016, 11 pages"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["ji he", "mari ostendorf", "xiaodong he", "jianshu chen", "jianfeng gao", "lihong li", "li deng"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.03667"}
