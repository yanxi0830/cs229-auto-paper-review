{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "5-Sep-2012", "title": "Learning Manifolds with K-Means and K-Flats", "abstract": "We study the problem of estimating a manifold from random samples. In particular, we consider piecewise constant and piecewise linear estimators induced by k-means and k-flats, and analyze their performance. We extend previous results for k-means in two separate directions. First, we provide new results for k-means reconstruction on manifolds and, secondly, we prove reconstruction bounds for higher-order approximation (k-flats), for which no known results were previously available. While the results for k-means are novel, some of the technical tools are well-established in the literature. In the case of k-flats, both the results and the mathematical tools are new.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Sep 2012 21:18:03 GMT  (240kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1121v1", "13 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 7 Sep 2012 17:11:23 GMT  (240kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1121v2", "13 pages, 2 figures; Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, NIPS 2012"], ["v3", "Tue, 11 Sep 2012 16:00:03 GMT  (240kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1121v3", "13 pages, 2 figures; Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, NIPS 2012"], ["v4", "Tue, 19 Feb 2013 17:53:17 GMT  (257kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1121v4", "19 pages, 2 figures; Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, NIPS 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["guillermo d ca\u00f1as", "tomaso a poggio", "lorenzo rosasco"], "accepted": true, "id": "1209.1121"}
