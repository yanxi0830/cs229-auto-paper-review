We show that this framework well regularizes previous neural KB embedding model for superior performance in reasoning tasks, while having the capabilities of dealing with unseen entities, that is, to learn their embeddings from natural language descriptions, which is very like human's behavior of learning semantic concepts.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Dec 2015 17:52:50 GMT  (15kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01173v1", "Accepted to NIPS 2015 Cognitive Computation workshop (CoCo@NIPS 2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to NIPS 2015 Cognitive Computation workshop (CoCo@NIPS 2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["jiaxin shi", "jun zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.01173"}
