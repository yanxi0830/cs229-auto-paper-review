We use completely random measures~(CRM) and hierarchical CRM to define a prior for Poisson processes. We derive the marginal distribution of the resultant point process, when the underlying CRM is marginalized out. Using well known properties unique to Poisson processes, we were able to derive an exact approach for instantiating a Poisson process with a hierarchical CRM prior. Furthermore, we derive Gibbs sampling strategies for hierarchical CRM models based on Chinese restaurant franchise sampling scheme. As an example, we present the sum of generalized gamma process (SGGP), and show its application in topic-modelling. We show that one can determine the power-law behaviour of the topics and words in a Bayesian fashion, by defining a prior on the parameters of SGGP.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 6 Sep 2015 14:44:38 GMT  (58kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01817v1", "14 pages, 1 figure"], ["v2", "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 06:46:28 GMT  (69kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01817v2", "11 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.ST cs.LG stat.TH", "authors": ["gaurav pandey", "ambedkar dukkipati"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.01817"}
