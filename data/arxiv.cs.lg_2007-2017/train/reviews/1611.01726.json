In this paper, we propose a system-call language-modeling approach for designing anomaly-based host intrusion detection systems. To remedy the issue of high false-alarm rates commonly arising in conventional methods, we employ a novel ensemble method that blends multiple thresholding classifiers into a single one, making it possible to accumulate 'highly normal' sequences. The proposed system-call language model has various advantages leveraged by the fact that it can learn the semantic meaning and interactions of each system call that existing methods cannot effectively consider. Through diverse experiments on public benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, we show that our model possesses high portability, which is one of the key aspects of realizing successful intrusion detection systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 6 Nov 2016 04:07:29 GMT  (972kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01726v1", "12 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["gyuwan kim", "hayoon yi", "jangho lee", "yunheung paek", "sungroh yoon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.01726"}
