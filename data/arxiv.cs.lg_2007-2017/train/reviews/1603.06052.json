However, successful use of Nystr\\\"om depends crucially on the selected landmarks. We consider landmark selection by using a Determinantal Point Process (DPP) to tractably select a diverse subset from the columns of an input kernel matrix. We prove that the landmarks selected using DPP sampling enjoy guaranteed error bounds; subsequently, we illustrate impact of DPP-sampled landmarks on kernel ridge regression. Moreover, we show how to efficiently sample from a DPP in linear time using a fast mixing (under certain constraints) Markov chain, which makes the overall procedure practical. Empirical results support our theoretical analysis: DPP-based landmark selection shows performance superior to existing approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Mar 2016 06:14:28 GMT  (914kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06052v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 28 May 2016 04:04:55 GMT  (723kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06052v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["chengtao li", "stefanie jegelka", "suvrit sra"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.06052"}
