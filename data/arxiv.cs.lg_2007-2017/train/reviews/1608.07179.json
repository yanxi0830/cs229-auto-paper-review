Our method approximately solves the following $n$-dimensional quadratic minimization problem in constant time, which is independent of $n$: $z^*=\\min_{\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n}\\langle\\mathbf{v}, A \\mathbf{v}\\rangle + n\\langle\\mathbf{v}, \\mathrm{diag}(\\mathbf{d})\\mathbf{v}\\rangle + n\\langle\\mathbf{b}, \\mathbf{v}\\rangle$, where $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is a matrix and $\\mathbf{d},\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ are vectors. Our theoretical analysis specifies the number of samples $k(\\delta, \\epsilon)$ such that the approximated solution $z$ satisfies $|z - z^*| = O(\\epsilon n^2)$ with probability $1-\\delta$. The empirical performance (accuracy and runtime) is positively confirmed by numerical experiments.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Aug 2016 14:43:17 GMT  (186kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.07179v1", "An extended abstract will appear in the proceedings of NIPS'16"]], "COMMENTS": "An extended abstract will appear in the proceedings of NIPS'16", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS stat.ML", "authors": ["kohei hayashi", "yuichi yoshida"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.07179"}
