In this work, we train word embeddings for more than 100 languages using their corresponding Wikipedias. We quantitatively demonstrate the utility of our word embeddings by using them as the sole features for training a part of speech tagger for a subset of these languages. We find their performance to be competitive with near state-of-art methods in English, Danish and Swedish. Moreover, we investigate the semantic features captured by these embeddings through the proximity of word groupings. We will release these embeddings publicly to help researchers in the development and enhancement of multilingual applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Jul 2013 16:52:09 GMT  (345kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1662v1", "10 pages, 2 figures, Proceedings of Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning CoNLL'2013"], ["v2", "Fri, 27 Jun 2014 17:31:33 GMT  (345kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1662v2", "10 pages, 2 figures, Proceedings of Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning CoNLL'2013"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 2 figures, Proceedings of Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning CoNLL'2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["rami al-rfou", "bryan perozzi", "steven skiena"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.1662"}
