However, the scarcity of large labeled data sets has hindered supervised machine learning research for this task. In this paper we develop and demonstrate an approach based on ``distantly-labeling'' a data set from which we can train a discriminative cross-document coreference model. In particular we build a dataset of more than a million people mentions extracted from 3.5 years of New York Times articles, leverage Wikipedia for distant labeling with a generative model (and measure the reliability of such labeling); then we train and evaluate a conditional random field coreference model that has factors on cross-document entities as well as mention-pairs. This coreference model obtains high accuracy in resolving mentions and entities that are not present in the training data, indicating applicability to non-Wikipedia data. Given the large amount of data, our work is also an exercise demonstrating the scalability of our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 May 2010 10:35:50 GMT  (226kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.4298v1", "16 pages, submitted to ECML 2010"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, submitted to ECML 2010", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["sameer singh", "michael wick", "andrew mccallum"], "accepted": false, "id": "1005.4298"}
