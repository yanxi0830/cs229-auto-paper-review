{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-Sep-2017", "title": "Depression Scale Recognition from Audio, Visual and Text Analysis", "abstract": "Depression is a major mental health disorder that is rapidly affecting lives worldwide. Depression not only impacts emotional but also physical and psychological state of the person. Its symptoms include lack of interest in daily activities, feeling low, anxiety, frustration, loss of weight and even feeling of self-hatred. This report describes work done by us for Audio Visual Emotion Challenge (AVEC) 2017 during our second year BTech summer internship. With the increase in demand to detect depression automatically with the help of machine learning algorithms, we present our multimodal feature extraction and decision level fusion approach for the same. Features are extracted by processing on the provided Distress Analysis Interview Corpus-Wizard of Oz (DAIC-WOZ) database. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering and Fisher vector approach were applied on the visual data; statistical descriptors on gaze, pose; low level audio features and head pose and text features were also extracted. Classification is done on fused as well as independent features using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and neural networks. The results obtained were able to cross the provided baseline on validation data set by 17% on audio features and 24.5% on video features.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 11:26:01 GMT  (363kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05865v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.MM", "authors": ["shubham dham", "anirudh sharma", "abhinav dhall"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.05865"}
