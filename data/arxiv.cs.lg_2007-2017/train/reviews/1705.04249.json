We show that the K-sets+ algorithm converges in a finite number of iterations and it retains the same performance guarantee as the K-sets algorithm for clustering data points in a metric space. We then extend the applicability of the K-sets+ algorithm from data points in a semi-metric space to data points that only have a symmetric similarity measure. Such an extension leads to great reduction of computational complexity. In particular, for an n * n similarity matrix with m nonzero elements in the matrix, the computational complexity of the K-sets+ algorithm is O((Kn + m)I), where I is the number of iterations. The memory complexity to achieve that computational complexity is O(Kn + m). As such, both the computational complexity and the memory complexity are linear in n when the n * n similarity matrix is sparse, i.e., m = O(n). We also conduct various experiments to show the effectiveness of the K-sets+ algorithm by using a synthetic dataset from the stochastic block model and a real network from the WonderNetwork website.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 May 2017 15:39:48 GMT  (301kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04249v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["cheng-shang chang", "chia-tai chang", "duan-shin lee", "li-heng liou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.04249"}
