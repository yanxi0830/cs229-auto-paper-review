The main new result is our demonstration of how to use a behavior's or process' $k$-order statistics to build a stochastic process that has those same $k$-order stationary statistics but possesses different, deliberately designed, $(k+1)$-order statistics if desired. Such a model realizes a \"complexification\" of the process or behavior which a defender can use to monitor whether an attacker is shaping the behavior. By deliberately introducing designed $(k+1)$-order behaviors, the defender can check to see if those behaviors are present in the data. We also develop constructs for source codes that respect the $k$-order statistics of a process while encoding covert information. One fundamental consequence of these results is that certain types of behavior analyses techniques come down to an {\\em arms race} in the sense that the advantage goes to the party that has more computing resources applied to the problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Apr 2011 04:12:47 GMT  (441kb,DS)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5071v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["valentino crespi", "george cybenko", "annarita giani"], "accepted": false, "id": "1104.5071"}
