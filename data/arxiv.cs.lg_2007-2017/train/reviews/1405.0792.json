This problem is equivalent to the problem of learning a general hypergraph using hyperedge-detecting queries, a problem motivated by applications arising in chemical reactions and genome sequencing.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 May 2014 06:49:05 GMT  (14kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0792v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hasan abasi", "nader h bshouty", "hanna mazzawi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.0792"}
