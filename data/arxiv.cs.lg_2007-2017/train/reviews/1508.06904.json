Recently proposed methodologies lack a satisfactory discussion of whether they actually produce the correct results according to their definition, especially in the context of Convolutional Neural Networks. We improve on this through an exact characterization of the requirements for a sound sliding window approach. The tools developed in this paper are especially beneficial if Convolutional Neural Networks are employed, but can also be used as a more general framework to validate related approaches to signal scanning. The contributed theory helps to eliminate redundant computations and renders special case treatment unnecessary, resulting in a dramatic boost in efficiency particularly on massively parallel processors.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Aug 2015 15:50:26 GMT  (1818kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06904v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 23 Mar 2016 18:49:52 GMT  (1864kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06904v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 5 Nov 2016 12:18:13 GMT  (2070kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06904v3", "Pages 1-16 only: Copyright (c) 2015 IEEE.
