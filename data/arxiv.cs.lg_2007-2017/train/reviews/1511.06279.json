{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "19-Nov-2015", "title": "Neural Programmer-Interpreters", "abstract": "We propose the neural programmer-interpreter (NPI): a recurrent and compositional neural network that learns to represent and execute programs. NPI has three learnable components: a task-agnostic recurrent core, a persistent key-value program memory, and domain-specific encoders that enable a single NPI to operate in multiple perceptually diverse environments with distinct affordances. By learning to compose lower-level programs to express higher-level programs, NPI reduces sample complexity and increases generalization ability compared to sequence-to-sequence LSTMs. The program memory allows efficient learning of additional tasks by building on existing programs. NPI can also harness the environment (e.g. a scratch pad with read-write pointers) to cache intermediate results of computation, lessening the long-term memory burden on recurrent hidden units. In this work we train the NPI with fully-supervised execution traces; each program has example sequences of calls to the immediate subprograms conditioned on the input. Rather than training on a huge number of relatively weak labels, NPI learns from a small number of rich examples. We demonstrate the capability of our model to learn several types of compositional programs: addition, sorting, and canonicalizing 3D models. Furthermore, a single NPI learns to execute these programs and all 21 associated subprograms.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 17:49:32 GMT  (845kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06279v1", "ICLR 2016 conference submission"], ["v2", "Mon, 23 Nov 2015 19:30:01 GMT  (846kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06279v2", "ICLR 2016 conference submission"], ["v3", "Tue, 8 Dec 2015 18:11:35 GMT  (845kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06279v3", "ICLR 2016 conference submission"], ["v4", "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 11:12:36 GMT  (882kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06279v4", "ICLR 2016 conference submission"]], "COMMENTS": "ICLR 2016 conference submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["scott reed", "nando de freitas"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.06279"}
