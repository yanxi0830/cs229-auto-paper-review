Recently, Chaudhuri et al. (2012) and Amini et al.(2012) proposed inspired variations on the algorithm that artificially inflate the node degrees for improved statistical performance. The current paper extends the previous statistical estimation results to the more canonical spectral clustering algorithm in a way that removes any assumption on the minimum degree and provides guidance on the choice of the tuning parameter. Moreover, our results show how the \"star shape\" in the eigenvectors--a common feature of empirical networks--can be explained by the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Blockmodel and the Extended Planted Partition model, two statistical models that allow for highly heterogeneous degrees. Throughout, the paper characterizes and justifies several of the variations of the spectral clustering algorithm in terms of these models.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Sep 2013 20:47:51 GMT  (75kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4111v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG math.ST stat.TH", "authors": ["tai qin", "karl rohe"], "accepted": true, "id": "1309.4111"}
