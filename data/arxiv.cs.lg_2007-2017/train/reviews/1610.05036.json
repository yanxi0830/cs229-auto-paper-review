We first obtain local descriptors, called Mesh Arc Descriptors (MADs) from fMRI data, by forming local meshes around anatomical regions, and estimating their relationship within a neighborhood. Then, we extract a dictionary of relationships, called \\textit{brain connectivity dictionary} by fitting a generative Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to a set of MADs, and selecting the codewords at the mean of each component of the mixture. Codewords represent the connectivity patterns among anatomical regions. We also encode MADs by VLAD and BoW methods using the k-Means clustering.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Oct 2016 10:08:09 GMT  (2108kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05036v1", "8 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["itir onal ertugrul", "mete ozay", "fatos t yarman vural"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.05036"}
