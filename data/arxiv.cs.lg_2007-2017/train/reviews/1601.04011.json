Implications to Exp-concave Empirical Risk Minimization", "abstract": "We tighten the sample complexity of empirical risk minimization (ERM) associated with a class of generalized linear models that include linear and logistic regression. In particular, we conclude that ERM attains the optimal sample complexity for linear regression. Our analysis relies on a new notion of stability, called preconditioned stability, which may be of independent interest.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 Jan 2016 17:32:44 GMT  (17kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04011v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 2 Feb 2016 11:46:18 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04011v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 11 Oct 2016 12:29:09 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04011v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 16 Apr 2017 12:15:33 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04011v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["alon gonen", "shai shalev-shwartz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.04011"}
