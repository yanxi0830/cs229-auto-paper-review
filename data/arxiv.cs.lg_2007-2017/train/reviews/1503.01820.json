In contrast to approaches that successively recognize actions and activities, our approach jointly models actions and activities in a unified framework, and their labels are simultaneously predicted. The model is embedded with a latent layer that is able to capture a richer class of contextual information in both state-state and observation-state pairs. Although loops are present in the model, the model has an overall linear-chain structure, where the exact inference is tractable. Therefore, the model is very efficient in both inference and learning. The parameters of the graphical model are learned with a Structured Support Vector Machine (Structured-SVM). A data-driven approach is used to initialize the latent variables; therefore, no manual labeling for the latent states is required. The experimental results from using two benchmark datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art approach, and our model is computationally more efficient.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Mar 2015 00:05:12 GMT  (3515kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01820v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["ninghang hu", "gwenn englebienne", "zhongyu lou", "ben kr\\\"ose"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.01820"}
