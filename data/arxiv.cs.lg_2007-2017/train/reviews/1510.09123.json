Similar notions have been considered for kernels; we extend them to more general types of ranges. We then consider approximations of these range spaces through $\\varepsilon $-nets and $\\varepsilon $-samples (aka $\\varepsilon$-approximations). We characterize when size bounds for $\\varepsilon $-samples on kernels can be extended to these more general smoothed range spaces. We also describe new generalizations for $\\varepsilon $-nets to these range spaces and show when results from binary range spaces can carry over to these smoothed ones.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 15:27:31 GMT  (349kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.09123v1", "This is the full version of the paper which appeared in ALT 2015. 16 pages, 3 figures.
