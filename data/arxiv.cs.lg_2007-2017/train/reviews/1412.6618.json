As an example, for image recognition problems this allows an efficient filtering of signals that do not lie on a dense grid (like pixel position), but of more general features (such as color values). The presented algorithm makes use of the permutohedral lattice data structure. The permutohedral lattice was introduced to efficiently implement a bilateral filter, a commonly used image processing operation. Its use allows for a generalization of the convolution type found in current (spatial) convolutional network architectures.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 Dec 2014 07:08:54 GMT  (29kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6618v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 26 Feb 2015 14:16:58 GMT  (31kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6618v2", null], ["v3", "Sun, 3 May 2015 11:26:34 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6618v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["martin kiefel", "varun jampani", "peter v gehler"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.6618"}
