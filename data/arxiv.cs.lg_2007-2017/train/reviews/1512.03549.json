Several methods have been tried for benchmark tasks such as sentiment classification, including word vector averaging, matrix-vector approaches based on parsing, and on-the-fly learning of paragraph vectors. Most models usually omit stop words from the composition. Instead of such an yes-no decision, we consider several graded schemes where words are weighted according to their discriminatory relevance with respect to its use in the document (e.g., idf). Some of these methods (particularly tf-idf) are seen to result in a significant improvement in performance over prior state of the art. Further, combining such approaches into an ensemble based on alternate classifiers such as the RNN model, results in an 1.6% performance improvement on the standard IMDB movie review dataset, and a 7.01% improvement on Amazon product reviews. Since these are language free models and can be obtained in an unsupervised manner, they are of interest also for under-resourced languages such as Hindi as well and many more languages. We demonstrate the language free aspects by showing a gain of 12% for two review datasets over earlier results, and also release a new larger dataset for future testing (Singh,2015).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Dec 2015 08:44:45 GMT  (57kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03549v1", "10 Pages, 2 Figures, 11 Tables"]], "COMMENTS": "10 Pages, 2 Figures, 11 Tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["pranjal singh", "amitabha mukerjee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.03549"}
