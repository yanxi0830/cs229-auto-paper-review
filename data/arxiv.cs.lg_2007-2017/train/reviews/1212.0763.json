However, a major drawback of matrix factorization is its static nature that results in a progressive declining of the accuracy of the predictions after each factorization. This is due to the fact that the new obtained ratings are not taken into account until a new factorization is computed, which can not be done very often because of the high cost of matrix factorization.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Dec 2012 13:00:27 GMT  (111kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.0763v1", "31 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "31 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DB cs.IR", "authors": ["modou gueye", "talel abdessalem", "hubert naacke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.0763"}
