The models showed promising improvements over traditional recommendation approaches. In this work, we further study RNNbased models for session-based recommendations. We propose the application of two techniques to improve model performance, namely, data augmentation, and a method to account for shifts in the input data distribution. We also empirically study the use of generalised distillation, and a novel alternative model that directly predicts item embeddings. Experiments on the RecSys Challenge 2015 dataset demonstrate relative improvements of 12.8% and 14.8% over previously reported results on the Recall@20 and Mean Reciprocal Rank@20 metrics respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Jun 2016 03:06:44 GMT  (183kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08117v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 16 Sep 2016 09:41:10 GMT  (184kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08117v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["yong kiam tan", "xinxing xu", "yong liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.08117"}
