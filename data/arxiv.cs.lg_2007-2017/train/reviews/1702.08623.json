Recent research focused on activity recognition, but little work has focused on process progress detection from sensor data. We introduce a real-time, sensor-based system for modeling, recognizing and estimating the completeness of a process. We implemented a multimodal CNN-LSTM structure to extract the spatio-temporal features from different sensory datatypes. We used a novel deep regression structure for overall completeness estimation. By combining process completeness estimation with a Gaussian mixture model, our system can predict the process phase using the estimated completeness. We also introduce the rectified hyperbolic tangent (rtanh) activation function and conditional loss to help the training process. Using the completeness estimation result and performance speed calculations, we also implemented an online estimator of remaining time. We tested this system using data obtained from a medical process (trauma resuscitation) and sport events (swim competition). Our system outperformed existing implementations for phase prediction during trauma resuscitation and achieved over 80% of process phase detection accuracy with less than 9% completeness estimation error and time remaining estimation error less than 18% of duration in both dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 03:11:33 GMT  (2027kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08623v1", "16 pages, 11 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 29 Jun 2017 05:04:49 GMT  (2091kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08623v2", "Accepted by IMWUT/Ubicomp 2017"], ["v3", "Fri, 14 Jul 2017 20:01:31 GMT  (2024kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08623v3", "Accepted by IMWUT/Ubicomp 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 11 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.HC", "authors": ["xinyu li", "yanyi zhang", "jianyu zhang", "yueyang chen", "shuhong chen", "yue gu", "moliang zhou", "richard a farneth", "ivan marsic", "randall s burd"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.08623"}
