Inspired by these successes, in this paper, we build two kinds of reinforcement learning algorithms: deep policy-gradient and value-function based agents which can predict the best possible traffic signal for a traffic intersection. At each time step, these adaptive traffic light control agents receive a snapshot of the current state of a graphical traffic simulator and produce control signals. The policy-gradient based agent maps its observation directly to the control signal, however the value-function based agent first estimates values for all legal control signals. The agent then selects the optimal control action with the highest value. Our methods show promising results in a traffic network simulated in the SUMO traffic simulator, without suffering from instability issues during the training process.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 28 Apr 2017 11:44:42 GMT  (128kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08883v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 27 May 2017 14:45:56 GMT  (128kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08883v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["seyed sajad mousavi", "michael schukat", "enda howley"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.08883"}
