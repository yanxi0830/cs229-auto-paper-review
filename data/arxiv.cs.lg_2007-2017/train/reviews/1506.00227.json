It overcome the shortcomings of some traditional clustering algorithm and guarantee the convergence to the optimal solution, thus have to the widespread attention. This article first introduced the parallel spectral clustering algorithm research background and significance, and then to Hadoop the cloud computing Framework has carried on the detailed introduction, then has carried on the related to spectral clustering is introduced, then introduces the spectral clustering arithmetic Method of parallel and relevant steps, finally made the related experiments, and the experiment are summarized.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 31 May 2015 13:39:41 GMT  (993kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00227v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["yajun cui", "yang zhao", "kafei xiao", "chenglong zhang", "lei wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.00227"}
