Given a collection of samples composed of features $x$ and a label $y$, linear regression is used to find the best prediction of the label as a linear combination of the features. However, it is also common to use linear regression for its explanatory capabilities rather than label prediction. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is often used in statistics to establish a correlation between an attribute (e.g. gender) and a label (e.g. income) in the presence of other features. OLS uses linear regression in order to estimate the correlation between the label and a feature $x_j$ on a given dataset; and then, under the assumption of a certain generative model for the data, OLS outputs an interval that is likely to contain the correlation between $y$ and $x_j$ in the underlying distribution (a confidence interval). When this interval does not intersect the origin, we can reject the null hypothesis as it is likely that $x_j$ has a non-zero correlation with $y$.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Jul 2015 12:32:19 GMT  (41kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02482v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 2 Nov 2015 02:19:03 GMT  (46kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02482v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 25 Nov 2015 00:24:42 GMT  (46kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02482v3", null], ["v4", "Mon, 21 Aug 2017 21:30:27 GMT  (605kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02482v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["or sheffet"], "accepted": true, "id": "1507.02482"}
