To address this sparse data issue, we present novel Incremental Transductive methods to circumvent the data collection process by applying previously acquired data to provide consistent, confidence-based labelling alternatives to field survey research. We investigated various reasoning approaches for semisupervised machine learning including Bayesian models for labelling data. The results show that using the proposed methods, we can label instances of data with a class of vector density at a high level of confidence. By applying the Liberal and Strict Training Approaches, we provide a labelling and classification alternative to standalone algorithms. The methods in this paper are components in the process of reducing the proliferation of the Schistosomiasis disease and its effects.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Apr 2017 13:03:05 GMT  (173kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01815v1", "8 pages, 5 figures, Dragon 4 Symposium"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 5 figures, Dragon 4 Symposium", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["terence fusco", "yaxin bi", "haiying wang", "fiona browne"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.01815"}
