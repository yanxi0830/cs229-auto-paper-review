We show that through this interpretation it is both efficient and straightforward to improve the approximation by employing normalizing flows while still allowing for local reparametrizations and a tractable lower bound. In experiments we show that with this new approximation we can significantly improve upon classical mean field for Bayesian neural networks on both predictive accuracy as well as predictive uncertainty.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 16:39:16 GMT  (970kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01961v1", "Submitted to ICML 2017"], ["v2", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 21:05:58 GMT  (1136kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01961v2", "Appearing at the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to ICML 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["christos louizos", "max welling"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.01961"}
