The budget and time constraints significantly increase the complexity of exploration-exploitation tradeoff because they introduce coupling among contexts. Such coupling effects make it difficult to obtain oracle solutions that assume known statistics of bandits. To gain insight, we first study unit-cost systems, where the costs of all actions under any context are identical. We develop near-optimal approximations of the oracle, which are then combined with upper confidence bound (UCB) method in the general case where the expected rewards are unknown a priori. We show that our proposed algorithms, named UCB-PB and UCB-ALP, achieve logarithmic regret except in certain boundary cases. Last, we discuss the extension of the proposed algorithms into general-cost systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Apr 2015 06:03:50 GMT  (194kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06937v1", "23 pages, 4 figures; under submission; partly presented at Information Theory and Applications (ITA) workshop, 2015, San Diego, CA"], ["v2", "Thu, 23 Jul 2015 17:55:35 GMT  (235kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06937v2", "36 pages, 4 figures; under submission; partly presented at Information Theory and Applications (ITA) workshop, 2015, San Diego, CA"], ["v3", "Mon, 19 Oct 2015 16:47:20 GMT  (751kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06937v3", "36 pages, 4 figures; accepted by the 29th Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), Montr\\'eal, Canada, Dec. 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "23 pages, 4 figures; under submission; partly presented at Information Theory and Applications (ITA) workshop, 2015, San Diego, CA", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["huasen wu", "r srikant", "xin liu 0002", "chong jiang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1504.06937"}
