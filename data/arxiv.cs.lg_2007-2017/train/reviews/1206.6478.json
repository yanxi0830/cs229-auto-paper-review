For a multi-label output coding to be discriminative, it is important that codewords for different label vectors are significantly different from each other. In the meantime, unlike in traditional coding theory, codewords in output coding are to be predicted from the input, so it is also critical to have a predictable label encoding.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (347kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6478v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["yi zhang 0010", "jeff g schneider"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6478"}
