We are thus able to factor the appearance of an image into the appearance of individual objects within the image --- and additionally for each individual object, we can factor content from pose. Unlike prior work on layered models, we learn a shape prior for each object/layer, allowing the model to tease out which object is in front by looking for a consistent shape, without needing access to motion cues or any labeled data. We show that ordinary stochastic gradient variational bayes (SGVB), which optimizes our fully differentiable lower-bound on the log-likelihood, is sufficient to learn an interpretable representation of images. Finally we present experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the model for inferring foreground and background objects in images.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 20:56:27 GMT  (4193kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06362v1", "10 pages, Under review at ICLR 2016"], ["v2", "Tue, 16 Feb 2016 07:22:02 GMT  (4193kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06362v2", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, Under review at ICLR 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["jonathan huang", "kevin murphy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06362"}
