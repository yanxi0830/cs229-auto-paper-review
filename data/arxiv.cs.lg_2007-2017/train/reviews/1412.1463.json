{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "3-Dec-2014", "title": "On the String Kernel Pre-Image Problem with Applications in Drug Discovery", "abstract": "The pre-image problem has to be solved during inference by most structured output predictors. For string kernels, this problem corresponds to finding the string associated to a given input. An algorithm capable of solving or finding good approximations to this problem would have many applications in computational biology and other fields. This work uses a recent result on combinatorial optimization of linear predictors based on string kernels to develop, for the pre-image, a low complexity upper bound valid for many string kernels. This upper bound is used with success in a branch and bound searching algorithm. Applications and results in the discovery of druggable peptides are presented and discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 Dec 2014 20:33:57 GMT  (14kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1463v1", "Peer-reviewed and accepted for presentation at Machine Learning in Computational Biology 2014, Montr\\'{e}al, Qu\\'{e}bec, Canada"], ["v2", "Thu, 4 Dec 2014 02:51:56 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1463v2", "Peer-reviewed and accepted for presentation at Machine Learning in Computational Biology 2014, Montr\\'eal, Qu\\'ebec, Canada"]], "COMMENTS": "Peer-reviewed and accepted for presentation at Machine Learning in Computational Biology 2014, Montr\\'{e}al, Qu\\'{e}bec, Canada", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE", "authors": ["s\\'ebastien gigu\\`ere", "am\\'elie rolland", "fran\\c{c}ois laviolette", "mario marchand"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.1463"}
