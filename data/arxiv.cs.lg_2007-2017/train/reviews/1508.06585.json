{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "26-Aug-2015", "title": "Towards universal neural nets: Gibbs machines and ACE", "abstract": "We study a class of neural nets - Gibbs machines - which are a type of variational auto-encoders, designed for gradual learning. They offer an universal platform for incrementally adding newly learned features, including physical symmetries in space/time. Combining them with classifiers gives rise to a brand of universal generative neural nets - stochastic auto-classifier-encoders (ACE). ACE preserve the non-Gaussian and clustering nature of real-life data and have state-of-the-art performance, both for classification and density estimation for the MNIST data set.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Aug 2015 17:43:08 GMT  (658kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06585v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 5 Sep 2015 21:49:06 GMT  (658kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06585v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 10 Nov 2015 03:35:59 GMT  (658kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06585v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 8 Apr 2016 22:11:23 GMT  (658kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06585v4", null], ["v5", "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 06:26:34 GMT  (651kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06585v5", "v5: added thermodynamic identities and variational error estimation; expanded references"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["galin georgiev"], "accepted": false, "id": "1508.06585"}
