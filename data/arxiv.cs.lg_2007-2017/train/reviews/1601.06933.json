In feature selection algorithms search strategies are key aspects. Since feature selection is an NP-Hard problem; therefore heuristic algorithms have been studied to solve this problem. In this paper, we have proposed a method based on memetic algorithm to find an efficient feature subset for a classification problem. It incorporates a filter method in the genetic algorithm to improve classification performance and accelerates the search in identifying core feature subsets. Particularly, the method adds or deletes a feature from a candidate feature subset based on the multivariate feature information. Empirical study on commonly data sets of the university of California, Irvine shows that the proposed method outperforms existing methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 26 Jan 2016 09:07:08 GMT  (233kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06933v1", "M., Montazeri, H.
