They showed that this single deterministic condition encompasses many previously studied clustering assumptions. More specifically, their proximity condition requires that in the target $k$-clustering, the projection of a point $x$ onto the line joining its cluster center $\\mu$ and some other center $\\mu'$, is a large additive factor closer to $\\mu$ than to $\\mu'$. This additive factor can be roughly described as $k$ times the spectral norm of the matrix representing the differences between the given (known) dataset and the means of the (unknown) target clustering. Clearly, the proximity condition implies center separation -- the distance between any two centers must be as large as the above mentioned bound.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 14 Jun 2012 18:23:46 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3204v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 15 Jun 2012 18:11:27 GMT  (42kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.3204v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["pranjal awasthi", "or sheffet"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.3204"}
