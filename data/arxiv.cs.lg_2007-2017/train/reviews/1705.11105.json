Although flatten labels is feasible, it misses the hierarchical information in the labels. Hierarchical models like HSVM by \\cite{vural2004hierarchical} becomes impossible to train because of the sheer number of SVMs in the whole architecture. We developed a hierarchical architecture based on neural networks that is simple to train. Also, we derived an inference algorithm that can efficiently infer the MAP (maximum a posteriori) trace guaranteed by our theorems. Furthermore, the complexity of the model is only $O(n^2)$ compared to $O(n^h)$ in a flatten model, where $h$ is the height of the hierarchy.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 May 2017 14:08:03 GMT  (928kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.11105v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["zhenzhou wu", "sean saito"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.11105"}
