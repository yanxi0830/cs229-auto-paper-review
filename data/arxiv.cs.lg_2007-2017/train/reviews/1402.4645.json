Semisupervised learning based methods are preferred when compared to the supervised and unsupervised learning because of the improved performance shown by the semisupervised approaches in the presence of large volumes of data. Labels are very hard to attain while unlabeled data are surplus, therefore semisupervised learning is a noble indication to shrink human labor and improve accuracy. There has been a large spectrum of ideas on semisupervised learning. In this paper we bring out some of the key approaches for semisupervised learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Feb 2014 12:40:31 GMT  (203kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4645v1", "5 Pages, 3 figures, Published with International Journal of Computer Trends and Technology (IJCTT)"]], "COMMENTS": "5 Pages, 3 figures, Published with International Journal of Computer Trends and Technology (IJCTT)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["v jothi prakash", "dr l m nithya"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.4645"}
