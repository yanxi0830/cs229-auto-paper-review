Most previous work focuses on developing probabilistic models or parameterized strategies for specific applications. Inspired by the recent success of deep reinforcement learning, we present neural-based models that jointly learn a policy and the behavior of opponents. Instead of explicitly predicting the opponent's action, we encode observation of the opponents into a deep Q-Network (DQN); however, we retain explicit modeling (if desired) using multitasking. By using a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, our model automatically discovers different strategy patterns of opponents without extra supervision. We evaluate our models on a simulated soccer game and a popular trivia game, showing superior performance over DQN and its variants.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 18 Sep 2016 22:06:36 GMT  (1190kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.05559v1", "In ICML 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "In ICML 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["he he", "jordan l boyd-graber"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.05559"}
