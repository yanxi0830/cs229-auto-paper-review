We first consider a spectral version of the holographic embedding, exploiting the frequency domain in the Fourier transform for efficient computation. The analysis of the resulting method reveals that it can be viewed as an instance of the complex embedding with certain constraints cast on the initial vectors upon training. Conversely, any complex embedding can be converted to an equivalent holographic embedding.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 18 Feb 2017 03:38:12 GMT  (122kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05563v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 11 Mar 2017 11:30:19 GMT  (119kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05563v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 22 Sep 2017 10:06:53 GMT  (132kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05563v3", "This is a slightly modified version of the paper of the same title that appeared in ACL 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["katsuhiko hayashi", "masashi shimbo"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.05563"}
