The mapping's objective is to have the output image as similar as possible to the input image. During training, no supervision is given in the form of matching inputs and outputs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Apr 2017 11:19:45 GMT  (7045kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05693v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 9 Jul 2017 16:10:53 GMT  (7045kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.05693v2", "v2 -- a change in the references due to a request from authors"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["lior wolf", "yaniv taigman", "adam polyak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.05693"}
