In particular, recent approaches for discovering similar motifs of different lengths have been proposed. In this work, we show that such variable-length similarity-based motifs cannot be directly compared, and hence ranked, by their normalized dissimilarities. Specifically, we find that length-normalized motif dissimilarities still have intrinsic dependencies on the motif length, and that lowest dissimilarities are particularly affected by this dependency. Moreover, we find that such dependencies are generally non-linear and change with the considered data set and dissimilarity measure. Based on these findings, we propose a solution to rank those motifs and measure their significance. This solution relies on a compact but accurate model of the dissimilarity space, using a beta distribution with three parameters that depend on the motif length in a non-linear way. We believe the incomparability of variable-length dissimilarities could go beyond the field of time series, and that similar modeling strategies as the one used here could be of help in a more broad context.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Mar 2015 09:10:34 GMT  (318kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01883v1", "20 pages, 10 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages, 10 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["joan serr\\`a", "isabel serra", "\\'alvaro corral", "josep lluis arcos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.01883"}
