Prior research has considered the effects of classical sketch on least squares regression (LSR), a strictly simpler problem. We establish that classical sketch has a similar effect upon the optimization properties of MRR as it does on those of LSR -- namely, it recovers nearly optimal solutions. In contrast, Hessian sketch does not have this guarantee; instead, the approximation error is governed by a subtle interplay between the \"mass\" in the responses and the optimal objective value.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Feb 2017 02:01:26 GMT  (997kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04837v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 25 Feb 2017 02:59:41 GMT  (1007kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04837v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 10 Jun 2017 17:52:18 GMT  (909kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.04837v3", "A short version will appear in the thirty-fourth International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2017)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG cs.NA", "authors": ["shusen wang", "alex gittens", "michael w mahoney"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.04837"}
