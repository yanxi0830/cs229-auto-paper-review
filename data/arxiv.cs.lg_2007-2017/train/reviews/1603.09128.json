Our model consists of an encoder, which uses monolingual and bilingual context (i.e. a parallel sentence) to choose a sense for a given word, and a decoder which predicts context words based on the chosen sense. The two components are estimated jointly. We observe that the word representations induced from bilingual data outperform the monolingual counterparts across a range of evaluation tasks, even though crosslingual information is not available at test time.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Mar 2016 11:09:01 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09128v1", "11 pages, to appear at NAACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, to appear at NAACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["simon suster", "ivan titov", "gertjan van noord"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.09128"}
