Such searching typically takes place within the restricted space of co-active rules for efficiency. This paper gives an historical overview of the evolution of such systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jan 2014 14:37:48 GMT  (829kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3607v1", "17 pages, 5 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 7 Feb 2014 11:55:12 GMT  (1192kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.3607v2", "37 pages, 9 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "17 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["larry bull"], "accepted": false, "id": "1401.3607"}
