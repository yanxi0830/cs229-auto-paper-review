We complement these guarantees by demonstrating almost matching hardness lower bounds, which show that our bound is nearly optimal. Our result yields new insight into margin-based nearest neighbor classification in metric spaces and allows us to significantly sharpen and simplify existing bounds. Some encouraging empirical results are also presented.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 13 Apr 2014 11:13:02 GMT  (54kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3368v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 4 Dec 2014 15:23:49 GMT  (96kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3368v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 5 Dec 2014 10:38:21 GMT  (92kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3368v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CC", "authors": ["lee-ad gottlieb", "aryeh kontorovich", "pinhas nisnevitch"], "accepted": true, "id": "1404.3368"}
