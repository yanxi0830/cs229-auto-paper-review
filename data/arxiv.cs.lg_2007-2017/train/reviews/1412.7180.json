We explore two classes of algorithms for efficiently exploring the translation space, with the first based on N-best lists and the second based on a hypergraph representation that compactly represents an exponential number of translation options. Our algorithms exhibit faster convergence and are capable of obtaining lower error rates than the existing translation model specific approaches, all within a generic Bayesian optimisation framework. Further more, we also introduce a random embedding algorithm to scale our approach to sparse high dimensional feature sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 21:44:00 GMT  (48kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7180v1", "Bayesian optimisation workshop, NIPS 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Bayesian optimisation workshop, NIPS 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["yishu miao", "ziyu wang", "phil blunsom"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.7180"}
