{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "6-Oct-2016", "title": "Using Non-invertible Data Transformations to Build Adversarial-Robust Neural Networks", "abstract": "Deep neural networks have proven to be quite effective in a wide variety of machine learning tasks, ranging from improved speech recognition systems to advancing the development of autonomous vehicles. However, despite their superior performance in many applications, these models have been recently shown to be susceptible to a particular type of attack possible through the generation of particular synthetic examples referred to as adversarial samples. These samples are constructed by manipulating real examples from the training data distribution in order to \"fool\" the original neural model, resulting in misclassification (with high confidence) of previously correctly classified samples. Addressing this weakness is of utmost importance if deep neural architectures are to be applied to critical applications, such as those in the domain of cybersecurity. In this paper, we present an analysis of this fundamental flaw lurking in all neural architectures to uncover limitations of previously proposed defense mechanisms. More importantly, we present a unifying framework for protecting deep neural models using a non-invertible data transformation--developing two adversary-resilient architectures utilizing both linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction. Empirical results indicate that our framework provides better robustness compared to state-of-art solutions while having negligible degradation in accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Oct 2016 16:20:45 GMT  (986kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01934v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 7 Oct 2016 14:08:07 GMT  (986kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01934v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 17 Oct 2016 15:45:44 GMT  (987kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01934v3", null], ["v4", "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 19:53:00 GMT  (987kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01934v4", null], ["v5", "Tue, 13 Dec 2016 20:13:33 GMT  (987kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.01934v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["qinglong wang", "wenbo guo", "alexander g ororbia ii", "xinyu xing", "lin lin", "c lee giles", "xue liu", "peng liu", "gang xiong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.01934"}
