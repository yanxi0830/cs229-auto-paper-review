{"conference": "ACL", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "25-Apr-2017", "title": "Abstract Syntax Networks for Code Generation and Semantic Parsing", "abstract": "Tasks like code generation and semantic parsing require mapping unstructured (or partially structured) inputs to well-formed, executable outputs. We introduce abstract syntax networks, a modeling framework for these problems. The outputs are represented as abstract syntax trees (ASTs) and constructed by a decoder with a dynamically-determined modular structure paralleling the structure of the output tree. On the benchmark Hearthstone dataset for code generation, our model obtains 79.2 BLEU and 22.7% exact match accuracy, compared to previous state-of-the-art values of 67.1 and 6.1%. Furthermore, we perform competitively on the Atis, Jobs, and Geo semantic parsing datasets with no task-specific engineering.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 04:37:35 GMT  (952kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07535v1", "ACL 2017.
