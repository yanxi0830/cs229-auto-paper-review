This is a realistic generalization of the random classification noise model, where the adversary can flip each example $x$ with probability $\\eta(x) \\leq \\eta$. We provide the first polynomial time algorithm that can learn linear separators to arbitrarily small excess error in this noise model under the uniform distribution over the unit ball in $\\Re^d$, for some constant value of $\\eta$. While widely studied in the statistical learning theory community in the context of getting faster convergence rates, computationally efficient algorithms in this model had remained elusive. Our work provides the first evidence that one can indeed design algorithms achieving arbitrarily small excess error in polynomial time under this realistic noise model and thus opens up a new and exciting line of research.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Mar 2015 05:38:19 GMT  (1039kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03594v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CC", "authors": ["pranjal awasthi", "maria-florina balcan", "nika haghtalab", "ruth urner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.03594"}
