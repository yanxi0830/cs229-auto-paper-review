Here, we first propose a new intuitive principle of unsupervised deep learning from time series which uses the nonstationary structure of the data. Our learning principle, time-contrastive learning (TCL), finds a representation which allows optimal discrimination of time segments (windows). Surprisingly, we show how TCL can be related to a nonlinear ICA model, when ICA is redefined to include temporal nonstationarities. In particular, we show that TCL combined with linear ICA estimates the nonlinear ICA model up to point-wise transformations of the sources, and this solution is unique --- thus providing the first identifiability result for nonlinear ICA which is rigorous, constructive, as well as very general.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 May 2016 12:59:22 GMT  (1287kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06336v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["aapo hyv\u00e4rinen", "hiroshi morioka"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.06336"}
