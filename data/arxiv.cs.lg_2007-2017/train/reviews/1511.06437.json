While essential object detection ingredients such as features, classifiers and proposal methods have been extensively researched it it surprising how little work has aimed to systematically address NMS. The de-facto standard for NMS is based on greedy clustering with a fixed distance threshold, which forces to trade-off recall versus precision. We propose a convnet designed to perform NMS of a given set of detections. We report experiments on a synthetic setup, and results on crowded pedestrian detection scenes. Our approach overcomes the intrinsic limitations of greedy NMS, obtaining better recall and precision.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 22:56:18 GMT  (6182kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06437v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 3 Dec 2015 08:16:33 GMT  (7671kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06437v2", "Added results on additional dataset"], ["v3", "Fri, 8 Jan 2016 00:00:21 GMT  (7672kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06437v3", "Included comments from reviewers"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["jan hosang", "rodrigo benenson", "bernt schiele"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06437"}
