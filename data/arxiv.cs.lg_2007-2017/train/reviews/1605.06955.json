However, such semi-supervised learning methods do not always perform well due to violation of the cluster and manifold assumptions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to semi-supervised learning that does not require such restrictive assumptions. Our key idea is to combine learning from positive and negative data (standard supervised learning) and learning from positive and unlabeled data (PU learning), the latter is guaranteed to be able to utilize unlabeled data without the cluster and manifold assumptions. We theoretically and experimentally show the usefulness of our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 May 2016 09:37:48 GMT  (153kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06955v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 14 Oct 2016 14:04:24 GMT  (261kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06955v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 11:39:31 GMT  (406kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06955v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 16 Jun 2017 11:14:36 GMT  (1750kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06955v4", "Accepted to the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2017)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["tomoya sakai", "marthinus christoffel du plessis", "gang niu", "masashi sugiyama"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.06955"}
