Many provably efficient algorithms have been developed for this problem recently, under specific click models. A click model is a model of how users click on a list of documents. Though these results are significant, the proposed algorithms have limited application because they are designed for specific click models, and do not have guarantees beyond them. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm, which we call MergeRank, for learning to rank in a class of click models that satisfy mild technical assumptions. This class encompasses two most fundamental click models, the cascade and position-based models. We derive a gap-dependent upper bound on the expected $n$-step regret of MergeRank and evaluate it on web search queries. We observe that MergeRank performs better than ranked bandits and is more robust than CascadeKL-UCB, an existing algorithm for learning to rank in the cascade model.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Mar 2017 18:53:58 GMT  (155kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02527v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 20 Jun 2017 07:13:15 GMT  (157kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02527v2", "Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["masrour zoghi", "tom\u00e1s tunys", "mohammad ghavamzadeh", "branislav kveton", "csaba szepesv\u00e1ri", "zheng wen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.02527"}
