Requiring that the perceptron updates its internal state whenever the normalized margin of a pattern is found not to exceed a certain fraction of this dynamic upper bound we construct a new approximate maximum margin classifier called the perceptron with dynamic margin (PDM). We demonstrate that PDM converges in a finite number of steps and derive an upper bound on them. We also compare experimentally PDM with other perceptron-like algorithms and support vector machines on hard margin tasks involving linear kernels which are equivalent to 2-norm soft margin.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 May 2011 17:02:09 GMT  (59kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.6041v1", "16 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["constantinos panagiotakopoulos", "petroula tsampouka"], "accepted": false, "id": "1105.6041"}
