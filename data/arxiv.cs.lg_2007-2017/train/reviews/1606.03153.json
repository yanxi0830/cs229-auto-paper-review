Word2Vec and its variants have successfully mapped words with similar syntactic or semantic meanings to nearby vectors. However, extracting universal embeddings of longer word-sequences remains a challenging task. We employ the convolutional dictionary model for unsupervised learning of embeddings for variable length word-sequences. We propose a two-phase ConvDic+DeconvDec framework that first learns dictionary elements (i.e., phrase templates), and then employs them for decoding the activations. The estimated activations are then used as embeddings for downstream tasks such as sentiment analysis, paraphrase detection, and semantic textual similarity estimation. We propose a convolutional tensor decomposition algorithm for learning the phrase templates. It is shown to be more accurate, and much more efficient than the popular alternating minimization in dictionary learning literature. Our word-sequence embeddings achieve state-of-the-art performance in sentiment classification, semantic textual similarity estimation, and paraphrase detection over eight datasets from various domains, without requiring pre-training or additional features.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 01:22:32 GMT  (67kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03153v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 4 May 2017 22:32:17 GMT  (60kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03153v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["furong huang", "animashree anandkumar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.03153"}
