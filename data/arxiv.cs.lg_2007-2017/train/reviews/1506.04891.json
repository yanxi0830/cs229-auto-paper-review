This paper describes a novel approach where the output layer of a character-level RNN language model is split into several independent predictive sub-models, each representing an author, while the recurrent layer is shared by all. This allows the recurrent layer to model the language as a whole without over-fitting, while the outputs select aspects of the underlying model that reflect their author's style. The method proves competitive, ranking first in two of the four languages.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Jun 2015 09:41:55 GMT  (503kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04891v1", "8 pages, 3 figures Notebook for the PAN@CLEF Author Identification challange"], ["v2", "Tue, 16 Aug 2016 05:04:57 GMT  (502kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04891v2", "8 pages, 3 figures Version 1 was a notebook for the PAN@CLEF Author Identification challenge.
