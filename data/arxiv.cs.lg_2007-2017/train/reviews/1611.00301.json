This approach holds promise in significantly increasing the ability of naive anomaly detection to detect small anomalies in highly complex complexity multi-user radio bands. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on a number of common real over the air radio communications bands of interest and quantify detection performance in terms of probability of detection an false alarm rates across a range of interference to band power ratios and compare to baseline methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Nov 2016 17:17:26 GMT  (4437kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00301v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["timothy j o'shea", "t charles clancy", "robert w mcgwier"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00301"}
