The combination of Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks in these models has proven to outperform the previous state of the art, obtaining more accurate video descriptions. In this work we propose pushing further this model by introducing two contributions into the encoding stage. First, producing richer image representations by combining object and location information from Convolutional Neural Networks and second, introducing Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks for capturing both forward and backward temporal relationships in the input frames.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 12 Apr 2016 13:09:01 GMT  (1322kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03390v1", "8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, Submitted to International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (ICANN)"], ["v2", "Mon, 12 Dec 2016 12:28:07 GMT  (1320kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03390v2", "8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, Submitted to International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (ICANN)"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, Submitted to International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (ICANN)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["\\'alvaro peris", "marc bola\\~nos", "petia radeva", "francisco casacuberta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.03390"}
