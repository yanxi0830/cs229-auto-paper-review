The goal of this exploration is to reduce execution time while meeting our quality of result objectives. In previous work we showed for the first time that it is possible to map this application to power constrained embedded systems, highlighting that decision choices made at the algorithmic design-level have the most impact.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Feb 2017 00:01:46 GMT  (735kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00505v1", "10 pages, Keywords: design space exploration, machine learning, computer vision, SLAM, embedded systems, GPU, crowd-sourcing"], ["v2", "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 21:58:41 GMT  (736kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.00505v2", "10 pages, Keywords: design space exploration, machine learning, computer vision, SLAM, embedded systems, GPU, crowd-sourcing"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, Keywords: design space exploration, machine learning, computer vision, SLAM, embedded systems, GPU, crowd-sourcing", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.DC cs.LG cs.PF", "authors": ["luigi nardi", "bruno bodin", "sajad saeedi", "emanuele vespa", "rew j davison", "paul h j kelly"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.00505"}
