In particular, polynomial approximations to the sign function underly algorithms for agnostically learning halfspaces, as well as pseudorandom generators for halfspaces. In this work, we investigate the limits of these techniques by proving inapproximability results for the sign function.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Dec 2014 05:58:56 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2457v1", "22 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CC cs.LG", "authors": ["mark bun", "thomas steinke"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.2457"}
