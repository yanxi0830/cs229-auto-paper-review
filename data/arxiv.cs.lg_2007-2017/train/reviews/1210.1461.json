It approximates any data matrix in terms of a small number of its columns and rows. In this paper we propose a novel randomized CUR algorithm with an expected relative-error bound. The proposed algorithm has the advantages over the existing relative-error CUR algorithms that it possesses tighter theoretical bound and lower time complexity, and that it can avoid maintaining the whole data matrix in main memory. Finally, experiments on several real-world datasets demonstrate significant improvement over the existing relative-error algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Oct 2012 14:23:34 GMT  (105kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1461v1", "accepted by NIPS 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted by NIPS 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DM stat.ML", "authors": ["shusen wang", "zhihua zhang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1210.1461"}
