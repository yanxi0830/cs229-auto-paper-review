The objectives of this study are to develop approaches to predict the scores a stu- dent may achieve on a given grade-related assessment based on information, considered as prior performance or prior ac- tivity in the course. We develop a personalized linear mul- tiple regression (PLMR) model to predict the grade for a student, prior to attempting the assessment activity. The developed model is real-time and tracks the participation of a student within a MOOC (via click-stream server logs) and predicts the performance of a student on the next as- sessment within the course offering. We perform a com- prehensive set of experiments on data obtained from three openEdX MOOCs via a Stanford University initiative. Our experimental results show the promise of the proposed ap- proach in comparison to baseline approaches and also helps in identification of key features that are associated with the study habits and learning behaviors of students.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 8 May 2016 04:00:31 GMT  (664kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02269v1", "8 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.LG", "authors": ["zhiyun ren", "huzefa rangwala", "aditya johri"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.02269"}
