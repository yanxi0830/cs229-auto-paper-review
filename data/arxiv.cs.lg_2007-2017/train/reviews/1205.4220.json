{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-May-2012", "title": "Diffusion Adaptation over Networks", "abstract": "Adaptive networks are well-suited to perform decentralized information processing and optimization tasks and to model various types of self organized and complex behavior encountered in nature. Adaptive networks consist of a collection of agents with processing and learning abilities. The agents are linked together through a connection topology, and they cooperate with each other through local interactions to solve distributed inference problems in real-time. The continuous diffusion of information across the network enables agents to adapt their performance in relation to changing data and network conditions; it also results in improved adaptation and learning performance relative to non-cooperative networks. This article provides an overview of diffusion strategies for adaptation and learning over networks. The article is divided into several sections: 1. Motivation; 2. Mean-Square-Error Estimation; 3. Distributed Optimization via Diffusion Strategies; 4. Adaptive Diffusion Strategies; 5. Performance of Steepest-Descent Diffusion Strategies; 6. Performance of Adaptive Diffusion Strategies; 7. Comparing the Performance of Cooperative Strategies; 8. Selecting the Combination Weights; 9. Diffusion with Noisy Information Exchanges; 10. Extensions and Further Considerations; Appendix A: Properties of Kronecker Products; Appendix B: Graph Laplacian and Network Connectivity; Appendix C: Stochastic Matrices; Appendix D: Block Maximum Norm; Appendix E: Comparison with Consensus Strategies; References.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 May 2012 19:09:46 GMT  (586kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.4220v1", "114 pages, 16 figures, 9 tables, to appear in E-Reference Signal Processing, R.
