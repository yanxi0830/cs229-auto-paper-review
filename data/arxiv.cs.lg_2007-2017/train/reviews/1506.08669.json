{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "29-Jun-2015", "title": "Efficient and Parsimonious Agnostic Active Learning", "abstract": "We develop a new active learning algorithm for the streaming setting satisfying three important properties: 1) It provably works for any classifier representation and classification problem including those with severe noise. 2) It is efficiently implementable with an ERM oracle. 3) It is more aggressive than all previous approaches satisfying 1 and 2. To do this we create an algorithm based on a newly defined optimization problem and analyze it. We also conduct the first experimental analysis of all efficient agnostic active learning algorithms, discovering that this one is typically better across a wide variety of datasets and label complexities.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Jun 2015 15:02:55 GMT  (149kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08669v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 6 Jan 2016 02:49:21 GMT  (441kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08669v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 18:27:33 GMT  (477kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08669v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["tzu-kuo huang", "alekh agarwal", "daniel j hsu", "john langford", "robert e schapire"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.08669"}
