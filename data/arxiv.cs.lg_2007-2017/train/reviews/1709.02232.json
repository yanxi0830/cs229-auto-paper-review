This work continues a previously proposed LSTM-based approach to the fault detection in simpler data. It is considered necessary to adapt the RNN network to deal with data containing stochastic, stationary, transitive and a rich variety of anomalous behaviours. There is particular focus on early detection with special NAB-metric. A comparison with the DPCA approach is provided. The generated data set is made publicly available.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 Sep 2017 13:45:29 GMT  (852kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02232v1", "ICML 2017 Time Series Workshop, Sydney, Australia, 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML 2017 Time Series Workshop, Sydney, Australia, 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["pavel filonov", "fedor kitashov", "rey lavrentyev"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.02232"}
