We propose deep structured energy based models (DSEBMs), where the energy function is the output of a deterministic deep neural network with structure. We develop novel model architectures to integrate EBMs with different types of data such as static data, sequential data, and spatial data, and apply appropriate model architectures to adapt to the data structure. Our training algorithm is built upon the recent development of score matching \\cite{sm}, which connects an EBM with a regularized autoencoder, eliminating the need for complicated sampling method. Statistically sound decision criterion can be derived for anomaly detection purpose from the perspective of the energy landscape of the data distribution. We investigate two decision criteria for performing anomaly detection: the energy score and the reconstruction error. Extensive empirical studies on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our proposed model consistently matches or outperforms all the competing methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 May 2016 03:40:18 GMT  (8782kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07717v1", "To appear in ICML 2016"], ["v2", "Thu, 16 Jun 2016 02:36:10 GMT  (8782kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07717v2", "To appear in ICML 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in ICML 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["shuangfei zhai", "yu cheng", "weining lu", "zhongfei zhang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.07717"}
