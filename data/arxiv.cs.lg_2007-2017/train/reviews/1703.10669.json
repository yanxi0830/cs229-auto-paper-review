It is applicable in settings where QoS satisfaction of an arm has to be ensured with high confidence efficiently, rather than finding the optimal arm while minimizing regret. Preliminary experimental results encourage further research in the field of QoS-aware decision making.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 15:01:51 GMT  (297kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10669v1", "Accepted at IEEE Workshop on Quality Assurance for Self-adaptive Self-organising Systems, FAS* 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted at IEEE Workshop on Quality Assurance for Self-adaptive Self-organising Systems, FAS* 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SE", "authors": ["lenz belzner", "thomas gabor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.10669"}
