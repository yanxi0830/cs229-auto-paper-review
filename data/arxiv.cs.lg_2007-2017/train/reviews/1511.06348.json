Combined with the inherent nature of medical images that make them ideal for deep-learning, further application of such systems to medical image classification holds much promise. However, the usefulness and potential impact of such a system can be completely negated if it does not reach a target accuracy. In this paper, we present a study on determining the optimum size of the training data set necessary to achieve high classification accuracy with low variance in medical image classification systems. The CNN was applied to classify axial Computed Tomography (CT) images into six anatomical classes. We trained the CNN using six different sizes of training data set (5, 10, 20, 50, 100, and 200) and then tested the resulting system with a total of 6000 CT images. All images were acquired from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). Using this data, we employ the learning curve approach to predict classification accuracy at a given training sample size. Our research will present a general methodology for determining the training data set size necessary to achieve a certain target classification accuracy that can be easily applied to other problems within such systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 20:38:43 GMT  (2696kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06348v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 21:08:10 GMT  (2698kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06348v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["junghwan cho", "kyewook lee", "ellie shin", "garry choy", "synho do"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06348"}
