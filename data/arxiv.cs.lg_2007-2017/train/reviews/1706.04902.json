This allows us to apply models trained on languages with a lot of data, e.g. English to low-resource languages. In the following, we will survey models that seek to learn cross-lingual embeddings. We will discuss them based on the type of approach and the nature of parallel data that they employ. Finally, we will present challenges and summarize how to evaluate cross-lingual embedding models.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 14:46:56 GMT  (1827kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04902v1", "23 pages, 17 figures, 2 tables"], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Oct 2017 10:44:06 GMT  (2430kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04902v2", "Very heavily improved and revised version"]], "COMMENTS": "23 pages, 17 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["sebastian ruder"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.04902"}
