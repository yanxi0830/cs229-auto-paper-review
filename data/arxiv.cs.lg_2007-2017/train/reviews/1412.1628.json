In this paper, we present a straightforward framework for better image representation by combining the two approaches. To take advantages of both representations, we propose an efficient method to extract a fair amount of multi-scale dense local activations from a pre-trained CNN. We then aggregate the activations by Fisher kernel framework, which has been modified with a simple scale-wise normalization essential to make it suitable for CNN activations. Replacing the direct use of a single activation vector with our representation demonstrates significant performance improvements: +17.76 (Acc.) on MIT Indoor 67 and +7.18 (mAP) on PASCAL VOC 2007. The results suggest that our proposal can be used as a primary image representation for better performances in visual recognition tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Dec 2014 11:30:57 GMT  (1994kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1628v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 19 Dec 2014 07:16:18 GMT  (1994kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1628v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["donggeun yoo", "sunggyun park", "joon-young lee", "in so kweon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.1628"}
