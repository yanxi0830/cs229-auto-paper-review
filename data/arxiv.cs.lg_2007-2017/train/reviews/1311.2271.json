That is, if more data is available, beyond the sample complexity limit, is it possible to use the extra examples to speed up the computation time required to perform the learning task?", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 10 Nov 2013 13:28:19 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2271v1", "13 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["amit daniely", "nati linial", "shai shalev-shwartz"], "accepted": true, "id": "1311.2271"}
