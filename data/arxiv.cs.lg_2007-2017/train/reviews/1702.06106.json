Neural networks have been successfully applied to this problem, and in this paper, we propose an attention-based deep neural network which better incorporates different embeddings of the queries and search results with an attention-based mechanism. This model also applies a decoder mechanism to learn the ranks of the search results in a listwise fashion. The embeddings are trained with convolutional neural networks or the word2vec model. We demonstrate the performance of this model with image retrieval and text querying data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Feb 2017 18:47:25 GMT  (171kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06106v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 15 May 2017 23:57:57 GMT  (452kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06106v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["baiyang wang", "diego klabjan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06106"}
