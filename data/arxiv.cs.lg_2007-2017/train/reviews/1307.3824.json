We demonstrate that implicit concurrency is indeed a form of efficient learning by showing that it can be used to obtain close-to-optimal bounds on the time and queries required to approximately correctly solve a constrained version (k=7, \\eta=1/5) of a recognizable computational learning problem: learning parities with noisy membership queries. We argue that a UGA that treats the noisy membership query oracle as a fitness function can be straightforwardly used to approximately correctly learn the essential attributes in O(log^1.585 n) queries and O(n log^1.585 n) time, where n is the total number of attributes. Our proof relies on an accessible symmetry argument and the use of statistical hypothesis testing to reject a global null hypothesis at the 10^-100 level of significance. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the first relatively rigorous identification of efficient computational learning in an evolutionary algorithm on a non-trivial learning problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Jul 2013 06:32:52 GMT  (390kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.3824v1", "For an easy introduction to implicit concurrency (with animations), visitthis http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "For an easy introduction to implicit concurrency (with animations), visitthis http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.CC cs.DM cs.LG", "authors": ["keki m burjorjee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.3824"}
