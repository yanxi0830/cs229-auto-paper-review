In this paper, we present the so-called Graph-based Semi-supervised Support Vector Machine (gS3VM), a method that leverages the excellent generalization ability of kernel-based method with the geometrical and distributive information carried in a spectral graph for semi-supervised learning purpose. The proposed gS3VM can be solved directly in the primal form using the Stochastic Gradient Descent method with the ideal convergence rate $O(\\frac{1}{T})$. Besides, our gS3VM allows the combinations of a wide spectrum of loss functions (e.g., Hinge, smooth Hinge, Logistic, L1, and {\\epsilon}-insensitive) and smoothness functions (i.e., $l_p(t) = |t|^p$ with $p\\ge1$). We note that the well-known Laplacian Support Vector Machine falls into the spectrum of gS3VM corresponding to the combination of the Hinge loss and the smoothness function $l_2(.)$. We further validate our proposed method on several benchmark datasets to demonstrate that gS3VM is appropriate for the large-scale datasets since it is optimal in memory used and yields superior classification accuracy whilst simultaneously achieving a significant computation speedup in comparison with the state-of-the-art baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 00:26:59 GMT  (2658kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06793v1", "18 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 6 Sep 2016 02:09:35 GMT  (8755kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06793v2", "15 pages"], ["v3", "Thu, 6 Apr 2017 02:40:23 GMT  (2731kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06793v3", "21 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["trung le", "khanh nguyen", "van nguyen", "vu nguyen", "dinh phung"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06793"}
