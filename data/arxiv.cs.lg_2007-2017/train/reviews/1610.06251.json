Conventionally, a graph structure is represented using an adjacency matrix or a set of hand-crafted structural features. These representations either fail to highlight local and global properties of the graph or suffer from a severe loss of structural information. There lacks an effective graph representation, which hinges the realization of the predictive power of network structures.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 00:16:05 GMT  (2925kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06251v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.LG", "authors": ["cheng li", "xiaoxiao guo", "qiaozhu mei"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.06251"}
