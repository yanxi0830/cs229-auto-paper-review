We present a procedure for efficient variational Bayesian learning of nonlinear state-space models based on sparse Gaussian processes. The result of learning is a tractable posterior over nonlinear dynamical systems. In comparison to conventional parametric models, we offer the possibility to straightforwardly trade off model capacity and computational cost whilst avoiding overfitting. Our main algorithm uses a hybrid inference approach combining variational Bayes and sequential Monte Carlo. We also present extensions to stochastic variational inference and online learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Jun 2014 22:16:27 GMT  (147kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4905v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 3 Nov 2014 08:17:59 GMT  (248kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4905v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.RO cs.SY stat.ML", "authors": ["roger frigola", "yutian chen", "carl e rasmussen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.4905"}
