The conventional way to answer this counterfactual question is to estimate the effect of the new treatment in comparison to that of the conventional treatment by running a controlled, randomized experiment. While this approach theoretically ensures an unbiased estimator, it suffers from several drawbacks, including the difficulty in finding representative experimental populations as well as the cost of running such trials. Moreover, such trials neglect the huge quantities of available control-condition data which are often completely ignored.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 22:12:52 GMT  (211kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07667v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 26 Oct 2016 06:11:07 GMT  (213kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.07667v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["nir rosenfeld", "yishay mansour", "elad yom-tov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.07667"}
