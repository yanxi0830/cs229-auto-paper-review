{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "29-Nov-2016", "title": "Associative Memory Using Dictionary Learning and Expander Decoding", "abstract": "An associative memory is a framework of content-addressable memory that stores a collection of message vectors (or a dataset) over a neural network while enabling a neurally feasible mechanism to recover any message in the dataset from its noisy version. Designing an associative memory requires addressing two main tasks: 1) learning phase: given a dataset, learn a concise representation of the dataset in the form of a graphical model (or a neural network), 2) recall phase: given a noisy version of a message vector from the dataset, output the correct message vector via a neurally feasible algorithm over the network learnt during the learning phase. This paper studies the problem of designing a class of neural associative memories which learns a network representation for a large dataset that ensures correction against a large number of adversarial errors during the recall phase. Specifically, the associative memories designed in this paper can store dataset containing $\\exp(n)$ $n$-length message vectors over a network with $O(n)$ nodes and can tolerate $\\Omega(\\frac{n}{{\\rm polylog} n})$ adversarial errors. This paper carries out this memory design by mapping the learning phase and recall phase to the tasks of dictionary learning with a square dictionary and iterative error correction in an expander code, respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Nov 2016 13:27:18 GMT  (47kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09621v1", "To appear in AAAI 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in AAAI 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "authors": ["arya mazumdar", "ankit singh rawat"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.09621"}
