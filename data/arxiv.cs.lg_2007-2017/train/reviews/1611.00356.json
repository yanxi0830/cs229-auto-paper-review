The declassification of millions of electronic records has made it possible to analyze these issues with greater rigor and precision. Using machine-learning methods, we examined nearly a million State Department cables from the 1970s to identify features of records that are more likely to be classified, such as international negotiations, military operations, and high-level communications. Even with incomplete data, algorithms can use such features to identify 90% of classified cables with &lt;11% false positives. But our results also show that there are longstanding problems in the identification of sensitive information. Error analysis reveals many examples of both overclassification and underclassification. This indicates both the need for research on inter-coder reliability among officials as to what constitutes classified material and the opportunity to develop recommender systems to better manage both classification and declassification.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Nov 2016 19:59:48 GMT  (642kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00356v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["renato rocha souza", "flavio codeco coelho", "rohan shah", "matthew connelly"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00356"}
