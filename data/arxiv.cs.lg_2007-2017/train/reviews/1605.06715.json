The model is designed by introducing a three-way weight tensor to capture the multiplicative interactions between side information and sequences. The proposed model builds on the Temporal Sigmoid Belief Network (TSBN), a sequential stack of Sigmoid Belief Networks (SBNs). The transition matrices are further factored to reduce the number of parameters and improve generalization. When side information is not available, a general framework for semi-supervised learning based on the proposed model is constituted, allowing robust sequence classification. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art predictive and classification performance on sequential data, and has the capacity to synthesize sequences, with controlled style transitioning and blending.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 22 May 2016 00:17:31 GMT  (1511kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06715v1", "to appear in ICML 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "to appear in ICML 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["jiaming song", "zhe gan", "lawrence carin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.06715"}
