Our work is based on supervised learning and intelligent statistical features. We also explored, but abandoned, a grammatical approach. In testing, our implementation greatly outperforms that of an existing tool that relies on a Bayesian classifier.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Jun 2011 00:37:23 GMT  (7kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4064v1", "11 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 9 Nov 2011 19:45:30 GMT  (7kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.4064v2", "11 pages.
