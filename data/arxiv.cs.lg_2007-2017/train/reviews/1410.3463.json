Motivated by this, we investigate novel Bayesian non-parametric modeling(BNP) techniques for count vectors, to capture long range correlations for cache preloading, by mining Block I/O traces. Such traces comprise of a sequence of memory accesses that can be aggregated into high-dimensional sparse correlated count vector sequences.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 13 Oct 2014 14:26:28 GMT  (109kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.3463v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.OS cs.LG cs.SY", "authors": ["lavanya sita tekumalla", "chiranjib bhattacharyya"], "accepted": false, "id": "1410.3463"}
