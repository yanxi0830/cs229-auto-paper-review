This correlation is further verified by a set of experiments for phoneme segmentation, in which better results compared to standard approaches were obtained.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 10:08:51 GMT  (2823kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07588v1", "5 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 31 Aug 2017 12:01:36 GMT  (2823kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07588v2", "5 pages, The code is available atthis https URL"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["yu-hsuan wang", "cheng-tao chung", "hung-yi lee"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07588"}
