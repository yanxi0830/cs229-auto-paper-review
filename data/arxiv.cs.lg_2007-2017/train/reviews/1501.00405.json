The discovery of waveform patterns, also known as time-series motifs, has been studied extensively; however, available techniques for discovering frequently occurring time-series motifs were found lacking in either efficiency or quality: Standard subsequence clustering results in poor quality, to the extent that it has even been termed 'meaningless'. Variants of hierarchical clustering using techniques for efficient discovery of 'exact pair motifs' find high-quality frequent motifs, but at the cost of high computational complexity, making such techniques unusable for our voluminous vehicular sensor data. We show that good quality frequent motifs can be discovered using bounded spherical clustering of time-series subsequences, which we refer to as COIN clustering, with near linear complexity in time-series size. COIN clustering addresses many of the challenges that previously led to subsequence clustering being viewed as meaningless. We describe an end-to-end motif-discovery procedure using a sequence of pre and post-processing techniques that remove trivial-matches and shifted-motifs, which also plagued previous subsequence-clustering approaches. We demonstrate that our technique efficiently discovers frequent motifs in voluminous vehicular sensor data as well as in publicly available data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Jan 2015 14:09:46 GMT  (2588kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00405v1", "13 pages, 8 figures, Technical Report"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 8 figures, Technical Report", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.LG", "authors": ["puneet agarwal", "gautam shroff", "sarmimala saikia", "zaigham khan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.00405"}
