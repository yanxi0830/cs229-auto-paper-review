To create a description of an image for a given target language, our sequence generation models condition on feature vectors from the image, the description from the source language, and/or a multimodal vector computed over the image and a description in the source language. In image description experiments on the IAPR-TC12 dataset of images aligned with English and German sentences, we find significant and substantial improvements in BLEU4 and Meteor scores for models trained over multiple languages, compared to a monolingual baseline.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Oct 2015 20:29:21 GMT  (3153kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04709v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 17:04:35 GMT  (1036kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04709v2", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["desmond elliott", "stella frank", "eva hasler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.04709"}
