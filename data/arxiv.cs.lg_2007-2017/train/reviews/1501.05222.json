Often, tree structures are used to solve these problems efficiently. Dual-tree algorithms can efficiently solve or approximate many of these problems. Using cover trees, rigorous worst-case runtime guarantees have been proven for some of these algorithms. In this paper, we present a problem-independent runtime guarantee for any dual-tree algorithm using the cover tree, separating out the problem-dependent and the problem-independent elements. This allows us to just plug in bounds for the problem-dependent elements to get runtime guarantees for dual-tree algorithms for any pairwise statistical problem without re-deriving the entire proof. We demonstrate this plug-and-play procedure for nearest-neighbor search and approximate kernel density estimation to get improved runtime guarantees. Under mild assumptions, we also present the first linear runtime guarantee for dual-tree based range search.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 21 Jan 2015 16:39:43 GMT  (44kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05222v1", "Submitted to JMLR"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to JMLR", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["ryan r curtin", "dongryeol lee", "william b march", "parikshit ram"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.05222"}
