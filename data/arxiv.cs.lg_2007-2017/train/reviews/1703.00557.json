While prior work assumes a known model of information diffusion, we propose a parametrization in terms of pairwise reachability which makes our framework agnostic to the underlying diffusion model. We give a corresponding monotone, submodular surrogate function, and show that it is a good approximation to the original IM objective. We also consider the case of a new marketer looking to exploit an existing social network, while simultaneously learning the factors governing information propagation. For this, we propose a pairwise-influence semi-bandit feedback model and develop a LinUCB-based bandit algorithm. Our model-independent regret analysis shows that our bound on the cumulative regret has a better (as compared to previous work) dependence on the size of the network. By using the graph Laplacian eigenbasis to construct features, we describe a practical LinUCB implementation. Experimental evaluation suggests that our framework is robust to the underlying diffusion model and can efficiently learn a near-optimal solution.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 1 Mar 2017 23:54:40 GMT  (847kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00557v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["sharan vaswani", "branislav kveton", "zheng wen", "mohammad ghavamzadeh", "laks lakshmanan", "mark schmidt"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.00557"}
