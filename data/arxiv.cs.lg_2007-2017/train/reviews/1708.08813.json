Anomaly detection is presented from the perspective of Wireless sensor networks. Different approaches have been taken in the past, as we will see, not only to identify outliers, but also to establish the statistical properties of the different methods. The usual goal is to show that the approach is asymptotically efficient and that the metric used is unbiased or maybe biased.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Aug 2017 15:08:05 GMT  (992kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08813v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["pelumi oluwasanya"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.08813"}
