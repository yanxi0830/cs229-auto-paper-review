We propose new Universum-SVM formulation for regression problems that incorporates a priori knowledge in the form of additional data samples. These additional data samples or Universum belong to the same application domain as the training samples, but they follow a different distribution. Several empirical comparisons are presented to illustrate the utility of the proposed approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 May 2016 03:11:41 GMT  (260kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08497v1", "10 pages,11 figures, Thesis:this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages,11 figures, Thesis:this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["sauptik dhar", "vladimir cherkassky"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.08497"}
