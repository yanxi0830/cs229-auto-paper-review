In our setting, an individual example consists of a domain element $x$ labeled by $k$ unknown concepts $(c_1,\\ldots,c_k)$. The goal of a multi-learner is to output $k$ hypotheses $(h_1,\\ldots,h_k)$ that generalize the input examples.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Nov 2015 03:57:22 GMT  (35kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08552v1", "29 pages.
