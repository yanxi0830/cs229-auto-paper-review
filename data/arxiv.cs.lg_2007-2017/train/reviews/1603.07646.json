Considering tagging information is usually very sparse, effective learning from content and tag association is very crucial and challenging task. Recently, various neural representation learning models such as WSABIE and its variants show promising performance, mainly due to compact feature representations learned in a semantic space. However, their capacity is limited by a linear compositional approach for representing tags as sum of equal parts and hurt their performance. In this work, we propose a neural feedback relevance model for learning tag representations with weighted feature representations. Our experiments on two widely used datasets show significant improvement for quality of recommendations over various baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 16:39:37 GMT  (501kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07646v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["saurabh kataria"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.07646"}
