However, since programs can be arbitrarily complicated, inducing them directly from question-answer pairs is a formidable challenge. To make this task more feasible, we solve these problems by generating answer rationales, sequences of natural language and human-readable mathematical expressions that derive the final answer through a series of small steps. Although rationales do not explicitly specify programs, they provide a scaffolding for their structure via intermediate milestones. To evaluate our approach, we have created a new 100,000-sample dataset of questions, answers and rationales. Experimental results show that indirect supervision of program learning via answer rationales is a promising strategy for inducing arithmetic programs.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 May 2017 13:04:47 GMT  (1699kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04146v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 10 Oct 2017 14:57:26 GMT  (1699kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04146v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 23 Oct 2017 16:45:03 GMT  (1699kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04146v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["wang ling", "dani yogatama", "chris dyer", "phil blunsom"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.04146"}
