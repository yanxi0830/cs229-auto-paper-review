Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and SVM models were constructed, with SVM giving the best results: an improvement of 12.9\\% over binary models was achieved for hold out cross validation by augmenting with pairwise correlation probabilities of the labels.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Nov 2015 05:21:53 GMT  (580kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07953v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.SI", "authors": ["amit garg", "jonathan noyola", "romil verma", "ashutosh saxena", "aditya jami"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.07953"}
