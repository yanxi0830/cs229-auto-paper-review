Questions such as \"what if we model common cause Z\" and \"what if Y's dependence on X reverses\" inspire many candidate models to consider and compare, yet current tools emphasize constructing a final model all at once.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 Apr 2016 20:43:20 GMT  (1957kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04639v1", "Master's Thesis"]], "COMMENTS": "Master's Thesis", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.LG", "authors": ["dylan hutchison"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.04639"}
