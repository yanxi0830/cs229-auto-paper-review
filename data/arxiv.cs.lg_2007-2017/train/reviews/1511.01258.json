We present two random forest transfer algorithms. The first algorithm searches greedily for locally optimal modifications of each tree structure by trying to locally expand or reduce the tree around individual nodes. The second algorithm does not modify structure, but only the parameter (thresholds) associated with decision nodes. We also propose to combine both methods by considering an ensemble that contains the union of the two forests. The proposed methods exhibit impressive experimental results over a range of problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Nov 2015 09:41:12 GMT  (499kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01258v1", "2 columns, 14 pages, TPAMI submitted"], ["v2", "Sun, 8 Nov 2015 06:56:12 GMT  (499kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01258v2", "2 columns, 14 pages, TPAMI submitted"]], "COMMENTS": "2 columns, 14 pages, TPAMI submitted", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["noam segev", "maayan harel", "shie mannor", "koby crammer", "ran el-yaniv"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.01258"}
