Ranking the items in social media websites based on the amount of user participation in them, can be used in different applications, such as recommender systems. In this paper, we consider a tweet containing a rating for a movie as an instance and focus on ranking the instances of each user based on their engagement, i.e., the total number of retweets and favorites it will gain.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Jan 2015 14:54:12 GMT  (49kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.07467v1", "In Proceedings of the 2014 ACM Recommender Systems Challenge, RecSysChallenge '14"]], "COMMENTS": "In Proceedings of the 2014 ACM Recommender Systems Challenge, RecSysChallenge '14", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["hamed zamani", "azadeh shakery", "pooya moradi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.07467"}
