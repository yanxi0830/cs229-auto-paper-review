Spatio-temporal alignment of registration of the incoming information is often a prerequisite to analyzing the fused data. The persistence and reliability of multi-modal registration is therefore the key to the stability of decision support systems ingesting the fused information. LiDAR-video systems like on those many driverless cars are a common example of where keeping the LiDAR and video channels registered to common physical features is important. We develop a deep learning method that takes multiple channels of heterogeneous data, to detect the misalignment of the LiDAR-video inputs. A number of variations were tested on the Ford LiDAR-video driving test data set and will be discussed. To the best of our knowledge the use of multi-modal deep convolutional neural networks for dynamic real-time LiDAR-video registration has not been presented.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 14:54:53 GMT  (3190kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7006v1", "submitted, 9 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Jul 2015 01:14:14 GMT  (3557kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7006v2", "7 pages, double column, IEEE format, accepted at IEEE HPEC 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted, 9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["michael giering", "vivek venugopalan", "kishore reddy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.7006"}
