Several key applications of LFMs need non-linearities, which results in analytically intractable inference. In this work we show how non-linear LFMs can be represented as non-linear white noise driven state-space models and present an efficient non-linear Kalman filtering and smoothing based method for approximate state and parameter inference. We illustrate the performance of the proposed methodology via two simulated examples, and apply it to a real-world problem of long-term prediction of GPS satellite orbits.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:34:23 GMT  (690kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4670v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IT astro-ph.EP cs.LG math.IT physics.data-an", "authors": ["jouni hartikainen", "mari sepp\u00e4nen", "simo s\u00e4rkk\u00e4"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4670"}
