The key object that defines an ExGM is often referred to as a graphon. This non-parametric perspective on network modeling poses challenging questions on how to make inference on the graphon underlying observed network data. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient procedure to estimate a graphon from a set of observed networks generated from it. This procedure is based on a stochastic blockmodel approximation (SBA) of the graphon. We show that, by approximating the graphon with a stochastic block model, the graphon can be consistently estimated, that is, the estimation error vanishes as the size of the graph approaches infinity.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 Nov 2013 16:20:02 GMT  (3016kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1731v1", "20 pages, 4 figures, 2 algorithms.
