Such methods can have significant benefits from a practical point of view since they remove the need to invert a sample covariance matrix, which can suffer from estimation error and will almost certainly be non-stationary. The general idea is to find groups of assets which share similar return characteristics over time and treat each group as a single composite asset. We then apply inverse volatility weightings to these new composite assets. In the course of our investigation we devise a method of clustering based on triangular potentials and we present associated theoretical results as well as various examples based on synthetic data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Feb 2015 00:27:39 GMT  (1703kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05090v1", "AIFU15"]], "COMMENTS": "AIFU15", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["aldo pacchiano", "oliver williams"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.05090"}
