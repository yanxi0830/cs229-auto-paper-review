However generating adversarial instances for tree ensembles, a piecewise constant class of models, has remained an open problem. In this paper, we construct both exact and approximate evasion algorithms for tree ensembles: for a given instance x we find the \"nearest\" instance x' such that the classifier predictions of x and x' are different. First, we show that finding such instances is practically possible despite tree ensemble models being non-differentiable and the optimal evasion problem being NP-hard.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 25 Sep 2015 20:57:35 GMT  (317kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07892v1", "9 pages, 9 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 27 May 2016 01:09:22 GMT  (891kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07892v2", "11 pages, 7 figures, Appears in Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), New York, NY, USA, 2016.
