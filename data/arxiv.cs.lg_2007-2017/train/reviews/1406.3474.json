In particular, we simultaneously learn a pose-joint regressor and a sliding-window body-part detector in a deep network architecture. We show that including the body-part detection task helps to regularize the network, directing it to converge to a good solution. We report competitive and state-of-art results on several data sets. We also empirically show that the learned neurons in the middle layer of our network are tuned to localized body parts.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 13 Jun 2014 10:11:18 GMT  (3676kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3474v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["sijin li", "zhi-qiang liu", "antoni b chan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.3474"}
