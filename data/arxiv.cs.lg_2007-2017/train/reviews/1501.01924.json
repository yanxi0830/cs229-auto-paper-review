In this work, we tap into this gap and propose a new ensemble approach for anomaly mining, with application to event detection in temporal graphs. Our method aims to combine results from heterogeneous detectors with varying outputs, and leverage the evidence from multiple sources to yield better performance. However, trusting all the results may deteriorate the overall ensemble accuracy, as some detectors may fall short and provide inaccurate results depending on the nature of the data in hand. This suggests that being selective in which results to combine is vital in building effective ensembles---hence \"less is more\".", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Jan 2015 18:54:09 GMT  (1271kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.01924v1", "14 pages, 5 pages Appendix, 10 Figures, 15 Tables, to appear at SDM 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 5 pages Appendix, 10 Figures, 15 Tables, to appear at SDM 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.LG", "authors": ["shebuti rayana", "leman akoglu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.01924"}
