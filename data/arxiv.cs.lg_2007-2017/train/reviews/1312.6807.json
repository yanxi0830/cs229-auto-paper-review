Those methods propagate label information of labeled samples to neighbors through their edges in order to get the predicted labels of unlabeled samples. Most popular semi-supervised learning approaches are sensitive to initial label distribution happened in imbalanced labeled datasets. The class boundary will be severely skewed by the majority classes in an imbalanced classification. In this paper, we proposed a simple and effective approach to alleviate the unfavorable influence of imbalance problem by iteratively selecting a few unlabeled samples and adding them into the minority classes to form a balanced labeled dataset for the learning methods afterwards. The experiments on UCI datasets and MNIST handwritten digits dataset showed that the proposed approach outperforms other existing state-of-art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Dec 2013 12:24:30 GMT  (478kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6807v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["fengqi li", "chuang yu", "nanhai yang", "feng xia", "guangming li", "fatemeh kaveh-yazdy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.6807"}
