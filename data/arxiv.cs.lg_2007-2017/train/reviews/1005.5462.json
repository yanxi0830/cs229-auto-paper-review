We prove that even without imposing orthogonality or sparsity constraint on the basis and/or coefficient matrix, NMF still can give clustering results, thus providing a theoretical support for the works of Xu et al. [1] and Kim et al. [2], where the authors showed the superiority of the standard NMF as a clustering method.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 29 May 2010 15:27:16 GMT  (58kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.5462v1", "4 pages, no figure"], ["v2", "Sat, 12 Jun 2010 10:40:53 GMT  (59kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.5462v2", "4 pages, no figure, to appear in ICEIE 2010"]], "COMMENTS": "4 pages, no figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["andri mirzal", "masashi furukawa"], "accepted": false, "id": "1005.5462"}
