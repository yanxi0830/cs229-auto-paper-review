{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "12-Jan-2012", "title": "Joint Approximation of Information and Distributed Link-Scheduling Decisions in Wireless Networks", "abstract": "For a large multi-hop wireless network, nodes are preferable to make distributed and localized link-scheduling decisions with only interactions among a small number of neighbors. However, for a slowly decaying channel and densely populated interferers, a small size neighborhood often results in nontrivial link outages and is thus insufficient for making optimal scheduling decisions. A question arises how to deal with the information outside a neighborhood in distributed link-scheduling. In this work, we develop joint approximation of information and distributed link scheduling. We first apply machine learning approaches to model distributed link-scheduling with complete information. We then characterize the information outside a neighborhood in form of residual interference as a random loss variable. The loss variable is further characterized by either a Mean Field approximation or a normal distribution based on the Lyapunov central limit theorem. The approximated information outside a neighborhood is incorporated in a factor graph. This results in joint approximation and distributed link-scheduling in an iterative fashion. Link-scheduling decisions are first made at each individual node based on the approximated loss variables. Loss variables are then updated and used for next link-scheduling decisions. The algorithm repeats between these two phases until convergence. Interactive iterations among these variables are implemented with a message-passing algorithm over a factor graph. Simulation results show that using learned information outside a neighborhood jointly with distributed link-scheduling reduces the outage probability close to zero even for a small neighborhood.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Jan 2012 14:28:23 GMT  (458kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2575v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 4 Mar 2012 23:06:41 GMT  (460kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.2575v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NI", "authors": ["sung-eok jeon", "chuanyi ji"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.2575"}
