Since a substance use ground truth is difficult to obtain on a large scale, to maximize system performance, we explore different feature learning methods to take advantage of a large amount of unsupervised social media data. We also demonstrate the benefit of using multi-view unsupervised feature learning to combine heterogeneous user information such as Facebook `\"likes\" and \"status updates\" to enhance system performance. Based on our evaluation, our best models achieved 86% AUC for predicting tobacco use, 81% for alcohol use and 84% for drug use, all of which significantly outperformed existing methods. Our investigation has also uncovered interesting relations between a user's social media behavior (e.g., word usage) and substance use.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 May 2017 10:37:52 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05633v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 31 May 2017 19:38:14 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05633v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.SI", "authors": ["tao ding", "warren k bickel", "shimei pan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05633"}
