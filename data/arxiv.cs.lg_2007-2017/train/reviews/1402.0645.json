An interesting feature of locally weighted regression is that it can work with spatially varying length scales, a beneficial property, for instance, in control problems. However, it does not provide a generative model for function values and requires training and test data to be generated identically, independently. Gaussian (process) regression, on the other hand, provides a fully generative model without significant formal requirements on the distribution of training data, but has much higher computational cost and usually works with one global scale per input dimension. Using a localising function basis and approximate inference techniques, we take Gaussian (process) regression to increasingly localised properties and toward the same computational complexity class as locally weighted regression.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 4 Feb 2014 07:35:48 GMT  (418kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0645v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.RO", "authors": ["franziska meier", "philipp hennig", "stefan schaal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.0645"}
