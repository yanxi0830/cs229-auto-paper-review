We consider different noise and abstention conditions of the labeler. We propose an algorithm which utilizes abstention responses, and analyze its statistical consistency and query complexity under fairly natural assumptions on the noise and abstention rate of the labeler. This algorithm is adaptive in a sense that it can automatically request less queries with a more informed or less noisy labeler. We couple our algorithm with lower bounds to show that under some technical conditions, it achieves nearly optimal query complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 30 Oct 2016 23:39:18 GMT  (172kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09730v1", "To appear in NIPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in NIPS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["songbai yan", "kamalika chaudhuri", "tara javidi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.09730"}
