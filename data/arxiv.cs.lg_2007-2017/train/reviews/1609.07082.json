We report on our experimental results, and further consider the case of learning a mixed curved Mahalanobis distance. Besides, we show that the Cayley-Klein Voronoi diagrams are affine, and can be built from an equivalent (clipped) power diagrams, and that Cayley-Klein balls have Mahalanobis shapes with displaced centers.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Sep 2016 17:41:03 GMT  (1027kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07082v1", "21 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, extend ICIP 2016 paper entitled \"CLASSIFICATION WITH MIXTURES OF CURVED MAHALANOBIS METRICS\""], ["v2", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 18:34:42 GMT  (1026kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07082v2", "21 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, extend ICIP 2016 paper entitled \"classification With Mixtures of Curved Mahalanobis Metrics\""]], "COMMENTS": "21 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables, extend ICIP 2016 paper entitled \"CLASSIFICATION WITH MIXTURES OF CURVED MAHALANOBIS METRICS\"", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CG cs.CV", "authors": ["frank nielsen", "boris muzellec", "richard nock"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.07082"}
