Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is an inference framework that constructs an approximation to the true likelihood based on the similarity between the observed and simulated data as measured by a predefined set of summary statistics. Although the choice of appropriate problem-specific summary statistics crucially influences the quality of the likelihood approximation and hence also the quality of the posterior sample in ABC, there are only few principled general-purpose approaches to the selection or construction of such summary statistics. In this paper, we develop a novel framework for this task using kernel-based distribution regression. We model the functional relationship between data distributions and the optimal choice (with respect to a loss function) of summary statistics using kernel-based distribution regression. We show that our approach can be implemented in a computationally and statistically efficient way using the random Fourier features framework for large-scale kernel learning. In addition to that, our framework shows superior performance when compared to related methods on toy and real-world problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Feb 2016 20:55:57 GMT  (68kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04805v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO stat.ME", "authors": ["jovana mitrovic", "dino sejdinovic", "yee whye teh"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.04805"}
