Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is one kind of deep neural network. It can study concurrently. In this article, we use convolutional neural network to implement the typical face recognition problem which can overcome the influence of pose or resolution in face recognition. Then, a parallel strategy was proposed in section4. In addition, by measuring the actual time of forward and backward computing, we analysed the maximal speed up and parallel efficiency theoretically.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 Jun 2015 10:18:49 GMT  (382kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01195v1", "10 pages, 5 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 4 Jun 2015 02:10:39 GMT  (383kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01195v2", "10 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["tianyi liu", "shuangsang fang", "yuehui zhao", "peng wang", "jun zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.01195"}
