Although simply replaying all previous data alleviates the problem, it requires large memory and even worse, often infeasible in real world applications where the access to past data is limited. Inspired by the generative nature of hippocampus as a short-term memory system in primate brain, we propose the Deep Generative Replay, a novel framework with a cooperative dual model architecture consisting of a deep generative model (\"generator\") and a task solving model (\"solver\"). With only these two models, training data for previous tasks can easily be sampled and interleaved with those for a new task. We test our methods in several sequential learning settings involving image classification tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 May 2017 10:37:38 GMT  (6160kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08690v1", "Submitted to NIPS 2017"], ["v2", "Sat, 9 Sep 2017 15:31:38 GMT  (6160kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08690v2", "To appear in NIPS 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to NIPS 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["hanul shin", "jung kwon lee", "jaehong kim", "jiwon kim"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.08690"}
