While DPPs have many appealing properties, such as efficient sampling, learning the parameters of a DPP is still considered a difficult problem due to the non-convex nature of the likelihood function. In this paper, we propose using Bayesian methods to learn the DPP kernel parameters. These methods are applicable in large-scale and continuous DPP settings even when the exact form of the eigendecomposition is unknown. We demonstrate the utility of our DPP learning methods in studying the progression of diabetic neuropathy based on spatial distribution of nerve fibers, and in studying human perception of diversity in images.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Feb 2014 01:54:37 GMT  (2333kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4862v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["raja hafiz affandi", "emily b fox", "ryan p adams", "benjamin taskar"], "accepted": true, "id": "1402.4862"}
