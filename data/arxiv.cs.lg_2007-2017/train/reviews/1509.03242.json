In this paper we compare various Gibbs sampling strategies for topic modeling of streaming spatiotemporal data, such as video captured by a mobile robot. Compared to previous work on online topic modeling, such as o-LDA and incremental LDA, we show that the proposed technique results in lower online and final perplexity, given the realtime constraints.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Sep 2015 17:25:50 GMT  (2859kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03242v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.LG", "authors": ["yogesh girdhar", "gregory dudek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.03242"}
