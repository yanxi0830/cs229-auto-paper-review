We posit that there is a hidden structure that explains the correctness of an answer given the question and instructional materials and present a unified max-margin framework that learns to find these hidden structures (given a corpus of question-answer pairs and instructional materials), and uses what it learns to answer novel elementary science questions. Our evaluation shows that our framework outperforms several strong baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 13 Feb 2016 20:13:48 GMT  (2363kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04375v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 5 Apr 2016 01:17:56 GMT  (547kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04375v2", "Corrected that the science QA dataset is NOT freely available"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["mrinmaya sachan", "kumar avinava dubey", "eric p xing"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.04375"}
