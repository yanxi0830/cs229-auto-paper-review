{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "14-Jan-2015", "title": "Hard to Cheat: A Turing Test based on Answering Questions about Images", "abstract": "Progress in language and image understanding by machines has sparkled the interest of the research community in more open-ended, holistic tasks, and refueled an old AI dream of building intelligent machines. We discuss a few prominent challenges that characterize such holistic tasks and argue for \"question answering about images\" as a particular appealing instance of such a holistic task. In particular, we point out that it is a version of a Turing Test that is likely to be more robust to over-interpretations and contrast it with tasks like grounding and generation of descriptions. Finally, we discuss tools to measure progress in this field.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Jan 2015 10:38:43 GMT  (168kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03302v1", "Also presented on: AAAI-15 Workshop: Beyond Turing the Turing Test"], ["v2", "Thu, 15 Jan 2015 10:18:54 GMT  (168kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03302v2", "Presented in AAAI-15 Workshop: Beyond the Turing Test"]], "COMMENTS": "Also presented on: AAAI-15 Workshop: Beyond Turing the Turing Test", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["mateusz malinowski", "mario fritz"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.03302"}
