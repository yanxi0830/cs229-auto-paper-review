In this paper, we first study a set of different features extraction methods such as linear predictive coding (LPC), mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) and perceptual linear prediction (PLP) with several features normalization techniques like rasta filtering and cepstral mean subtraction (CMS). Based on this, a comparative evaluation of these features is performed on the task of text independent speaker identification using a combination between gaussian mixture models (GMM) and linear and non-linear kernels based on support vector machine (SVM).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Jun 2014 20:56:00 GMT  (268kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7314v1", "8 pages, 3 Figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 3 Figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["imen trabelsi", "dorra ben ayed"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.7314"}
