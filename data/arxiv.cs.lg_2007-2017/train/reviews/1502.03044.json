We describe how we can train this model in a deterministic manner using standard backpropagation techniques and stochastically by maximizing a variational lower bound. We also show through visualization how the model is able to automatically learn to fix its gaze on salient objects while generating the corresponding words in the output sequence. We validate the use of attention with state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets: Flickr8k, Flickr30k and MS COCO.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 Feb 2015 19:18:29 GMT  (8243kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 11 Feb 2015 02:58:54 GMT  (8243kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 19 Apr 2016 16:43:09 GMT  (8243kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03044v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["kelvin xu", "jimmy ba", "ryan kiros", "kyunghyun cho", "aaron c courville", "ruslan salakhutdinov", "richard s zemel", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": true, "id": "1502.03044"}
