In particular, we focus on the compression of RNN acoustic models, which are motivated by the goal of building compact and accurate speech recognition systems which can be run efficiently on mobile devices. In this work, we present a technique for general recurrent model compression that jointly compresses both recurrent and non-recurrent inter-layer weight matrices. We find that the proposed technique allows us to reduce the size of our Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) acoustic model to a third of its original size with negligible loss in accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 25 Mar 2016 21:43:28 GMT  (171kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08042v1", "Accepted in ICASSP 2016"], ["v2", "Mon, 2 May 2016 15:19:30 GMT  (261kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08042v2", "Accepted in ICASSP 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted in ICASSP 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["rohit prabhavalkar", "ouais alsharif", "antoine bruguier", "ian mcgraw"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.08042"}
