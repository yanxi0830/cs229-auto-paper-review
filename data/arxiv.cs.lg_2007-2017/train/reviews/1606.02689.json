A unified neural network framework is proposed to enable the system to first learn by supervision from a set of dialogue data and then continuously improve its behaviour via reinforcement learning, all using gradient-based algorithms on one single model. The experiments demonstrate the supervised model's effectiveness in the corpus-based evaluation, with user simulation, and with paid human subjects. The use of reinforcement learning further improves the model's performance in both interactive settings, especially under higher-noise conditions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 19:03:06 GMT  (749kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02689v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["pei-hao su", "milica gasic", "nikola mrksic", "lina rojas-barahona", "stefan ultes", "david vandyke", "tsung-hsien wen", "steve young"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.02689"}
