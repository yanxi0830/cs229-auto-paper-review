The problem of random distribution to random value is transformed to random vector to random value by taking distribution moments of $x$ observations in a bag as random vector. Then Radon--Nikodym or least squares theory can be applied, what give $y(x)$ estimator. The probability distribution of $y$ is also obtained, what requires solving generalized eigenvalues problem, matrix spectrum (not depending on $x$) give possible $y$ outcomes and depending on $x$ probabilities of outcomes can be obtained by projecting the distribution with fixed $x$ value (delta--function) to corresponding eigenvector. A library providing numerically stable polynomial basis for these calculations is available, what make the proposed approach practical.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 29 Nov 2015 18:41:02 GMT  (166kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09058v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 2 Dec 2015 11:02:01 GMT  (167kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09058v2", "Gramar fixes.
