Materials and Methods: The clinically meaningful representations of medical concepts and patients are the key for health analytic applications. Most of existing approaches directly construct features mapped to raw data (e.g., ICD or CPT codes), or utilize some ontology mapping such as SNOMED codes. However, none of the existing approaches leverage EHR data directly for learning such concept representation. We propose a new way to represent heterogeneous medical concepts (e.g., diagnoses, medications and procedures) based on co-occurrence patterns in longitudinal electronic health records. The intuition behind the method is to map medical concepts that are co-occuring closely in time to similar concept vectors so that their distance will be small. We also derive a simple method to construct patient vectors from the related medical concept vectors. Results: We evaluate similar medical concepts across diagnosis, medication and procedure. The results show xx% relevancy between similar pairs of medical concepts. Our proposed representation significantly improves the predictive modeling performance for onset of heart failure (HF), where classification methods (e.g. logistic regression, neural network, support vector machine and K-nearest neighbors) achieve up to 23% improvement in area under the ROC curve (AUC) using this proposed representation. Conclusion: We proposed an effective method for patient and medical concept representation learning. The resulting representation can map relevant concepts together and also improves predictive modeling performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Feb 2016 12:03:42 GMT  (2348kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03686v1", "45 pages, under revision"], ["v2", "Tue, 20 Jun 2017 22:28:50 GMT  (1820kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03686v2", "45 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "45 pages, under revision", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["edward choi", "y schuetz", "walter f stewart", "jimeng sun"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.03686"}
