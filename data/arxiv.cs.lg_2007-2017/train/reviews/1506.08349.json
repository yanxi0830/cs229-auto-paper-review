{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "28-Jun-2015", "title": "Improved Deep Speaker Feature Learning for Text-Dependent Speaker Recognition", "abstract": "A deep learning approach has been proposed recently to derive speaker identifies (d-vector) by a deep neural network (DNN). This approach has been applied to text-dependent speaker recognition tasks and shows reasonable performance gains when combined with the conventional i-vector approach. Although promising, the existing d-vector implementation still can not compete with the i-vector baseline. This paper presents two improvements for the deep learning approach: a phonedependent DNN structure to normalize phone variation, and a new scoring approach based on dynamic time warping (DTW). Experiments on a text-dependent speaker recognition task demonstrated that the proposed methods can provide considerable performance improvement over the existing d-vector implementation.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 Jun 2015 03:32:02 GMT  (1438kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08349v1", "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1505.06427"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1505.06427", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["lantian li", "yiye lin", "zhiyong zhang", "dong wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.08349"}
