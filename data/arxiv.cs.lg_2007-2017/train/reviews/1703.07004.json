We compare the performance of autoencoders that take fixed length sequences of concatenated timesteps as input with a recurrent sequence-to-sequence autoencoder. We evaluate our methods on around 35,500 patients from the latest MIMIC III dataset from Beth Israel Deaconess Hospital.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Mar 2017 23:30:40 GMT  (992kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07004v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["harini suresh", "peter szolovits", "marzyeh ghassemi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07004"}
