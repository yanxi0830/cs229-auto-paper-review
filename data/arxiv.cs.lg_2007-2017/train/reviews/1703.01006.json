Understanding how the traffic flows and short-term prediction of congestion occurrence due to rush-hour or incidents can be beneficial to such systems to effectively manage and direct the traffic to the most appropriate detours. Many of the current traffic flow prediction systems are designed by utilizing a central processing component where the prediction is carried out through aggregation of the information gathered from all measuring stations. However, centralized systems are not scalable and fail provide real-time feedback to the system whereas in a decentralized scheme, each node is responsible to predict its own short-term congestion based on the local current measurements in neighboring nodes.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 01:12:38 GMT  (2394kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01006v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["mohammadhani fouladgar", "mostafa parchami", "ramez elmasri", "amir ghaderi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.01006"}
