Using a well-designed coding scheme for the projected data, which determines the number of bits needed for each projected value and how to allocate these bits, can significantly improve the effectiveness of the algorithm, in storage cost as well as computational speed. In this paper, we study a number of simple coding schemes, focusing on the task of similarity estimation and on an application to training linear classifiers. We demonstrate that uniform quantization outperforms the standard existing influential method (Datar et. al. 2004). Indeed, we argue that in many cases coding with just a small number of bits suffices. Furthermore, we also develop a non-uniform 2-bit coding scheme that generally performs well in practice, as confirmed by our experiments on training linear support vector machines (SVM).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Aug 2013 19:50:24 GMT  (192kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.2218v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS cs.IT math.IT stat.CO", "authors": ["ping li 0001", "michael mitzenmacher", "anshumali shrivastava"], "accepted": true, "id": "1308.2218"}
