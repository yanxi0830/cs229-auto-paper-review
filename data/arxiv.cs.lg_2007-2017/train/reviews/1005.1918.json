{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-May-2010", "title": "Prediction with Expert Advice under Discounted Loss", "abstract": "We study prediction with expert advice in the setting where the losses are accumulated with some discounting---the impact of old losses may gradually vanish. We generalize the Aggregating Algorithm and the Aggregating Algorithm for Regression to this case, propose a suitable new variant of exponential weights algorithm, and prove respective loss bounds.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 May 2010 19:27:35 GMT  (20kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1918v1", "22 pages; draft version"], ["v2", "Fri, 4 Jun 2010 19:13:37 GMT  (24kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.1918v2", "26 pages; expanded (2 remarks -&gt; theorems), some misprints corrected"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages; draft version", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["alexey chernov", "fedor zhdanov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1005.1918"}
