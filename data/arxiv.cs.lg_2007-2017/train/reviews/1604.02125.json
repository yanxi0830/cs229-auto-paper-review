{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "7-Apr-2016", "title": "Resolving Language and Vision Ambiguities Together: Joint Segmentation & Prepositional Attachment Resolution in Captioned Scenes", "abstract": "We present an approach to simultaneously perform semantic segmentation and prepositional phrase attachment resolution for captioned images. The motivation for this work comes from the fact that some ambiguities in language simply cannot be resolved without simultaneously reasoning about an associated image. If we consider the sentence \"I shot an elephant in my pajamas\", looking at the language alone (and not reasoning about common sense), it is unclear if it is the person or the elephant that is wearing the pajamas or both. Our approach involves producing a diverse set of plausible hypotheses for both semantic segmentation and prepositional phrase attachment resolution that are then jointly re-ranked to select the most consistent pair. We show that our semantic segmentation and prepositional phrase attachment resolution modules have complementary strengths, and that joint reasoning produces more accurate results than any module operating in isolation. We also show that multiple hypotheses are crucial to improved multiple-module reasoning. Our vision and language approach significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art NLP system (Stanford Parser [16,27]) by 17.91% (28.69% relative) in one experiment, and by 12.83% (25.28% relative) in another. We also make small improvements over a state-of-the-art vision system (DeepLab-CRF [13]).", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 7 Apr 2016 19:26:56 GMT  (7574kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02125v1", "*The first two authors contributed equally"], ["v2", "Thu, 5 May 2016 19:05:27 GMT  (7575kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02125v2", "*The first two authors contributed equally"], ["v3", "Fri, 2 Sep 2016 01:47:35 GMT  (5865kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02125v3", "*The first two authors contributed equally"], ["v4", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 04:08:19 GMT  (6799kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02125v4", "*The first two authors contributed equally.
