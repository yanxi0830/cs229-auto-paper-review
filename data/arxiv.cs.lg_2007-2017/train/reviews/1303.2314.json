Our guarantees for both methods are expressed in terms of the original nonsmooth primal problem based on the hinge-loss.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 10 Mar 2013 12:00:59 GMT  (53kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2314v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.OC", "authors": ["martin tak\u00e1c", "avleen singh bijral", "peter richt\u00e1rik", "nati srebro"], "accepted": true, "id": "1303.2314"}
