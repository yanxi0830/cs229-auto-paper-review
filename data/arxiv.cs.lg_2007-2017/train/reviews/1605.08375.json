We show that, in the absence of penalizations or constraints, the stability and approximation properties of the algorithm can be controlled by tuning either the step-size or the number of passes over the data. In this view, these parameters can be seen to control a form of implicit regularization. Numerical results complement the theoretical findings.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 May 2016 17:37:51 GMT  (54kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08375v1", "26 pages, 4 figures.
