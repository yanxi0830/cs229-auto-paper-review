Supervised learning is successful because it can be solved by the minimization of the training error cost function. Unsupervised learning is not as successful, because the unsupervised objective may be unrelated to the supervised task of interest. For an example, density modelling and reconstruction have often been used for unsupervised learning, but they did not produced the sought-after performance gains, because they have no knowledge of the sought-after supervised tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 23:04:23 GMT  (487kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06440v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 3 Dec 2015 17:24:22 GMT  (489kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06440v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ilya sutskever", "rafal jozefowicz", "karol gregor", "danilo rezende", "tim lillicrap", "oriol vinyals"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06440"}
