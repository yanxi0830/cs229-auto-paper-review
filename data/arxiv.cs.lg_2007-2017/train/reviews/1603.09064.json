With graph-based methods, entities (examples) correspond to nodes in a graph and edges correspond to related entities. The graph structure is used to infer implicit pairwise affinity values (kernel) which are used to compute the learned labels.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Mar 2016 07:51:58 GMT  (251kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09064v1", "13 pages, 6 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 23 May 2016 18:21:01 GMT  (420kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09064v2", "21 pages, 5 figures"], ["v3", "Sat, 13 Aug 2016 05:57:56 GMT  (417kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09064v3", "21 pages, 5 figures"], ["v4", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 07:08:42 GMT  (418kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09064v4", "21 pages, 5 figures"], ["v5", "Fri, 20 Jan 2017 18:34:52 GMT  (436kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.09064v5", "13 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["edith cohen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.09064"}
