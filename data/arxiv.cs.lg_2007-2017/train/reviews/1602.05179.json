Neurons move their activations towards configurations corresponding to lower energy and smaller prediction error: a new observation creates a perturbation at visible neurons that propagates into hidden layers, with these propagated perturbations corresponding to the back-propagated gradient. This avoids the need for a lengthy relaxation in the positive phase of training (when both inputs and targets are observed), as was believed with previous work on fixed-point recurrent networks. We show experimentally that energy-based neural networks with several hidden layers can be trained at discriminative tasks by using iterative inference and an STDP-like learning rule. The main result of this paper is that we can train neural networks with 1, 2 and 3 hidden layers on the permutation-invariant MNIST task and get the training error down to 0.00%. The results presented here make it more biologically plausible that a mechanism similar to back-propagation may take place in brains in order to achieve credit assignment in deep networks. The paper also discusses some of the remaining open problems to achieve a biologically plausible implementation of backprop in brains.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Feb 2016 20:46:51 GMT  (300kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05179v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 11:13:08 GMT  (301kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05179v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 20 Sep 2016 16:15:26 GMT  (436kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05179v3", null], ["v4", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 09:55:15 GMT  (439kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05179v4", null], ["v5", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 18:31:11 GMT  (388kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05179v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["benjamin scellier", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.05179"}
