We present a reduction that can transform standard low-regret algorithms to strongly adaptive. As a consequence, we derive simple, yet efficient, strongly adaptive algorithms for a handful of problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Feb 2015 07:24:40 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07073v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 15:10:11 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07073v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 19 Jun 2015 07:31:45 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07073v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["amit daniely", "alon gonen", "shai shalev-shwartz"], "accepted": true, "id": "1502.07073"}
