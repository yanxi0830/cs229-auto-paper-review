{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "21-Dec-2014", "title": "Striving for Simplicity: The All Convolutional Net", "abstract": "Most modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) used for object recognition are built using the same principles: Alternating convolution and max-pooling layers followed by a small number of fully connected layers. We re-evaluate the state of the art for object recognition from small images with convolutional networks, questioning the necessity of different components in the pipeline. We find that max-pooling can simply be replaced by a convolutional layer with increased stride without loss in accuracy on several image recognition benchmarks. Following this finding -- and building on other recent work for finding simple network structures -- we propose a new architecture that consists solely of convolutional layers and yields competitive or state of the art performance on several object recognition datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet). To analyze the network we introduce a new variant of the \"deconvolution approach\" for visualizing features learned by CNNs, which can be applied to a broader range of network structures than existing approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 21 Dec 2014 16:16:37 GMT  (3566kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6806v1", "submitted to ICLR-2015 conference track"], ["v2", "Mon, 2 Mar 2015 21:44:06 GMT  (4448kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6806v2", "submitted to ICLR-2015 conference track Version 2: modified according to remarks of the reviewers.
