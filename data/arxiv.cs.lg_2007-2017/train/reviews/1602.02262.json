In practice, this is typically formulated as weighted low-rank approximation problem and solved using non-convex optimization heuristics such as alternating minimization. Such non-convex techniques have little guarantees. Even worse, weighted low-rank approximation is NP-hard for even the most simple case when the ground truth is a rank-1 matrix.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 6 Feb 2016 14:55:12 GMT  (429kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02262v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 8 Dec 2016 17:05:41 GMT  (600kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02262v2", "40 pages.
