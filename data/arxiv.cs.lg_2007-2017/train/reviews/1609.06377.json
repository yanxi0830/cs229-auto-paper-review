A convolutional recurrent neural network is trained to predict depth from monocular video input, which, along with the current video image and the camera trajectory, can then be used to compute the next frame. Unlike prior next-frame prediction approaches, we take advantage of the scene geometry and use the predicted depth for generating next frame prediction. A useful side effect of our technique is that it produces depth from video, which can be used in other applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Sep 2016 22:49:34 GMT  (4218kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06377v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 12 Jun 2017 21:52:06 GMT  (6581kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06377v2", "To appear in 2017 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["reza mahjourian", "martin wicke", "anelia angelova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.06377"}
