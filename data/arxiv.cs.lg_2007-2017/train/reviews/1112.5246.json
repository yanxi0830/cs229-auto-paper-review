In particular, we show that simple meta-learning based ensemble achieves better result than weighting methods. Furthermore we propose a new one-class ensemble scheme, called TUPSO that uses meta-learning for combining multiple one-class classifiers. We also present a new one-class classification performance measures to weigh the base-classifiers, a process that proved helpful for increasing the classification performance of the induced ensemble. Our experimental study shows that the proposed method significantly outperforms exiting methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Dec 2011 08:07:56 GMT  (116kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.5246v1", "Related to both Ensemble learning and one-class learning.
