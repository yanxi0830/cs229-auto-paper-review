The fixed-point precisions are determined a priori using profiling and are selected at a per layer granularity. This paper presents Dynamic Stripes, an extension to Stripes that detects precision variance at runtime and at a finer granularity. This extra level of precision reduction increases performance by 41% over Stripes.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 21:57:32 GMT  (252kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00504v1", "3 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "3 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["alberto delmas", "patrick judd", "sayeh sharify", "reas moshovos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.00504"}
