{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "27-Jun-2012", "title": "Smoothness and Structure Learning by Proxy", "abstract": "As data sets grow in size, the ability of learning methods to find structure in them is increasingly hampered by the time needed to search the large spaces of possibilities and generate a score for each that takes all of the observed data into account. For instance, Bayesian networks, the model chosen in this paper, have a super-exponentially large search space for a fixed number of variables. One possible method to alleviate this problem is to use a proxy, such as a Gaussian Process regressor, in place of the true scoring function, training it on a selection of sampled networks. We prove here that the use of such a proxy is well-founded, as we can bound the smoothness of a commonly-used scoring function for Bayesian network structure learning. We show here that, compared to an identical search strategy using the network?s exact scores, our proxy-based search is able to get equivalent or better scores on a number of data sets in a fraction of the time.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (351kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6452v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.OC stat.ML", "authors": ["benjamin yackley", "terran lane"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6452"}
