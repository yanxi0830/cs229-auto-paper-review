We develop a robustness metric derived from source-aware lower and upper bounds of model accuracy even when data source labels are not readily available. We clearly demonstrate that even on a well-explored dataset like MNIST, challenging training scenarios can be constructed under the proposed assessment framework for two separate yet equally important applications: i) more rigorous learning model comparison and ii) dataset adequacy evaluation. In addition, our findings not only promise a more complete identification of trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy and robustness but can also help researchers optimize their efforts in data collection by identifying the less robust and more challenging class labels.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Apr 2017 11:58:24 GMT  (3529kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.00158v1", "Submitted to UAI 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to UAI 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ozsel kilinc", "ismail uysal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.00158"}
