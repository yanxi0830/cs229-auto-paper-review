In this paper, we propose a convex optimization approach for efficiently and exactly solving the multiclass SVM learning problem involving a sparse regularization and the multiclass hinge loss formulated by Crammer and Singer. We provide two algorithms: the first one dealing with the hinge loss as a penalty term, and the other one addressing the case when the hinge loss is enforced through a constraint. The related convex optimization problems can be efficiently solved thanks to the flexibility offered by recent primal-dual proximal algorithms and epigraphical splitting techniques. Experiments carried out on several datasets demonstrate the interest of considering the exact expression of the hinge loss rather than a smooth approximation. The efficiency of the proposed algorithms w.r.t. several state-of-the-art methods is also assessed through comparisons of execution times.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 15 Jan 2015 13:23:14 GMT  (280kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03669v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 16 Jan 2015 09:26:32 GMT  (280kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03669v2", "Corrected the name of an author"], ["v3", "Fri, 6 Feb 2015 23:36:03 GMT  (303kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03669v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 26 Apr 2015 15:33:36 GMT  (303kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03669v4", null], ["v5", "Mon, 14 Dec 2015 09:49:32 GMT  (304kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03669v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["g chierchia", "nelly pustelnik", "jean-christophe pesquet", "b pesquet-popescu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.03669"}
