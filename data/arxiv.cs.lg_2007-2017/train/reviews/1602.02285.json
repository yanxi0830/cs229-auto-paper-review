First, we prove that the popular model of Dawid and Skene, which assumes that all classifiers are conditionally independent, is {\\em equivalent} to a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) with a single hidden node. Hence, under this model, the posterior probabilities of the true labels can be instead estimated via a trained RBM. Next, to address the more general case, where classifiers may strongly violate the conditional independence assumption, we propose to apply RBM-based Deep Neural Net (DNN). Experimental results on various simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed DNN approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, in particular when the data violates the conditional independence assumption.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 6 Feb 2016 17:56:59 GMT  (361kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02285v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["uri shaham", "xiuyuan cheng", "omer dror", "ariel jaffe", "boaz nadler", "joseph t chang", "yuval kluger"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.02285"}
