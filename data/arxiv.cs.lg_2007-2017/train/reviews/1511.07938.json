We introduce a multi-resolution convolutional neural network for early detection of multiple diseases from irregularly measured sparse lab values. Our novel architecture takes as input both an imputed version of the data and a binary observation matrix. For imputing the temporal sparse observations, we develop a flexible, fast to train method for differentiable multivariate kernel regression. Our experiments on data from 300K individuals over 8 years, 18 common lab measurements, and 170 diseases show that the temporal signatures learned via convolution are significantly more predictive than baselines commonly used for early disease diagnosis.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Nov 2015 02:56:33 GMT  (2479kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07938v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 05:27:22 GMT  (2428kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07938v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 19 Jan 2016 22:19:40 GMT  (2432kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07938v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 11 Mar 2016 00:00:50 GMT  (2432kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07938v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["narges razavian", "david sontag"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.07938"}
