{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-Nov-2015", "title": "Deep Linear Discriminant Analysis", "abstract": "We introduce Deep Linear Discriminant Analysis (DeepLDA) which learns linearly separable latent representations in an end-to-end fashion. Classic LDA extracts features which preserve class separability and is used for dimensionality reduction for many classification problems. The central idea of this paper is to put LDA on top of a deep neural network. This can be seen as a non-linear extension of classic LDA. Instead of maximizing the likelihood of target labels for individual samples, we propose an objective function that pushes the network to produce feature distributions which: (a) have low variance within the same class and (b) high variance between different classes. Our objective is derived from the general LDA eigenvalue problem and still allows to train with stochastic gradient descent and back-propagation. For evaluation we test our approach on three different benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10 and STL-10). DeepLDA produces competitive results on all three datasets and sets a new state of the art on STL-10 with a test set accuracy of 81.4%.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 15 Nov 2015 14:33:26 GMT  (2261kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04707v1", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v2", "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 08:05:10 GMT  (2093kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04707v2", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v3", "Sat, 21 Nov 2015 17:59:18 GMT  (2084kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04707v3", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v4", "Mon, 28 Dec 2015 09:52:47 GMT  (2107kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04707v4", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v5", "Wed, 17 Feb 2016 08:32:47 GMT  (2114kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04707v5", "Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["matthias dorfer", "rainer kelz", "gerhard widmer"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.04707"}
