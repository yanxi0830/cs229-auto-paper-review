We propose a method to aggregate noisy labels collected from a crowd of workers or annotators. Eliciting labels is important in tasks such as judging web search quality and rating products. Our method assumes that labels are generated by a probability distribution over items and labels. We formulate the method by drawing parallels between Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and show that the problem of vote aggregation can be viewed as one of clustering. We use K-RBMs to perform clustering. We finally show some empirical evaluations over real datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Nov 2016 16:01:48 GMT  (28kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05340v1", "8 pages, 1 figure"], ["v2", "Thu, 17 Nov 2016 02:48:04 GMT  (28kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05340v2", "8 pages, 1 figure"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["abhay gupta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.05340"}
