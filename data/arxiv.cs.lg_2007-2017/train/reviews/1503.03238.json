A recent paradigm, called shapelets, represents patterns that are highly predictive for the target variable. Shapelets are discovered by measuring the prediction accuracy of a set of potential (shapelet) candidates. The candidates typically consist of all the segments of a dataset, therefore, the discovery of shapelets is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel method that avoids measuring the prediction accuracy of similar candidates in Euclidean distance space, through an online clustering pruning technique. In addition, our algorithm incorporates a supervised shapelet selection that filters out only those candidates that improve classification accuracy. Empirical evidence on 45 datasets from the UCR collection demonstrate that our method is 3-4 orders of magnitudes faster than the fastest existing shapelet-discovery method, while providing better prediction accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Mar 2015 09:38:49 GMT  (1110kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03238v1", "Under review in the journal \"Knowledge and Information Systems\" (KAIS)"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review in the journal \"Knowledge and Information Systems\" (KAIS)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["josif grabocka", "martin wistuba", "lars schmidt-thieme"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.03238"}
