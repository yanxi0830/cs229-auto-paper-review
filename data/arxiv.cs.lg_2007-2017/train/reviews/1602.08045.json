This paper presents a novel PCA/LDA-based approach that is faster than traditional statistical model-based methods and achieves competitive results. First, the performance based on only PCA and only LDA is measured; then a mixed model, taking advantages of both methods, is introduced. A subset of the TIMIT corpus composed of 200 male speakers, is used for enrollment, validation and testing. The best results achieve 100%; 96% and 95% classification rate at population level 50; 100 and 200, using 39-dimensional MFCC features with delta and double delta. These results are based on 12-second text-independent speech for training and 4-second data for test. These are comparable to the conventional MFCC-GMM methods, but require significantly less time to train and operate.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Feb 2016 19:18:06 GMT  (207kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08045v1", "Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) Conference Series"]], "COMMENTS": "Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE) Conference Series", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.LG", "authors": ["zhenhao ge", "sudhendu r sharma", "mark j t smith"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.08045"}
