Safe screening---which eliminates the features that are guaranteed to be absent for a target regularization parameter based on an existing solution---is a technique for improving the computational efficiency while maintaining the same solution. In this note, we propose an approach called Sasvi (Safe screening with variational inequalities) and take LASSO for example in the analysis. Sasvi makes use of the variational inequalities which provide the sufficient and necessary optimality conditions for the dual problem. The existing approaches can be casted as relaxed versions of the proposed Sasvi, and thus Sasvi provides a much stronger screening rule. The monotone properties of Sasvi are studied based on which a sure removal regularization parameter can be identified for each feature. In addition, the proposed Sasvi is readily extended for solving the generalized sparse linear models. Preliminary experimental results are reported.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Jul 2013 13:45:58 GMT  (127kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7577v1", "20 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 30 Oct 2013 15:00:04 GMT  (3312kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7577v2", "27 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables"], ["v3", "Mon, 12 May 2014 19:46:39 GMT  (3322kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7577v3", "Accepted by International Conference on Machine Learning 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["jun liu 0003", "zheng zhao", "jie wang", "jieping ye"], "accepted": true, "id": "1307.7577"}
