However some models are opaque to probabilistic interpretation, and MF-based methods, typically solved using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), may incur loss of corpus information. In addition, it is desirable to incorporate global latent factors, such as topics, sentiments or writing styles, into the word embedding model. Since generative models provide a principled way to incorporate latent factors, we propose a generative word embedding model, which is easy to interpret, and can serve as a basis of more sophisticated latent factor models. The model inference reduces to a low rank weighted positive semidefinite approximation problem. Its optimization is approached by eigendecomposition on a submatrix, followed by online blockwise regression, which is scalable and avoids the information loss in SVD. In experiments on 7 common benchmark datasets, our vectors are competitive to word2vec, and better than other MF-based methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 16 Aug 2015 14:12:17 GMT  (146kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03826v1", "Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) 2015 2015, 11 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Proceedings of the Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP) 2015 2015, 11 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["shaohua li", "jun zhu", "chunyan miao"], "accepted": true, "id": "1508.03826"}
