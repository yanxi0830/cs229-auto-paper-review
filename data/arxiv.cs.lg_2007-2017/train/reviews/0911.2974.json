We provide a 1-o(1) competitive algorithm for this surprisingly general class of online problems under the assumption of random order of arrival and some mild conditions on the right-hand-side input. Our learning-based algorithm works by dynamically updating a threshold price vector at geometric time intervals, the price learned from the previous steps is used to determine the decision for the current step. Our result provides a common near-optimal solution to a wide range of online problems including online routing and packing, online combinatorial auction, online adwords matching, many secretary problems, and various resource allocation and revenue management problems. Apart from online problems, the algorithm can also be applied for fast solution of large linear programs by sampling the columns of constraint matrix.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Nov 2009 16:39:33 GMT  (22kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2974v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 4 May 2013 20:10:14 GMT  (88kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2974v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 9 Apr 2014 03:44:37 GMT  (68kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.2974v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["shipra agrawal", "zizhuo wang", "yinyu ye"], "accepted": false, "id": "0911.2974"}
