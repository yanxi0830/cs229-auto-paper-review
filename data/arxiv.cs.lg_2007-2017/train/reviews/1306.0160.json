{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "2-Jun-2013", "title": "Phase Retrieval using Alternating Minimization", "abstract": "Phase retrieval problems involve solving linear equations, but with missing sign (or phase, for complex numbers) information. Over the last two decades, a popular generic empirical approach to the many variants of this problem has been one of alternating minimization; i.e. alternating between estimating the missing phase information, and the candidate solution. In this paper, we show that a simple alternating minimization algorithm geometrically converges to the solution of one such problem -- finding a vector $x$ from $y,A$, where $y = |A^T x|$ and $|z|$ denotes a vector of element-wise magnitudes of $z$ -- under the assumption that $A$ is Gaussian.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 2 Jun 2013 00:45:12 GMT  (167kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0160v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 12 Jun 2015 11:45:50 GMT  (402kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.0160v2", "Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "authors": ["praneeth netrapalli", "prateek jain 0002", "sujay sanghavi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1306.0160"}
