In contrast to the NormalHedge bound, which mainly depends on the effective number of experts and also weakly depends on the nominal one, we obtain a bound that does not contain the nominal number of experts at all. We use the defensive forecasting method and introduce an application of defensive forecasting to multivalued supermartingales.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 2 Jun 2010 19:41:27 GMT  (81kb,S)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.0475v1", "22 pages; draft version"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages; draft version", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["alexey chernov", "vladimir vovk"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.0475"}
