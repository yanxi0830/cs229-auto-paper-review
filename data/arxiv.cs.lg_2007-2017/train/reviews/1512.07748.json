This type of score following is particularly useful in automatic accompaniment for practices and rehearsals, where errors and repeats/skips are often made. Simple extensions of the algorithms previously proposed in the literature are not applicable in these situations for scores of practical length due to the problem of large computational complexity. To cope with this problem, we present two hidden Markov models of monophonic performance with errors and arbitrary repeats/skips, and derive efficient score-following algorithms with an assumption that the prior probability distributions of score positions before and after repeats/skips are independent from each other. We confirmed real-time operation of the algorithms with music scores of practical length (around 10000 notes) on a modern laptop and their tracking ability to the input performance within 0.7 s on average after repeats/skips in clarinet performance data. Further improvements and extension for polyphonic signals are also discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Dec 2015 08:21:48 GMT  (592kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07748v1", "12 pages, 8 figures, version accepted in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages, 8 figures, version accepted in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.LG cs.MM", "authors": ["tomohiko nakamura", "eita nakamura", "shigeki sagayama"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.07748"}
