Most competitive approaches lie at methodological extremes: some follow a Bayesian approach, defining probabilistic models with convergence guarantees, while others opt for more efficient heuristic techniques. Here we introduce an approximation to a segmental Bayesian model that falls in between, with a clear objective function but using hard clustering and segmentation rather than full Bayesian inference. Like its Bayesian counterpart, this embedded segmental k-means model (ES-KMeans) represents arbitrary-length word segments as fixed-dimensional acoustic word embeddings. On English and Xitsonga data, ES-KMeans outperforms a leading heuristic method in word segmentation, giving similar scores to the Bayesian model while being five times faster with fewer hyperparameters. However, there is a trade-off in cluster purity, with the Bayesian model's purer clusters yielding about 10% better unsupervised word error rates.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 16:45:22 GMT  (527kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08135v1", "5 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables"], ["v2", "Tue, 5 Sep 2017 14:14:11 GMT  (272kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08135v2", "8 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables; accepted to ASRU 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["herman kamper", "karen livescu", "sharon goldwater"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.08135"}
