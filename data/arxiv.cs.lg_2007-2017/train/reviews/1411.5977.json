A variety of methods have been proposed in the literature to address this inference problem. As far as we know, none of the objective functions in existing methods is convex. In machine learning and applied statistics, a convex function such as the objective function of support vector machines (SVMs) is generally preferred, since it can leverage the high-performance algorithms and rigorous guarantees established in the extensive literature on convex optimization. One may thus wonder if there exists a meaningful convex objective function for the inference problem in human computation. In this paper, we investigate this convexity issue for human computation. We take an axiomatic approach by formulating a set of axioms that impose two mild and natural assumptions on the objective function for the inference. Under these axioms, we show that it is unfortunately impossible to ensure convexity of the inference problem. On the other hand, we show that interestingly, in the absence of a requirement to model \"spammers\", one can construct reasonable objective functions for crowdsourcing that guarantee convex inference.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Nov 2014 18:51:10 GMT  (194kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5977v1", "AAAI 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "AAAI 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.HC cs.LG", "authors": ["nihar b shah", "dengyong zhou"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.5977"}
