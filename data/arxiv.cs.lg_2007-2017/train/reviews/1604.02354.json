Many metric learning algorithms are however based on the point estimation of a quadratic optimization problem, which is time-consuming, susceptible to overfitting, and lack a natural mechanism to reason with parameter uncertainty, an important property useful especially when the training set is small and/or noisy. To deal with these issues, we present a novel Bayesian metric learning method, called Bayesian NCA, based on the well-known Neighbourhood Component Analysis method, in which the metric posterior is characterized by the local label consistency constraints of observations, encoded with a similarity graph instead of independent pairwise constraints. For efficient Bayesian optimization, we explore the variational lower bound over the log-likelihood of the original NCA objective. Experiments on several publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is able to learn robust metric measures from small size dataset and/or from challenging training set with labels contaminated by errors. The proposed method is also shown to outperform a previous pairwise constrained Bayesian metric learning method.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Apr 2016 13:35:03 GMT  (2249kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.02354v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["dong wang", "xiaoyang tan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.02354"}
