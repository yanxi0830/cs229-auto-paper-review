Such certificates and corresponding rate of convergence guarantees are important for practitioners to diagnose progress, in particular in machine learning applications. We obtain new primal-dual convergence rates e.g. for the Lasso as well as many L1, Elastic-Net and group-lasso-regularized problems. The theory applies to any norm-regularized generalized linear model. Our approach provides efficiently computable duality gaps which are globally defined, without modifying the original problems in the region of interest.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Feb 2016 21:06:01 GMT  (406kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05205v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 21:29:48 GMT  (357kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05205v2", "appearing at ICML 2016 - Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning, New York, NY, USA, 2016.
