Supervised- or weakly supervised training enables the detection of findings that are known a priori. It does not scale well, and a priori definition limits the vocabulary of markers to known entities reducing the accuracy of diagnosis and prognosis. Here, we propose the identification of anomalies in large-scale medical imaging data using healthy examples as a reference. We detect and categorize candidates for anomaly findings untypical for the observed data. A deep convolutional autoencoder is trained on healthy retinal images. The learned model generates a new feature representation, and the distribution of healthy retinal patches is estimated by a one-class support vector machine. Results demonstrate that we can identify pathologic regions in images without using expert annotations. A subsequent clustering categorizes findings into clinically meaningful classes. In addition the learned features outperform standard embedding approaches in a classification task.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 14:05:49 GMT  (669kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00686v1", "Extended Abstract, Accepted for NIPS 2016 Workshop \"Machine Learning for Health\""]], "COMMENTS": "Extended Abstract, Accepted for NIPS 2016 Workshop \"Machine Learning for Health\"", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["philipp seeb\\\"ock", "sebastian waldstein", "sophie klimscha", "bianca s gerendas", "ren\\'e donner", "thomas schlegl", "ursula schmidt-erfurth", "georg langs"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.00686"}
