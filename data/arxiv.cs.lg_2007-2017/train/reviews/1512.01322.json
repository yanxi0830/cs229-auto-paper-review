The hardware complexity can be much lowered by minimizing the word-length of weights and signals. This work analyzes the fixed-point performance of recurrent neural networks using a retrain based quantization method. The quantization sensitivity of each layer in RNNs is studied, and the overall fixed-point optimization results minimizing the capacity of weights while not sacrificing the performance are presented. A language model and a phoneme recognition examples are used.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Dec 2015 06:07:28 GMT  (610kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01322v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 23 Jan 2016 11:53:34 GMT  (611kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01322v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 27 Sep 2016 11:42:34 GMT  (611kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01322v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["sungho shin", "kyuyeon hwang", "wonyong sung"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.01322"}
