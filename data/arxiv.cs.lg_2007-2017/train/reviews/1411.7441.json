Motivated by a pattern decomposition problem in materials discovery, aimed at discovering new materials for renewable energy, e.g. for fuel and solar cells, we introduce CombiFD, a framework for factor based pattern decomposition that allows the incorporation of a-priori knowledge as constraints, including complex combinatorial constraints. In addition, we propose a new pattern decomposition algorithm, called AMIQO, based on solving a sequence of (mixed-integer) quadratic programs. Our approach considerably outperforms the state of the art on the materials discovery problem, scaling to larger datasets and recovering more precise and physically meaningful decompositions. We also show the effectiveness of our approach for enforcing background knowledge on other application domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Nov 2014 02:31:41 GMT  (674kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7441v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["stefano ermon", "ronan le bras", "santosh k suram", "john m gregoire", "carla p gomes", "bart selman", "robert bruce van dover"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.7441"}
