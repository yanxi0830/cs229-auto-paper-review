{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Dec-2014", "title": "Incremental Adaptation Strategies for Neural Network Language Models", "abstract": "It is today acknowledged that neural network language models outperform back- off language models in applications like speech recognition or statistical machine translation. However, training these models on large amounts of data can take several days. We present efficient techniques to adapt a neural network language model to new data. Instead of training a completely new model or rely on mixture approaches, we propose two new methods: continued training on resampled data or insertion of adaptation layers. We present experimental results in an CAT en- vironment where the post-edits of professional translators are used to improve an SMT system. Both methods are very fast and achieve significant improvements without over-fitting the small adaptation data.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 Dec 2014 13:06:05 GMT  (280kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6650v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 23 Dec 2014 13:43:19 GMT  (280kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6650v2", "submitted as conference paper to ICLR 2015"], ["v3", "Tue, 23 Jun 2015 11:36:36 GMT  (39kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6650v3", "accepted as workshop paper at ACL-IJCNLP 2015"], ["v4", "Tue, 7 Jul 2015 14:54:51 GMT  (36kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6650v4", "accepted as workshop paper at ACL-IJCNLP 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["aram ter-sarkisov", "holger schwenk", "loic barrault", "fethi bougares"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.6650"}
