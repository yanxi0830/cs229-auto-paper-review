We design a domain-specific language (DSL) that allows for arbitrary concatenations of API outputs and constant strings. The DSL consists of three family of APIs: regular expression-based APIs, lookup APIs, and transformation APIs. We then present a novel neural synthesis algorithm to search for programs in the DSL that are consistent with a given set of examples. The search algorithm uses recently introduced neural architectures to encode input-output examples and to model the program search in the DSL. We show that synthesis algorithm outperforms baseline methods for synthesizing programs on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Apr 2017 02:04:06 GMT  (92kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04327v1", "8 pages + 4 pages of supplementary material.
