It is mainly of two types based on the intrusions, first is Misuse or signature based detection and the other is Anomaly detection. In this paper Machine learning based methods which are one of the types of Anomaly detection techniques is discussed.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 27 Jul 2013 18:00:43 GMT  (60kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.7286v1", "3 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1204.6416by other authors"]], "COMMENTS": "3 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1204.6416by other authors", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR", "authors": ["harjinder kaur", "gurpreet singh", "jaspreet minhas"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.7286"}
