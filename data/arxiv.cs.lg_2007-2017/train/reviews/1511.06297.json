Dropout has been shown to be an effective strategy to sparsify computations (by not involving all units), as well as to regularize models. In typical dropout, nodes are dropped uniformly at random. Our goal is to use reinforcement learning in order to design better, more informed dropout policies, which are data-dependent. We cast the problem of learning activation-dependent dropout policies for blocks of units as a reinforcement learning problem. We propose a learning scheme motivated by computation speed, capturing the idea of wanting to have parsimonious activations while maintaining prediction accuracy. We apply a policy gradient algorithm for learning policies that optimize this loss function and propose a regularization mechanism that encourages diversification of the dropout policy. We present encouraging empirical results showing that this approach improves the speed of computation without impacting the quality of the approximation.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 18:40:22 GMT  (748kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06297v1", "ICLR 2016 submission"], ["v2", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 22:41:10 GMT  (752kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06297v2", "ICLR 2016 submission, revised"]], "COMMENTS": "ICLR 2016 submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["emmanuel bengio", "pierre-luc bacon", "joelle pineau", "doina precup"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06297"}
