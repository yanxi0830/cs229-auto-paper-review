{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "19-Nov-2015", "title": "Variable Rate Image Compression with Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "Although image compression has been actively studied for decades, there has been relatively little research on learning to compress images with modern neural networks. Standard approaches, such as those employing patch-based autoencoders, have shown a great deal of promise but cannot compete with popular image codecs because they fail to address three questions: 1) how to effectively binarize activations: in the absence of binarization, a bottleneck layer alone tends not to lead to efficient compression; 2) how to achieve variable-rate encoding: a standard autoencoder generates a fixed-length code for each fixed-resolution input patch, resulting in the same cost for low- and high-entropy patches, and requiring the network to be completely retrained to achieve different compression rates; and 3) how to avoid block artifacts: patch-based approaches are prone to block discontinuities. We propose a general framework for variable-rate image compression and a novel architecture based on convolutional and deconvolutional recurrent networks, including LSTMs, that address these issues and report promising results compared to existing baseline codecs. We evaluate the proposed methods on a large-scale benchmark consisting of tiny images (32$\\times$32), which proves to be very challenging for all the methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 07:50:46 GMT  (121kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06085v1", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v2", "Sat, 21 Nov 2015 01:44:51 GMT  (121kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06085v2", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v3", "Tue, 12 Jan 2016 02:43:40 GMT  (290kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06085v3", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v4", "Wed, 13 Jan 2016 20:57:42 GMT  (233kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06085v4", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v5", "Tue, 1 Mar 2016 22:13:44 GMT  (5796kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06085v5", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["george toderici", "sean m o'malley", "sung jin hwang", "damien vincent", "david minnen", "shumeet baluja", "michele covell", "rahul sukthankar"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.06085"}
