{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "5-Aug-2009", "title": "The Infinite Hierarchical Factor Regression Model", "abstract": "We propose a nonparametric Bayesian factor regression model that accounts for uncertainty in the number of factors, and the relationship between factors. To accomplish this, we propose a sparse variant of the Indian Buffet Process and couple this with a hierarchical model over factors, based on Kingman's coalescent. We apply this model to two problems (factor analysis and factor regression) in gene-expression data analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Aug 2009 01:10:09 GMT  (78kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0908.0570v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["piyush rai", "hal daum\u00e9 iii"], "accepted": true, "id": "0908.0570"}
