We seek to develop a system that can generate stories by learning everything it needs to know from textual story corpora. To date, recurrent neural networks that learn language models at character, word, or sentence levels have had little success generating coherent stories. We explore the question of event representations that provide a mid-level of abstraction between words and sentences in order to retain the semantic information of the original data while minimizing event sparsity. We present a technique for preprocessing textual story data into event sequences. We then present a technique for automated story generation whereby we decompose the problem into the generation of successive events (event2event) and the generation of natural language sentences from events (event2sentence). We give empirical results comparing different event representations and their effects on event successor generation and the translation of events to natural language.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 Jun 2017 14:04:48 GMT  (54kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01331v1", "8 pages, 1 figure"], ["v2", "Mon, 14 Aug 2017 18:14:02 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01331v2", "8 pages, 1 figure"], ["v3", "Tue, 12 Sep 2017 14:45:22 GMT  (216kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01331v3", "Submitted to AAAI'18"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 1 figure", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["lara j martin", "prithviraj ammanabrolu", "xinyu wang", "william hancock", "shruti singh", "brent harrison", "mark o riedl"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.01331"}
