Yet, the majority of metaphor processing systems to date rely on hand-engineered features and there is still no consensus in the field as to which features are optimal for this task. In this paper, we present the first deep learning architecture designed to capture metaphorical composition. Our results demonstrate that it outperforms the existing approaches in the metaphor identification task.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 2 Sep 2017 13:13:06 GMT  (254kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.00575v1", "EMNLP 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["marek rei", "luana bulat", "douwe kiela", "ekaterina shutova"], "accepted": true, "id": "1709.00575"}
