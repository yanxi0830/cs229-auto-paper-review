In the first, active search, our goal is to actively uncover as many members of a given class as possible. In the second, active surveying, our goal is to actively query points to ultimately predict the proportion of a given class. Numerous real-world problems can be framed in these terms, and in either case typical model-based concerns such as generalization error are only of secondary importance.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (505kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6406v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["roman garnett", "yamuna krishnamurthy", "xuehan xiong", "jeff g schneider", "richard p mann"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6406"}
