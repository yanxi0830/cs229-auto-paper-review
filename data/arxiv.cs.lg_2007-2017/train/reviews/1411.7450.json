Compared with the traditional LDA, WLDA considers the dimensionality reduction problem from the worst-case viewpoint, which is in general more robust for classification. However, the original problem of WLDA is non-convex and difficult to optimize. In this paper, we reformulate the optimization problem of WLDA into a sequence of semidefinite feasibility problems. To efficiently solve the semidefinite feasibility problems, we design a new scalable optimization method with quasi-Newton methods and eigen-decomposition being the core components. The proposed method is orders of magnitude faster than standard interior-point based SDP solvers.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Nov 2014 02:52:56 GMT  (205kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7450v1", "14 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hui li", "chunhua shen", "anton van den hengel", "qinfeng shi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.7450"}
