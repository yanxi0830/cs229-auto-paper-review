However, previous attempts for quantization of RNNs show considerable performance degradation when using low bit-width weights and activations. In this paper, we propose methods to quantize the structure of gates and interlinks in LSTM and GRU cells. In addition, we propose balanced quantization methods for weights to further reduce performance degradation. Experiments on PTB and IMDB datasets confirm effectiveness of our methods as performances of our models match or surpass the previous state-of-the-art of quantized RNN.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 14:33:08 GMT  (32kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10176v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["qinyao he", "he wen", "shuchang zhou", "yuxin wu", "cong yao", "xinyu zhou", "yuheng zou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.10176"}
