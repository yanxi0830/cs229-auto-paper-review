(Moulin-Frier et al., 2015). Based on the analysis of mathematical models of the origins of speech forms, with a focus on their assumptions , we study the fundamental question of how speech can be formed out of non--speech, at both developmental and evolutionary scales. In particular, we emphasize the importance of embodied self-organization , as well as the role of mechanisms of motivation and active curiosity-driven exploration in speech formation. Finally , we discuss an evolutionary-developmental perspective of the origins of speech.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Jan 2016 12:50:14 GMT  (203kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00816v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CL cs.CY cs.LG", "authors": ["pierre-yves oudeyer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.00816"}
