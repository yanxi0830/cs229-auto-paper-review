However, a typical FCN usually requires lots of floating point computation and large run-time memory, which effectively limits its usability. We propose a method to train Bit Fully Convolution Network (BFCN), a fully convolutional neural network that has low bit-width weights and activations. Because most of its computation-intensive convolutions are accomplished between low bit-width numbers, a BFCN can be accelerated by an efficient bit-convolution implementation. On CPU, the dot product operation between two bit vectors can be reduced to bitwise operations and popcounts, which can offer much higher throughput than 32-bit multiplications and additions.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 11:56:15 GMT  (1730kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00212v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["he wen", "shuchang zhou", "zhe liang", "yuxiang zhang", "dieqiao feng", "xinyu zhou", "cong yao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.00212"}
