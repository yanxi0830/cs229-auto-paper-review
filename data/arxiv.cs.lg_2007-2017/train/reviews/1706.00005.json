In recent years, many innovative solutions for recording and viewing sounds from a stethoscope have become available. However, to fully utilize such devices, there is a need for an automated approach for detecting abnormal lung sounds, which is better than the existing methods that typically have been developed and evaluated using a small and non-diverse dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 May 2017 16:24:28 GMT  (1365kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00005v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.LG", "authors": ["morten gr{\\o}nnesby", "juan carlos aviles solis", "einar holsb{\\o}", "hasse melbye", "lars ailo bongo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.00005"}
