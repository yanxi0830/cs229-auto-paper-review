{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "4-Mar-2017", "title": "Axiomatic Attribution for Deep Networks", "abstract": "We study the problem of attributing the prediction of a deep network to its input features, a problem previously studied by several other works. We identify two fundamental axioms---Sensitivity and Implementation Invariance that attribution methods ought to satisfy. We show that they are not satisfied by most known attribution methods, which we consider to be a fundamental weakness of those methods. We use the axioms to guide the design of a new attribution method called Integrated Gradients. Our method requires no modification to the original network and is extremely simple to implement; it just needs a few calls to the standard gradient operator. We apply this method to a couple of image models, a couple of text models and a chemistry model, demonstrating its ability to debug networks, to extract rules from a deep network, and to enable users to engage with models better.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 4 Mar 2017 00:18:49 GMT  (5478kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 01:52:38 GMT  (7018kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01365v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["mukund sundararajan", "ankur taly", "qiqi yan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.01365"}
