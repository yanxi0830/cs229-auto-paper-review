Deep reinforcement learning methods have demonstrated the ability to learn with highly general policy classes for complex tasks with high-dimensional inputs, such as raw images. However, many of the most effective exploration techniques rely on tabular representations, or on the ability to construct a generative model over states and actions. Both are exceptionally difficult when these inputs are complex and high dimensional. On the other hand, it is comparatively easy to build discriminative models on top of complex states such as images using standard deep neural networks. This paper introduces a novel approach, EX2, which approximates state visitation densities by training an ensemble of discriminators, and assigns reward bonuses to rarely visited states. We demonstrate that EX2 achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods on low-dimensional tasks, and its effectiveness scales into high-dimensional state spaces such as visual domains without hand-designing features or density models.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 17:38:59 GMT  (2908kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01260v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 27 May 2017 05:09:09 GMT  (4087kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01260v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["justin fu", "john d co-reyes", "sergey levine"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.01260"}
