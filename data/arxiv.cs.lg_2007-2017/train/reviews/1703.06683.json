It deals with data streams having very skewed class distributions, where concept drift may occur. It has recently received increased research attention; however, very little work addresses the combined problem where both class imbalance and concept drift coexist. As the first systematic study of handling concept drift in class-imbalanced data streams, this paper first provides a comprehensive review of current research progress in this field, including current research focuses and open challenges. Then, an in-depth experimental study is performed, with the goal of understanding how to best overcome concept drift in online learning with class imbalance. Based on the analysis, a general guideline is proposed for the development of an effective algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Mar 2017 11:22:10 GMT  (1437kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06683v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["shuo wang", "leandro l minku", "xin yao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06683"}
