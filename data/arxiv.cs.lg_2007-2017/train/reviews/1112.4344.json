Unlike previously proposed methods for the same task, MUCCA works in time linear in the number of nodes. Our approach is based on a game-theoretic formulation of the problem in which the test labels are expressed as a Nash Equilibrium of a certain game. However, in order to achieve scalability, we find the equilibrium on a spanning tree of the original graph. Experiments on real-world data reveal that MUCCA is much faster than its competitors while achieving a similar predictive performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 Dec 2011 14:21:00 GMT  (694kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4344v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GT", "authors": ["giovanni zappella"], "accepted": false, "id": "1112.4344"}
