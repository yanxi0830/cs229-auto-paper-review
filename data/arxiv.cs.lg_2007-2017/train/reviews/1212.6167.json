Credit requests, of new and existing customers, are often evaluated by classical discrimination rules based on customers information. However, these kinds of strategies have serious limits and don't take into account the characteristics difference between current customers and the future ones. The aim of this paper is to measure credit worthiness for non customers borrowers and to model potential risk given a heterogeneous population formed by borrowers customers of the bank and others who are not. We hold on previous works done in generalized gaussian discrimination and transpose them into the logistic model to bring out efficient discrimination rules for non customers' subpopulation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Dec 2012 12:03:26 GMT  (105kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.6167v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE", "authors": ["farid beninel", "waad bouaguel", "ghazi belmufti"], "accepted": false, "id": "1212.6167"}
