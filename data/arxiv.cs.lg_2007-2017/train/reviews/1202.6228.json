The novelty of our work is the critical use of the confusion matrix of a classifier as an error measure; this puts our contribution in the line of work aiming at dealing with performance measure that are richer than mere scalar criterion such as the misclassification rate. Thanks to very recent and beautiful results on matrix concentration inequalities, we derive two bounds showing that the true confusion risk of the Gibbs classifier is upper-bounded by its empirical risk plus a term depending on the number of training examples in each class. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first PAC-Bayes bounds based on confusion matrices.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Feb 2012 14:13:01 GMT  (27kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6228v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 22 Mar 2012 09:29:28 GMT  (27kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6228v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 24 May 2012 06:26:12 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6228v3", "Arxiv:this http URL, Accepted at ICML 2012"], ["v4", "Sat, 30 Jun 2012 19:23:14 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6228v4", "Arxiv:this http URL, Accepted at ICML 2012"], ["v5", "Wed, 4 Jul 2012 14:57:53 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6228v5", "Arxiv:this http URL, Accepted at ICML 2012"], ["v6", "Tue, 22 Oct 2013 08:25:52 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.6228v6", "Arxiv:this http URL, Accepted at ICML 2012"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["emilie morvant", "sokol ko\u00e7o", "liva ralaivola"], "accepted": true, "id": "1202.6228"}
