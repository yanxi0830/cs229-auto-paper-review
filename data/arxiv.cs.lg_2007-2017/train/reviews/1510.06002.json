Although finding the most violating label in a margin-rescaled formulation is often easy since the target function decomposes with respect to the structure, this is not the case for a slack-rescaled formulation, and finding the most violated label might be very difficult. Our core contribution is an efficient method for finding the most-violating-label in a slack-rescaled formulation, given an oracle that returns the most-violating-label in a (slightly modified) margin-rescaled formulation. We show that our method enables accurate and scalable training for slack-rescaled SVMs, reducing runtime by an order of magnitude compared to previous approaches to slack-rescaled SVMs.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Oct 2015 18:25:45 GMT  (248kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06002v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 27 Oct 2015 22:25:33 GMT  (252kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06002v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["heejin choi", "ofer meshi", "nathan srebro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.06002"}
