{"conference": "EMNLP", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Mar-2016", "title": "Recursive Neural Conditional Random Fields for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis", "abstract": "Aspect-based sentiment analysis has obtained substantial popularity due to its ability to extract useful information from customer reviews. In most cases, aspect terms in a review sentence have strong relations with opinion terms because an aspect is the target where an opinion is expressed. With this connection, some of the existing work focused on designing syntactic rules to double propagate information between aspect and opinion terms. However, these methods require large amount of efforts and domain knowledge to design precise syntactic rules and fail to handle uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a novel joint model that integrates recursive neural networks and conditional random fields into a unified framework for aspect-based sentiment analysis. Our task is to extract aspect and opinion terms/phrases for each review. The proposed model is able to learn high-level discriminative features and double propagate information between aspect and opinion terms simultaneously. Furthermore, it is flexible to incorporate linguistic or lexicon features into the proposed model to further boost its performance in terms of information extraction. Experimental results on the SemEval Challenge 2014 dataset show the superiority of our proposed model over several baseline methods as well as the winning systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 22 Mar 2016 05:59:00 GMT  (1804kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06679v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 06:24:06 GMT  (1544kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06679v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 19 Sep 2016 14:00:43 GMT  (1416kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06679v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["wenya wang", "sinno jialin pan", "daniel dahlmeier", "xiaokui xiao"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.06679"}
