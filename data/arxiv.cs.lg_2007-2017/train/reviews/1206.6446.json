Geometric smoothing techniques are developed to deal with degenerate clusters. To allow for cluster models based on exponential families with overcomplete representations, Bregman divergences are developed for nondifferentiable convex functions.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (481kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6446v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["matus telgarsky", "sanjoy dasgupta"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6446"}
