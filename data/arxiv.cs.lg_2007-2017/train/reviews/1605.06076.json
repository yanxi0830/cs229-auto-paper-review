The algorithm considered here is TDC with importance weighting introduced by Maei et al. We support our theoretical results by providing suitable empirical results for standard off-policy counterexamples.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 May 2016 18:32:50 GMT  (242kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06076v1", "14 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1503.09105"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1503.09105", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["prasenjit karmakar", "rajkumar maity", "shalabh bhatnagar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.06076"}
