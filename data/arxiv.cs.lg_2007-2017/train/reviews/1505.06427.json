This new method has been tested on text-dependent speaker verification tasks, and improvement was reported when combined with the conventional i-vector method.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 24 May 2015 11:22:40 GMT  (1253kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06427v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["lantian li", "dong wang", "zhiyong zhang", "thomas fang zheng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.06427"}
