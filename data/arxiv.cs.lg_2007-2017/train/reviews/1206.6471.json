This has implications for popular scenarios such as covariate shift, concept drift, transfer learning and semi-supervised learning. We argue that causal knowledge may facilitate some approaches for a given problem, and rule out others. In particular, we formulate a hypothesis for when semi-supervised learning can help, and corroborate it with empirical results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (476kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6471v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1112.2738"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012). arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1112.2738", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["bernhard sch\u00f6lkopf", "dominik janzing", "jonas peters", "eleni sgouritsa", "kun zhang", "joris m mooij"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6471"}
