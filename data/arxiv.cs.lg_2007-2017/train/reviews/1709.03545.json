The hierarchical architecture consisting of multiple GANs preserves both local and global topological features and automatically partitions the input graph into representative stages for feature learning. The stages facilitate reconstruction and can be used as indicators of the importance of the associated topological structures. Experiments show that our method produces subgraphs retaining a wide range of topological features, even in early reconstruction stages (unlike a single GAN, which cannot easily identify such features, let alone reconstruct the original graph). This paper is firstline research on combining the use of GANs and graph topological analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Sep 2017 18:57:03 GMT  (1779kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03545v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 13 Sep 2017 18:02:41 GMT  (1779kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.03545v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.LG", "authors": ["weiyi liu", "hal cooper", "min hwan oh", "sailung yeung", "pin-yu chen", "toyotaro suzumura", "lingli chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.03545"}
