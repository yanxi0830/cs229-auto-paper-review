Traditional ML libraries does not support well processing of huge datasets, so that new approaches were needed. Parallelization using modern parallel computing frameworks, such as MapReduce, CUDA, or Dryad gained in popularity and acceptance, resulting in new ML libraries developed on top of these frameworks. We will briefly introduce the most prominent industrial and academic outcomes, such as Apache Mahout, GraphLab or Jubatus.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 13:29:35 GMT  (37kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08767v1", "This manuscript was originally published as IEAT Technical Report atthis https URLin 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "This manuscript was originally published as IEAT Technical Report atthis https URLin 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.LG", "authors": ["daniel pop"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.08767"}
