We study the convergence of the shortest path distance in such graphs as the sample size tends to infinity. We prove that for unweighted kNN graphs, this distance converges to an unpleasant distance function on the underlying space whose properties are detrimental to machine learning. We also study the behavior of the shortest path distance in weighted kNN graphs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (669kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6381v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"], ["v2", "Mon, 9 Jul 2012 08:36:42 GMT  (578kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6381v2", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["morteza alamgir", "ulrike von luxburg"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6381"}
