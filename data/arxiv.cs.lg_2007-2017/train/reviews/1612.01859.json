One difference with the single arm variant is that the dependency structure of the arms is crucial. Previous works on this setting either used a worst-case approach or imposed independence of the arms. We introduce a way to quantify the dependency structure of the problem and design an algorithm that adapts to it. The algorithm is based on linear regression and the analysis develops techniques from the linear bandit literature. By comparing its performance to a new lower bound, we prove that it is optimal, up to a poly-logarithmic factor in the number of pulled arms.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 6 Dec 2016 15:28:22 GMT  (135kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.01859v1", "in NIPS 2016 (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems), Dec 2016, Barcelona, Spain"]], "COMMENTS": "in NIPS 2016 (Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems), Dec 2016, Barcelona, Spain", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["r\u00e9my degenne", "vianney perchet"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.01859"}
