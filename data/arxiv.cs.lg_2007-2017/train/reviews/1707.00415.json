Two dual tasks have intrinsic connections with each other due to the probabilistic correlation between their models. This connection is, however, not effectively utilized today, since people usually train the models of two dual tasks separately and independently. In this work, we propose training the models of two dual tasks simultaneously, and explicitly exploiting the probabilistic correlation between them to regularize the training process. For ease of reference, we call the proposed approach \\emph{dual supervised learning}. We demonstrate that dual supervised learning can improve the practical performances of both tasks, for various applications including machine translation, image processing, and sentiment analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Jul 2017 06:19:31 GMT  (1152kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.00415v1", "ICML 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["yingce xia", "tao qin", "wei chen", "jiang bian", "nenghai yu", "tie-yan liu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.00415"}
