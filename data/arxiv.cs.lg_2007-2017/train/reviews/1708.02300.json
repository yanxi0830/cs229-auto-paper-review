First, using policy gradient and mixed-loss methods for reinforcement learning, we directly optimize sentence-level task-based metrics (as rewards), achieving significant improvements over the baseline, based on both automatic metrics and human evaluation on multiple datasets. Next, we propose a novel entailment-enhanced reward (CIDEnt) that corrects phrase-matching based metrics (such as CIDEr) to only allow for logically-implied partial matches and avoid contradictions, achieving further significant improvements over the CIDEr-reward model. Overall, our CIDEnt-reward model achieves the new state-of-the-art on the MSR-VTT dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Aug 2017 20:50:24 GMT  (1956kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02300v1", "EMNLP 2017 (9 pages)"]], "COMMENTS": "EMNLP 2017 (9 pages)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["ramakanth pasunuru", "mohit bansal"], "accepted": true, "id": "1708.02300"}
