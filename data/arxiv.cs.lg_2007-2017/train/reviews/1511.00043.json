We make three main contributions: (1) we formulate our approach theoretically in the PAC learning framework, (2) we analyze the PAC learnability of the known parametric SUQR model of bounded rationality and (3) we propose the first non-parametric class of response functions for SSGs and analyze its PAC learnability. Finally, we conduct experiments and report the real world performance of the learning methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 22:27:25 GMT  (4146kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00043v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 17:51:17 GMT  (3598kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00043v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 08:34:43 GMT  (2999kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00043v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.GT cs.LG", "authors": ["arunesh sinha", "debarun kar", "milind tambe"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.00043"}
