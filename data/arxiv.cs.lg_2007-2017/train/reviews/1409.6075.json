More specifically, this model is designed to succeed even where the logit transform of the dependent variable is not necessarily linear in the independent variables. This research shows that for large datasets, the resulting models can be produced on modern computers in a tractable amount of time. These models are also resistant to overfitting, and as such they tend to produce interpretable models with only a limited number of features, all of which are designed to be well behaved.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Sep 2014 03:39:23 GMT  (492kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6075v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 6 Oct 2014 11:12:07 GMT  (996kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6075v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 4 Nov 2014 05:41:04 GMT  (1622kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.6075v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["tyler ward"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.6075"}
