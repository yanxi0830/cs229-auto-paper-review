{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-Jun-2012", "title": "Robust PCA in High-dimension: A Deterministic Approach", "abstract": "We consider principal component analysis for contaminated data-set in the high dimensional regime, where the dimensionality of each observation is comparable or even more than the number of observations. We propose a deterministic high-dimensional robust PCA algorithm which inherits all theoretical properties of its randomized counterpart, i.e., it is tractable, robust to contaminated points, easily kernelizable, asymptotic consistent and achieves maximal robustness -- a breakdown point of 50%. More importantly, the proposed method exhibits significantly better computational efficiency, which makes it suitable for large-scale real applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:07:55 GMT  (699kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4628v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["jiashi feng", "huan xu", "shuicheng yan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4628"}
