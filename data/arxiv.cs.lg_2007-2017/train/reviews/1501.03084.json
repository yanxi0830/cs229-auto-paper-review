One vital factor that impacts clustering performance is how to learn or design the data representation (or features). Fortunately, recent advances in deep learning can learn unsupervised features effectively, and have yielded state of the art performance in many classification problems, such as character recognition, object recognition and document categorization. However, little attention has been paid to the potential of deep learning for unsupervised clustering problems. In this paper, we propose a deep belief network with nonparametric clustering. As an unsupervised method, our model first leverages the advantages of deep learning for feature representation and dimension reduction. Then, it performs nonparametric clustering under a maximum margin framework -- a discriminative clustering model and can be trained online efficiently in the code space. Lastly model parameters are refined in the deep belief network. Thus, this model can learn features for clustering and infer model complexity in an unified framework. The experimental results show the advantage of our approach over competitive baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Jan 2015 17:26:26 GMT  (274kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03084v1", "14 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "14 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["gang chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.03084"}
