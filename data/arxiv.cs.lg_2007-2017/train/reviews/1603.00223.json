This model connects the segmental conditional random field (CRF) with a recurrent neural network (RNN) used for feature extraction. Compared to most previous CRF-based acoustic models, it does not rely on an external system to provide features or segmentation boundaries. Instead, this model marginalises out all the possible segmentations, and features are extracted from the RNN trained together with the segmental CRF. In essence, this model is self-contained and can be trained end-to-end. In this paper, we discuss practical training and decoding issues as well as the method to speed up the training in the context of speech recognition. We performed experiments on the TIMIT dataset. We achieved 17.3 phone error rate (PER) from the first-pass decoding --- the best reported result using CRFs, despite the fact that we only used a zeroth-order CRF and without using any language model.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Mar 2016 10:43:43 GMT  (178kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00223v1", "5 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 10:29:23 GMT  (178kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00223v2", "5 pages, 2 figures, accepted by Interspeech 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["liang lu", "lingpeng kong", "chris dyer", "noah a smith", "steve renals"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.00223"}
