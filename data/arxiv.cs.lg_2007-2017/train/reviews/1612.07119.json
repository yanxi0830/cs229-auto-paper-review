In this paper, we present FINN, a framework for building fast and flexible FPGA accelerators using a flexible heterogeneous streaming architecture. By utilizing a novel set of optimizations that enable efficient mapping of binarized neural networks to hardware, we implement fully connected, convolutional and pooling layers, with per-layer compute resources being tailored to user-provided throughput requirements. On a ZC706 embedded FPGA platform drawing less than 25 W total system power, we demonstrate up to 12.3 million image classifications per second with 0.31 {\\mu}s latency on the MNIST dataset with 95.8% accuracy, and 21906 image classifications per second with 283 {\\mu}s latency on the CIFAR-10 and SVHN datasets with respectively 80.1% and 94.9% accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, ours are the fastest classification rates reported to date on these benchmarks.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Dec 2016 22:19:47 GMT  (867kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.07119v1", "To appear in the 25th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays, February 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear in the 25th International Symposium on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays, February 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AR cs.LG", "authors": ["yaman umuroglu", "nicholas j fraser", "giulio gambardella", "michaela blott", "philip leong", "magnus jahre", "kees vissers"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.07119"}
