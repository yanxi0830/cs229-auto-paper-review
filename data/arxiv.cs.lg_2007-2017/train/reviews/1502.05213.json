In this paper, Deep Belief Network (DBN), a class of DNN family has been employed and applied to model the F0 contour of synthesized speech which was generated by HMM-based speech synthesis system. The experiment was done on Bengali language. Several DBN-DNN architectures ranging from four to seven hidden layers and up to 200 hid- den units per hidden layer was presented and evaluated. The results were compared against clustering tree techniques pop- ularly found in statistical parametric speech synthesis. We show that from textual inputs DBN-DNN learns a high level structure which in turn improves F0 contour in terms of ob- jective and subjective tests.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Feb 2015 13:15:13 GMT  (219kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05213v1", "OCOCOSDA 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "OCOCOSDA 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["sankar mukherjee", "shyamal kumar das mandal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.05213"}
