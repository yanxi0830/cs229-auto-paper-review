Most existing spectral clustering algorithms integrate dimensionality reduction into the clustering process assisted by manifold learning in the original space. However, the manifold in reduced-dimensional subspace is likely to exhibit altered properties in contrast with the original space. Thus, applying manifold information obtained from the original space to the clustering process in a low-dimensional subspace is prone to inferior performance. Aiming to address this issue, we propose a novel convex algorithm that mines the manifold structure in the low-dimensional subspace. In addition, our unified learning process makes the manifold learning particularly tailored for the clustering. Compared with other related methods, the proposed algorithm results in more structured clustering result. To validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, we perform extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets in comparison with some state-of-the-art clustering approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm has quite promising clustering performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 23 Nov 2014 22:12:52 GMT  (612kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.6308v1", "AAAI2015"]], "COMMENTS": "AAAI2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["xiaojun chang", "feiping nie", "zhigang ma", "yi yang", "xiaofang zhou"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.6308"}
