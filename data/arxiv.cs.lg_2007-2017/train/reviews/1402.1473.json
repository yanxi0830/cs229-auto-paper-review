{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "6-Feb-2014", "title": "Near-Optimal Joint Object Matching via Convex Relaxation", "abstract": "Joint matching over a collection of objects aims at aggregating information from a large collection of similar instances (e.g. images, graphs, shapes) to improve maps between pairs of them. Given multiple matches computed between a few object pairs in isolation, the goal is to recover an entire collection of maps that are (1) globally consistent, and (2) close to the provided maps --- and under certain conditions provably the ground-truth maps. Despite recent advances on this problem, the best-known recovery guarantees are limited to a small constant barrier --- none of the existing methods find theoretical support when more than $50\\%$ of input correspondences are corrupted. Moreover, prior approaches focus mostly on fully similar objects, while it is practically more demanding to match instances that are only partially similar to each other.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Feb 2014 20:16:35 GMT  (10892kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.1473v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.IT math.IT math.OC stat.ML", "authors": ["yuxin chen", "leonidas j guibas", "qi-xing huang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1402.1473"}
