Our polarity correction technique takes into account the consistency of the polarities (positive and negative) of sentences within each product review before performing the actual machine learning task. While sentences with inconsistent polarities are removed, sentences with consistent polarities are used to learn state-of-the-art classifiers. The technique achieved better results on different types of products reviews and outperforms baseline models without the correction technique. Experimental results show an average of 82% F-measure on four different product review domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 Nov 2015 18:38:22 GMT  (302kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02385v1", "15 pages.
