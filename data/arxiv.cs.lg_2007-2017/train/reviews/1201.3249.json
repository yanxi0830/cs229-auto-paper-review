This paper presents a LCS where each traditional rule is represented by a spiking neural network, a type of network with dynamic internal state. We employ a constructivist model of growth of both neurons and dendrites that realise flexible learning by evolving structures of sufficient complexity to solve a well-known problem involving continuous, real-valued inputs. Additionally, we extend the system to enable temporal state decomposition. By allowing our LCS to chain together sequences of heterogeneous actions into macro-actions, it is shown to perform optimally in a problem where traditional methods can fail to find a solution in a reasonable amount of time. Our final system is tested on a simulated robotics platform.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Jan 2012 13:19:55 GMT  (1222kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.3249v1", "20 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG cs.RO", "authors": ["gerard howard", "larry bull", "pier-luca lanzi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.3249"}
