{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Sep-2015", "title": "Hardness of Online Sleeping Combinatorial Optimization Problems", "abstract": "We show that several online combinatorial optimization problems that admit efficient no-regret algorithms become computationally hard in the sleeping setting where a subset of actions becomes unavailable in each round. Specifically, we show that the sleeping versions of these problems are at least as hard as PAC learning DNF expressions, a long standing open problem. We show hardness for the sleeping versions of Online Shortest Paths, Online Minimum Spanning Tree, Online k-Subsets, Online k-Truncated Permutations, Online Minimum Cut, and Online Bipartite Matching. The hardness result for the sleeping version of the Online Shortest Paths problem resolves an open problem presented at COLT 2015 (Koolen et al., 2015).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Sep 2015 18:27:42 GMT  (207kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03600v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 22 Sep 2015 18:12:37 GMT  (211kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03600v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 19 Dec 2016 22:28:15 GMT  (209kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03600v3", "A version of this paper was published in NIPS 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["satyen kale", "chansoo lee", "d\u00e1vid p\u00e1l"], "accepted": true, "id": "1509.03600"}
