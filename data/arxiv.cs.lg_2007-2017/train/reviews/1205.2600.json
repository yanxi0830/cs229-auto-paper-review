{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-May-2012", "title": "A Uniqueness Theorem for Clustering", "abstract": "Despite the widespread use of Clustering, there is distressingly little general theory of clustering available. Questions like \"What distinguishes a clustering of data from other data partitioning?\", \"Are there any principles governing all clustering paradigms?\", \"How should a user choose an appropriate clustering algorithm for a particular task?\", etc. are almost completely unanswered by the existing body of clustering literature. We consider an axiomatic approach to the theory of Clustering. We adopt the framework of Kleinberg, [Kle03]. By relaxing one of Kleinberg's clustering axioms, we sidestep his impossibility result and arrive at a consistent set of axioms. We suggest to extend these axioms, aiming to provide an axiomatic taxonomy of clustering paradigms. Such a taxonomy should provide users some guidance concerning the choice of the appropriate clustering paradigm for a given task. The main result of this paper is a set of abstract properties that characterize the Single-Linkage clustering function. This characterization result provides new insight into the properties of desired data groupings that make Single-Linkage the appropriate choice. We conclude by considering a taxonomy of clustering functions based on abstract properties that each satisfies.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 May 2012 18:48:23 GMT  (172kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.2600v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Twenty-Fifth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI2009)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["reza bosagh zadeh", "shai ben-david"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.2600"}
