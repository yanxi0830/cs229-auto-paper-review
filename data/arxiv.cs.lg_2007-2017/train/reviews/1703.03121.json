One key challenge in this setting is that learning a good model of coordination can be difficult, since coordination is often implicit in the demonstrations and must be inferred as a latent variable. We propose a joint approach that simultaneously learns a latent coordination model along with the individual policies. In particular, our method integrates unsupervised structure learning with conventional imitation learning. We illustrate the power of our approach on a difficult problem of learning multiple policies for fine-grained behavior modeling in team sports, where different players occupy different roles in the coordinated team strategy. We show that having a coordination model to infer the roles of players yields substantially improved imitation loss compared to conventional baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 9 Mar 2017 03:45:42 GMT  (2673kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03121v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hoang m le", "yisong yue", "peter carr 0001", "patrick lucey"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.03121"}
