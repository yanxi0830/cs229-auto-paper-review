Our IPMs are based on matching statistics of distributions embedded in a finite dimensional feature space. Mean and covariance feature matching IPMs allow for stable training of GANs, which we will call McGan. McGan minimizes a meaningful loss between distributions.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 17:46:30 GMT  (3643kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08398v1", "15 pages; under review"], ["v2", "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 23:45:25 GMT  (3887kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08398v2", "15 pages; published at ICML 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages; under review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["youssef mroueh", "tom sercu", "vaibhava goel"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.08398"}
