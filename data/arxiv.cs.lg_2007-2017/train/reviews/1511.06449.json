{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "19-Nov-2015", "title": "Learning to decompose for object detection and instance segmentation", "abstract": "Although deep convolutional neural networks(CNNs) have achieved remarkable results on object detection and segmentation, pre- and post-processing steps such as region proposals and non-maximum suppression(NMS), have been required. These steps result in high computational complexity and sensitivity to hyperparameters, e.g. thresholds for NMS. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable deep neural network architecture that generates the correct number of object instances and their bounding boxes (or segmentation masks) given an image, using only a single network evaluation without any pre- or post-processing steps. We have tested on detecting digits in multi-digit images synthesized using MNIST, automatically segmenting digits in these images, and detecting cars in the KITTI benchmark dataset. The proposed approach outperforms a strong CNN baseline on the synthesized digits datasets and shows promising results on KITTI car detection.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 23:30:06 GMT  (1661kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06449v1", "ICLR 2016 submission"], ["v2", "Mon, 30 Nov 2015 06:07:28 GMT  (1678kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06449v2", "ICLR 2016 submission"], ["v3", "Wed, 11 May 2016 02:55:29 GMT  (1551kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06449v3", "ICLR 2016 Workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "ICLR 2016 submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["eunbyung park", "alexander c berg"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06449"}
