Our method is dual in nature: in each iteration we update a random subset of the dual variables. However, unlike existing methods such as stochastic dual coordinate ascent, SDNA is capable of utilizing all curvature information contained in the examples, which leads to striking improvements in both theory and practice - sometimes by orders of magnitude. In the special case when an L2-regularizer is used in the primal, the dual problem is a concave quadratic maximization problem plus a separable term. In this regime, SDNA in each step solves a proximal subproblem involving a random principal submatrix of the Hessian of the quadratic function; whence the name of the method. If, in addition, the loss functions are quadratic, our method can be interpreted as a novel variant of the recently introduced Iterative Hessian Sketch.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 8 Feb 2015 16:34:41 GMT  (428kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02268v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["zheng qu", "peter richt\u00e1rik", "martin tak\u00e1c", "olivier fercoq"], "accepted": true, "id": "1502.02268"}
