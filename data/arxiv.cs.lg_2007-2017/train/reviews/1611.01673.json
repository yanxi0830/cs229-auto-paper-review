In this paper, we propose the \\emph{Generative Multi-Adversarial Network} (GMAN), a framework that extends GANs to multiple discriminators. In previous work, the successful training of GANs requires modifying the minimax objective to accelerate training early on. In contrast, GMAN can be reliably trained with the original, untampered objective. We explore a number of design perspectives with the discriminator role ranging from formidable adversary to forgiving teacher. Image generation tasks comparing the proposed framework to standard GANs demonstrate GMAN produces higher quality samples in a fraction of the iterations when measured by a pairwise GAM-type metric.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 5 Nov 2016 16:56:44 GMT  (4132kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01673v1", "Submitted as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"], ["v2", "Wed, 23 Nov 2016 15:33:09 GMT  (4133kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01673v2", "Submitted as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"], ["v3", "Thu, 2 Mar 2017 21:20:59 GMT  (4465kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01673v3", "Accepted as a conference paper (poster) at ICLR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted as a conference paper at ICLR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.MA cs.NE", "authors": ["ishan durugkar", "ian gemp", "sridhar mahadevan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.01673"}
