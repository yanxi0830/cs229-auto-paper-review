However, current spectral algorithms are largely restricted to mixtures of discrete or Gaussian distributions. In this paper, we propose a kernel method for learning multi-view latent variable models, allowing each mixture component to be nonparametric. The key idea of the method is to embed the joint distribution of a multi-view latent variable into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and then the latent parameters are recovered using a robust tensor power method. We establish that the sample complexity for the proposed method is quadratic in the number of latent components and is a low order polynomial in the other relevant parameters. Thus, our non-parametric tensor approach to learning latent variable models enjoys good sample and computational efficiencies. Moreover, the non-parametric tensor power method compares favorably to EM algorithm and other existing spectral algorithms in our experiments.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 Nov 2013 20:42:21 GMT  (101kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3287v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 8 Dec 2013 01:58:58 GMT  (99kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3287v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["le song", "animashree anandkumar", "bo dai", "bo xie 0002"], "accepted": true, "id": "1311.3287"}
