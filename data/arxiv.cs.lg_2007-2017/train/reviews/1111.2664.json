But these competitions have a number of weaknesses, particularly in the incentive structure they create for the participants. We propose a new approach, called a Crowdsourced Learning Mechanism, in which participants collaboratively \"learn\" a hypothesis for a given prediction task. The approach draws heavily from the concept of a prediction market, where traders bet on the likelihood of a future event. In our framework, the mechanism continues to publish the current hypothesis, and participants can modify this hypothesis by wagering on an update. The critical incentive property is that a participant will profit an amount that scales according to how much her update improves performance on a released test set.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Nov 2011 05:09:33 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2664v1", "Full version of the extended abstract which appeared in NIPS 2011"]], "COMMENTS": "Full version of the extended abstract which appeared in NIPS 2011", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.GT", "authors": ["jacob d abernethy", "rafael m frongillo"], "accepted": true, "id": "1111.2664"}
