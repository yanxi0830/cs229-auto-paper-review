However, it is difficult to define, detect or correct errors in an unsupervised way. Here, we train a deep neural network to re-synthesize its inputs at its output layer for a given class of data. We then exploit the fact that this abstract transformation, which we call a deep transform (DT), inherently rejects information (errors) existing outside of the abstract feature space. Using the DT to perform probabilistic re-synthesis, we demonstrate the recovery of data that has been subject to extreme degradation.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Feb 2015 16:41:26 GMT  (197kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04617v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["andrew j r simpson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.04617"}
