We apply the proposedmethod for object recognition with temporal context in videos and obtain better results than comparable methods in the literature, including the Deep Predictive Coding Networks previously proposed by Chalasani and Principe.Our contributions can be summarized as a scalable reinterpretation of the Deep Predictive Coding Networks trained end-to-end with backpropagation through time, an extension of the previously proposed Winner-Take-All Autoencoders to sequences in time, and a new technique for initializing and regularizing convolutional-recurrent neural networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 21:16:46 GMT  (3299kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00050v1", "under review"], ["v2", "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 16:01:43 GMT  (3299kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00050v2", "under review"]], "COMMENTS": "under review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["eder santana", "matthew emigh", "pablo zegers", "jose c principe"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00050"}
