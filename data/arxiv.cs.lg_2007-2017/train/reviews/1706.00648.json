We describe vector space of finite prefix trees with numerical leaves which allows us to combine expressive power of dataflow matrix machines with simplicity of traditional recurrent neural networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 May 2017 13:46:05 GMT  (79kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00648v1", "6 pages, accepted for presentation at LearnAut 2017: Learning and Automata workshop at LICS (Logic in Computer Science) 2017 conference.
