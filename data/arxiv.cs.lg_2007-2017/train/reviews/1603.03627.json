Data imbalance is an inherent problem in activity recognition caused by the irregular time distribution of activities, which are sequential and dependent on previous movements. We use conditional random fields (CRF), a graphical model for structured classification, to take advantage of dependencies between activities in a sequence. However, CRFs do not consider the negative effects of class imbalance during training. We propose a class-wise dynamically weighted CRF (dWCRF) where weights are automatically determined during training by maximizing the expected overall F-score. Our results based on three case studies from a healthcare application using a batteryless body worn sensor, demonstrate that our method, in general, improves overall and minority class F-score when compared to other CRF based classifiers and achieves similar or better overall and class-wise performance when compared to SVM based classifiers under conditions of limited training data. We also confirm the performance of our approach using an additional battery powered body worn sensor dataset, achieving similar results in cases of high class imbalance.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Mar 2016 13:51:37 GMT  (4073kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03627v1", "28 pages, 8 figures, 1 table"]], "COMMENTS": "28 pages, 8 figures, 1 table", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["roberto l shinmoto torres", "damith c ranasinghe", "qinfeng shi", "anton van den hengel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.03627"}
