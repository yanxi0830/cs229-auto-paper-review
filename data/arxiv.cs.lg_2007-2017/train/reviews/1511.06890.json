In particular, it utilizes a principled Bayesian sequential decision problem framework for jointly and naturally optimizing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. In general, the resulting induced GPP policy cannot be derived exactly due to an uncountable set of candidate observations. A key contribution of our work here thus lies in exploiting the Lipschitz continuity of the reward functions to solve for a nonmyopic adaptive epsilon-optimal GPP (epsilon-GPP) policy. To plan in real time, we further propose an asymptotically optimal, branch-and-bound anytime variant of epsilon-GPP with performance guarantee. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our epsilon-GPP policy and its anytime variant in Bayesian optimization and an energy harvesting task.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 21 Nov 2015 14:57:48 GMT  (574kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06890v1", "30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2016), Extended version with proofs, 17 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "30th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2016), Extended version with proofs, 17 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO", "authors": ["chun kai ling", "kian hsiang low", "patrick jaillet"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.06890"}
