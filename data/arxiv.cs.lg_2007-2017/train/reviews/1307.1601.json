This data provides a unique insight into immunological status at the point of tumour removal, tumour classification and post-operative survival. Attempts are made to cluster this dataset and important subsets of it in an effort to characterize the data and validate existing standards for tumour classification. It is apparent from optimal clustering that existing tumour classification is largely unrelated to immunological factors within a patient and that there may be scope for re-evaluating treatment options and survival estimates based on a combination of tumour physiology and patient histochemistry.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Jul 2013 12:56:24 GMT  (153kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.1601v1", "Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS), pp 187-191, 2012"]], "COMMENTS": "Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems (FedCSIS), pp 187-191, 2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CE", "authors": ["chris roadknight", "uwe aickelin", "alex ladas", "daniele soria", "john scholefield", "lindy durrant"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.1601"}
