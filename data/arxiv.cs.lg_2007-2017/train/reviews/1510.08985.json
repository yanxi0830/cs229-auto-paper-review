A PAC-RNN is comprised of a pair of neural networks in which a {\\it correction} network uses auxiliary information given by a {\\it prediction} network to help estimate the state probability. The information from the correction network is also used by the prediction network in a recurrent loop. Our model outperforms other state-of-the-art neural networks (DNNs, LSTMs) on IARPA-Babel tasks. Moreover, transfer learning from a language that is similar to the target language can help improve performance further.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 30 Oct 2015 06:42:03 GMT  (493kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08985v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["yu zhang", "ekapol chuangsuwanich", "james glass", "dong yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.08985"}
