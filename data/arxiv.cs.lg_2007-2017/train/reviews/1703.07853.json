These methods can decrease the total training time needed by an RL agent compared to training on the target task from scratch. Unlike traditional transfer learning, we consider creating a sequence from several training tasks in order to provide the most benefit in terms of reducing the total time to train.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Mar 2017 21:07:35 GMT  (352kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07853v1", "12 pages and 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages and 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["vikas jain", "theja tulabandhula"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07853"}
