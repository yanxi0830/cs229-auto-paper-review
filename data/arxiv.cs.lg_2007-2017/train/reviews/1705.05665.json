Examples of such tasks include computing optical flow and stereo disparity. We treat the relation inference tasks as a machine learning problem and tackle it with neural networks. A key to the problem is learning a representation of relations. We propose a new neural network module, contrast association unit (CAU), which explicitly models the relations between two sets of input variables. Due to the non-negativity of the weights in CAU, we adopt a multiplicative update algorithm for learning these weights. Experiments show that neural networks with CAUs are more effective in learning five fundamental image transformations than conventional neural networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 May 2017 12:09:44 GMT  (201kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05665v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["yao lu", "zhirong yang", "juho kannala", "samuel kaski"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.05665"}
