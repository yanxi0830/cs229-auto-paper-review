In order to model pairwise interactions between different tracks, such as suppression of overlapping tracks and contextual cues about co-occurence of different objects, we augment a standard min-cost flow objective with quadratic terms between detection variables. We learn the parameters of this model using structured prediction and a loss function which approximates the multi-target tracking accuracy. We evaluate two different approaches to finding an optimal set of tracks under model objective based on an LP relaxation and a novel greedy extension to dynamic programming that handles pairwise interactions. We find the greedy algorithm achieves equivalent performance to the LP relaxation while being 2-7x faster than a commercial solver. The resulting model with learned parameters outperforms existing methods across several categories on the KITTI tracking benchmark.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Dec 2014 17:04:35 GMT  (1493kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2066v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 9 Dec 2014 05:25:44 GMT  (1489kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.2066v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["shaofei wang", "charless c fowlkes"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.2066"}
