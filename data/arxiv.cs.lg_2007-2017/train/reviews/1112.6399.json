These methods have had some successes, but their applicability is limited because they are not robust to noise. To address this limitation, we look at two-manifold problems, in which we simultaneously reconstruct two related manifolds, each representing a different view of the same data. By solving these interconnected learning problems together and allowing information to flow between them, two-manifold algorithms are able to succeed where a non-integrated approach would fail: each view allows us to suppress noise in the other, reducing bias in the same way that an instrumental variable allows us to remove bias in a {linear} dimensionality reduction problem. We propose a class of algorithms for two-manifold problems, based on spectral decomposition of cross-covariance operators in Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss situations where two-manifold problems are useful, and demonstrate that solving a two-manifold problem can aid in learning a nonlinear dynamical system from limited data.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Dec 2011 19:52:14 GMT  (7479kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.6399v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["byron boots", "geoffrey j gordon"], "accepted": false, "id": "1112.6399"}
