While the effectiveness of diversity-inducing regularizers such as the mutual angular regularizer has been demonstrated empirically, a rigorous theoretical analysis of them is still missing. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap and analyze how the mutual angular regularizer (MAR) affects the generalization performance of supervised LVMs. We use neural network (NN) as a model instance to carry out the study and the analysis shows that increasing the diversity of hidden units in NN would reduce estimation error and increase approximation error. In addition to theoretical analysis, we also present empirical study which demonstrates that the MAR can greatly improve the performance of NN and the empirical observations are in accordance with the theoretical analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 Nov 2015 04:51:49 GMT  (368kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07110v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["pengtao xie", "yuntian deng", "eric xing"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.07110"}
