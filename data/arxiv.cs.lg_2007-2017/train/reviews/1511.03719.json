We call it universum prescription by the fact that the prescribed labels cannot be one of the supervised labels. In spite of its simplicity, universum prescription obtained competitive results in training deep convolutional networks for CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10 datasets. A qualitative justification of these approaches using Rademacher complexity is presented. The effect of a regularization parameter -- probability of sampling from unlabeled data -- is also studied empirically.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 11 Nov 2015 22:46:46 GMT  (99kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03719v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 19:54:22 GMT  (100kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03719v2", null], ["v3", "Sun, 22 Nov 2015 22:12:09 GMT  (100kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03719v3", null], ["v4", "Thu, 21 Jan 2016 06:11:33 GMT  (100kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03719v4", null], ["v5", "Mon, 15 Feb 2016 18:52:30 GMT  (100kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03719v5", null], ["v6", "Mon, 25 Apr 2016 21:10:32 GMT  (99kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03719v6", null], ["v7", "Fri, 18 Nov 2016 01:15:30 GMT  (104kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03719v7", "7 pages for article, 3 pages for supplemental material.
