In order to better facilitate the information offered by them, they need to automatically react to the intra-operative context. To this end, the progress of the surgical workflow must be detected and interpreted, so that the current status can be given in machine-readable form. In this work, Random Forests (RF) and Hidden Markov Models (HMM) are compared and combined to detect the surgical workflow phase of a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Various combinations of data were tested, from using only raw sensor data to filtered and augmented datasets. Achieved accuracies ranged from 64% to 72% for the RF approach, and from 80% to 82% for the combination of RF and HMM.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Jun 2017 08:33:24 GMT  (354kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00587v1", "7 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ralf stauder", "erg\\\"un kayis", "nassir navab"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.00587"}
