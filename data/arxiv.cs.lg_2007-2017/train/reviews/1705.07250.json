As demonstrated on several autoencoder examples it significantly outperforms the usual parametrization, reaching lower training error values with only a fraction of the number of epochs. It's argued that it makes it easier to understand and initialize the parameters.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 May 2017 02:54:52 GMT  (668kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07250v1", "8 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 13:50:46 GMT  (668kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07250v2", "8 pages"], ["v3", "Fri, 2 Jun 2017 14:58:53 GMT  (668kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07250v3", "8 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["michael f zimmer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07250"}
