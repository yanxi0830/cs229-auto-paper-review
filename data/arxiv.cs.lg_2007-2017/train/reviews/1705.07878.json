In this work, we propose TernGrad that uses ternary gradients to accelerate distributed deep learning in data parallelism. Our approach requires only three numerical levels {-1,0,1} which can aggressively reduce the communication time. We mathematically prove the convergence of TernGrad under the assumption of a bound on gradients. Guided by the bound, we propose layer-wise ternarizing and gradient clipping to improve its convergence. Our experiments show that applying TernGrad on AlexNet does not incur any accuracy loss and can even improve accuracy. The accuracy loss of GoogLeNet induced by TernGrad is less than 2% on average. Finally, a performance model is proposed to study the scalability of TernGrad. Experiments show significant speed gains for various deep neural networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 May 2017 17:42:15 GMT  (690kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07878v1", "9 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 24 May 2017 06:41:05 GMT  (693kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07878v2", "11 pages"], ["v3", "Mon, 4 Sep 2017 23:49:08 GMT  (693kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07878v3", "NIPS 2017 Oral"], ["v4", "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 16:21:51 GMT  (727kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07878v4", "NIPS 2017 Oral"], ["v5", "Tue, 31 Oct 2017 16:36:41 GMT  (694kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07878v5", "NIPS 2017 Oral"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DC cs.NE", "authors": ["wei wen", "cong xu", "feng yan", "chunpeng wu", "yandan wang", "yiran chen", "hai li"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.07878"}
