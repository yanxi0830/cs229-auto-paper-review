However, current lifelong learning methods exhibit non-vanishing regret as the amount of experience increases and include limitations that can lead to suboptimal or unsafe control policies. To address these issues, we develop a lifelong policy gradient learner that operates in an adversarial set- ting to learn multiple tasks online while enforcing safety constraints on the learned policies. We demonstrate, for the first time, sublinear regret for lifelong policy search, and validate our algorithm on several benchmark dynamical systems and an application to quadrotor control.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 21 May 2015 17:24:57 GMT  (283kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05798v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["haitham bou-ammar", "rasul tutunov", "eric eaton"], "accepted": true, "id": "1505.05798"}
