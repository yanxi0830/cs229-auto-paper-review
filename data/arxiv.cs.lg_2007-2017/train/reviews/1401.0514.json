Our primary contribution is to describe a family of generative models for NSC that have three key properties: First, they incorporate both sequential and hierarchical structure. Second, we learn a distributed representation of source code elements. Finally, they integrate closely with a compiler, which allows leveraging compiler logic and abstractions when building structure into the model. We also develop an extension that includes more complex structure, refining how the model generates identifier tokens based on what variables are currently in scope. Our models can be learned efficiently, and we show empirically that including appropriate structure greatly improves the models, measured by the probability of generating test programs.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Jan 2014 19:35:31 GMT  (415kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0514v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 20 Jun 2014 08:12:20 GMT  (629kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0514v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["chris j maddison", "daniel tarlow"], "accepted": true, "id": "1401.0514"}
