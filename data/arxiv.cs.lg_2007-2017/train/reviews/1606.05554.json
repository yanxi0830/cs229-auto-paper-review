Our approach requires minimum features engineering and a small set of la- belled data samples. Features are extracted using topic modelling based on latent Dirichlet allocation, and then a comprehensive data model is created using a Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA). Topic modelling summarises the data providing ease of use and high interpretability by visualising the topics using word clouds. Given that the SMS messages can be regarded as either spam (unwanted) or ham (wanted), the SDA is able to model the messages and accurately discriminate between the two classes without the need for a pre-labelled training set. The results are compared against the state-of-the-art spam detection algorithms with our proposed approach achieving over 97% accuracy which compares favourably to the best reported algorithms presented in the literature.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 17 Jun 2016 15:15:18 GMT  (1802kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05554v1", "Paper was accepted to the 25th International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (ICANN 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "Paper was accepted to the 25th International Conference on Artificial Neural Networks (ICANN 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["noura al moubayed", "toby breckon", "peter matthews", "a stephen mcgough"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.05554"}
