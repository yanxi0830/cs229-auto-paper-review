It is essential to ascertain the risk of bankruptcy at initial stages to prevent financial losses. In this perspective, different soft computing techniques can be employed to ascertain bankruptcy. This study proposes a bankruptcy prediction system to categorize the companies based on extent of risk. The prediction system acts as a decision support tool for detection of bankruptcy", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Feb 2015 11:07:51 GMT  (526kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03601v1", "11 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["kalyan nagaraj", "amulyashree sridhar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.03601"}
