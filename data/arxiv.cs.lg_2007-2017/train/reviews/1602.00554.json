We show how this objective can be understood in terms of graph embedding as well as how it corresponds to the information-theoretic measure of excess entropy in special cases. Experimentally, we compare the approach to two other algorithms for the extraction of predictable features, namely ForeCA and PFA, and show how it is able to outperform them in certain settings.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Feb 2016 15:11:48 GMT  (239kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00554v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 11 May 2017 12:41:25 GMT  (286kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00554v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["bj\\\"orn weghenkel", "asja fischer", "laurenz wiskott"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.00554"}
