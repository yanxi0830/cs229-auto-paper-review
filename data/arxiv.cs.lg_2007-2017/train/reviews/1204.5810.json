The n columns arrive in random order and the goal is to set the corresponding decision variables irrevocably when they arrive so as to obtain a feasible solution maximizing the expected reward. Previous (1 - \\epsilon)-competitive algorithms require the right-hand side of the LP to be Omega((m/\\epsilon^2) log (n/\\epsilon)), a bound that worsens with the number of columns and rows. However, the dependence on the number of columns is not required in the single-row case and known lower bounds for the general case are also independent of n.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Apr 2012 02:06:44 GMT  (48kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5810v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["marco molinaro", "r ravi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1204.5810"}
