The discovery of motifs is crucial for practitioners in order to understand and interpret the phenomena occurring in sequential data. Currently, motifs are searched among series sub-sequences, aiming at selecting the most frequently occurring ones. Search-based methods, which try out series sub-sequence as motif candidates, are currently believed to be the best methods in finding the most frequent patterns.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 3 May 2015 12:11:43 GMT  (249kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00423v1", "Submitted to KDD2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to KDD2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["josif grabocka", "nicolas schilling", "lars schmidt-thieme"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.00423"}
