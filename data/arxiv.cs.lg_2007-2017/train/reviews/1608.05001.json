Which has multi layers that project the vector representation of input data into a lower vector space. These projection vectors are dense representations of the input data. As a result, SAE can be used for image compression. Using chaotic logistic map, the compression ones can further be encrypted. In this study, an application of image compression and encryption is suggested using SAE and chaotic logistic map. Experiments show that this application is feasible and effective. It can be used for image transmission and image protection on internet simultaneously.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 16 Aug 2016 14:51:25 GMT  (1009kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05001v1", "6 pages, 6 figures"], ["v2", "Sun, 9 Oct 2016 02:27:20 GMT  (932kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.05001v2", "6 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.MM", "authors": ["fei hu", "changjiu pu", "haowei gao", "mengzi tang", "li li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.05001"}
