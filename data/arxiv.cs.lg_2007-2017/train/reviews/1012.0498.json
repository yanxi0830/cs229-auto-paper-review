Currently popular systems include Amazon's book recommendations, Netflix's movie recommendations, and Pandora's music recommendations. In this paper we address the problem of estimating probabilities associated with recommendation system data using non-parametric kernel smoothing. In our estimation we interpret missing items as randomly censored observations and obtain efficient computation schemes using combinatorial properties of generating functions. We demonstrate our approach with several case studies involving real world movie recommendation data. The results are comparable with state-of-the-art techniques while also providing probabilistic preference estimates outside the scope of traditional recommender systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Dec 2010 17:04:19 GMT  (653kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1012.0498v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["mingxuan sun", "guy lebanon", "paul kidwell"], "accepted": false, "id": "1012.0498"}
