Many such methods rely on graph-based approaches, where continuous labels are propagated through a graph on the input points. Here we argue that it is more effective to consider infection processes on these graphs, whereby at any point in time nodes can infect other nodes with their labels. Since the dynamics of these processes is stochastic, we develop algorithms for efficiently estimating the expected labels over time. We show that our approach addresses many of the limitations of graph based learning, and is also empirically effective.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 19 Mar 2017 12:49:51 GMT  (49kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06426v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 21 May 2017 07:17:41 GMT  (1289kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06426v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 16 Oct 2017 21:26:17 GMT  (1313kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06426v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["nir rosenfeld", "amir globerson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06426"}
