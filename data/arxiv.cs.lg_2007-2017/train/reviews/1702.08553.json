We provide, for the first time, an efficient algorithm that is able to realize this upper bound, and we empirically demonstrate its good performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 21:59:24 GMT  (576kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08553v1", "18 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 9 Jun 2017 00:39:57 GMT  (574kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08553v2", "16 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["christopher tosh", "sanjoy dasgupta"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.08553"}
