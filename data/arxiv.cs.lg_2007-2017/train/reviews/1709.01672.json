For such a network, we design routing-scheduling policies that maximize the end-to-end timely throughput of the network. Timely throughput of a flow $f$ is defined as the average rate at which packets of flow $f$ reach their destination node $d_f$ within their deadline.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Sep 2017 04:56:43 GMT  (923kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01672v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 12 Sep 2017 03:58:18 GMT  (1236kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01672v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.LG cs.NE cs.SY", "authors": ["rahul singh", "p r kumar", "eytan modiano"], "accepted": false, "id": "1709.01672"}
