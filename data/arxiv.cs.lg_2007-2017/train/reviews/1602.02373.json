We view it as a special case of a general framework which jointly trains a linear model with a non-linear feature generator consisting of `text region embedding + pooling'. Under this framework, we explore a more sophisticated region embedding method using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). LSTM can embed text regions of variable (and possibly large) sizes, whereas the region size needs to be fixed in a CNN. We seek the best use of LSTM for the purpose in the supervised and semi-supervised settings, starting with the idea of one-hot LSTM, which eliminates the customarily used word embedding layer. Our results indicate that on this task, embeddings of text regions, which can convey higher concepts than single words in isolation, are more useful than word embeddings. We report performances exceeding the previous best results on four benchmark datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 7 Feb 2016 14:05:58 GMT  (206kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02373v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 26 May 2016 15:26:34 GMT  (229kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02373v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["rie johnson", "tong zhang 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.02373"}
