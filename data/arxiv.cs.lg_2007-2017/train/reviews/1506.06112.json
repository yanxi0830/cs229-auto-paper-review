The use of the statistical Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is introduced for modeling margin distances, allowing us to derive a scalable non-linear model called the Extreme Value Machine (EVM). Without the need for a kernel, the EVM leverages a margin model to estimate the probability of sample inclusion in each class. The EVM selects a near-optimal subset of the training vectors to optimize the gain in terms of points covered versus parameters used. We show that the problem reduces to the NP-hard Set Cover problem which has a provable polynomial time approximation. The resulting machine has comparable closed set accuracy (i.e., when all testing classes are known at training time) to optimized RBF SVMs and exhibits far superior performance in open set recognition (i.e., when unknown classes exist at testing time). In open set recognition performance, the EVM is more accurate and more scalable than the state of the art.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Jun 2015 19:04:54 GMT  (507kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06112v1", "Submitted to NIPS 2015"], ["v2", "Tue, 12 Jan 2016 00:21:24 GMT  (738kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06112v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 18 May 2016 00:57:06 GMT  (801kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06112v3", "Submitted as an IEEE Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (PAMI) short article"], ["v4", "Sun, 21 May 2017 01:47:04 GMT  (3633kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06112v4", "Pre-print of a manuscript accepted to the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (T-PAMI) journal"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to NIPS 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ethan m rudd", "lalit p jain", "walter j scheirer", "terrance e boult"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.06112"}
