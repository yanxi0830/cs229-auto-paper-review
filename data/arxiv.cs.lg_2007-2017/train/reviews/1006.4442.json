In this endeavor, many probabilistic logics have been developed. ProbLog is a recent probabilistic extension of Prolog motivated by the mining of large biological networks. In ProbLog, facts can be labeled with probabilities. These facts are treated as mutually independent random variables that indicate whether these facts belong to a randomly sampled program. Different kinds of queries can be posed to ProbLog programs. We introduce algorithms that allow the efficient execution of these queries, discuss their implementation on top of the YAP-Prolog system, and evaluate their performance in the context of large networks of biological entities.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 23 Jun 2010 08:05:34 GMT  (104kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4442v1", "28 pages; To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)"]], "COMMENTS": "28 pages; To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.LG cs.LO", "authors": ["angelika kimmig", "bart demoen", "luc de raedt", "v\\'itor santos costa", "ricardo rocha"], "accepted": false, "id": "1006.4442"}
