{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Jun-2016", "title": "Avoiding Imposters and Delinquents: Adversarial Crowdsourcing and Peer Prediction", "abstract": "We consider a crowdsourcing model in which $n$ workers are asked to rate the quality of $n$ items previously generated by other workers. An unknown set of $\\alpha n$ workers generate reliable ratings, while the remaining workers may behave arbitrarily and possibly adversarially. The manager of the experiment can also manually evaluate the quality of a small number of items, and wishes to curate together almost all of the high-quality items with at most an $\\epsilon$ fraction of low-quality items. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that this is possible with an amount of work required of the manager, and each worker, that does not scale with $n$: the dataset can be curated with $\\tilde{O}\\Big(\\frac{1}{\\beta\\alpha^3\\epsilon^4}\\Big)$ ratings per worker, and $\\tilde{O}\\Big(\\frac{1}{\\beta\\epsilon^2}\\Big)$ ratings by the manager, where $\\beta$ is the fraction of high-quality items. Our results extend to the more general setting of peer prediction, including peer grading in online classrooms.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Jun 2016 21:45:14 GMT  (44kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05374v1", "18 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.CR cs.DS cs.GT cs.LG", "authors": ["jacob steinhardt", "gregory valiant", "moses charikar"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.05374"}
