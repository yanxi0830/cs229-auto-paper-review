Existing literature suggests that pixel-wise face alignment is the key to achieve high-accuracy face recognition. By assuming a human face as piece-wise planar surfaces, where each surface corresponds to a facial part, we develop in this paper a Constrained Part-based Alignment (CPA) algorithm for face recognition across pose and/or expression. Our proposed algorithm is based on a trainable CPA model, which learns appearance evidence of individual parts and a tree-structured shape configuration among different parts. Given a probe face, CPA simultaneously aligns all its parts by fitting them to the appearance evidence with consideration of the constraint from the tree-structured shape configuration. This objective is formulated as a norm minimization problem regularized by graph likelihoods. CPA can be easily integrated with many existing classifiers to perform part-based face recognition. Extensive experiments on benchmark face datasets show that CPA outperforms or is on par with existing methods for robust face recognition across pose, expression, and/or illumination changes.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Jan 2015 06:05:01 GMT  (2948kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04717v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["yuting zhang", "kui jia", "yueming wang", "gang pan", "tsung-han chan", "yi ma"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.04717"}
