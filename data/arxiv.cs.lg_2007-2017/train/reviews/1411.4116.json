We disambiguate the input word vectors before they are fed into a compositional deep net. A series of evaluations shows the positive effect of prior disambiguation for such deep models.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 15 Nov 2014 06:32:49 GMT  (13kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4116v1", "NIPS 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["jianpeng cheng", "dimitri kartsaklis", "edward grefenstette"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.4116"}
