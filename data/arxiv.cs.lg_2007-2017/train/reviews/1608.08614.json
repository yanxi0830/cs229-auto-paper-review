This work provides an empirical investigation of various facets of this question: Is more pre-training data always better? How does feature quality depend on the number of training examples per class? Does adding more object classes improve performance? For the same data budget, how should the data be split into classes? Is fine-grained recognition necessary for learning good features? Given the same number of training classes, is it better to have coarse classes or fine-grained classes? Which is better: more classes or more examples per class?", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 Aug 2016 19:45:09 GMT  (4593kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08614v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 10 Dec 2016 13:37:06 GMT  (2051kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08614v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["minyoung huh", "pulkit agrawal", "alexei a efros"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.08614"}
