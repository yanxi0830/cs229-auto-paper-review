{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "24-May-2016", "title": "Interaction Screening: Efficient and Sample-Optimal Learning of Ising Models", "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning the underlying graph of an unknown Ising model on p spins from a collection of i.i.d. samples generated from the model. We suggest a new estimator that is computationally efficient and requires a number of samples that is near-optimal with respect to previously established information-theoretic lower-bound. Our statistical estimator has a physical interpretation in terms of \"interaction screening\". The estimator is consistent and is efficiently implemented using convex optimization. We prove that with appropriate regularization, the estimator recovers the underlying graph using a number of samples that is logarithmic in the system size p and exponential in the maximum coupling-intensity and maximum node-degree.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 May 2016 01:36:48 GMT  (81kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07252v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 14 Nov 2016 03:00:29 GMT  (81kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07252v2", "To be published in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 30"], ["v3", "Mon, 19 Dec 2016 13:32:25 GMT  (81kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07252v3", "To be published in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 30"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cond-mat.stat-mech cs.IT math.IT math.ST stat.ML stat.TH", "authors": ["marc vuffray", "sidhant misra", "andrey y lokhov", "michael chertkov"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.07252"}
