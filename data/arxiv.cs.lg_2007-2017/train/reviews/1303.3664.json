This perspective gains significance under the so called separability condition. This is a condition on existence of novel-words that are unique to each topic. We present a suite of highly efficient algorithms based on data-dependent and random projections of word-frequency patterns to identify novel words and associated topics. We will also discuss the statistical guarantees of the data-dependent projections method based on two mild assumptions on the prior density of topic document matrix. Our key insight here is that the maximum and minimum values of cross-document frequency patterns projected along any direction are associated with novel words. While our sample complexity bounds for topic recovery are similar to the state-of-art, the computational complexity of our random projection scheme scales linearly with the number of documents and the number of words per document. We present several experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate qualitative and quantitative merits of our scheme.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 Mar 2013 02:37:19 GMT  (416kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3664v1", "This paper was submitted to the 30th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2013) on February 15, 2013"], ["v2", "Mon, 18 Mar 2013 13:11:02 GMT  (416kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.3664v2", null]], "COMMENTS": "This paper was submitted to the 30th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2013) on February 15, 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["weicong ding", "mohammad hossein rohban", "prakash ishwar", "venkatesh saligrama"], "accepted": true, "id": "1303.3664"}
