In this paper, we develop the first linear-time algorithm for maximizing a general monotone submodular function subject to a cardinality constraint. We show that our randomized algorithm, Rand-Greedy, can achieve a (1-1/e) approximation guarantee to the optimum solution in time linear in the size of the data and independent of the cardinality constraint. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on submodular functions arising in data summarization, including training large-scale kernel methods and exemplar-based clustering. We observe that Rand-Greedy practically achieves the same utility value as lazy greedy but runs much faster. More surprisingly, we observe that in many practical scenarios Rand-Greedy does not evaluate the whole fraction of data points even once and still achieves indistinguishable results compared to lazy greedy.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 28 Sep 2014 18:06:23 GMT  (44kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7938v1", "14 pages, 9 figures, sibmitted to AAAI 2014"], ["v2", "Wed, 26 Nov 2014 08:45:32 GMT  (855kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7938v2", "In Proc.
