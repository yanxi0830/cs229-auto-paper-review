Our method learns a probabilistic model for real-world programs from a corpus of existing code. It uses this model during synthesis to automatically infer a posterior distribution over sketches, or syntactic models of the problem to be synthesized. Sketches sampled from this posterior are then used to drive combinatorial synthesis of a program in a high-level programming language.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Mar 2017 16:23:30 GMT  (376kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05698v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 21 Mar 2017 18:29:10 GMT  (377kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05698v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 17 Jul 2017 02:29:37 GMT  (229kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05698v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.PL cs.LG", "authors": ["vijayaraghavan murali", "letao qi", "swarat chaudhuri", "chris jermaine"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.05698"}
