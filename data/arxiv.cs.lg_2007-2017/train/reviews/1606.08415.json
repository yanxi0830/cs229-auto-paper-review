The GELU nonlinearity is the expected transformation of a stochastic process which randomly applies the identity or zero map, combining the intuitions of dropout and zoneout while respecting neuron values. This connection suggests a new probabilistic understanding of nonlinearities. We perform an empirical evaluation of the GELU nonlinearity against the ReLU and ELU activations and find performance improvements across all tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Jun 2016 19:20:40 GMT  (435kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 8 Jul 2016 18:32:46 GMT  (608kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.08415v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["dan hendrycks", "kevin gimpel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.08415"}
