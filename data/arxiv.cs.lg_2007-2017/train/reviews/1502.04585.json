What makes this estimation problem particularly challenging is its sequential and adaptive nature. As participants are allowed to repeatedly evaluate their submissions on the leaderboard, they may begin to overfit to the holdout data that supports the leaderboard. Few theoretical results give actionable advice on how to design a reliable leaderboard. Existing approaches therefore often resort to poorly understood heuristics such as limiting the bit precision of answers and the rate of re-submission.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Feb 2015 15:53:03 GMT  (90kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04585v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["avrim blum", "moritz hardt"], "accepted": true, "id": "1502.04585"}
