In this paper we contribute to this understanding in two ways. We present a new theoretically tractable variant of random regression forests and prove that our algorithm is consistent. We also provide an empirical evaluation, comparing our algorithm and other theoretically tractable random forest models to the random forest algorithm used in practice. Our experiments provide insight into the relative importance of different simplifications that theoreticians have made to obtain tractable models for analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Oct 2013 22:33:35 GMT  (4536kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1415v1", "Under review by the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review by the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["misha denil", "david matheson", "nando de freitas"], "accepted": true, "id": "1310.1415"}
