SVRG and related methods have recently surged into prominence for convex optimization given their edge over stochastic gradient descent (SGD); but their theoretical analysis almost exclusively assumes convexity. In contrast, we prove non-asymptotic rates of convergence (to stationary points) of SVRG for nonconvex optimization, and show that it is provably faster than SGD and gradient descent. We also analyze a subclass of nonconvex problems on which SVRG attains linear convergence to the global optimum. We extend our analysis to mini-batch variants of SVRG, showing (theoretical) linear speedup due to mini-batching in parallel settings.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Mar 2016 23:37:38 GMT  (130kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06160v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 4 Apr 2016 23:08:20 GMT  (130kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06160v2", "Minor feedback changes"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.OC cs.LG cs.NE stat.ML", "authors": ["sashank j reddi", "ahmed hefny", "suvrit sra", "barnab\u00e1s p\u00f3czos", "alexander j smola"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.06160"}
