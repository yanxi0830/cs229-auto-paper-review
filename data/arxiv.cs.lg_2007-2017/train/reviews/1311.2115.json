{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Nov-2013", "title": "Fast large-scale optimization by unifying stochastic gradient and quasi-Newton methods", "abstract": "We present an algorithm for minimizing a sum of functions that combines the computational efficiency of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with the second order curvature information accessible by quasi-Newton methods. We unify these disparate approaches by maintaining an independent Hessian approximation for each contributing function in the sum. We maintain computational tractability even for high dimensional optimization problems by developing an adaptive scheme to store and manipulate these quadratic approximations in a shared, time evolving low dimensional subspace, determined by the recent history of gradient evaluations. This algorithm contrasts with earlier stochastic second order techniques, which treat the Hessian of each contributing function only as a noisy approximation to the full Hessian, rather than as a target for direct estimation. Our approach reaps the benefits of both SGD and quasi-Newton methods; each update step requires only a single subfunction evaluation (like SGD but unlike previous stochastic second order methods), while little to no adjustment of hyperparameters is required (as is typical for quasi-Newton methods but not for SGD). For convex problems the convergence rate of the proposed technique is at least linear. We demonstrate improved convergence on five diverse optimization problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 9 Nov 2013 00:54:37 GMT  (960kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2115v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 10 Feb 2014 02:10:32 GMT  (1988kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2115v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 26 Mar 2014 06:49:16 GMT  (2073kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2115v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 27 Apr 2014 02:38:28 GMT  (2101kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2115v4", null], ["v5", "Tue, 13 May 2014 23:51:41 GMT  (3213kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2115v5", null], ["v6", "Thu, 14 Aug 2014 02:27:38 GMT  (6430kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2115v6", null], ["v7", "Sun, 30 Nov 2014 01:35:55 GMT  (1598kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2115v7", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jascha sohl-dickstein", "ben poole", "surya ganguli"], "accepted": true, "id": "1311.2115"}
