First, we study an approach where uni-modal deep networks are trained separately and their final hidden layers fused to obtain a joint feature space in which another deep network is built. While the audio network alone achieves a phone error rate (PER) of $41\\%$ under clean condition on the IBM large vocabulary audio-visual studio dataset, this fusion model achieves a PER of $35.83\\%$ demonstrating the tremendous value of the visual channel in phone classification even in audio with high signal to noise ratio. Second, we present a new deep network architecture that uses a bilinear softmax layer to account for class specific correlations between modalities. We show that combining the posteriors from the bilinear networks with those from the fused model mentioned above results in a further significant phone error rate reduction, yielding a final PER of $34.03\\%$.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Jan 2015 05:25:33 GMT  (323kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.05396v1", "ICASSP 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "ICASSP 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["youssef mroueh", "etienne marcheret", "vaibhava goel"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.05396"}
