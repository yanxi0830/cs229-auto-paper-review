This paper presents a novel structure based on functional hashing to compress DNNs, namely FunHashNN. For each entry in a deep net, FunHashNN uses multiple low-cost hash functions to fetch values in the compression space, and then employs a small reconstruction network to recover that entry. The reconstruction network is plugged into the whole network and trained jointly. FunHashNN includes the recently proposed HashedNets as a degenerated case, and benefits from larger value capacity and less reconstruction loss. We further discuss extensions with dual space hashing and multi-hops. On several benchmark datasets, FunHashNN demonstrates high compression ratios with little loss on prediction accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 May 2016 23:44:19 GMT  (1995kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06560v1", "submitted to NIPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted to NIPS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["lei shi", "shikun feng", "zhifanzhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.06560"}
