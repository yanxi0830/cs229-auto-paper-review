Their applications in machine learning include summary extraction and recommendation systems. Yet, the cost of sampling from a DPP is prohibitive in large-scale applications, which has triggered an effort towards efficient approximate samplers. We build a novel MCMC sampler that combines ideas from combinatorial geometry, linear programming, and Monte Carlo methods to sample from DPPs with a fixed sample cardinality, also called projection DPPs. Our sampler leverages the ability of the hit-and-run MCMC kernel to efficiently move across convex bodies. Previous theoretical results yield a fast mixing time of our chain when targeting a distribution that is close to a projection DPP, but not a DPP in general. Our empirical results demonstrate that this extends to sampling projection DPPs, i.e., our sampler is more sample-efficient than previous approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 30 May 2017 08:07:19 GMT  (3376kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10498v1", "19 pages, accepted to ICML 2017"], ["v2", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 08:36:00 GMT  (3783kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.10498v2", "12 pages, 12 figures, 2 columns, accepted to ICML 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "19 pages, accepted to ICML 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG stat.CO", "authors": ["guillaume gautier", "r\u00e9mi bardenet", "michal valko"], "accepted": true, "id": "1705.10498"}
