This \"weight transport problem\" [1] is thought to be the crux of BP's biological implausibility. Using 15 different classification datasets, we systematically study to what extent BP really depends on weight symmetry. Surprisingly, the results indicate: (1) the magnitudes of feedback weights do not matter to performance (2) the signs of feedback weights do matter--the more concordant signs between feedforward and their corresponding feedback connections, the better (3) with feedback weights having random magnitudes and 100% concordant signs, we were able to achieve the same or even better performance than SGD. (4) some normalizations/stabilizations are indispensable for such asymmetric BP to work, namely Batch Normalization (BN) [2] and/or a \"Batch Manhattan\" (BM) update rule.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 17 Oct 2015 03:49:05 GMT  (374kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05067v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 31 Oct 2015 16:55:06 GMT  (374kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05067v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 2 Dec 2015 01:49:38 GMT  (374kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05067v3", "Fixed a small bug in the implementation of Batch Normalization (BN).
