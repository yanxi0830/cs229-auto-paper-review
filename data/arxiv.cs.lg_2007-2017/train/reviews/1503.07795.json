The resulting model can be further integrated into Privacy-Preserving Data Mining, where it can be used to assess risk of identification of different patient groups. Our project considers relations between diabetes and demographics of patients as a multi-labelled problem. Most research in this area has been done as binary classification, where the target class is finding if a person has diabetes or not. But very few, and maybe no work has been done in multi-labeled analysis of the demographics of patients who are likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. To identify such groups, we applied ensembles of several multi-label learning algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Mar 2015 17:22:26 GMT  (535kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.07795v1", "16 pages, 9 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 9 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["naveen kumar parachur cotha", "marina sokolova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.07795"}
