We provide a sharp regret analysis of this algorithm in a standard stochastic noise setting, demonstrate its scalability properties, and prove its effectiveness on a number of synthetic and real-world datasets. Our experiments show a significant increase in prediction performance over state-of-the-art methods for bandit problems.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 31 Jan 2014 18:49:42 GMT  (7938kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.8257v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 13 May 2014 07:13:06 GMT  (4223kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.8257v2", "20 pages, 7 figures, Cycle II Accepted Paper of ICML 2014, Beijing, China.
