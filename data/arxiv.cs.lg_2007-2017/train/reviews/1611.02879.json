The frame labels obtained from the acoustic model are then used to perform a non-linear dimensionality reduction of the visual features using a deep bottleneck network. Audio and visual features are fused and used to train a fusion RNN. The use of bottleneck features for visual modality helps the model to converge properly during training. Our system is evaluated on GRID corpus. Our results show that presence of visual modality gives significant improvement in character error rate (CER) at various levels of noise even when the model is trained without noisy data. We also provide a comparison of two fusion methods: feature fusion and decision fusion.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Nov 2016 10:24:52 GMT  (311kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02879v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["abhinav thanda", "shankar m venkatesan"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.02879"}
