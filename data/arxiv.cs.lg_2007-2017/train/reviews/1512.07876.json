{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "24-Dec-2015", "title": "An unsupervised spatiotemporal graphical modeling approach to anomaly detection in distributed CPS", "abstract": "Modern distributed cyber-physical systems (CPSs) encounter a large variety of physical faults and cyber anomalies and in many cases, they are vulnerable to catastrophic fault propagation scenarios due to strong connectivity among the sub-systems. This paper presents a new data-driven framework for system-wide anomaly detection for addressing such issues. The framework is based on a spatiotemporal feature extraction scheme built on the concept of symbolic dynamics for discovering and representing causal interactions among the subsystems of a CPS. The extracted spatiotemporal features are then used to learn system-wide patterns via a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The results show that: (1) the RBM free energy in the off-nominal conditions are different from that in the nominal conditions and can be used for anomaly detection; (2) the framework can capture multiple nominal modes with one graphical model; (3) the case studies with simulated data and an integrated building system validates the proposed approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Dec 2015 18:15:42 GMT  (1182kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07876v1", "10 pages, to appear in ICCPS 2016"], ["v2", "Fri, 20 May 2016 16:44:59 GMT  (976kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07876v2", "ICCPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, to appear in ICCPS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["chao liu", "sambuddha ghosal", "zhanhong jiang", "soumik sarkar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.07876"}
