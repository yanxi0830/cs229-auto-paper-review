We propose algorithms $\\mathtt{LazyEV}$ and $\\mathtt{LazyCCA}$ to solve the two problems with running times linearly dependent on the input size and on $k$.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 20 Jul 2016 16:43:18 GMT  (591kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06017v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1607.03463"], ["v2", "Sat, 26 Nov 2016 03:18:24 GMT  (668kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.06017v2", "We have now stated more clearly why this paper has outperformed relevant previous results, and included discussions for doubly-stochastic methods. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1607.03463"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1607.03463", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.OC cs.DS cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["zeyuan allen-zhu", "yuanzhi li"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.06017"}
