{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Jan-2013", "title": "Discriminative Recurrent Sparse Auto-Encoders", "abstract": "We present the discriminative recurrent sparse auto-encoder model, which consists of an encoder whose hidden layer is recurrent, and two linear decoders, one to reconstruct the input, and one to predict the output. The hidden layer is composed of rectified linear units (ReLU) and is subject to a sparsity penalty. The network is first trained in unsupervised mode to reconstruct the input, and subsequently trained discriminatively to also produce the desired output. The recurrent network is time-unfolded with a given number of iterations, and trained using back-propagation through time. In its time-unfolded form, the network can be seen as a very deep multi-layer network in which the weights are shared between the hidden layers. The depth allows the system to exhibit all the power of deep network while substantially reducing the number of trainable parameters.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 18:07:01 GMT  (355kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3775v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 1 Feb 2013 18:51:59 GMT  (364kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3775v2", "Improved readability of the text, particularly the introduction.
