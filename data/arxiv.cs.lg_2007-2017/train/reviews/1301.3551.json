We formulate an entropy-like functional on positive definite matrices based on Renyi's entropy definition and examine some key properties of this functional that lead to the concept of infinite divisibility. The proposed formulation avoids the plug in estimation of density and brings along the representation power of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. We show how analogues to quantities such as conditional entropy can be defined, enabling solutions to learning problems. In particular, we derive a supervised metric learning algorithm with very competitive results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 01:49:52 GMT  (159kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3551v1", "Initial submission for International Conference on Learning Representations 2013"], ["v2", "Wed, 20 Mar 2013 06:40:01 GMT  (190kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3551v2", "Modified submission for International Conference on Learning Representations 2013"], ["v3", "Fri, 22 Mar 2013 14:53:42 GMT  (190kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3551v3", "Modified submission for International Conference on Learning Representations 2013"], ["v4", "Tue, 16 Apr 2013 00:12:21 GMT  (190kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3551v4", "Modified submission for International Conference on Learning Representations 2013"], ["v5", "Wed, 1 May 2013 06:18:31 GMT  (192kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3551v5", "Modified submission for International Conference on Learning Representations 2013"], ["v6", "Tue, 4 Jun 2013 04:42:39 GMT  (190kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3551v6", "Modified submission for International Conference on Learning Representations 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "Initial submission for International Conference on Learning Representations 2013", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["luis g sanchez giraldo", "jose c principe"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.3551"}
