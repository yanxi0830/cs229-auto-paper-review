{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-Jun-2015", "title": "Efficient Learning of Ensembles with QuadBoost", "abstract": "We first present a general risk bound for ensembles that depends on the Lp norm of the weighted combination of voters which can be selected from a continuous set. We then propose a boosting method, called QuadBoost, which is strongly supported by the general risk bound and has very simple rules for assigning the voters' weights. Moreover, QuadBoost exhibits a rate of decrease of its empirical error which is slightly faster than the one achieved by AdaBoost. The experimental results confirm the expectation of the theory that QuadBoost is a very efficient method for learning ensembles.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 15:10:56 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02535v1", "9 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 19 Jun 2015 14:14:29 GMT  (19kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02535v2", "9 pages"], ["v3", "Fri, 10 Jul 2015 20:15:09 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02535v3", "9 pages"], ["v4", "Tue, 21 Jul 2015 17:37:12 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02535v4", "9 pages"], ["v5", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 19:33:34 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02535v5", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["louis fortier-dubois", "fran\\c{c}ois laviolette", "mario marchand", "louis-emile robitaille", "jean-francis roy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.02535"}
