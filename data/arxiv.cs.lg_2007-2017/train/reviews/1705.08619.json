Accordingly, developing an ultra-low-cost alternative, affordable even to groups at the bottom of the economic pyramid, has emerged as a societal imperative. Against this backdrop, we propose an inexpensive yet accurate home-based electrocardiogram(ECG) monitoring service. Specifically, we seek to provide point-of-care monitoring of premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), high frequency of which could indicate the onset of potentially fatal arrhythmia. Note that a traditional telecardiology system acquires the ECG, transmits it to a professional diagnostic centre without processing, and nearly achieves the diagnostic accuracy of a bedside setup, albeit at high bandwidth cost. In this context, we aim at reducing cost without significantly sacrificing reliability. To this end, we develop a dictionary-based algorithm that detects with high sensitivity the anomalous beats only which are then transmitted. We further compress those transmitted beats using class-specific dictionaries subject to suitable reconstruction/diagnostic fidelity. Such a scheme would not only reduce the overall bandwidth requirement, but also localising anomalous beats, thereby reducing physicians' burden. Finally, using Monte Carlo cross validation on MIT/BIH arrhythmia database, we evaluate the performance of the proposed system. In particular, with a sensitivity target of at most one undetected PVC in one hundred beats, and a percentage root mean squared difference less than 9% (a clinically acceptable level of fidelity), we achieved about 99.15% reduction in bandwidth cost, equivalent to 118-fold savings over traditional telecardiology.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 May 2017 06:00:57 GMT  (1335kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08619v1", "19 pages, 9 figures and 5 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "19 pages, 9 figures and 5 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["bollepalli s chandra", "challa s sastry", "laxminarayana anumandla", "soumya jana"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.08619"}
