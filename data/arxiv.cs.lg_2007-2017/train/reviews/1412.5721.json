In this model, the algorithm receives vectors v1,...,vn one by one in arbitrary order. For each vector vi the algorithm outputs a cluster identifier before receiving vi+1. Our online algorithm generates ~O(k) clusters whose k-means cost is ~O(W*) where W* is the optimal k-means cost using k clusters and ~O suppresses poly logarithmic factors. We also show that, experimentally, it is not much worse than k-means++ while operating in a strictly more constrained computational model.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Dec 2014 05:09:32 GMT  (216kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5721v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 23 Feb 2015 17:30:23 GMT  (220kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5721v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["edo liberty", "ram sriharsha", "maxim sviridenko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.5721"}
