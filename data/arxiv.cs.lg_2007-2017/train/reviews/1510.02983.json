Feature engineering is folded into the learning through convolution graph kernel learning to explore different extents of the graph. A high-dimensional space of features includes individual nodes as well as complex subgraphs. In experiments on a text-forecasting problem that predicts stock price change from news for company mentions, OmniGraph beats several benchmarks based on bag-of-words, syntactic dependencies, and semantic trees. The highly expressive features OmniGraph discovers provide insights into the semantics across distinct market sectors. To demonstrate the method's generality, we also report its high performance results on a fine-grained sentiment corpus.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 10 Oct 2015 21:22:00 GMT  (1070kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.02983v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["boyi xie", "rebecca j passonneau"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.02983"}
