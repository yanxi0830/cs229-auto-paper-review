We consider a setting where only aggregate node-level traffic is observed and tackle the task of learning edge transition probabilities. We cast it as a preference learning problem, and we study a model where choices follow Luce's axiom. In this case, the $O(n)$ marginal counts of node visits are a sufficient statistic for the $O(n^2)$ transition probabilities. We show how to make the inference problem well-posed regardless of the network's structure, and we present ChoiceRank, an iterative algorithm that scales to networks that contains billions of nodes and edges. We apply the model to a month-long clickstream of the English Wikipedia and one year of rides on New York City's bicycle-sharing system. In both cases, we successfully recover the transition probabilities using only the network structure and marginal (node-level) traffic data.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Oct 2016 18:19:07 GMT  (118kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06525v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 15 Jun 2017 15:14:54 GMT  (104kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06525v2", "Accepted at ICML 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG cs.SI", "authors": ["lucas maystre", "matthias grossglauser"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.06525"}
