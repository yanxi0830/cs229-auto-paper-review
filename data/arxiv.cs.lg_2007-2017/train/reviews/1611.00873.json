Many models such as SVM, random forest, and deep neural nets have been proposed and achieved great success. However, what emerges as missing in many applications is actionability, i.e., the ability to turn prediction results into actions. For example, in applications such as customer relationship management, clinical prediction, and advertisement, the users need not only accurate prediction, but also actionable instructions which can transfer an input to a desirable goal (e.g., higher profit repays, lower morbidity rates, higher ads hit rates). Existing effort in deriving such actionable knowledge is few and limited to simple action models which restricted to only change one attribute for each action. The dilemma is that in many real applications those action models are often more complex and harder to extract an optimal solution.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Nov 2016 03:53:41 GMT  (287kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.00873v1", "16 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["qiang lyu", "yixin chen", "zhaorong li", "zhicheng cui", "ling chen", "xing zhang", "haihua shen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.00873"}
