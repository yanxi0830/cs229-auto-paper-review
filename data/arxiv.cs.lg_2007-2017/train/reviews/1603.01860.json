Existing generalization error bounds necessarily degrade as the size of the document list associated with a query increases. We show that such a degradation is not intrinsic to the problem. For several loss functions, including the cross-entropy loss used in the well known ListNet method, there is \\emph{no} degradation in generalization ability as document lists become longer. We also provide novel generalization error bounds under $\\ell_1$ regularization and faster convergence rates if the loss function is smooth.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 6 Mar 2016 19:01:53 GMT  (34kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01860v1", "Appeared in ICML 2015. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1405.0586"]], "COMMENTS": "Appeared in ICML 2015. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1405.0586", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ambuj tewari", "sougata chaudhuri"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.01860"}
