The most common approach to defining risk is through various variance related criteria such as the Sharpe Ratio or the standard deviation adjusted reward. It is known that optimizing many of the variance related risk criteria is NP-hard. In this paper we devise a framework for local policy gradient style algorithms for reinforcement learning for variance related criteria. Our starting point is a new formula for the variance of the cost-to-go in episodic tasks. Using this formula we develop policy gradient algorithms for criteria that involve both the expected cost and the variance of the cost. We prove the convergence of these algorithms to local minima and demonstrate their applicability in a portfolio planning problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (482kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6404v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CY math.OC stat.ML", "authors": ["dotan di castro", "aviv tamar", "shie mannor"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6404"}
