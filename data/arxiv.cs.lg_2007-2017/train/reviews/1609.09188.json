This problem may be even worse for postgraduate students who are new to a field and may not know where to start. To address this problem, we have developed an online catalog of research papers where the papers have been automatically categorized by a topic model. The catalog contains 7719 papers from the proceedings of two artificial intelligence conferences from 2000 to 2015. Rather than the commonly used Latent Dirichlet Allocation, we use a recently proposed method called hierarchical latent tree analysis for topic modeling. The resulting topic model contains a hierarchy of topics so that users can browse the topics from the top level to the bottom level. The topic model contains a manageable number of general topics at the top level and allows thousands of fine-grained topics at the bottom level. It also can detect topics that have emerged recently.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Sep 2016 03:22:01 GMT  (2044kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09188v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["leonard k m poon", "nevin l zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.09188"}
