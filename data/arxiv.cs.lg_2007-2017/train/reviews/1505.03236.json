Several approaches are widely applied to data clustering so that objects within the clusters are similar and objects in different clusters are far away from each other. K-Means, is one of the familiar center based clustering algorithms since implementation is very easy and fast convergence. However, K-Means algorithm suffers from initialization, hence trapped in local optima. Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) is the global optimization technique, which avoids trapping in local optimum solution. In this paper, a novel hybrid data clustering approach using Flower Pollination Algorithm and K-Means (FPAKM) is proposed. The proposed algorithm results are compared with K-Means and FPA on eight datasets. From the experimental results, FPAKM is better than FPA and K-Means.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 13 May 2015 04:24:50 GMT  (428kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.03236v1", "11 pages, Journal.
