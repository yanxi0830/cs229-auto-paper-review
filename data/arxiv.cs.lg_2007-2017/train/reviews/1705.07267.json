The proposed approach consists of two stages. In the first stage--retrieval stage--, an off-the-shelf, black-box search engine is used to retrieve a small subset of sentence pairs from a training set given a source sentence. These pairs are further filtered based on a fuzzy matching score based on edit distance. In the second stage--translation stage--, a novel translation model, called translation memory enhanced NMT (TM-NMT), seamlessly uses both the source sentence and a set of retrieved sentence pairs to perform the translation. Empirical evaluation on three language pairs (En-Fr, En-De, and En-Es) shows that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline approach and the improvement is more significant when more relevant sentence pairs were retrieved.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 May 2017 06:53:09 GMT  (2338kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07267v1", "8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["jiatao gu", "yong wang", "kyunghyun cho", "victor o k li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.07267"}
