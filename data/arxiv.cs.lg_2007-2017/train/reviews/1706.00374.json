Attract-Repel facilitates the use of constraints from mono- and cross-lingual resources, yielding semantically specialised cross-lingual vector spaces. Our evaluation shows that the method can make use of existing cross-lingual lexicons to construct high-quality vector spaces for a plethora of different languages, facilitating semantic transfer from high- to lower-resource ones. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated with state-of-the-art results on semantic similarity datasets in six languages. We next show that Attract-Repel-specialised vectors boost performance in the downstream task of dialogue state tracking (DST) across multiple languages. Finally, we show that cross-lingual vector spaces produced by our algorithm facilitate the training of multilingual DST models, which brings further performance improvements.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Jun 2017 16:29:47 GMT  (71kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00374v1", "Accepted for publication at TACL (to be presented at EMNLP 2017)"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted for publication at TACL (to be presented at EMNLP 2017)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["nikola mrk\\v{s}i\\'c", "ivan vuli\\'c", "diarmuid \\'o s\\'eaghdha", "ira leviant", "roi reichart", "milica ga\\v{s}i\\'c", "anna korhonen", "steve young"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.00374"}
