Here we develop and test 8-bit approximation algorithms, which provide improved utilization of the available bandwidth by compressing 32-bit gradients and nonlinear activations to 8-bit approximations. We show that these approximations do not decrease predictive performance on MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet for both model and data parallelism and provide a data transfer speedup of 2x relative to 32-bit parallelism. We compare our data types with other methods and show that 8-bit approximations achieve state-of-the-art speedups for model parallelism in general and data parallelism with up to 200k parameters per layer. Thus 8-bit approximation is the single best method for parameter compression in the parallelization of convolutional networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 14 Nov 2015 14:04:51 GMT  (218kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04561v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 22 Nov 2015 10:25:58 GMT  (224kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04561v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 4 Jan 2016 20:32:52 GMT  (190kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04561v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 19 Feb 2016 16:26:30 GMT  (191kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04561v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["tim dettmers"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.04561"}
