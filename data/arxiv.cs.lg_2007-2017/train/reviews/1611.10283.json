In both settings, we propose algorithms that are inspired by Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), incorporate cost distortions, and exhibit sublinear regret assuming \\holder continuous weight distortion functions. For the $K$-armed setting, we show that the algorithm, called W-UCB, achieves problem-dependent regret $O(L^2 M^2 \\log n/ \\Delta^{\\frac{2}{\\alpha}-1})$, where $n$ is the number of plays, $\\Delta$ is the gap in distorted expected value between the best and next best arm, $L$ and $\\alpha$ are the H\\\"{o}lder constants for the distortion function, and $M$ is an upper bound on costs, and a problem-independent regret bound of $O((KL^2M^2)^{\\alpha/2}n^{(2-\\alpha)/2})$. We also present a matching lower bound on the regret, showing that the regret of W-UCB is essentially unimprovable over the class of H\\\"{o}lder-continuous weight distortions. For the linearly parameterized setting, we develop a new algorithm, a variant of the Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty Linear bandit (OFUL) algorithm called WOFUL (Weight-distorted OFUL), and show that it has regret $O(d\\sqrt{n} \\; \\mbox{polylog}(n))$ with high probability, for sub-Gaussian cost distributions. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the advantages resulting from using distortion-aware learning algorithms.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 17:37:51 GMT  (101kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.10283v1", "Longer version of the paper to be published as part of the proceedings of AAAI 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Longer version of the paper to be published as part of the proceedings of AAAI 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["aditya gopalan", "prashanth l a", "michael c fu", "steven i marcus"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.10283"}
