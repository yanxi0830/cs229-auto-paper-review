The Random Neural Network is a integrate and fire computational model of a neural network whose mathematical structure permits the efficient analysis of large ensembles of neurons. An activation function is derived from the RNN and used in an Extreme Learning Machine. We compare the performance of this combination against the ELM with various activation functions, we reduce the input dimensionality via PCA and compare its performance vs. autoencoder based versions of the RNN-ELM.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 25 Sep 2016 10:18:19 GMT  (44kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07724v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["athanasios vlontzos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.07724"}
