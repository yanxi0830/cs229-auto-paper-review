However, it comes with a slow running time due to the matrix exponential and eigendecomposition computations. For this reason, many researchers studied the followed-the-perturbed-leader (FTPL) framework which is faster, but a factor $\\sqrt{d}$ worse than the optimal regret of MMWU for dimension-$d$ matrices.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 6 Jan 2017 18:43:53 GMT  (582kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01722v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 18:18:21 GMT  (1118kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01722v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 18 Sep 2017 01:04:08 GMT  (1119kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01722v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS math.OC stat.ML", "authors": ["zeyuan allen-zhu", "yuanzhi li"], "accepted": true, "id": "1701.01722"}
