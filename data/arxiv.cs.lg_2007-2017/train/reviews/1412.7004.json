Our learning algorithm takes an existing lexical vector space and compresses it such that the resulting word embeddings are good predictors for a target bilexical relation. In experiments we show that task-specific embeddings can benefit both the quality and efficiency in lexical prediction tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 14:49:19 GMT  (900kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7004v1", "Under review as a workshop contribution at ICLR 2015"], ["v2", "Fri, 10 Apr 2015 17:33:57 GMT  (901kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7004v2", "Accepted as a workshop contribution at ICLR 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review as a workshop contribution at ICLR 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["pranava swaroop madhyastha", "xavier carreras", "ariadna quattoni"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.7004"}
