Unlike the previous confidence-weighted learning algorithms, the proposed soft confidence-weighted learning method enjoys all the four salient properties: (i) large margin training, (ii) confidence weighting, (iii) capability to handle non-separable data, and (iv) adaptive margin. Our experimental results show that the proposed SCW algorithms significantly outperform the original CW algorithm. When comparing with a variety of state-of-the-art algorithms (including AROW, NAROW and NHERD), we found that SCW generally achieves better or at least comparable predictive accuracy, but enjoys significant advantage of computational efficiency (i.e., smaller number of updates and lower time cost).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:00:20 GMT  (255kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4612v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["steven c h hoi", "jialei wang", "peilin zhao"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4612"}
