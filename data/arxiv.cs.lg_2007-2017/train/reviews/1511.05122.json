{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Nov-2015", "title": "Adversarial Manipulation of Deep Representations", "abstract": "We show that the internal representations of an image in a deep neural network (DNN) can be manipulated to mimic those of other natural images with only minor, imperceptible perturbations to the original image. Previous methods for generating adversarial images focused on image manipulation designed to produce erroneous class labels, while here we look at internal layers of the representation. Despite the similarities in the generation process, our class of adversarial images differs qualitatively from previous ones. Specifically, while the input image is perceptually similar to an image of one class, its internal representation appear remarkably like that of natural images in a different class. This phenomenon raises questions about DNN representations, as well as the properties of natural images themselves.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Nov 2015 20:48:20 GMT  (4769kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05122v1", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v2", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 21:00:44 GMT  (5272kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05122v2", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v3", "Mon, 23 Nov 2015 20:56:44 GMT  (5273kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05122v3", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v4", "Fri, 11 Dec 2015 21:03:14 GMT  (8849kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05122v4", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v5", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 20:59:55 GMT  (9280kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05122v5", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v6", "Tue, 12 Jan 2016 20:51:51 GMT  (9213kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05122v6", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v7", "Wed, 13 Jan 2016 20:57:33 GMT  (9463kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05122v7", "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v8", "Tue, 1 Mar 2016 20:51:06 GMT  (9461kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05122v8", "Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v9", "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 20:21:24 GMT  (9461kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05122v9", "Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["sara sabour", "yanshuai cao", "fartash faghri", "david j fleet"], "accepted": true, "id": "1511.05122"}
