The first step is simply to define the problem: to this end, we introduce several natural classes of private linear programs that capture different ways sensitive data can be incorporated into a linear program. For each class of linear programs we give an efficient, differentially private solver based on the multiplicative weights framework, or we give an impossibility result.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 15 Feb 2014 00:55:46 GMT  (41kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3631v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 8 May 2014 19:52:34 GMT  (41kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3631v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.CR cs.LG", "authors": ["justin hsu", "aaron roth", "tim roughgarden", "jonathan ullman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.3631"}
