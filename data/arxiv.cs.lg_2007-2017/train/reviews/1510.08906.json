{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "29-Oct-2015", "title": "Sample Complexity of Episodic Fixed-Horizon Reinforcement Learning", "abstract": "Recently, there has been significant progress in understanding reinforcement learning in discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) by deriving tight sample complexity bounds. However, in many real-world applications, an interactive learning agent operates for a fixed or bounded period of time, for example tutoring students for exams or handling customer service requests. Such scenarios can often be better treated as episodic fixed-horizon MDPs, for which only looser bounds on the sample complexity exist. A natural notion of sample complexity in this setting is the number of episodes required to guarantee a certain performance with high probability (PAC guarantee). In this paper, we derive an upper PAC bound $\\tilde O(\\frac{|\\mathcal S|^2 |\\mathcal A| H^2}{\\epsilon^2} \\ln\\frac 1 \\delta)$ and a lower PAC bound $\\tilde \\Omega(\\frac{|\\mathcal S| |\\mathcal A| H^2}{\\epsilon^2} \\ln \\frac 1 {\\delta + c})$ that match up to log-terms and an additional linear dependency on the number of states $|\\mathcal S|$. The lower bound is the first of its kind for this setting. Our upper bound leverages Bernstein's inequality to improve on previous bounds for episodic finite-horizon MDPs which have a time-horizon dependency of at least $H^3$.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 29 Oct 2015 21:14:42 GMT  (64kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08906v1", "26 pages, appears in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2015"], ["v2", "Tue, 19 Jan 2016 16:36:03 GMT  (65kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08906v2", "28 pages, appeared in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2015, updated version with fixed typos and modified Lemma 1"], ["v3", "Wed, 11 May 2016 15:27:28 GMT  (65kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.08906v3", "28 pages, appeared in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2015, updated version with fixed typos and modified Lemma 1 and Lemma C.5"]], "COMMENTS": "26 pages, appears in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["christoph dann", "emma brunskill"], "accepted": true, "id": "1510.08906"}
