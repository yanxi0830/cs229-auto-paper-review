In Deep Learning the ubiquitous architecture used for this task is the Siamese Neural Network which maps each entity to a representation through a learnable function and expresses similarity through the distances among the entities in the representation space. In this paper, we argue that such a static and invariant mapping is both naive and unnatural. We develop a novel neural model called Attentive Recurrent Comparators (ARCs) that dynamically compares two entities and test the model extensively on the Omniglot dataset. In the task of similarity learning, our simplistic model that does not use any convolutions performs on par with Deep Convolutional Siamese Networks and significantly better when convolutional layers are also used. In the challenging task of one-shot learning on the same dataset, an ARC based model achieves the first super-human performance for a neural method with an error rate of 1.5\\%.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Mar 2017 12:47:40 GMT  (288kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00767v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 5 Mar 2017 12:23:16 GMT  (288kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00767v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 30 Jun 2017 07:37:56 GMT  (392kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.00767v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["pranav shyam", "shubham gupta", "ambedkar dukkipati"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.00767"}
