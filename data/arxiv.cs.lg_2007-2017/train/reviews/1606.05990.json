The method consists of constructing a new functional that is less nonlinear in comparison with the classical functional by removing the nonlinearity of the activation functions from the output layer. We validate this new method by a series of experiments that show an improved learning speed and also a better classification error.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 07:05:14 GMT  (454kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05990v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["petre birtea", "cosmin cernazanu-glavan", "alexandru sisu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.05990"}
