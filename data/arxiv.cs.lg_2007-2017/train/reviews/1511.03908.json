At Google, we have created a first-of-its-kind dataset of human movements, passively collected by 1500 volunteers using their smartphones daily over several months. We (1) compare several neural architectures for efficient learning of temporal multi-modal data representations, (2) propose an optimized shift-invariant dense convolutional mechanism (DCWRNN) and (3) incorporate the discriminatively-trained dynamic features in a probabilistic generative framework taking into account temporal characteristics. Our results demonstrate, that human kinematics convey important information about user identity and can serve as a valuable component of multi-modal authentication systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Nov 2015 14:48:53 GMT  (1598kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03908v1", "10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables"], ["v2", "Tue, 8 Dec 2015 15:23:06 GMT  (1427kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03908v2", "10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables"], ["v3", "Wed, 9 Dec 2015 01:59:58 GMT  (2044kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03908v3", "10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables"], ["v4", "Thu, 21 Apr 2016 16:04:00 GMT  (3357kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03908v4", "10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["natalia neverova", "christian wolf", "griffin lacey", "lex fridman", "deepak chandra", "brandon barbello", "graham taylor"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.03908"}
