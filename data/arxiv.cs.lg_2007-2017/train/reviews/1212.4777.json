Most approaches to topic model inference have been based on a maximum likelihood objective. Efficient algorithms exist that approximate this objective, but they have no provable guarantees. Recently, algorithms have been introduced that provide provable bounds, but these algorithms are not practical because they are inefficient and not robust to violations of model assumptions. In this paper we present an algorithm for topic model inference that is both provable and practical. The algorithm produces results comparable to the best MCMC implementations while running orders of magnitude faster.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 19 Dec 2012 18:14:51 GMT  (187kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.4777v1", "26 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "26 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS stat.ML", "authors": ["sanjeev arora", "rong ge 0001", "yonatan halpern", "david m mimno", "ankur moitra", "david sontag", "yichen wu", "michael zhu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1212.4777"}
