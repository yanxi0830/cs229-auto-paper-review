Now, benefiting from the big data in cellular networks, it becomes possible to make the analyses one step further into the application level. In this paper, we firstly collect a significant amount of application-level traffic data from cellular network operators. Afterwards, with the aid of the traffic \"big data\", we make a comprehensive study over the modeling and prediction framework of cellular network traffic. Our results solidly demonstrate that there universally exist some traffic statistical modeling characteristics, including ALPHA-stable modeled property in the temporal domain and the sparsity in the spatial domain. Meanwhile, the results also demonstrate the distinctions originated from the uniqueness of different service types of applications. Furthermore, we propose a new traffic prediction framework to encompass and explore these aforementioned characteristics and then develop a dictionary learning-based alternating direction method to solve it. Besides, we validate the prediction accuracy improvement and the robustness of the proposed framework through extensive simulation results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 14:13:57 GMT  (170kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04778v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 28 Mar 2017 03:52:23 GMT  (8109kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04778v2", "Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications on March 26, 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NI cs.LG", "authors": ["rongpeng li", "zhifeng zhao", "jianchao zheng", "chengli mei", "yueming cai", "honggang zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.04778"}
