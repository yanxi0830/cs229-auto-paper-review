In this paper we propose a simple yet powerful modification. The main emphasis is on an algorithm improving the SMO step size by planning-ahead. The theoretical analysis ensures its convergence to the optimum. Experiments involving a large number of datasets were carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the new algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 31 Jul 2013 12:38:20 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.8305v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["tobias glasmachers"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.8305"}
