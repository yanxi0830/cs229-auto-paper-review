We focus on problems without strong convexity, for which all previously known algorithms achieve a convergence rate for function values of O(1/n^{1/2}). We consider and analyze two algorithms that achieve a rate of O(1/n) for classical supervised learning problems. For least-squares regression, we show that averaged stochastic gradient descent with constant step-size achieves the desired rate. For logistic regression, this is achieved by a simple novel stochastic gradient algorithm that (a) constructs successive local quadratic approximations of the loss functions, while (b) preserving the same running time complexity as stochastic gradient descent. For these algorithms, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the generalization error (in expectation, and also in high probability for least-squares), and run extensive experiments on standard machine learning benchmarks showing that they often outperform existing approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Jun 2013 07:31:10 GMT  (130kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.2119v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.OC stat.ML", "authors": ["francis r bach", "eric moulines"], "accepted": true, "id": "1306.2119"}
