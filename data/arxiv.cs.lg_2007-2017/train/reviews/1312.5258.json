Physical computation offers the opportunity to reduce the cost of sampling by building physical systems whose natural dynamics correspond to drawing samples from the desired RBM distribution. Such a system avoids the burn-in and mixing cost of a Markov chain. However, hardware implementations of this variety usually entail limitations such as low-precision and limited range of the parameters and restrictions on the size and topology of the RBM. We conduct software simulations to determine how harmful each of these restrictions is. Our simulations are designed to reproduce aspects of the D-Wave quantum computer, but the issues we investigate arise in most forms of physical computation.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Dec 2013 18:30:51 GMT  (720kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5258v1", "Conference, prepared for ICLR 2014"], ["v2", "Fri, 24 Oct 2014 19:16:14 GMT  (630kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5258v2", null]], "COMMENTS": "Conference, prepared for ICLR 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["vincent dumoulin", "ian j goodfellow", "aaron c courville", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": true, "id": "1312.5258"}
