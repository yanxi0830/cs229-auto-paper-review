We describe a new technique for &lt;EM&gt;multivariate&lt;/EM&gt; discretization, whereby each continuous variable is discretized while taking into account its interaction with the other variables. The technique is based on the use of a Bayesian scoring metric that scores the discretization policy for a continuous variable given a BN structure and the observed data. Since the metric is relative to the BN structure currently being evaluated, the discretization of a variable needs to be dynamically adjusted as the BN structure changes.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Jan 2013 15:06:05 GMT  (381kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7403v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the Fourteenth Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI1998)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["stefano monti", "gregory f cooper"], "accepted": false, "id": "1301.7403"}
