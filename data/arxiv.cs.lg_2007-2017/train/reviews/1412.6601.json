We propose a novel architecture for solving CTR prediction problem by combining artificial neural networks (ANN) with decision trees. First we compare ANN with respect to other popular machine learning models being used for this task. Then we go on to combine ANN with MatrixNet (proprietary implementation of boosted trees) and evaluate the performance of the system as a whole. The results show that our approach provides significant improvement over existing models.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 Dec 2014 04:44:00 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6601v1", "6 pages, 3 figures, for submission to workshop proceedings of ICLR 2015"], ["v2", "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 08:15:40 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6601v2", "7 pages, 3 figures, for submission to workshop proceedings of ICLR 2015 Added more info about training the model in section 3.3 Updated Tables 2 and 3 Added some brief clarifications in section 3.1 and 4.2"], ["v3", "Sat, 19 Sep 2015 23:30:51 GMT  (75kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6601v3", "updated typos, and removed conference header"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages, 3 figures, for submission to workshop proceedings of ICLR 2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["afroze ibrahim baqapuri", "ilya trofimov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.6601"}
