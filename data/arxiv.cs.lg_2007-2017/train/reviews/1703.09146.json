This is due to the high level of contention among thousands of parallel threads. This problem was mostly addressed using heuristics. We propose a representation learning approach to address this problem. We model any performance metric as a temporal function of the executed instructions with the intuition that the flow of instructions can be identified as distinct activities of the code. Our experiments show high accuracy and non-trivial predictive power of representation learning on a benchmark.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Mar 2017 15:31:02 GMT  (675kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.09146v1", "Proceedings of the 33 rd International Conference on Machine Learning, New York, NY, USA, 2016.
