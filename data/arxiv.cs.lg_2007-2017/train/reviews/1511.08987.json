The theory behind the SVM and the naive Bayes classifier is explored. The algorithms are trained using data from the month of January 2010, extracted from the MarketWatch.com website. Input features are selected based on previous studies of the SET100 Index. The Weka 3 software is used to create models from the labeled training data. Mean squared error and proportion of correctly classified instances, and a number of other error measurements are the used to compare the two algorithms. This essay shows that these two algorithms are currently not advanced enough to accurately model the stock exchange. Nevertheless, the naive Bayes is better than the support vector machine at predicting the Stock Exchange of Thailand.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 29 Nov 2015 09:57:42 GMT  (699kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08987v1", "16 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "16 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["napas udomsak"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.08987"}
