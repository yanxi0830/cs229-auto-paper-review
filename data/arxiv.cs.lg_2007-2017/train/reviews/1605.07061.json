{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "23-May-2016", "title": "On Restricted Nonnegative Matrix Factorization", "abstract": "Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is the problem of decomposing a given nonnegative $n \\times m$ matrix $M$ into a product of a nonnegative $n \\times d$ matrix $W$ and a nonnegative $d \\times m$ matrix $H$. Restricted NMF requires in addition that the column spaces of $M$ and $W$ coincide. Finding the minimal inner dimension $d$ is known to be NP-hard, both for NMF and restricted NMF. We show that restricted NMF is closely related to a question about the nature of minimal probabilistic automata, posed by Paz in his seminal 1971 textbook. We use this connection to answer Paz's question negatively, thus falsifying a positive answer claimed in 1974. Furthermore, we investigate whether a rational matrix $M$ always has a restricted NMF of minimal inner dimension whose factors $W$ and $H$ are also rational. We show that this holds for matrices $M$ of rank at most $3$ and we exhibit a rank-$4$ matrix for which $W$ and $H$ require irrational entries.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 May 2016 15:26:26 GMT  (97kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07061v1", "Full version of an ICALP'16 paper"]], "COMMENTS": "Full version of an ICALP'16 paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.FL cs.CC cs.LG", "authors": ["dmitry chistikov", "stefan kiefer", "ines maru\\v{s}i\\'c", "mahsa shirmohammadi", "james worrell"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.07061"}
