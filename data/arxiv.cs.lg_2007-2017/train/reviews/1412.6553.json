Given a layer, we use non-linear least squares to compute a low-rank CP-decomposition of the 4D convolution kernel tensor into a sum of a small number of rank-one tensors. At the second step, this decomposition is used to replace the original convolutional layer with a sequence of four convolutional layers with small kernels. After such replacement, the entire network is fine-tuned on the training data using standard backpropagation process.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Dec 2014 23:02:43 GMT  (720kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6553v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 24 Dec 2014 21:57:37 GMT  (722kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6553v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 24 Apr 2015 11:40:54 GMT  (763kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6553v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["vadim lebedev", "yaroslav ganin", "maksim rakhuba", "ivan oseledets", "victor lempitsky"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.6553"}
