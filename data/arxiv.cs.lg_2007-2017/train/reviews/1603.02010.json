We establish two approaches for achieving differential privacy, provide a theoretical analysis of the privacy and utility of the two algorithms, and show promising results on simple empirical examples.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Mar 2016 11:23:57 GMT  (174kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02010v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["borja balle", "maziar gomrokchi", "doina precup"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.02010"}
