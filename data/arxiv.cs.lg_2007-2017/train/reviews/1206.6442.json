In particular, we show that amongst all convex surrogate losses, the hinge loss gives essentially the best possible bound, of all convex loss functions, for the misclassification error rate of the resulting linear predictor in terms of the best possible margin error rate. We also provide lower bounds for specific convex surrogates that show how different commonly used losses qualitatively differ from each other.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (633kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6442v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["shai ben-david", "david loker", "nathan srebro", "karthik sridharan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6442"}
