{"conference": "acl", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "14-Jun-2016", "title": "Deep Recurrent Models with Fast-Forward Connections for Neural Machine Translation", "abstract": "Neural machine translation (NMT) aims at solving machine translation (MT) problems with purely neural networks and exhibits promising results in recent years. However, most of the existing NMT models are of shallow topology and there is still a performance gap between the single NMT model and the best conventional MT system. In this work, we introduce a new type of linear connections, named fast-forward connections, based on deep Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, together with the interleaved bi-directional way for stacking them. Fast-forward connections play an essential role to propagate the gradients in building the deep topology of depth 16. On WMT'14 English- to-French task, we achieved BLEU=37.7 with single attention model, which outperforms the corresponding single shallow model by 6.2 BLEU points. It is the first time that a single NMT model achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms the best conventional model by 0.7 BLEU points. Even without considering attention mechanism, we can still achieve BLEU=36.3. After the special handling for unknown words and the model ensemble, we obtained the best score on this task with BLEU=40.4. Our models are also verified on the more difficult WMT'14 English-to-German task.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 14 Jun 2016 03:53:00 GMT  (153kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04199v1", "To be published on TACL 2016"], ["v2", "Wed, 15 Jun 2016 04:21:03 GMT  (153kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04199v2", "To be published on TACL 2016"], ["v3", "Sat, 23 Jul 2016 13:14:17 GMT  (153kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.04199v3", "TACL 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "To be published on TACL 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["jie zhou", "ying cao", "xuguang wang", "peng li", "wei xu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1606.04199"}
