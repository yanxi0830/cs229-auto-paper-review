In this paper, we develop a new computationally efficient and provably consistent estimator for a mixture of linear regressions, a simple instance of a discriminative latent-variable model. Our approach relies on a low-rank linear regression to recover a symmetric tensor, which can be factorized into the parameters using a tensor power method. We prove rates of convergence for our estimator and provide an empirical evaluation illustrating its strengths relative to local optimization (EM).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 17 Jun 2013 03:02:05 GMT  (2364kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.3729v1", "Accepted at ICML 2013.
