Although a greatly distorted metric space has a high degree of freedom to fit training data, it is prone to overfitting and numerical inaccuracy. This paper presents {\\it bounded-distortion metric learning} (BDML), a new metric learning framework which amounts to finding an optimal Mahalanobis metric space with a bounded-distortion constraint. An efficient solver based on the multiplicative weights update method is proposed. Moreover, we generalize BDML to pseudo-metric learning and devise the semidefinite relaxation and a randomized algorithm to approximately solve it. We further provide theoretical analysis to show that distortion is a key ingredient for stability and generalization ability of our BDML algorithm. Extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets yield promising results.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 10 May 2015 13:27:36 GMT  (316kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02377v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["renjie liao", "jianping shi", "ziyang ma", "jun zhu", "jiaya jia"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.02377"}
