Previous studies on teaching dimension focused on version-space learners which maintain all hypotheses consistent with the training data, and cannot be applied to modern machine learners which select a specific hypothesis via optimization. This paper presents the first known teaching dimension for ridge regression, support vector machines, and logistic regression. We also exhibit optimal training sets that match these teaching dimensions. Our approach generalizes to other linear learners.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Dec 2015 19:24:55 GMT  (21kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02181v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ji liu", "xiaojin zhu 0001", "hrag ohannessian"], "accepted": true, "id": "1512.02181"}
