{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "4-Mar-2016", "title": "Normalization Propagation: A Parametric Technique for Removing Internal Covariate Shift in Deep Networks", "abstract": "While the authors of Batch Normalization (BN) identify and address an important problem involved in training deep networks-- \\textit{Internal Covariate Shift}-- the current solution has multiple drawbacks. For instance, BN depends on batch statistics for layerwise input normalization during training which makes the estimates of mean and standard deviation of input (distribution) to hidden layers inaccurate due to shifting parameter values (specially during initial training epochs). Another fundamental problem with BN is that it cannot be used with batch-size $ 1 $ during training. We address these (and other) drawbacks of BN by proposing a non-adaptive normalization technique for removing covariate shift, that we call \\textit{Normalization Propagation}. Our approach does not depend on batch statistics, but rather uses a data-independent parametric estimate of mean and standard-deviation in every layer; thus being computationally cheaper. We exploit the observation that the pre-activation before Rectified Linear Units follow a Gaussian distribution in deep networks, and that once the first and second order statistics of any given dataset are normalized, we can forward propagate this normalization without the need for recalculating the approximate statistics (using data) for any of the hidden layers.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Mar 2016 12:01:58 GMT  (299kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01431v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 9 Mar 2016 16:41:25 GMT  (302kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01431v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 23 May 2016 23:01:55 GMT  (1073kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01431v3", "11 pages in ICML 2016"], ["v4", "Mon, 30 May 2016 02:08:06 GMT  (1068kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01431v4", "11 pages, ICML 2016"], ["v5", "Sun, 3 Jul 2016 20:17:44 GMT  (906kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01431v5", "11 pages, ICML 2016"], ["v6", "Tue, 12 Jul 2016 13:57:19 GMT  (923kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.01431v6", "11 pages, ICML 2016, appendix added to the last version"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["devansh arpit", "yingbo zhou", "bhargava urala kota", "venu govindaraju"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.01431"}
