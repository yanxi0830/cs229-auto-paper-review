The only underlying LSTM structure that has been explored so far is a linear chain. However, natural language exhibits syntactic properties that would naturally combine words to phrases. We introduce the Tree-LSTM, a generalization of LSTMs to tree-structured network topologies. Tree-LSTMs outperform all existing systems and strong LSTM baselines on two tasks: predicting the semantic relatedness of two sentences (SemEval 2014, Task 1) and sentiment classification (Stanford Sentiment Treebank).", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 06:31:50 GMT  (251kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00075v1", "10 pages, 4 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 5 Mar 2015 20:13:25 GMT  (252kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00075v2", "10 pages, 4 figures"], ["v3", "Sat, 30 May 2015 06:51:20 GMT  (254kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.00075v3", "Accepted for publication at ACL 2015"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["kai sheng tai", "richard socher", "christopher d manning"], "accepted": true, "id": "1503.00075"}
