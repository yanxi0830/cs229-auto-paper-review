Such tasks include simple reporting on streams to sophisticated model building. However, the practicality of such analyses are impeded in several domains because they are faced with a fundamental trade-off between data collection latency and analysis accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 May 2016 05:31:01 GMT  (1047kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04652v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 17 May 2016 20:00:59 GMT  (333kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04652v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.LG cs.NI", "authors": ["anand padmanabha iyer", "ion stoica", "mosharaf chowdhury", "li erran li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.04652"}
