{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "4-Jul-2016", "title": "Bootstrap Model Aggregation for Distributed Statistical Learning", "abstract": "In distributed, or privacy-preserving learning, we are often given a set of probabilistic models estimated from different local repositories, and asked to combine them into a single model that gives efficient statistical estimation. A simple method is to linearly average the parameters of the local models, which, however, tends to be degenerate or not applicable on non-convex models, or models with different parameter dimensions. One more practical strategy is to generate bootstrap samples from the local models, and then learn a joint model based on the combined bootstrap set. Unfortunately, the bootstrap procedure introduces additional noise and can significantly deteriorate the performance. In this work, we propose two variance reduction methods to correct the bootstrap noise, including a weighted M-estimator that is both statistically efficient and practically powerful. Both theoretical and empirical analysis is provided to demonstrate our methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 Jul 2016 20:12:41 GMT  (596kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01036v1", "This paper is about variance reduction on Monte Carol estimation of KL divergence"], ["v2", "Wed, 1 Feb 2017 20:06:40 GMT  (596kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01036v2", "This paper is about variance reduction on Monte Carol estimation of KL divergence"], ["v3", "Sun, 5 Feb 2017 03:07:51 GMT  (377kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01036v3", "This paper is about variance reduction on Monte Carol estimation of KL divergence, NIPS, 2016"], ["v4", "Mon, 27 Feb 2017 21:01:20 GMT  (376kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01036v4", "This paper is about variance reduction on Monte Carol estimation of KL divergence, NIPS, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "This paper is about variance reduction on Monte Carol estimation of KL divergence", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["jun han", "qiang liu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1607.01036"}
