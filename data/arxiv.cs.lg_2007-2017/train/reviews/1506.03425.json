{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "10-Jun-2015", "title": "Fast Online Clustering with Randomized Skeleton Sets", "abstract": "We present a new fast online clustering algorithm that reliably recovers arbitrary-shaped data clusters in high throughout data streams. Unlike the existing state-of-the-art online clustering methods based on k-means or k-medoid, it does not make any restrictive generative assumptions. In addition, in contrast to existing nonparametric clustering techniques such as DBScan or DenStream, it gives provable theoretical guarantees. To achieve fast clustering, we propose to represent each cluster by a skeleton set which is updated continuously as new data is seen. A skeleton set consists of weighted samples from the data where weights encode local densities. The size of each skeleton set is adapted according to the cluster geometry. The proposed technique automatically detects the number of clusters and is robust to outliers. The algorithm works for the infinite data stream where more than one pass over the data is not feasible. We provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of the clustering and also demonstrate its advantage over the existing state-of-the-art on several datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Jun 2015 18:41:55 GMT  (1991kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03425v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["krzysztof choromanski", "sanjiv kumar", "xiaofeng liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.03425"}
