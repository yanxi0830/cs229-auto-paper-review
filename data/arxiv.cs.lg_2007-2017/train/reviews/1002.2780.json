We introduce a weighted version of the trace-norm regularizer that works well also with non-uniform sampling. Our experimental results demonstrate that the weighted trace-norm regularization indeed yields significant gains on the (highly non-uniformly sampled) Netflix dataset.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 14 Feb 2010 16:37:04 GMT  (39kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1002.2780v1", "9 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ruslan salakhutdinov", "nathan srebro"], "accepted": true, "id": "1002.2780"}
