In this paper, we classify post stance on social media channels and develop UTCNN, a neural network model that incorporates user tastes, topic tastes, and user comments on posts. UTCNN not only works on social media texts, but also analyzes texts in forums and message boards. Experiments performed on Chinese Facebook data and English online debate forum data show that UTCNN achieves a 0.755 macro-average f-score for supportive, neutral, and unsupportive stance classes on Facebook data, which is significantly better than models in which either user, topic, or comment information is withheld. This model design greatly mitigates the lack of data for the minor class without the use of oversampling. In addition, UTCNN yields a 0.842 accuracy on English online debate forum data, which also significantly outperforms results from previous work as well as other deep learning models, showing that UTCNN performs well regardless of language or platform.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Nov 2016 07:05:49 GMT  (69kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03599v1", "11 pages, to appear in COLING 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, to appear in COLING 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["wei-fan chen", "lun-wei ku"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.03599"}
