They prepare vehicles for unsafe road conditions and alert drivers if they perform a dangerous maneuver. However, many accidents are unavoidable because by the time drivers are alerted, it is already too late. Anticipating maneuvers beforehand can alert drivers before they perform the maneuver and also give ADAS more time to avoid or prepare for the danger.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 5 Jan 2016 05:25:14 GMT  (3099kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.00740v1", "Journal Version (ICCV and ICRA combination with more system details)this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "Journal Version (ICCV and ICRA combination with more system details)this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["ashesh jain", "hema s koppula", "shane soh", "bharad raghavan", "avi singh", "ashutosh saxena"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.00740"}
