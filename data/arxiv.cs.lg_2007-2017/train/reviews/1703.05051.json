Now, there is increasing interest in using deep ConvNets for end-to-end EEG analysis. However, little is known about many important aspects of how to design and train ConvNets for end-to-end EEG decoding, and there is still a lack of techniques to visualize the informative EEG features the ConvNets learn.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 09:52:58 GMT  (8271kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05051v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 10 Jul 2017 11:06:38 GMT  (8271kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05051v2", "A revised manuscript (with the new title) has been accepted at Human Brain Mapping, we will provide the URL once it is available online"], ["v3", "Mon, 7 Aug 2017 16:16:08 GMT  (8271kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05051v3", "A revised manuscript (with the new title) has been accepted at Human Brain Mapping, seethis http URL"], ["v4", "Tue, 8 Aug 2017 08:48:58 GMT  (8271kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05051v4", "A revised manuscript (with the new title) has been accepted at Human Brain Mapping, seethis http URL"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["robin tibor schirrmeister", "jost tobias springenberg", "lukas dominique josef fiederer", "martin glasstetter", "katharina eggensperger", "michael tangermann", "frank hutter", "wolfram burgard", "tonio ball"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.05051"}
