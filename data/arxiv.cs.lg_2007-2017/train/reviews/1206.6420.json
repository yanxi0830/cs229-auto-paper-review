{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "27-Jun-2012", "title": "Distributed Parameter Estimation via Pseudo-likelihood", "abstract": "Estimating statistical models within sensor networks requires distributed algorithms, in which both data and computation are distributed across the nodes of the network. We propose a general approach for distributed learning based on combining local estimators defined by pseudo-likelihood components, encompassing a number of combination methods, and provide both theoretical and experimental analysis. We show that simple linear combination or max-voting methods, when combined with second-order information, are statistically competitive with more advanced and costly joint optimization. Our algorithms have many attractive properties including low communication and computational cost and \"any-time\" behavior.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (1650kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6420v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DC stat.ML", "authors": ["qiang liu", "alexander t ihler"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6420"}
