In many scenarios of interest data is hard to obtain, so agents may learn a source policy in a setting where data is readily available, with the hope that it generalises well to the target domain. We propose a new multi-stage RL agent, DARLA (DisentAngled Representation Learning Agent), which learns to see before learning to act. DARLA's vision is based on learning a disentangled representation of the observed environment. Once DARLA can see, it is able to acquire source policies that are robust to many domain shifts - even with no access to the target domain. DARLA significantly outperforms conventional baselines in zero-shot domain adaptation scenarios, an effect that holds across a variety of RL environments (Jaco arm, DeepMind Lab) and base RL algorithms (DQN, A3C and EC).", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Jul 2017 14:50:51 GMT  (5748kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1707.08475v1", "ICML 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["irina higgins", "arka pal", "andrei a rusu", "lo\u00efc matthey", "christopher burgess", "alexander pritzel", "matthew botvinick", "charles blundell", "alexander lerchner"], "accepted": true, "id": "1707.08475"}
