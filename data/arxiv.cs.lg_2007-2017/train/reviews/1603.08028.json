We ask the question \"Does there exist a regime where the network cannot be deanonymized perfectly, yet the community structure could be learned?.\" To answer this question, we derive information theoretic converses for the perfect deanonymization problem using the Stochastic Block Model and edge sub-sampling. We also provide an almost tight achievability result for perfect deanonymization.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 25 Mar 2016 20:45:32 GMT  (555kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08028v1", "10 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR cs.SI", "authors": ["daniel cullina", "kushagra singhal", "negar kiyavash", "prateek mittal"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.08028"}
