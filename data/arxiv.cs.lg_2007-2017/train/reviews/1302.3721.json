This bandit problem assumes stationary distributions for the rewards. It is often unrealistic to model the real world as a stationary distribution. In this paper we derive and evaluate algorithms using Thompson Sampling for a Switching Multi-Armed Bandit Problem. We propose a Thompson Sampling strategy equipped with a Bayesian change point mechanism to tackle this problem. We develop algorithms for a variety of cases with constant switching rate: when switching occurs all arms change (Global Switching), switching occurs independently for each arm (Per-Arm Switching), when the switching rate is known and when it must be inferred from data. This leads to a family of algorithms we collectively term Change-Point Thompson Sampling (CTS). We show empirical results of the algorithm in 4 artificial environments, and 2 derived from real world data; news click-through[Yahoo!, 2011] and foreign exchange data[Dukascopy, 2012], comparing them to some other bandit algorithms. In real world data CTS is the most effective.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 15 Feb 2013 10:48:57 GMT  (324kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.3721v1", "A version will appear in the Sixteenth international conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AIStats 2013)"]], "COMMENTS": "A version will appear in the Sixteenth international conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AIStats 2013)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["joseph mellor", "jonathan shapiro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1302.3721"}
