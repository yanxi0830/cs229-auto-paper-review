KRA Algorithm is based on Contingency Table concepts. Metrics are computed for the Original and Refined Clusters. Quality of Original and Refined Clusters are compared in terms of metrics. The proposed algorithm (KRA) is tested in the educational domain and results show that it generates better quality clusters in terms of improved metric values.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Jul 2013 17:07:39 GMT  (220kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1307.6814v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["shveta kundra bhatia", "v s dixit"], "accepted": false, "id": "1307.6814"}
