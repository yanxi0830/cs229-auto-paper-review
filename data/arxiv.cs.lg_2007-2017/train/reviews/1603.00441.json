Additionally, due to the lack of knowledge about street parking spaces, heuristic circling the blocks not only costs drivers' time and fuel, but also increases city congestion. In the wake of recent trend to build convenient, green and energy-efficient smart cities, we rethink common techniques adopted by high-profile smart parking systems, and present a user-engaged (crowdsourcing) and sonar-based prototype to identify urban on-street parking spaces. The prototype includes an ultrasonic sensor, a GPS receiver and associated Arduino micro-controllers. It is mounted on the passenger side of a car to measure the distance from the vehicle to the nearest roadside obstacle. Multiple road tests are conducted around Wheatley, Oxford to gather results and emulate the crowdsourcing approach. By extracting parked vehicles' features from the collected trace, a supervised learning algorithm is developed to estimate roadside parking occupancy and spot illegal parking vehicles. A quantity estimation model is derived to calculate the required number of sensing units to cover urban streets. The estimation is quantitatively compared to a fixed sensing solution. The results show that the crowdsourcing way would need substantially fewer sensors compared to the fixed sensing system.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 1 Mar 2016 20:22:08 GMT  (1959kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00441v1", "8 pages, 4 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 4 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.HC cs.LG", "authors": ["ruizhi liao", "cristian roman", "peter ball", "shumao ou", "liping chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.00441"}
