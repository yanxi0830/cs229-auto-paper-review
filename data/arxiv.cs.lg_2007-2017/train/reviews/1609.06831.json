Our new point process allows better approximation in application domains where events and intensities accelerate each other with correlated levels of contagion. We generalize a recent algorithm for simulating draws from Hawkes processes whose levels of excitation are stochastic processes, and propose a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo approach for model fitting. Our sampling procedure scales linearly with the number of required events and does not require stationarity of the point process. A modular inference procedure consisting of a combination between Gibbs and Metropolis Hastings steps is put forward. We recover expectation maximization as a special case. Our general approach is illustrated for contagion following geometric Brownian motion and exponential Langevin dynamics.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 Sep 2016 06:18:20 GMT  (812kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.06831v1", "Copy of ICML paper"]], "COMMENTS": "Copy of ICML paper", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["young lee", "kar wai lim", "cheng soon ong"], "accepted": true, "id": "1609.06831"}
