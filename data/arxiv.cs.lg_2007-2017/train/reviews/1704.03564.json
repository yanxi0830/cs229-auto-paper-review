For example, in a recommendation system application (say for restaurants), the annotator may be asked whether she liked or disliked a specific restaurant (a label query); or which one of two restaurants did she like more (a comparison query).", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Apr 2017 22:55:29 GMT  (127kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03564v1", "23 pages (not including references), 1 figure"], ["v2", "Fri, 2 Jun 2017 00:49:37 GMT  (127kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03564v2", "23 pages (not including references), 1 figure.
