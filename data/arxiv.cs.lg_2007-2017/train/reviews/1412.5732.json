In this paper, we propose a novel online multiple-output regression method, called MORES, for streaming data. MORES can \\emph{dynamically} learn the structure of the regression coefficients to facilitate the model's continuous refinement. We observe that limited expressive ability of the regression model, especially in the preliminary stage of online update, often leads to the variables in the residual errors being dependent. In light of this point, MORES intends to \\emph{dynamically} learn and leverage the structure of the residual errors to improve the prediction accuracy. Moreover, we define three statistical variables to \\emph{exactly} represent all the seen samples for \\emph{incrementally} calculating prediction loss in each online update round, which can avoid loading all the training data into memory for updating model, and also effectively prevent drastic fluctuation of the model in the presence of noise. Furthermore, we introduce a forgetting factor to set different weights on samples so as to track the data streams' evolving characteristics quickly from the latest samples. Experiments on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Dec 2014 06:37:50 GMT  (437kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5732v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 8 Sep 2015 03:00:55 GMT  (1878kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5732v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["changsheng li", "fan wei", "weishan dong", "qingshan liu", "xiangfeng wang", "xin zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.5732"}
