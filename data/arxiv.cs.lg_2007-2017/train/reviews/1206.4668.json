Our algorithm ensures vector-quantization accuracy similar to that of computationally-expensive PCA trees with similar time-complexity to that of lower-accuracy RP trees.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:33:25 GMT  (880kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4668v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS stat.ML", "authors": ["mark mccartin-lim", "andrew mcgregor 0001", "rui wang 0003"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4668"}
