{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-Jun-2015", "title": "A New PAC-Bayesian Perspective on Domain Adaptation", "abstract": "We study the issue of domain adaptation: we want to adapt a model from a source distribution to a target one. We focus on models expressed as a majority vote. Our main contribution is a novel theoretical analysis of the target risk that is formulated as an upper bound expressing a trade-off between only two terms: (i) the voters' joint errors on the source distribution, and (ii) the voters' disagreement on the target one; both easily estimable from samples. Hence, this new study is more precise than other analyses that usually rely on three terms (including a hardly controllable term). Moreover, we derive a PAC-Bayesian generalization bound, and specialize the result to linear classifiers to propose a learning algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Jun 2015 12:46:45 GMT  (800kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04573v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 21 Sep 2015 10:49:00 GMT  (800kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04573v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 14 Mar 2016 19:44:22 GMT  (381kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04573v3", null], ["v4", "Tue, 26 Jul 2016 10:29:33 GMT  (422kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04573v4", "Published at ICML 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["pascal germain", "amaury habrard", "fran\u00e7ois laviolette", "emilie morvant"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.04573"}
