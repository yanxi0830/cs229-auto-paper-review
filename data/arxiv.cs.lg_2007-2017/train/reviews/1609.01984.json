However, in most of the service robot applications, the user needs to move himself/herself to allow the robot to see him/her face to face. To overcome such limitations, a method for estimating human body orientation is required. Previous studies used various components such as feature extractors and classification models to classify the orientation which resulted in low performance. For a more robust and accurate approach, we propose the light weight convolutional neural networks, an end to end system, for estimating human body orientation. Our body orientation estimation model achieved 81.58% and 94% accuracy with the benchmark dataset and our own dataset respectively. The proposed method can be used in a wide range of service robot applications which depend on the ability to estimate human body orientation. To show its usefulness in service robot applications, we designed a simple robot application which allows the robot to move towards the user's frontal plane. With this, we demonstrated an improved face detection rate.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 7 Sep 2016 13:53:26 GMT  (3496kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.01984v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["jinyoung choi", "beom-jin lee", "byoung-tak zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.01984"}
