Advances in computer vision and machine learning techniques provide a large number of cloud-based services with the ability to provide content analysis, face recognition, and object detection facilities to third parties. These inferences and analytics might come with undesired privacy risks to the individuals.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Mar 2017 18:21:03 GMT  (699kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02952v1", "Technical Report"], ["v2", "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 11:14:55 GMT  (699kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02952v2", "Technical Report"], ["v3", "Mon, 3 Apr 2017 11:43:10 GMT  (699kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02952v3", "Technical Report"], ["v4", "Tue, 4 Apr 2017 05:28:20 GMT  (699kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02952v4", "Technical Report"]], "COMMENTS": "Technical Report", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["seyed ali osia", "ali shahin shamsabadi", "ali taheri", "hamid r rabiee", "nicholas d lane", "hamed haddadi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.02952"}
