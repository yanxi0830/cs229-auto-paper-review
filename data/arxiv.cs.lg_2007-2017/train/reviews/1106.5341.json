For an arbitrary skeleton and depth image, an evolutionary algorithm is used to find the optimal kinematic configuration to explain the observed image. Results show that our approach can correctly estimate poses of 39 and 78 degree-of-freedom models from a single depth image, even in cases of significant self-occlusion.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 27 Jun 2011 09:47:28 GMT  (705kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1106.5341v1", "2 pages, 2 figures, RGB-D workshop in Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS 2011)"]], "COMMENTS": "2 pages, 2 figures, RGB-D workshop in Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS 2011)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["daniel l ly", "ashutosh saxena", "hod lipson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1106.5341"}
