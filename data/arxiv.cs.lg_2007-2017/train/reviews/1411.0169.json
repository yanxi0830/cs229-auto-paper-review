We consider the problem of {\\em density estimation}, in which a learning algorithm is given i.i.d. draws from $p$ and must (with high probability) output a hypothesis distribution that is close to $p$. The main contribution of this paper is a highly efficient density estimation algorithm for learning using a variable-width histogram, i.e., a hypothesis distribution with a piecewise constant probability density function.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Nov 2014 21:03:59 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.0169v1", "conference version appears in NIPS 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "conference version appears in NIPS 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS math.ST stat.TH", "authors": ["siu-on chan", "ilias diakonikolas", "rocco a servedio", "xiaorui sun"], "accepted": true, "id": "1411.0169"}
