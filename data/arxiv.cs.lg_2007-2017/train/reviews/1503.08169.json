In contrast to the existing dense (iterative) data analysis methods that are oblivious to the platform, for the first time, we introduce novel scalable data transformation and mapping algorithms that enable optimizing for the underlying computing platforms' cost/constraints. The cost is defined by the number of arithmetic and (within-platform) message passing operations incurred by the variable updates in each iteration, while the constraints are set by the available memory resources. RankMap's transformation scalably factorizes data into an ensemble of lower dimensional subspaces, while its mapping schedules the flow of iterative computation on the transformed data onto the pertinent computing machine. We show a trade-off between the desired level of accuracy for the learning algorithm and the achieved efficiency. RankMap provides two APIs, one matrix-based and one graph-based, which facilitate automated adoption of the framework for performing several contemporary iterative learning applications optimized to the platform. To demonstrate the utility of RankMap, we solve sparse recovery and power iteration problems on various real-world datasets with up to 1.8 billion non-zeros. Our evaluations are performed on Amazon EC2 and IBM iDataPlex platforms using up to 244 cores. The results demonstrate up to 2 orders of magnitude improvements in memory usage, execution speed, and bandwidth compared with the best reported prior work.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Mar 2015 18:02:51 GMT  (1394kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08169v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 27 Oct 2016 14:29:44 GMT  (988kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08169v2", "13 pages, 10 figures"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.LG", "authors": ["azalia mirhoseini", "eva l dyer", "ebrahim m songhori", "richard g baraniuk", "farinaz koushanfar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.08169"}
