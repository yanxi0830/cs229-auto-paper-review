For the CTC training, however, it is required to unroll the RNN by the length of an input sequence. This unrolling requires a lot of memory and hinders a small footprint implementation of online learning or adaptation. Furthermore, the length of training sequences is usually not uniform, which makes parallel training with multiple sequences inefficient on shared memory models such as graphics processing units (GPUs). In this work, we introduce an expectation-maximization (EM) based online CTC algorithm that enables unidirectional RNNs to learn sequences that are longer than the amount of unrolling. The RNNs can also be trained to process an infinitely long input sequence without pre-segmentation or external reset. Moreover, the proposed approach allows efficient parallel training on GPUs. For evaluation, end-to-end speech recognition examples are presented on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 21 Nov 2015 05:22:37 GMT  (510kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06841v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 30 Nov 2015 19:10:36 GMT  (394kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06841v2", "Submitted to ICLR 2016"], ["v3", "Tue, 1 Dec 2015 12:09:14 GMT  (394kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06841v3", "Submitted to ICLR 2016"], ["v4", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 20:52:42 GMT  (395kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06841v4", "Submitted to ICLR 2016"], ["v5", "Thu, 2 Feb 2017 13:42:49 GMT  (395kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06841v5", "Final version: Kyuyeon Hwang and Wonyong Sung, \"Sequence to Sequence Training of CTC-RNNs with Partial Windowing,\" Proceedings of The 33rd International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 2178-2187, 2016.
