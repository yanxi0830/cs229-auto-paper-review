Going beyond low level attributes, such as colour and texture, we explore weakly-labelled datasets for the learning of higher level concepts, such as scene categories. The idea is based on discovering common characteristics shared among subsets of images by posing a method that is able to organise the data while eliminating irrelevant instances. We propose a novel clustering and outlier detection method, namely Rectifying Self Organizing Maps (RSOM). Given an image collection returned for a concept query, RSOM provides clusters pruned from outliers. Each cluster is used to train a model representing a different characteristics of the concept. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art studies on the task of learning low-level concepts, and it is competitive in learning higher level concepts as well. It is capable to work at large scale with no supervision through exploiting the available sources.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Dec 2013 14:51:00 GMT  (6565kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.4384v1", "present CVPR2014 submission"]], "COMMENTS": "present CVPR2014 submission", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["eren golge", "pinar duygulu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.4384"}
