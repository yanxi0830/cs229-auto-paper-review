The hardness of recommending Copeland winners, the arms that beat the greatest number of other arms, is characterized by deriving an asymptotic regret bound. We propose Copeland Winners Relative Minimum Empirical Divergence (CW-RMED) and derive an asymptotically optimal regret bound for it. However, it is not known whether the algorithm can be efficiently computed or not. To address this issue, we devise an efficient version (ECW-RMED) and derive its asymptotic regret bound. Experimental comparisons of dueling bandit algorithms show that ECW-RMED significantly outperforms existing ones.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 May 2016 18:08:13 GMT  (2332kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01677v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 24 May 2016 12:42:15 GMT  (2105kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01677v2", "To appear in ICML2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["junpei komiyama", "junya honda", "hiroshi nakagawa"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.01677"}
