Our approach extends the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm to the relative setting by using estimates of the pairwise probabilities to select a promising arm and applying Upper Confidence Bound with the winner as a benchmark. We prove a finite-time regret bound of order O(log t). In addition, our empirical results using real data from an information retrieval application show that it greatly outperforms the state of the art.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Dec 2013 03:08:46 GMT  (1952kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3393v1", "13 pages, 6 figures"], ["v2", "Tue, 17 Dec 2013 10:30:42 GMT  (1952kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.3393v2", "13 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["masrour zoghi", "shimon whiteson", "r\u00e9mi munos", "maarten de rijke"], "accepted": true, "id": "1312.3393"}
