We present DBMSTClu a new density-based non-parametric method working on a limited number of linear measurements i.e. a sketched version of the similarity graph $G$ between the $N$ objects to cluster. Unlike $k$-means, $k$-medians or $k$-medoids algorithms, it does not fail at distinguishing clusters with particular structures. No input parameter is needed contrarily to DBSCAN or the Spectral Clustering method. DBMSTClu as a graph-based technique relies on the similarity graph $G$ which costs theoretically $O(N^2)$ in memory. However, our algorithm follows the dynamic semi-streaming model by handling $G$ as a stream of edge weight updates and sketches it in one pass over the data into a compact structure requiring $O(\\operatorname{poly} \\operatorname{log} (N))$ space. Thanks to the property of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for expressing the underlying structure of a graph, our algorithm successfully detects the right number of non-convex clusters by recovering an approximate MST from the graph sketch of $G$. We provide theoretical guarantees on the quality of the clustering partition and also demonstrate its advantage over the existing state-of-the-art on several datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Mar 2017 13:43:45 GMT  (1467kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02375v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 13:11:52 GMT  (1624kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02375v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 4 Sep 2017 07:58:04 GMT  (5526kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02375v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["anne morvan", "krzysztof choromanski", "c\\'edric gouy-pailler", "jamal atif"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.02375"}
