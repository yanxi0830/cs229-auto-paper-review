The course aggregation model of the original covariance matrix is used in the iterative solution of the eigenvalue problem by a power iterations method. The method is tested on several data sets consisting of large number of text documents.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 02:40:05 GMT  (150kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08800v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NA cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["vitaly bulgakov"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.08800"}
