Often a bound $k$ on the number of clusters is given or assumed by the practitioner. Many versions of this problem have been defined, most notably $k$-means and $k$-median.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 Jan 2012 07:46:08 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.6462v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["nir ailon", "ron begleiter"], "accepted": false, "id": "1201.6462"}
