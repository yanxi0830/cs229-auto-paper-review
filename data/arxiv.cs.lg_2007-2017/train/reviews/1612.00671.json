In the field of machine learning, it is often seen that a single parameter that is 'predictive accuracy' is being used for evaluating the performance of a classifier model. However, this parameter might not be considered reliable given a dataset with very high level of skewness. To demonstrate such behavior, seven different types of datasets have been used to evaluate a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) using twelve(12) different parameters which include micro- and macro-level estimation. In the present study, the most common problem of prediction called 'multiclass' classification has been considered. The results that are obtained for different parameters for each of the dataset could demonstrate interesting findings to support the usability of these set of performance evaluation parameters.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 19:58:44 GMT  (130kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00671v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["siddharth dinesh", "tirtharaj dash"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.00671"}
