{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-Oct-2016", "title": "Federated Optimization: Distributed Machine Learning for On-Device Intelligence", "abstract": "We introduce a new and increasingly relevant setting for distributed optimization in machine learning, where the data defining the optimization are unevenly distributed over an extremely large number of nodes. The goal is to train a high-quality centralized model. We refer to this setting as Federated Optimization. In this setting, communication efficiency is of the utmost importance and minimizing the number of rounds of communication is the principal goal.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 8 Oct 2016 13:25:15 GMT  (243kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02527v1", "38 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "38 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["jakub kone\\v{c}n\\'y", "h brendan mcmahan", "daniel ramage", "peter richt\\'arik"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.02527"}
