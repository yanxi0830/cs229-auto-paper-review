Recently, efficient algorithms were conceived to enumerate all biclusters in real-valued datasets. In this case, the solution composes a complete set of maximal and non-redundant biclusters. However, the ability to enumerate biclusters revealed a challenging scenario: in noisy datasets, each true bicluster may become highly fragmented and with a high degree of overlapping. It prevents a direct analysis of the obtained results. To revert the fragmentation, we propose here two approaches for properly aggregating the whole set of enumerated biclusters: one based on single linkage and the other directly exploring the rate of overlapping. Both proposals were compared with each other and with the actual state-of-the-art in several experiments, and they not only significantly reduced the number of biclusters but also consistently increased the quality of the solution.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 2 Jun 2015 22:26:42 GMT  (213kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01077v1", "15 pages, will be published by Springer Verlag in the LNAI Series in the book Advances in Data Mining"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages, will be published by Springer Verlag in the LNAI Series in the book Advances in Data Mining", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["saullo haniell galv\\~ao de oliveira", "rosana veroneze", "fernando jos\\'e von zuben"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.01077"}
