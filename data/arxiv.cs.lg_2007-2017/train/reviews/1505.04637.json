{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-May-2015", "title": "Ensemble of Example-Dependent Cost-Sensitive Decision Trees", "abstract": "Several real-world classification problems are example-dependent cost-sensitive in nature, where the costs due to misclassification vary between examples and not only within classes. However, standard classification methods do not take these costs into account, and assume a constant cost of misclassification errors. In previous works, some methods that take into account the financial costs into the training of different algorithms have been proposed, with the example-dependent cost-sensitive decision tree algorithm being the one that gives the highest savings. In this paper we propose a new framework of ensembles of example-dependent cost-sensitive decision-trees. The framework consists in creating different example-dependent cost-sensitive decision trees on random subsamples of the training set, and then combining them using three different combination approaches. Moreover, we propose two new cost-sensitive combination approaches; cost-sensitive weighted voting and cost-sensitive stacking, the latter being based on the cost-sensitive logistic regression method. Finally, using five different databases, from four real-world applications: credit card fraud detection, churn modeling, credit scoring and direct marketing, we evaluate the proposed method against state-of-the-art example-dependent cost-sensitive techniques, namely, cost-proportionate sampling, Bayes minimum risk and cost-sensitive decision trees. The results show that the proposed algorithms have better results for all databases, in the sense of higher savings.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 May 2015 13:43:53 GMT  (150kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04637v1", "13 pages, 6 figures, Submitted for possible publication"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 6 figures, Submitted for possible publication", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["alejandro correa bahnsen", "djamila aouada", "bjorn ottersten"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.04637"}
