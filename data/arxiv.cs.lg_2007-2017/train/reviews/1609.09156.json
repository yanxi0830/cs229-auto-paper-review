Despite growing attention, achieving high performance tracking is still challenging, with state-of-the- art systems resulting in high complexity with a large number of hyper parameters. In this paper, we focus on reducing overall system complexity and the number hyper parameters that need to be tuned to a specific environment. We introduce a novel tracking system based on similarity mapping by Enhanced Siamese Neural Network (ESNN), which accounts for both appearance and geometric information, and is trainable end-to-end. Our system achieves competitive performance in both speed and accuracy on MOT16 challenge, compared to known state-of-the-art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 28 Sep 2016 23:52:50 GMT  (5753kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09156v1", "accepted as a poster presentation for WiML 2016, colocated with NIPS 2016, Barcelona, Spain"], ["v2", "Tue, 24 Jan 2017 00:51:57 GMT  (3329kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.09156v2", "1) accepted as a poster presentation at WiML (Women in Machine Learning) workshop 2016, colocated with NIPS 2016 in Barcelona, Spain, 2) accepted as a poster presentation at MLITS (Machine Learning for Intelligent Transportation Systems) Workshop held in conjunction with the NIPS 2016 in Barcelona, Spain"]], "COMMENTS": "accepted as a poster presentation for WiML 2016, colocated with NIPS 2016, Barcelona, Spain", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["minyoung kim", "stefano alletto", "luca rigazio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.09156"}
