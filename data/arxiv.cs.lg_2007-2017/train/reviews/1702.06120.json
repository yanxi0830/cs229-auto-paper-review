As $k$-means++, for samples, provides with constant factor approximation for $k$-means objectives, such an approximation can be achieved for the population with increase of the sample size.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 20 Feb 2017 10:09:02 GMT  (303kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06120v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["mieczys{\\l}aw a k{\\l}opotek"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06120"}
