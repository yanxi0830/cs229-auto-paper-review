{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "7-Mar-2017", "title": "Online Convex Optimization with Unconstrained Domains and Losses", "abstract": "We propose an online convex optimization algorithm (RescaledExp) that achieves optimal regret in the unconstrained setting without prior knowledge of any bounds on the loss functions. We prove a lower bound showing an exponential separation between the regret of existing algorithms that require a known bound on the loss functions and any algorithm that does not require such knowledge. RescaledExp matches this lower bound asymptotically in the number of iterations. RescaledExp is naturally hyperparameter-free and we demonstrate empirically that it matches prior optimization algorithms that require hyperparameter optimization.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 7 Mar 2017 22:14:53 GMT  (392kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02622v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["ashok cutkosky", "kwabena a boahen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.02622"}
