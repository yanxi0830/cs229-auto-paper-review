In this paper, we ask a fundamental question: can neural machine translation generate a character sequence without any explicit segmentation? To answer this question, we evaluate an attention-based encoder-decoder with a subword-level encoder and a character-level decoder on four language pairs--En-Cs, En-De, En-Ru and En-Fi-- using the parallel corpora from WMT'15. Our experiments show that the models with a character-level decoder outperform the ones with a subword-level decoder on all of the four language pairs. Furthermore, the ensembles of neural models with a character-level decoder outperform the state-of-the-art non-neural machine translation systems on En-Cs, En-De and En-Fi and perform comparably on En-Ru.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 19 Mar 2016 21:35:04 GMT  (172kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06147v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 23 Mar 2016 20:57:23 GMT  (172kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06147v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 16 Jun 2016 04:06:01 GMT  (172kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06147v3", null], ["v4", "Tue, 21 Jun 2016 01:12:22 GMT  (174kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06147v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["junyoung chung", "kyunghyun cho", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.06147"}
