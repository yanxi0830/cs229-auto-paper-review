It leverages the large learning capacity of deep networks, as well as the problem-specific expertise that was hardly incorporated in the past design of deep architectures. For the latter, we take into consideration both the prior knowledge of the JPEG compression scheme, and the successful practice of the sparsity-based dual-domain approach. We further design the One-Step Sparse Inference (1-SI) module, as an efficient and light-weighted feed-forward approximation of sparse coding. Extensive experiments verify the superiority of the proposed $D^3$ model over several state-of-the-art methods. Specifically, our best model is capable of outperforming the latest deep model for around 1 dB in PSNR, and is 30 times faster.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 16 Jan 2016 10:38:43 GMT  (2035kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04149v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 1 Apr 2016 03:19:10 GMT  (1527kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04149v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 9 Apr 2016 19:25:08 GMT  (1527kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04149v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["zhangyang wang", "ding liu", "shiyu chang", "qing ling", "yingzhen yang", "thomas s huang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.04149"}
