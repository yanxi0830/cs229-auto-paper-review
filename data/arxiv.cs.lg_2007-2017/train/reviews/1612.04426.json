Our model is a simplified version of memory augmented networks, which stores past hidden activations as memory and accesses them through a dot product with the current hidden activation. This mechanism is very efficient and scales to very large memory sizes. We also draw a link between the use of external memory in neural network and cache models used with count based language models. We demonstrate on several language model datasets that our approach performs significantly better than recent memory augmented networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Dec 2016 23:09:49 GMT  (197kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04426v1", "Submitted to ICLR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to ICLR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["edouard grave", "armand joulin", "nicolas usunier"], "accepted": true, "id": "1612.04426"}
