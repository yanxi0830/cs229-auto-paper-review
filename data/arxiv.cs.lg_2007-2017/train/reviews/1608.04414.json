{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-Aug-2016", "title": "Generalization of ERM in Stochastic Convex Optimization: The Dimension Strikes Back", "abstract": "In stochastic convex optimization the goal is to minimize a convex function $F(x) \\doteq {\\mathbf E}_{{\\mathbf f}\\sim D}[{\\mathbf f}(x)]$ over a convex set $\\cal K \\subset {\\mathbb R}^d$ where $D$ is some unknown distribution and each $f(\\cdot)$ in the support of $D$ is convex over $\\cal K$. The optimization is commonly based on i.i.d.~samples $f^1,f^2,\\ldots,f^n$ from $D$. A standard approach to such problems is empirical risk minimization (ERM) that optimizes $F_S(x) \\doteq \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i\\leq n} f^i(x)$. Here we consider the question of how many samples are necessary for ERM to succeed and the closely related question of uniform convergence of $F_S$ to $F$ over $\\cal K$. We demonstrate that in the standard $\\ell_p/\\ell_q$ setting of Lipschitz-bounded functions over a $\\cal K$ of bounded radius, ERM requires sample size that scales linearly with the dimension $d$. This nearly matches standard upper bounds and improves on $\\Omega(\\log d)$ dependence proved for $\\ell_2/\\ell_2$ setting by Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009). In stark contrast, these problems can be solved using dimension-independent number of samples for $\\ell_2/\\ell_2$ setting and $\\log d$ dependence for $\\ell_1/\\ell_\\infty$ setting using other approaches. We also demonstrate that for a more general class of range-bounded (but not Lipschitz-bounded) stochastic convex programs an even stronger gap appears already in dimension 2.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Aug 2016 21:19:51 GMT  (17kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04414v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 28 Oct 2016 00:46:58 GMT  (20kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04414v2", "Added a lower bound construction based on efficiently computable functions"], ["v3", "Mon, 26 Dec 2016 06:37:48 GMT  (299kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04414v3", "Added illustrations of functions used in some of the constructions"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["vitaly feldman"], "accepted": true, "id": "1608.04414"}
