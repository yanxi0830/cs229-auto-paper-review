Traditional navigation approaches rely on global maps of the environment to overcome cul-de-sacs and plan feasible motions. Yet, maintaining an accurate global map may be challenging in real-world settings. A possible way to mitigate this limitation is to use learning techniques that forgo hand-engineered map representations and infer appropriate control responses directly from sensed information. An important but unexplored aspect of such approaches is the effect of memory on their performance. This work is a first thorough study of memory structures for deep-neural-network-based robot navigation, and offers novel tools to train such networks from supervision and quantify their ability to generalize to unseen scenarios. We analyze the separation and generalization abilities of feedforward, long short-term memory, and differentiable neural computer networks. We introduce a new method to evaluate the generalization ability by estimating the VC-dimension of networks with a final linear readout layer. We validate that the VC estimates are good predictors of actual test performance. The reported method can be applied to deep learning problems beyond robotics.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 May 2017 00:58:20 GMT  (2726kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08049v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.RO cs.LG", "authors": ["steven w chen", "nikolay atanasov", "arbaaz khan", "konstantinos karydis", "daniel d lee", "vijay kumar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1705.08049"}
