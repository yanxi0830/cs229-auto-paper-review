Social network sites (SNSs) have revolutionized the way in which information is spread by allowing users to freely share content. As a consequence, SNSs are also increasingly used as vectors for the diffusion of misinformation and hoaxes. The amount of disseminated information and the rapidity of its diffusion make it practically impossible to assess reliability in a timely manner, highlighting the need for automatic hoax detection systems.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 25 Apr 2017 01:20:40 GMT  (1869kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07506v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.HC cs.SI", "authors": ["eugenio tacchini", "gabriele ballarin", "marco l della vedova", "stefano moret", "luca de alfaro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.07506"}
