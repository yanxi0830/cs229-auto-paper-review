We effect this training using negative learning rates. We also show how this method can be used to perform direct policy learning in a reinforcement learning setting.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 27 Mar 2016 20:02:13 GMT  (96kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08253v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 29 Mar 2016 11:10:33 GMT  (96kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08253v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["devon merrill"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.08253"}
