However, the design of network architectures usually relies heavily on expert knowledge and is hand-crafted. In this paper, we provide a solution to automatically and efficiently design high performance network architectures. To reduce the search space of network design, we focus on constructing network blocks, which can be stacked to generate the whole network. Blocks are generated through an agent, which is trained with Q-learning to maximize the expected accuracy of the searching blocks on the learning task. Distributed asynchronous framework and early stop strategy are used to accelerate the training process. Our experimental results demonstrate that the network architectures designed by our approach perform competitively compared with hand-crafted state-of-the-art networks. We trained the Q-learning on CIFAR-100, and evaluated on CIFAR10 and ImageNet, the designed block structure achieved 3.60% error on CIFAR-10 and competitive result on ImageNet. The Q-learning process can be efficiently trained only on 32 GPUs in 3 days.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Aug 2017 10:12:43 GMT  (2715kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05552v1", "11 pages, 8 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["zhao zhong", "junjie yan", "cheng-lin liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.05552"}
