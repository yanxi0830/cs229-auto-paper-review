To alleviate these problems to some extent, prior research utilize low precision fixed-point numbers to represent the CNN weights and activations. However, the minimum required data precision of fixed-point weights varies across different networks and also across different layers of the same network. In this work, we propose using floating-point numbers for representing the weights and fixed-point numbers for representing the activations. We show that using floating-point representation for weights is more efficient than fixed-point representation for the same bit-width and demonstrate it on popular large-scale CNNs such as AlexNet, SqueezeNet, GoogLeNet and VGG-16. We also show that such a representation scheme enables compact hardware multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) unit design. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme reduces the weight storage by up to 36% and power consumption of the hardware multiplier by up to 50%.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 8 Mar 2017 23:49:20 GMT  (1608kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03073v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["liangzhen lai", "naveen suda", "vikas chandra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.03073"}
