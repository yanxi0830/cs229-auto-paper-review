However, these techniques only reveal linear relationships in data. Although nonlinear variants of PCA and CCA have been proposed, they are computationally prohibitive in the large scale.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 1 Feb 2014 19:54:06 GMT  (312kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0119v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 13 May 2014 16:41:11 GMT  (530kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0119v2", "Appearing in ICML 2014"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["david lopez-paz", "suvrit sra", "alexander j smola", "zoubin ghahramani", "bernhard sch\u00f6lkopf"], "accepted": true, "id": "1402.0119"}
