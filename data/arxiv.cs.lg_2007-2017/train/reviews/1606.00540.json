The optimization formulas are different during the pretraining process for different pretraining models. In this paper, we pretrained deep neutral network by different pretraining models and hence investigated the difference between DBN and Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDA) when used as pretraining model. The experimental results show that DBN get a better initial model. However the model converges to a relatively worse model after the finetuning process. Yet after pretrained by SDA for the second time the model converges to a better model if finetuned.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 05:39:54 GMT  (317kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00540v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["zhen hu", "zhuyin xue", "tong cui", "shiqiang zong", "chenglong he"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.00540"}
