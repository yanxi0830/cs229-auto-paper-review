Almost all NER systems for Hindi use Language Specific features and handcrafted rules with gazetteers. Our model is language independent and uses no domain specific features or any handcrafted rules. Our models rely on semantic information in the form of word vectors which are learnt by an unsupervised learning algorithm on an unannotated corpus. Our model attained state of the art per- formance in both English and Hindi which is a morphologically rich language without the use of any morphological analysis or without using gazetteers of any sort.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 31 Oct 2016 01:31:52 GMT  (198kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09756v1", "6 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 16 Nov 2016 17:15:14 GMT  (178kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09756v2", "7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "6 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["vinayak athavale", "shreenivas bharadwaj", "monik pamecha", "ameya prabhu", "manish shrivastava"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.09756"}
