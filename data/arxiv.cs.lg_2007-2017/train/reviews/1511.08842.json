More recently, data-driven adaptation of synthesis dictionaries has shown promise in many applications compared to fixed or analytical dictionary models. However, dictionary learning problems are typically non-convex and NP-hard, and the usual alternating minimization approaches for these problems are often computationally expensive, with the computations dominated by the NP-hard synthesis sparse coding step. In this work, we investigate an efficient method for $\\ell_{0}$ \"norm\"-based dictionary learning by first approximating the training data set with a sum of sparse rank-one matrices and then using a block coordinate descent approach to estimate the unknowns. The proposed block coordinate descent algorithm involves efficient closed-form solutions. In particular, the sparse coding step involves a simple form of thresholding. We provide a convergence analysis for the proposed block coordinate descent approach. Our numerical experiments show the promising performance and significant speed-ups provided by our method over the classical K-SVD scheme in sparse signal representation and image denoising.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 27 Nov 2015 22:32:43 GMT  (1903kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08842v1", "A short version of this work [arXiv:1511.06333] has also been submitted to ICLR 2016"], ["v2", "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 02:31:13 GMT  (1904kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08842v2", "This work is cited by the IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging PaperarXiv:1511.06333(DOI: 10.1109/TCI.2017.2697206)"]], "COMMENTS": "A short version of this work [arXiv:1511.06333] has also been submitted to ICLR 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["saiprasad ravishankar", "raj rao nadakuditi", "jeffrey a fessler"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.08842"}
