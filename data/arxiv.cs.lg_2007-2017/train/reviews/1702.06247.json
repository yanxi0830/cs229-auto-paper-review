However, most matrix completion methods lack semantic interpretation and usually result in weak-semantic recommendations. To this end, this paper proposes a {\\bf S}emantic {\\bf A}nalysis approach for {\\bf R}ecommendation systems \\textbf{(SAR)}, which applies a two-level hierarchical generative process that assigns semantic properties and categories for user and item. SAR learns semantic representations of users/items merely from user ratings on items, which offers a new path to recommendation by semantic matching with the learned representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAR outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines substantially.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 21 Feb 2017 03:09:10 GMT  (738kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06247v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 02:20:47 GMT  (731kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.06247v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.LG", "authors": ["han xiao", "minlie huang", "xiaoyan zhu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.06247"}
