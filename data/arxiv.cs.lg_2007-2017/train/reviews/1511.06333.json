More recently, the data-driven adaptation of synthesis dictionaries has shown promise in many applications compared to fixed or analytical dictionaries. However, dictionary learning problems are typically non-convex and NP-hard, and the alternating minimization approaches usually adopted to solve these problems are often computationally expensive, with the computations dominated by the NP-hard synthesis sparse coding step. In this work, we investigate an efficient method for dictionary learning by first decomposing the training data set into a sum of sparse rank-one matrices and then using a block coordinate descent approach to estimate the rank-one terms. The proposed algorithm involves efficient closed-form solutions. In particular, the sparse coding step involves a simple form of thresholding. We provide a convergence analysis for the proposed block coordinate descent method that solves a highly non-convex problem. Our experiments show the promising performance and significant speed-ups provided by our method over the classical K-SVD scheme in sparse signal representation and image denoising.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 20:01:24 GMT  (1794kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06333v1", "This paper was submitted to ICLR 2016"], ["v2", "Fri, 4 Dec 2015 03:56:34 GMT  (1794kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06333v2", "This paper was submitted to ICLR 2016"], ["v3", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 23:47:05 GMT  (1798kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06333v3", "This paper was submitted to ICLR 2016"], ["v4", "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 01:39:38 GMT  (768kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06333v4", "Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging.
