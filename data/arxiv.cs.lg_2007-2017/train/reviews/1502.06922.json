The proposed LSTM-RNN model sequentially takes each word in a sentence, extracts its information, and embeds it into a semantic vector. Due to its ability to capture long term memory, the LSTM-RNN accumulates increasingly richer information as it goes through the sentence, and when it reaches the last word, the hidden layer of the network provides a semantic representation of the whole sentence. In this paper, the LSTM-RNN is trained in a weakly supervised manner on user click-through data logged by a commercial web search engine. Visualization and analysis are performed to understand how the embedding process works. The model automatically attenuates the unimportant words and detects the salient keywords in the sentence. Furthermore, these detected keywords automatically activate different cells of the LSTM-RNN, where words belonging to a similar topic activate the same cell. As a semantic representation of the sentence, the embedding vector can be used in many different applications. These keyword detection and topic allocation tasks enabled by the LSTM-RNN allow the network to perform web document retrieval, where the similarity between the query and documents can be measured by the distance between their corresponding sentence embedding vectors computed by the LSTM-RNN. On a web search task, the LSTM-RNN embedding is shown to significantly outperform all existing state of the art methods.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 24 Feb 2015 19:39:27 GMT  (1307kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06922v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 5 Jul 2015 06:11:19 GMT  (1490kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06922v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 16 Jan 2016 06:35:23 GMT  (1759kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06922v3", "To appear in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["hamid palangi", "li deng", "yelong shen", "jianfeng gao", "xiaodong he", "jianshu chen", "xinying song", "rabab ward"], "accepted": false, "id": "1502.06922"}
