In one pertinent, well-motivated attack scenario, an adversary may attempt to evade a deployed system at test time by carefully manipulating attack samples. In this work, we present a simple but effective gradient-based approach that can be exploited to systematically assess the security of several, widely-used classification algorithms against evasion attacks. Following a recently proposed framework for security evaluation, we simulate attack scenarios that exhibit different risk levels for the classifier by increasing the attacker's knowledge of the system and her ability to manipulate attack samples. This gives the classifier designer a better picture of the classifier performance under evasion attacks, and allows him to perform a more informed model selection (or parameter setting). We evaluate our approach on the relevant security task of malware detection in PDF files, and show that such systems can be easily evaded. We also sketch some countermeasures suggested by our analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Aug 2017 09:55:37 GMT  (177kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06131v1", "In this paper, in 2013, we were the first to introduce the notion of evasion attacks (adversarial examples) created with high confidence (instead of minimum-distance misclassifications), and the notion of surrogate learners (substitute models).
