These methods involve combinations of activation functions, sampling steps and different kinds of penalties. To investigate the effectiveness of sparsity by itself, we propose the k-sparse autoencoder, which is a linear model, but where in hidden layers only the k highest activities are kept. When applied to the MNIST and NORB datasets, we find that this method achieves better classification results than denoising autoencoders, networks trained with dropout, and restricted Boltzmann machines. k-sparse autoencoders are simple to train and the encoding stage is very fast, making them well-suited to large problem sizes, where conventional sparse coding algorithms cannot be applied.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Dec 2013 17:46:46 GMT  (1073kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5663v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 22 Mar 2014 17:12:07 GMT  (1155kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5663v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["alireza makhzani", "brendan frey"], "accepted": true, "id": "1312.5663"}
