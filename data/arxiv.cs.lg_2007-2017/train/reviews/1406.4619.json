All of them assume normality of the involved random steps, and while this is consistent with a black-box scenario, information on the function to be optimized (e.g. separability) may be exploited by the use of another distribution. The objective of our contribution is to complement previous studies realized with normal steps, and to give sufficient conditions on the distribution of the random steps for the success of a constant step-size $(1,\\lambda)$-ES on the simple problem of a linear function with a linear constraint. The decomposition of a multidimensional distribution into its marginals and the copula combining them is applied to the new distributional assumptions, particular attention being paid to distributions with Archimedean copulas.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Jun 2014 06:58:38 GMT  (124kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4619v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NA cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["alexandre chotard", "martin holena"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.4619"}
