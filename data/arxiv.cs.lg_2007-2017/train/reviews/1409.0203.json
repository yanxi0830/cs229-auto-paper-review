We construct a matrix consisting of the pairwise distances and propose to estimate the missing entries based on a novel Euclidean distance matrix completion algorithm by alternative low-rank matrix completion and projection onto the Euclidean distance space. This approach confines the recovered matrix to the EDM cone at each iteration of the matrix completion algorithm. The theoretical guarantees of the calibration performance are obtained considering the random and locally structured missing entries as well as the measurement noise on the known distances. This study elucidates the links between the calibration error and the number of microphones along with the noise level and the ratio of missing distances. Thorough experiments on real data recordings and simulated setups are conducted to demonstrate these theoretical insights. A significant improvement is achieved by the proposed Euclidean distance matrix completion algorithm over the state-of-the-art techniques for ad hoc microphone array calibration.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 31 Aug 2014 10:33:45 GMT  (195kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0203v1", "In Press, available online, August 1, 2014.this http URL, Signal Processing, 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "In Press, available online, August 1, 2014.this http URL, Signal Processing, 2014", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.LG", "authors": ["mohammad j taghizadeh", "reza parhizkar", "philip n garner", "herve bourlard", "afsaneh asaei"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.0203"}
