Most of these applications need to be able to compare these structured data. In this context, dynamic time warping (DTW) is probably the most common comparison measure. However, not much research effort has been put into improving it by learning. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning similarities based on DTW, in order to improve time series classification. Making use of the uniform stability framework, we provide the first theoretical guarantees in the form of a generalization bound for linear classification. The experimental study shows that the proposed approach is efficient, while yielding sparse classifiers.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 15 Oct 2016 20:37:52 GMT  (482kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04783v1", "Techreport"]], "COMMENTS": "Techreport", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["maria-irina nicolae", "\\'eric gaussier", "amaury habrard", "marc sebban"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.04783"}
