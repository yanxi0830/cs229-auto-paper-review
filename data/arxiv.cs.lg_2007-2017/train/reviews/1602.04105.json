We compare the efficacy of radio modulation classification using naively learned features against using expert features, which are currently used widely and well regarded in the field and we show significant performance improvements. We show that blind temporal learning on large and densely encoded time series using deep convolutional neural networks is viable and a strong candidate approach for this task.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 12 Feb 2016 16:28:59 GMT  (896kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04105v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 24 Apr 2016 21:38:29 GMT  (814kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04105v2", null], ["v3", "Fri, 10 Jun 2016 21:44:09 GMT  (638kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04105v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["timothy j o'shea", "johnathan corgan", "t charles clancy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.04105"}
