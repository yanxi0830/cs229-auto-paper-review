Typically, kernel functions are designed beforehand for a data type which either exploit statistics of the structures or make use of probabilistic generative models, and then a discriminative classifier is learned based on the kernels via convex optimization. However, such an elegant two-stage approach also limited kernel methods from scaling up to millions of data points, and exploiting discriminative information to learn feature representations.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 17 Mar 2016 19:29:46 GMT  (598kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05629v1", "22 pages, 8 figures"], ["v2", "Sat, 19 Mar 2016 19:26:55 GMT  (751kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05629v2", "22 pages, 8 figures"], ["v3", "Sun, 29 May 2016 19:12:05 GMT  (722kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05629v3", "ICML 2016"], ["v4", "Mon, 26 Sep 2016 23:52:45 GMT  (753kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05629v4", "ICML 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages, 8 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["hanjun dai", "bo dai", "le song"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.05629"}
