Traditional methods for drift compensation are laborious and costly due to the frequent acquisition and labeling process for gases samples recalibration. Extreme learning machines (ELMs) have been confirmed to be efficient and effective learning techniques for pattern recognition and regression. However, ELMs primarily focus on the supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning problems in single domain (i.e. source domain). To our best knowledge, ELM with cross-domain learning capability has never been studied. This paper proposes a unified framework, referred to as Domain Adaptation Extreme Learning Machine (DAELM), which learns a robust classifier by leveraging a limited number of labeled data from target domain for drift compensation as well as gases recognition in E-nose systems, without loss of the computational efficiency and learning ability of traditional ELM. In the unified framework, two algorithms called DAELM-S and DAELM-T are proposed for the purpose of this paper, respectively. In order to percept the differences among ELM, DAELM-S and DAELM-T, two remarks are provided. Experiments on the popular sensor drift data with multiple batches collected by E-nose system clearly demonstrate that the proposed DAELM significantly outperforms existing drift compensation methods without cumbersome measures, and also bring new perspectives for ELM.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 24 May 2015 04:34:27 GMT  (855kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06405v1", "11 pages, 9 figures, to appear in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages, 9 figures, to appear in IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["lei zhang", "david zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.06405"}
