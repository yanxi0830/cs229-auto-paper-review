Big Data problems, generated by massive growth in the scale of data observed in recent years, also follow the same dictate. A common problem affecting data quality is the presence of noise, particularly in classification problems, where label noise refers to the incorrect labeling of training instances, and is known to be a very disruptive feature of data. However, in this Big Data era, the massive growth in the scale of the data poses a challenge to traditional proposals created to tackle noise, as they have difficulties coping with such a large amount of data. New algorithms need to be proposed to treat the noise in Big Data problems, providing high quality and clean data, also known as Smart Data. In this paper, two Big Data preprocessing approaches to remove noisy examples are proposed: an homogeneous ensemble and an heterogeneous ensemble filter, with special emphasis in their scalability and performance traits. The obtained results show that these proposals enable the practitioner to efficiently obtain a Smart Dataset from any Big Data classification problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 6 Apr 2017 10:06:52 GMT  (68kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01770v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 28 Jul 2017 11:39:16 GMT  (838kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.01770v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DB cs.LG", "authors": ["diego garc\\'ia-gil", "juli\\'an luengo", "salvador garc\\'ia", "francisco herrera"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.01770"}
