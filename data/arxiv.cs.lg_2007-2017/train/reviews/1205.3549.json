{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-May-2012", "title": "Normalized Maximum Likelihood Coding for Exponential Family with Its Applications to Optimal Clustering", "abstract": "We are concerned with the issue of how to calculate the normalized maximum likelihood~(NML) code-length. There is a problem that the normalization term of the NML code-length may diverge when it is continuous and unbounded and a straightforward computation of it is highly expensive when the data domain is finite . In previous works it has been investigated how to calculate the NML code-length for specific types of distributions. We first propose a general method for computing the NML code-length for the exponential family. Then we specifically focus on Gaussian mixture model~(GMM), and propose a new efficient method for computing the NML to them. We develop it by generalizing Rissanen's re-normalizing technique. Then we apply this method to the clustering issue, in which a clustering structure is modeled using a GMM, and the main task is to estimate the optimal number of clusters on the basis of the NML code-length. We demonstrate using artificial data sets the superiority of the NML-based clustering over other criteria such as AIC, BIC in terms of the data size required for high accuracy rate to be achieved.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 16 May 2012 03:54:30 GMT  (48kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3549v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 17 May 2012 01:03:19 GMT  (48kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.3549v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["so hirai", "kenji yamanishi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1205.3549"}
