By constructing a low-rank estimate of the gradient, we propose an iterative algorithm based on stochastic proximal gradient descent (SPGD), and take the last iterate of SPGD as the final solution. The main advantage of the proposed algorithm is that its space complexity is $O(m+n)$, in contrast, most of previous algorithms have a $O(mn)$ space complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that it achieves $O(\\log T/\\sqrt{T})$ and $O(\\log T/T)$ convergence rates for general convex functions and strongly convex functions, respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 5 Nov 2015 09:24:13 GMT  (15kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01664v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 5 Dec 2015 08:02:25 GMT  (15kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01664v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["lijun zhang", "tianbao yang", "rong jin", "zhi-hua zhou"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.01664"}
