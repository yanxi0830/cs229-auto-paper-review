How can structural properties of the underlying matrix B be leveraged to yield computationally efficient and information theoretically optimal reconstruction algorithms? When can accurate reconstruction be accomplished in the sparse data regime? This basic problem lies at the core of a number of questions that are currently being considered by different communities, including community detection in sparse random graphs, learning structured models such as topic models or hidden Markov models, and the efforts from the natural language processing community to compute \"word embeddings\".", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 21 Feb 2016 21:47:45 GMT  (542kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06586v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 29 Feb 2016 22:20:50 GMT  (542kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06586v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 9 Apr 2016 06:59:37 GMT  (518kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06586v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 15 Apr 2016 04:58:58 GMT  (518kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06586v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["qingqing huang", "sham m kakade", "weihao kong", "gregory valiant"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.06586"}
