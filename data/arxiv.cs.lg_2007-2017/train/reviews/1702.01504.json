Cost-sensitive adjustment approach is a typical algorithm-level method resisting the data set imbalance. For SVMs classifier, which is modified to incorporate varying penalty parameter(C) for each of considered groups of examples. However, the C value is determined empirically, or is calculated according to the evaluation metric, which need to be computed iteratively and time consuming. This paper presents a novel cost-sensitive SVM method whose penalty parameter C optimized on the basis of cluster probability density function(PDF) and the cluster PDF is estimated only according to similarity matrix and some predefined hyper-parameters. Experimental results on various standard benchmark data sets and real-world data with different ratios of imbalance show that the proposed method is effective in comparison with commonly used cost-sensitive techniques.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Feb 2017 06:14:29 GMT  (733kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01504v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["qiuyan yan", "shixiong xia", "fanrong meng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.01504"}
