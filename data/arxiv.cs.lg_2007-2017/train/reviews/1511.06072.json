Our architecture achieves this with the help of expert networks: A network is trained on a disjoint subset of a given dataset and then run in parallel to other experts during deployment. A mediator is employed if experts contradict each other. This allows our framework to naturally support incremental learning, as adding new classes requires (re-)training of the new expert only. We also propose two measures to control computational complexity: An early-stopping mechanism halts experts that have low confidence in their prediction. The system allows to trade-off accuracy and complexity without further retraining. We also suggest to share low-level convolutional layers between experts in an effort to avoid computation of a near-duplicate feature set. We evaluate our system on a popular dataset and report improved accuracy compared to a single model of same configuration.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 07:01:36 GMT  (124kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06072v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["sebastian agethen", "winston h hsu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06072"}
