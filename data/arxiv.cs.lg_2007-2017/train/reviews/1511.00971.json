In this scenario, Hoeffding Trees are an established method for classification. Several extensions exist, including high-performing ensemble setups such as online and leveraging bagging. Also, $k$-nearest neighbors is a popular choice, with most extensions dealing with the inherent performance limitations over a potentially-infinite stream.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 3 Nov 2015 16:29:57 GMT  (1653kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00971v1", "20 pages, journal"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages, journal", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["diego marr\\'on", "jesse read", "albert bifet", "nacho navarro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.00971"}
