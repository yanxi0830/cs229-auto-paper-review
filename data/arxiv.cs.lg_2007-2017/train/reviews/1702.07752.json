Picking such a windowing of the data is often done by hand, or left up to the technology that is collecting the data. However, the choice can make a big difference in the properties of the dynamic network. This is the time scale detection problem. In previous work, this problem is often solved with a heuristic as an unsupervised task. As an unsupervised problem, it is difficult to measure how well a given algorithm performs. In addition, we show that the quality of the windowing is dependent on which task an analyst wants to perform on the network after windowing. Therefore the time scale detection problem should not be handled independently from the rest of the analysis of the network.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 24 Feb 2017 20:45:02 GMT  (64kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.07752v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SI cs.LG", "authors": ["benjamin fish", "rajmonda s caceres"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.07752"}
