{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Dec-2013", "title": "Unsupervised Feature Learning by Deep Sparse Coding", "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a new unsupervised feature learning framework, namely Deep Sparse Coding (DeepSC), that extends sparse coding to a multi-layer architecture for visual object recognition tasks. The main innovation of the framework is that it connects the sparse-encoders from different layers by a sparse-to-dense module. The sparse-to-dense module is a composition of a local spatial pooling step and a low-dimensional embedding process, which takes advantage of the spatial smoothness information in the image. As a result, the new method is able to learn several levels of sparse representation of the image which capture features at a variety of abstraction levels and simultaneously preserve the spatial smoothness between the neighboring image patches. Combining the feature representations from multiple layers, DeepSC achieves the state-of-the-art performance on multiple object recognition tasks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Dec 2013 00:21:36 GMT  (306kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5783v1", "9 pages, submitted to ICLR"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, submitted to ICLR", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["yunlong he", "koray kavukcuoglu", "yun wang", "arthur szlam", "yanjun qi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1312.5783"}
