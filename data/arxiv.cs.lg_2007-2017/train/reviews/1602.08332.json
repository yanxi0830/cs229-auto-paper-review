Mathematically, such decision-makers can be modeled as information-theoretic channels with limited transmission rate. Here, we apply this formalism for the first time to multilayer feedforward neural networks. We derive synaptic weight update rules for two scenarios, where either each neuron is considered as a bounded rational decision-maker or the network as a whole. In the update rules, bounded rationality translates into information-theoretically motivated types of regularization in weight space. In experiments on the MNIST benchmark classification task for handwritten digits, we show that such information-theoretic regularization successfully prevents overfitting across different architectures and attains state-of-the-art results for both ordinary and convolutional neural networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 26 Feb 2016 14:15:03 GMT  (39kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08332v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 23 May 2016 15:51:07 GMT  (41kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08332v2", "Proceedings of the 32nd Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI), New York City, NY, USA, 2016"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["felix leibfried", "daniel alexander braun"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.08332"}
