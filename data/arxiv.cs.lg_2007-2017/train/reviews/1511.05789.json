{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "18-Nov-2015", "title": "Metric learning approach for graph-based label propagation", "abstract": "The efficiency of graph-based semi-supervised algorithms depends on the graph of instances on which they are applied. The instances are often in a vectorial form before a graph linking them is built. The construction of the graph relies on a metric over the vectorial space that help define the weight of the connection between entities. The classic choice for this metric is usually a distance measure or a similarity measure based on the euclidean norm. We claim that in some cases the euclidean norm on the initial vectorial space might not be the more appropriate to solve the task efficiently. We propose an algorithm that aims at learning the most appropriate vectorial representation for building a graph on which the task at hand is solved efficiently.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 14:04:55 GMT  (268kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05789v1", "Pre-submission ICLR 2016"], ["v2", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 21:58:32 GMT  (446kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05789v2", "Pre-submission ICLR 2016"], ["v3", "Fri, 27 Nov 2015 14:03:22 GMT  (465kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05789v3", "Pre-submission ICLR 2016"], ["v4", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 21:41:36 GMT  (445kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05789v4", "Pre-submission ICLR 2016"], ["v5", "Tue, 19 Jan 2016 20:59:03 GMT  (1015kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05789v5", "Pre-submission ICLR 2016"], ["v6", "Thu, 18 Feb 2016 15:53:01 GMT  (62kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05789v6", "Workshop track submission ICLR 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Pre-submission ICLR 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["pauline wauquier", "mikaela keller"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.05789"}
