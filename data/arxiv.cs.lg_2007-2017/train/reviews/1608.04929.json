For several RL problems in operation research and optimal control, the optimal policy of the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP) is characterized by a known structure. The current state of the art algorithms do not utilize this known structure of the optimal policy while minimizing regret. In this work, we develop new RL algorithms that exploit the structure of the optimal policy to minimize regret. Numerical experiments on MDPs with structured optimal policies show that our algorithms have better performance, are easy to implement, have a smaller run-time and require less number of random number generations.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 17 Aug 2016 11:35:32 GMT  (55kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04929v1", "An extended abstract appears in AAMAS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "An extended abstract appears in AAMAS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["k j prabuchandran", "tejas bodas", "theja tulabandhula"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.04929"}
