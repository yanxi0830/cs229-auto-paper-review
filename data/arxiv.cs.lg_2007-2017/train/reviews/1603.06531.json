We amalgamate autoencoder and predictor architectures using an adaptive weighting scheme coping with a reduced size labeled dataset, while enriching our models from enormous unlabeled sets. We further improve robustness to lighting conditions by introducing a new adaptive filer based on temporal local scale normalization. We provide superior results over known methods, including recent reported approaches based on neural nets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 21 Mar 2016 18:33:29 GMT  (2032kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06531v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["otkrist gupta", "dan raviv", "ramesh raskar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.06531"}
