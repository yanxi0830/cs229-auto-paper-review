We show a large gap between the adversarial and the stochastic cases. In the adversarial case, we prove that even for dense feedback graphs, the learner cannot improve upon a trivial regret bound obtained by ignoring any additional feedback besides her own loss. In contrast, in the stochastic case we give an algorithm that achieves $\\widetilde \\Theta(\\sqrt{\\alpha T})$ regret over $T$ rounds, provided that the independence numbers of the hidden feedback graphs are at most $\\alpha$. We also extend our results to a more general feedback model, in which the learner does not necessarily observe her own loss, and show that, even in simple cases, concealing the feedback graphs might render a learnable problem unlearnable.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 23 May 2016 14:07:43 GMT  (42kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07018v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["alon cohen", "tamir hazan", "tomer koren"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.07018"}
