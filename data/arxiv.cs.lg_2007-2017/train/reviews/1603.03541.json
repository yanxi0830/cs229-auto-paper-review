{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "11-Mar-2016", "title": "Watch-n-Patch: Unsupervised Learning of Actions and Relations", "abstract": "There is a large variation in the activities that humans perform in their everyday lives. We consider modeling these composite human activities which comprises multiple basic level actions in a completely unsupervised setting. Our model learns high-level co-occurrence and temporal relations between the actions. We consider the video as a sequence of short-term action clips, which contains human-words and object-words. An activity is about a set of action-topics and object-topics indicating which actions are present and which objects are interacting with. We then propose a new probabilistic model relating the words and the topics. It allows us to model long-range action relations that commonly exist in the composite activities, which is challenging in previous works. We apply our model to the unsupervised action segmentation and clustering, and to a novel application that detects forgotten actions, which we call action patching. For evaluation, we contribute a new challenging RGB-D activity video dataset recorded by the new Kinect v2, which contains several human daily activities as compositions of multiple actions interacting with different objects. Moreover, we develop a robotic system that watches people and reminds people by applying our action patching algorithm. Our robotic setup can be easily deployed on any assistive robot.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Mar 2016 07:13:59 GMT  (8276kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03541v1", "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1512.04208"]], "COMMENTS": "arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1512.04208", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO", "authors": ["chenxia wu", "jiemi zhang", "ozan sener", "bart selman", "silvio savarese", "ashutosh saxena"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.03541"}
