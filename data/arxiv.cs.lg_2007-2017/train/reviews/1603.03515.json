This problem has recently gained a lot of interest in automated science and adversarial reverse engineering for which only heuristic algorithms are known. In such applications, queries can be constructed de novo to elicit information (e.g., automated science) or to evade detection with minimal cost (e.g., adversarial reverse engineering).", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Mar 2016 04:18:48 GMT  (7790kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03515v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 12 Nov 2016 17:39:47 GMT  (6921kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03515v2", "Accepted by AAAI 2017"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.IT cs.LG math.IT", "authors": ["lin chen 0003", "seyed hamed hassani", "amin karbasi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1603.03515"}
