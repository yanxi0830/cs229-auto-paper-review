In this work we formulate the navigation question as a reinforcement learning problem and show that data efficiency and task performance can be dramatically improved by relying on additional auxiliary tasks to bootstrap learning. In particular we consider jointly learning the goal-driven reinforcement learning problem with an unsupervised depth prediction task and a self-supervised loop closure classification task. Using this approach we can learn to navigate from raw sensory input in complicated 3D mazes, approaching human-level performance even under conditions where the goal location changes frequently. We provide detailed analysis of the agent behaviour, its ability to localise, and its network activity dynamics. We then show that the agent implicitly learns key navigation abilities, through reinforcement learning with sparse rewards and without direct supervision.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 11 Nov 2016 12:14:45 GMT  (1910kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03673v1", "10 pages, 2 appendix pages, 8 figures, under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"], ["v2", "Wed, 30 Nov 2016 18:02:53 GMT  (2992kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03673v2", "11 pages, 3 appendix pages, 9 figures, under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"], ["v3", "Fri, 13 Jan 2017 11:15:22 GMT  (5943kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.03673v3", "11 pages, 5 appendix pages, 11 figures, 3 tables, under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 2 appendix pages, 8 figures, under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO", "authors": ["piotr mirowski", "razvan pascanu", "fabio viola", "hubert soyer", "rew j ballard", "rea banino", "misha denil", "ross goroshin", "laurent sifre", "koray kavukcuoglu", "dharshan kumaran", "raia hadsell"], "accepted": true, "id": "1611.03673"}
