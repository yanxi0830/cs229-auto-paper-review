A language-independent, multi-stage classification approach is employed for detection of key acoustic events which then act as a platform for summarization of highlight scenes. Objective results and human experience indicate that our system is highly efficient.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 18 Sep 2015 12:47:09 GMT  (536kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06279v1", "IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (IEEE ICCE 2015)"]], "COMMENTS": "IEEE International Conference on Consumer Electronics (IEEE ICCE 2015)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["anant baijal", "jaeyoun cho", "woojung lee", "byeong-seob ko"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.06279"}
