We identify different feature representations of oriented objects, and energies that lead a network to learn this representations. The choice of the representation is crucial since the pose of an object has a natural, continuous structure while its category is a discrete variable. We evaluate the different approaches on the joint object detection and pose estimation task of the Pascal3D+ benchmark using Average Viewpoint Precision. We show that a classification approach on discretized viewpoints achieves state-of-the-art performance for joint object detection and pose estimation, and significantly outperforms existing baselines on this benchmark.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 22:26:26 GMT  (61kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7190v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 2 Jan 2015 16:43:41 GMT  (61kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7190v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 7 Feb 2015 05:27:24 GMT  (65kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7190v3", null], ["v4", "Sat, 28 Feb 2015 05:15:45 GMT  (71kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7190v4", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["francisco massa", "mathieu aubry", "renaud marlet"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.7190"}
