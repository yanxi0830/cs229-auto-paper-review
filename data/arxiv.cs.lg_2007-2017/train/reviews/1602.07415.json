To speed up Gibbs sampling, there has recently been interest in parallelizing it by executing asynchronously. While empirical results suggest that many models can be efficiently sampled asynchronously, traditional Markov chain analysis does not apply to the asynchronous case, and thus asynchronous Gibbs sampling is poorly understood. In this paper, we derive a better understanding of the two main challenges of asynchronous Gibbs: sampling bias and mixing time. We show experimentally that our theoretical results match practical outcomes.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 24 Feb 2016 06:54:43 GMT  (57kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07415v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 30 May 2016 21:19:52 GMT  (58kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07415v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 16 Jun 2016 20:55:19 GMT  (58kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07415v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["christopher de sa", "christopher r\u00e9", "kunle olukotun"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.07415"}
