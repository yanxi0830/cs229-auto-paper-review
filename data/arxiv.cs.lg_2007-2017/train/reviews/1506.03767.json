In this work, we demonstrate that, beyond its advantages for efficient computation, the spectral domain also provides a powerful representation in which to model and train convolutional neural networks (CNNs).", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 11 Jun 2015 18:23:18 GMT  (3263kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03767v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["oren rippel", "jasper snoek", "ryan p adams"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.03767"}
