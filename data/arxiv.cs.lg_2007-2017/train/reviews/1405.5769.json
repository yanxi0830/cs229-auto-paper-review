It has been shown that these networks still work well when they are applied to datasets or recognition tasks different from those they were trained on. However, descriptors like SIFT are not only used in recognition but also for many correspondence problems that rely on descriptor matching. In this paper we compare features from various layers of convolutional neural nets to standard SIFT descriptors. We consider a network that was trained on ImageNet and another one that was trained without supervision. Surprisingly, convolutional neural networks clearly outperform SIFT on descriptor matching.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 22 May 2014 14:35:52 GMT  (2824kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5769v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 24 Jun 2015 09:16:28 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5769v2", "This paper has been merged witharXiv:1406.6909"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["philipp fischer", "alexey dosovitskiy", "thomas brox"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.5769"}
