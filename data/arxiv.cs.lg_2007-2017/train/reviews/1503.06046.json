However, the signal processing implemented by the brain to perform cocktail party listening is not well understood. Here, we trained two separate convolutive autoencoder deep neural networks (DNN) to separate monaural and binaural mixtures of two concurrent speech streams. We then used these DNNs as convolutive deep transform (CDT) devices to perform probabilistic re-synthesis. The CDTs operated directly in the time-domain. Our simulations demonstrate that very simple neural networks are capable of exploiting monaural and binaural information available in a cocktail party listening scenario.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Mar 2015 12:00:44 GMT  (5232kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.06046v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.SD cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["andrew j r simpson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.06046"}
