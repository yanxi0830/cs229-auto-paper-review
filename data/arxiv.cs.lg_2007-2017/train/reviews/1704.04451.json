Consequently, most approaches optimize objectives only indirectly related to the end goal, resulting in suboptimal performance. Instead, we propose a differentiable relaxation that lends itself to gradient-based optimisation, thus bypassing the need for reinforcement learning or heuristic modification of cross-entropy. We show that by modifying the training objective of a competitive neural coreference system, we obtain a substantial gain in performance. This suggests that our approach can be regarded as a viable alternative to using reinforcement learning or more computationally expensive imitation learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 14 Apr 2017 15:22:51 GMT  (80kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04451v1", "10 pages"], ["v2", "Mon, 17 Apr 2017 08:30:32 GMT  (81kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04451v2", "10 pages"], ["v3", "Thu, 22 Jun 2017 07:55:47 GMT  (85kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04451v3", "10 pages.
