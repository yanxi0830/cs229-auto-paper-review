To scale up these methods, we extend the celebrated Random Fourier Feature methodology to get an approximation of operator-valued kernels. We propose a general principle for Operator-valued Random Fourier Feature construction relying on a generalization of Bochner's theorem for translation-invariant operator-valued Mercer kernels. We prove the uniform convergence of the kernel approximation for bounded and unbounded operator random Fourier features using appropriate Bernstein matrix concentration inequality. An experimental proof-of-concept shows the quality of the approximation and the efficiency of the corresponding linear models on example datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 9 May 2016 11:36:40 GMT  (383kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02536v1", "32 pages, 6 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 23 May 2016 16:35:41 GMT  (383kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02536v2", "32 pages, 6 figures"], ["v3", "Tue, 24 May 2016 12:59:58 GMT  (383kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02536v3", "32 pages, 6 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "32 pages, 6 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["romain brault", "florence d'alch\\'e-buc", "markus heinonen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.02536"}
