{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Feb-2012", "title": "Finding a most biased coin with fewest flips", "abstract": "We study the problem of learning the most biased coin among a set of coins by tossing the coins adaptively. The goal is to minimize the number of tosses to identify a coin i* such that prob{coin i* is most biased} is at least 1-\\delta\\ for any given \\delta&gt;0. Under a particular probabilistic model, we give an optimal algorithm, i.e., an algorithm that minimizes the expected number of tosses, to learn a most biased coin. The problem is equivalent to finding the best arm in the multi-armed bandit problem using adaptive strategies. Dar et al. (2002) and Mannor and Tsitsiklis (2004) show upper and lower bounds matching up to constant factors on the number of coin tosses for several underlying settings of the bias probabilities. For a class of such settings we bridge the constant factor gap by giving an optimal adaptive strategy -- a strategy that performs the best possible action under any given history of outcomes. For any given history, tossing the coin chosen by our strategy minimizes the expected number of tosses needed to learn a most biased coin. To our knowledge, this is the first algorithm that employs an optimal adaptive strategy under a Bayesian setting for this problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 16 Feb 2012 16:40:56 GMT  (67kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3639v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 13 Aug 2012 14:53:35 GMT  (69kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3639v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 7 Sep 2013 17:09:32 GMT  (71kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3639v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["karthekeyan chandrasekaran", "richard karp"], "accepted": false, "id": "1202.3639"}
