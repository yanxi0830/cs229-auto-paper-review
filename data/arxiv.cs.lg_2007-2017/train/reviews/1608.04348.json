We propose in this paper a fast real-time streaming version of the PDA algorithm for anomaly detection and classification that exploits the computational advantages of partial differential equation (PDE) continuum limits. We prove convergence rates for the continuum approximations and present the results of numerical experiments.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 15 Aug 2016 18:03:51 GMT  (1860kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04348v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 15 Mar 2017 19:50:07 GMT  (1844kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04348v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.DB", "authors": ["bilal abbasi", "jeff calder", "adam m oberman"], "accepted": false, "id": "1608.04348"}
