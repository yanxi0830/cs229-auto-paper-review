We develop a novel characterization of a large class of minimax algorithms, recovering, and even improving, several previous results as immediate corollaries. Moreover, using our tools, we develop an algorithm that provides a regret bound of $\\mathcal{O}\\Big(U \\sqrt{T \\log(U \\sqrt{T} \\log^2 T +1)}\\Big)$ where $U$ is the $L_2$ norm of a comparator, and both $T$ and $U$ are unknown to the player. This bound is optimal up to $\\sqrt{\\log \\log T}$ terms. When $T$ is known, we derive an algorithm with an optimal regret bound (up to constant factors). For both the known and unknown $T$ case, a Normal approximation to the conditional value of the game proves to be the key analysis tool.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 3 Mar 2014 23:06:24 GMT  (23kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0628v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 21 May 2014 16:17:09 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0628v2", "Proceedings of the 27th Annual Conference on Learning Theory (COLT 2014)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["h brendan mcmahan", "francesco orabona"], "accepted": false, "id": "1403.0628"}
