In this paper, we take a first step towards bridging this gap, by developing flavors of competitive Hebbian learning which produce sparse, distributed neural codes using online adaptation with minimal tuning. We propose an unsupervised algorithm, termed Adaptive Hebbian Learning (AHL). We illustrate the distributed nature of the learned representations via output entropy computations for synthetic data, and demonstrate superior performance, compared to standard alternatives such as autoencoders, in training a deep convolutional net on standard image datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Nov 2016 02:28:13 GMT  (1453kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.04228v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["aseem wadhwa", "upamanyu madhow"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.04228"}
