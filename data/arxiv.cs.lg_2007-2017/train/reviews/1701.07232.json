In this paper, we show how to automate the generation of an input grammar suitable for input fuzzing using sample inputs and neural-network-based statistical machine-learning techniques. We present a detailed case study with a complex input format, namely PDF, and a large complex security-critical parser for this format, namely, the PDF parser embedded in Microsoft's new Edge browser. We discuss (and measure) the tension between conflicting learning and fuzzing goals: learning wants to capture the structure of well-formed inputs, while fuzzing wants to break that structure in order to cover unexpected code paths and find bugs. We also present a new algorithm for this learn&amp;fuzz challenge which uses a learnt input probability distribution to intelligently guide where to fuzz inputs.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 Jan 2017 10:01:39 GMT  (422kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07232v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.CR cs.LG cs.PL cs.SE", "authors": ["patrice godefroid", "hila peleg", "rishabh singh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.07232"}
