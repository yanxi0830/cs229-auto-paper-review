Formal approaches to understanding this problem focus on statistical inference and generalization of individual analysis procedures. Yet the practice of data analysis is an inherently interactive and adaptive process: new analyses and hypotheses are proposed after seeing the results of previous ones, parameters are tuned on the basis of obtained results, and datasets are shared and reused. An investigation of this gap has recently been initiated by the authors in (Dwork et al., 2014), where we focused on the problem of estimating expectations of adaptively chosen functions.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 19:34:29 GMT  (58kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02629v1", null], ["v2", "Fri, 25 Sep 2015 19:04:32 GMT  (67kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02629v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["cynthia dwork", "vitaly feldman", "moritz hardt", "toniann pitassi", "omer reingold", "aaron roth"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.02629"}
