Although they can be extracted from range data however extracting them from images and videos would be extremely beneficial. We trained a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify occlusion edges in images and videos with both RGB-D and RGB inputs. The use of CNN avoids hand-crafting of features for automatically isolating occlusion edges and distinguishing them from appearance edges. Other than quantitative occlusion edge detection results, qualitative results are provided to demonstrate the trade-off between high resolution analysis and frame-level computation time which is critical for real-time robotics applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 14:55:17 GMT  (3012kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7007v1", "9 pages, v1"], ["v2", "Wed, 24 Dec 2014 12:50:48 GMT  (3012kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7007v2", "9 pages, v2, spellcheck"], ["v3", "Wed, 8 Jul 2015 01:07:23 GMT  (3011kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7007v3", "7 pages, double column, IEEE HPEC 2015 Conference"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, v1", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["soumik sarkar", "vivek venugopalan", "kishore reddy", "michael giering", "julian ryde", "navdeep jaitly"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.7007"}
