{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Nov-2014", "title": "No-Regret Learnability for Piecewise Linear Losses", "abstract": "In the convex optimization approach to online regret minimization, many methods have been developed to guarantee a $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for subdifferentiable convex loss functions with bounded subgradients by means of a reduction to bounded linear loss functions. This suggests that the latter tend to be the hardest loss functions to learn against. We investigate this question in a systematic fashion by establishing $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ lower bounds on the minimum achievable regret for a class of piecewise linear loss functions that subsumes the class of bounded linear loss functions. These results hold in a completely adversarial setting. In contrast, we show that the minimum achievable regret can be significantly smaller when the opponent is greedy.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 20 Nov 2014 19:38:11 GMT  (50kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5649v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 7 Jan 2015 01:41:37 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5649v2", null], ["v3", "Thu, 8 Jan 2015 08:40:58 GMT  (57kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5649v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 27 May 2016 21:29:52 GMT  (23kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5649v4", null], ["v5", "Sat, 17 Sep 2016 16:14:50 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5649v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["arthur flajolet", "patrick jaillet"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.5649"}
