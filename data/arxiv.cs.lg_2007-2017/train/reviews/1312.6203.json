In this paper we consider possible generalizations of CNNs to signals defined on more general domains without the action of a translation group. In particular, we propose two constructions, one based upon a hierarchical clustering of the domain, and another based on the spectrum of the graph Laplacian. We show through experiments that for low-dimensional graphs it is possible to learn convolutional layers with $O(1)$ parameters, resulting in efficient deep architectures.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 21 Dec 2013 04:25:53 GMT  (1303kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6203v1", "11 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 20 Feb 2014 23:23:06 GMT  (1782kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6203v2", "14 pages"], ["v3", "Wed, 21 May 2014 16:27:09 GMT  (1782kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6203v3", "14 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["joan bruna", "wojciech zaremba", "arthur szlam", "yann lecun"], "accepted": true, "id": "1312.6203"}
