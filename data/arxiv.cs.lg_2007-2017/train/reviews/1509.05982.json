To remedy this, we introduce a method to train an autoencoder using only noisy data, having examples with and without the signal class of interest. The autoencoder learns a partitioned representation of signal and noise, learning to reconstruct each separately. We illustrate the method by denoising birdsong audio (available abundantly in uncontrolled noisy datasets) using a convolutional autoencoder.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 20 Sep 2015 09:03:48 GMT  (1112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05982v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 22 Sep 2015 20:51:05 GMT  (1112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05982v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["dan stowell", "richard e turner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.05982"}
