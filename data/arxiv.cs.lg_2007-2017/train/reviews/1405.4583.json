However, minimizing such energies is challenging. None of existing techniques (such as s-t graph cut, QPBO, BP and TRW-S) can individually do this well. In this paper, we present an efficient method, namely ESSP, to optimize binary MRFs with arbitrary pairwise potentials, which could be nonsubmodular and with dense connectivity. We also provide a comparative study of our approach and several recent promising methods. From our study, we make some reasonable recommendations of combining existing methods that perform the best in different situations for this challenging problem. Experimental results validate that for dense and nonsubmodular energy functions, the proposed approach can usually obtain lower energies than the best combination of other techniques using comparably reasonable time.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 19 May 2014 03:06:14 GMT  (432kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4583v1", "9 pages, 11 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 11 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["wei feng", "jiaya jia", "zhi-qiang liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1405.4583"}
