Our result characterizes the convergence behavior of the algorithm when a large amount noise is introduced after each matrix-vector multiplication. While interesting in its own right, our main motivation comes from the problem of privacy-preserving spectral analysis where noise is added in order to achieve the privacy guarantee known as differential privacy. Our contributions here are twofold:", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Nov 2013 16:47:25 GMT  (22kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2495v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 15 Sep 2014 19:17:32 GMT  (26kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2495v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 8 Dec 2014 21:53:05 GMT  (26kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2495v3", "NIPS 2014"], ["v4", "Tue, 3 Feb 2015 23:43:37 GMT  (27kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2495v4", "NIPS 2014"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DS cs.LG", "authors": ["moritz hardt", "eric price"], "accepted": true, "id": "1311.2495"}
