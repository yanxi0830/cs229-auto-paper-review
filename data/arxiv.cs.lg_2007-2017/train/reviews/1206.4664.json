This has implications to a number of methods recently proposed based on this representation. As an example application we use our tighter representation to derive a general f-divergence estimator based on two i.i.d. samples and derive the dual program for this estimator that performs well empirically. We also point out a connection between our estimator and MMD.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jun 2012 15:31:13 GMT  (503kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4664v1", "ICML2012"]], "COMMENTS": "ICML2012", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["avraham ruderman", "mark d reid", "dario garc\u00eda-garc\u00eda", "james petterson"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.4664"}
