However, compared to the conventional Gaussian mixture models(GMMs), DNN-based acoustic models usually have much larger number of model parameters, making it challenging for their applications in resource constrained platforms, e.g. mobile devices. In this paper, we study the application of the recently proposed highway network to train small-footprint DNNs, which are thinner and deeper and have significantly smaller number of model parameters compared to conventional DNNs. We investigated this approach on the AMI meeting speech transcription corpus which has around 70 hours of audio data. The highway neural networks constantly outperformed their plain DNN counterparts, and the number of model parameters can be reduced significantly without sacrificing the recognition accuracy.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 14 Dec 2015 12:29:32 GMT  (86kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04280v1", "5 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 3 Mar 2016 12:14:06 GMT  (110kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04280v2", "5 pages, 3 figures"], ["v3", "Mon, 20 Jun 2016 10:30:54 GMT  (110kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04280v3", "5 pages, 3 figures, accepted by Interspeech 2016"], ["v4", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 15:17:27 GMT  (110kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04280v4", "5 pages, 3 figures, fixed typo, accepted by Interspeech 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["liang lu", "steve renals"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.04280"}
