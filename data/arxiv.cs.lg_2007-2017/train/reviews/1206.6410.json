In particular, we provide a novel framework for approximating and bounding the partition function using MAP inference on randomly perturbed models. As a result, we can use efficient MAP solvers such as graph-cuts to evaluate the corresponding partition function. We show that our method excels in the typical \"high signal - high coupling\" regime that results in ragged energy landscapes difficult for alternative approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (420kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6410v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["tamir hazan", "tommi s jaakkola"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6410"}
