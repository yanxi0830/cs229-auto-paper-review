In this model, the algorithm is allowed to observed noisy realizations of the function value $f(x)$ at any query point $x \\in \\xset$. The quantity of interest is regret of the algorithm, which is the sum of the function values at algorithm's query points minus the optimal function value. We demonstrate a generalization of the ellipsoid algorithm that incurs $\\otil(\\poly(d)\\sqrt{T})$ regret. Since any algorithm has regret at least $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ on this problem, our algorithm is optimal in terms of the scaling with $T$.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 8 Jul 2011 22:18:05 GMT  (525kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1744v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 8 Oct 2011 06:06:43 GMT  (526kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1744v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.OC cs.LG cs.SY", "authors": ["alekh agarwal", "dean p foster", "daniel j hsu", "sham m kakade", "alexander rakhlin"], "accepted": true, "id": "1107.1744"}
