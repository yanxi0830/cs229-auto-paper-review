For example, a hospital may wish to use a cloud service to predict the readmission risk of a patient. However, due to regulations, the patient's medical files cannot be revealed. The goal is to make an inference using the model, without jeopardizing the accuracy of the prediction or the privacy of the data.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Dec 2014 23:38:54 GMT  (82kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6181v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 24 Dec 2014 06:16:14 GMT  (82kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6181v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR cs.NE", "authors": ["pengtao xie", "misha bilenko", "tom finley", "ran gilad-bachrach", "kristin lauter", "michael naehrig"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.6181"}
