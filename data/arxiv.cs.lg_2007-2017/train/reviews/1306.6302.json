Focusing on this subclass, we present a new symbolic planning algorithm which is the first algorithm that has explicit performance guarantees for relational MDPs with exogenous events. In particular, under some technical conditions, our planning algorithm provides a monotonic lower bound on the optimal value function. To support this algorithm we present novel evaluation and reduction techniques for generalized first order decision diagrams, a knowledge representation for real-valued functions over relational world states. Our planning algorithm uses a set of focus states, which serves as a training set, to simplify and approximate the symbolic solution, and can thus be seen to perform learning for planning. A preliminary experimental evaluation demonstrates the validity of our approach.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Jun 2013 17:59:49 GMT  (1022kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6302v1", "This is an extended version of our ECML/PKDD 2013 paper including all proofs"], ["v2", "Thu, 27 Jun 2013 13:57:19 GMT  (1022kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6302v2", "This is an extended version of our ECML/PKDD 2013 paper including all proofs.
