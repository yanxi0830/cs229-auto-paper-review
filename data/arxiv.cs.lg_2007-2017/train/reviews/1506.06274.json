We developed a patch-based multi-class classification algorithm, and an iterative approach to improve the accuracy. We achieved state-of-the-art performance on pose estimation task.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 Jun 2015 17:55:49 GMT  (3131kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06274v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.RO", "authors": ["chuiwen ma", "hao su", "liang shi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.06274"}
