{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "5-Jun-2016", "title": "Deep Q-Networks for Accelerating the Training of Deep Neural Networks", "abstract": "In this paper, we show that by feeding the weights of a deep neural network (DNN) during training into a deep Q-network (DQN) as its states, this DQN can learn policies to accelerate the training of that DNN. The actions of the DQN modify different hyperparameters during training. Empirically, this acceleration leads to better generalization performance of the DNN.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 5 Jun 2016 06:42:56 GMT  (352kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01467v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 8 Jun 2016 17:02:49 GMT  (380kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01467v2", null], ["v3", "Mon, 1 Aug 2016 14:17:18 GMT  (254kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01467v3", null], ["v4", "Sun, 16 Oct 2016 04:20:25 GMT  (42kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01467v4", null], ["v5", "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 05:27:02 GMT  (318kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01467v5", null], ["v6", "Fri, 11 Nov 2016 06:22:25 GMT  (313kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01467v6", null], ["v7", "Thu, 17 Nov 2016 06:16:24 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01467v7", "This paper has been withdrawn by the author due to a crucial error in the source-code (the epsilon configuration), which makes the results invalid"], ["v8", "Tue, 20 Jun 2017 10:28:34 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01467v8", "The DQN itself has too many hyperparameters"], ["v9", "Wed, 12 Jul 2017 12:29:29 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01467v9", "We choose to withdraw this paper.
