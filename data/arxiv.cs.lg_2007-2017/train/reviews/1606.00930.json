We followed the Demsar analysis and found that the three best classifiers (random forest, gbm and RBF SVM) are not significantly different from each other. We also discuss that a change of less then 0.0112 in the error rate should be considered as an irrelevant change, and used a Bayesian ANOVA analysis to conclude that with high probability the differences between these three classifiers is not of practical consequence. We also verified the execution time of \"standard implementations\" of these algorithms and concluded that RBF SVM is the fastest (significantly so) both in training time and in training plus testing time.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 23:01:25 GMT  (61kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00930v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["jacques wainer"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.00930"}
