{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "9-Sep-2014", "title": "A Stochastic PCA and SVD Algorithm with an Exponential Convergence Rate", "abstract": "We describe and analyze a simple algorithm for principal component analysis, VR-PCA, which uses computationally cheap stochastic iterations, yet converges exponentially fast to the optimal solution. In contrast, existing algorithms suffer either from slow convergence, or computationally intensive iterations whose runtime scales with the data size. The algorithm builds on a recent variance-reduced stochastic gradient technique, which was previously analyzed for strongly convex optimization, whereas here we apply it to the non-convex PCA problem, using a very different analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 9 Sep 2014 19:31:52 GMT  (28kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2848v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 25 Jan 2015 08:28:03 GMT  (32kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2848v2", "Some improvements and additions to previous version"], ["v3", "Sun, 19 Apr 2015 14:19:08 GMT  (36kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2848v3", "Some improvements and additions to previous version; fixed bug in proof of lemma 1"], ["v4", "Sun, 26 Apr 2015 12:20:12 GMT  (36kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2848v4", null], ["v5", "Fri, 31 Jul 2015 04:41:42 GMT  (36kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.2848v5", "Fixed a minor bug in the proof of lemma 1 (which does not affect the result)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NA math.OC stat.ML", "authors": ["ohad shamir"], "accepted": true, "id": "1409.2848"}
