They lead in the development of many specialized algorithms looking for one or more particular footprints under specific settings. Naturally, the performance of such algorithms are not perfect, and accordingly the provided output might be noisy, inaccurate and only partially correct. Furthermore, a forged image in practical scenarios is often the result of utilizing several tools available by image-processing software systems. Therefore, reliable tamper detection requires developing more poweful tools to deal with various tempering scenarios. Fusion of forgery detection tools based on Fuzzy Inference System has been used before for addressing this problem. Adjusting the membership functions and defining proper fuzzy rules for attaining to better results are time-consuming processes. This can be accounted as main disadvantage of fuzzy inference systems. In this paper, a Neuro-Fuzzy inference system for fusion of forgery detection tools is developed. The neural network characteristic of these systems provides appropriate tool for automatically adjusting the membership functions. Moreover, initial fuzzy inference system is generated based on fuzzy clustering techniques. The proposed framework is implemented and validated on a benchmark image splicing data set in which three forgery detection tools are fused based on adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy inference system. The outcome of the proposed method reveals that applying Neuro Fuzzy inference systems could be a better approach for fusion of forgery detection tools.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 29 Jan 2017 13:19:07 GMT  (812kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08374v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["habib ghaffari hadigheh", "ghazali bin sulong"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08374"}
