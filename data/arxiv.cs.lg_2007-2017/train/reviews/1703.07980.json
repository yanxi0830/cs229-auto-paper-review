However, recent research results demonstrated that combining the separated phases in a unified framework and training them jointly can achieve a better performance. In this paper, we first introduce fully convolutional auto-encoders for image feature learning and then propose a unified clustering framework to learn image representations and cluster centers jointly based on a fully convolutional auto-encoder and soft $k$-means scores. At initial stages of the learning procedure, the representations extracted from the auto-encoder may not be very discriminative for latter clustering. We address this issue by adopting a boosted discriminative distribution, where high score assignments are highlighted and low score ones are de-emphasized. With the gradually boosted discrimination, clustering assignment scores are discriminated and cluster purities are enlarged. Experiments on several vision benchmark datasets show that our methods can achieve a state-of-the-art performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 23 Mar 2017 09:49:37 GMT  (2983kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07980v1", "27 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "27 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["fengfu li", "hong qiao", "bo zhang", "xuanyang xi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.07980"}
