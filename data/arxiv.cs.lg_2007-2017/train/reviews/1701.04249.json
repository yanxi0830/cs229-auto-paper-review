{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Jan-2017", "title": "Geometric features for voxel-based surface recognition", "abstract": "We introduce a library of geometric voxel features for CAD surface recognition/retrieval tasks. Our features include local versions of the intrinsic volumes (the usual 3D volume, surface area, integrated mean and Gaussian curvature) and a few closely related quantities. We also compute Haar wavelet and statistical distribution features by aggregating raw voxel features. We apply our features to object classification on the ESB data set and demonstrate accurate results with a small number of shallow decision trees.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 16 Jan 2017 11:30:31 GMT  (578kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.04249v1", "13 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["dmitry yarotsky"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.04249"}
