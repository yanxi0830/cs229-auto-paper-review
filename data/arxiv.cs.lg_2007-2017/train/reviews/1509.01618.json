Applicability of DPPs to large sets of data is, however, hindered by the expensive matrix operations involved, especially when sampling. We therefore propose a new efficient approximate two-stage sampling algorithm for discrete k-DPPs. As opposed to previous approximations, our algorithm aims at minimizing the variational distance to the original distribution. Experiments indicate that the resulting sampling algorithm works well on large data and yields more accurate samples than previous approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 4 Sep 2015 21:38:17 GMT  (140kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01618v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 28 May 2016 00:37:56 GMT  (176kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01618v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["chengtao li", "stefanie jegelka", "suvrit sra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.01618"}
