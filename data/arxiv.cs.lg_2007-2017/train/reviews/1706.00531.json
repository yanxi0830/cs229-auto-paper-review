We show that different priors result in different decompositions of information between the latent code and the autoregressive decoder. For example, by imposing a Gaussian distribution as the prior, we can achieve a global vs. local decomposition, or by imposing a categorical distribution as the prior, we can disentangle the style and content information of images in an unsupervised fashion. We further show how the PixelGAN autoencoder with a categorical prior can be directly used in semi-supervised settings and achieve competitive semi-supervised classification results on the MNIST, SVHN and NORB datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Jun 2017 00:53:14 GMT  (6379kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00531v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["alireza makhzani", "brendan frey"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.00531"}
