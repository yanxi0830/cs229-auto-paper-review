{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "26-Nov-2016", "title": "Visual Dialog", "abstract": "We introduce the task of Visual Dialog, which requires an AI agent to hold a meaningful dialog with humans in natural, conversational language about visual content. Specifically, given an image, a dialog history, and a question about the image, the agent has to ground the question in image, infer context from history, and answer the question accurately. Visual Dialog is disentangled enough from a specific downstream task so as to serve as a general test of machine intelligence, while being grounded in vision enough to allow objective evaluation of individual responses and benchmark progress. We develop a novel two-person chat data-collection protocol to curate a large-scale Visual Dialog dataset (VisDial). Data collection is underway and on completion, VisDial will contain 1 dialog with 10 question-answer pairs on all ~200k images from COCO, with a total of 2M dialog question-answer pairs.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 26 Nov 2016 06:39:28 GMT  (6982kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08669v1", "22 pages, 16 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 5 Dec 2016 02:00:49 GMT  (6982kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08669v2", "22 pages, 17 figures, Webpage:this http URL"], ["v3", "Fri, 21 Apr 2017 16:29:55 GMT  (9069kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08669v3", "22 pages, 17 figures, Webpage:this http URL"], ["v4", "Mon, 24 Apr 2017 02:10:49 GMT  (9069kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08669v4", "23 pages, 18 figures, CVPR 2017 camera-ready, results on VisDial v0.9 dataset, Webpage:this http URL"], ["v5", "Tue, 1 Aug 2017 22:04:37 GMT  (9068kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08669v5", "23 pages, 18 figures, CVPR 2017 camera-ready, results on VisDial v0.9 dataset, Webpage:this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages, 16 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.AI cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["abhishek das", "satwik kottur", "khushi gupta", "avi singh", "deshraj yadav", "jos\\'e m f moura", "devi parikh", "dhruv batra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1611.08669"}
