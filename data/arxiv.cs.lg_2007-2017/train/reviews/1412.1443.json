We first observe that the notoriously difficult problem of learning parities with noise can be captured as a special case of learning graphical models. This leads to an unconditional computational lower bound of $\\Omega (p^{d/2})$ for learning general graphical models on $p$ nodes of maximum degree $d$, for the class of so-called statistical algorithms recently introduced by Feldman et al (2013). The lower bound suggests that the $O(p^d)$ runtime required to exhaustively search over neighborhoods cannot be significantly improved without restricting the class of models.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 3 Dec 2014 19:08:55 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1443v1", "15 pages.
