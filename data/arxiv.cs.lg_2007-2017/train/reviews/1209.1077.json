By establishing a precise connection between optimal transport metrics, optimal quantization, and learning theory, we derive new probabilistic bounds for the performance of a classic algorithm in unsupervised learning (k-means), when used to produce a probability measure derived from the data. In the course of the analysis, we arrive at new lower bounds, as well as probabilistic upper bounds on the convergence rate of the empirical law of large numbers, which, unlike existing bounds, are applicable to a wide class of measures.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 5 Sep 2012 19:10:09 GMT  (521kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.1077v1", "13 pages, 2 figures.
