Specifically, we provide means for drawing either approximate or unbiased samples from Gibbs' distributions by introducing low dimensional perturbations and solving the corresponding MAP assignments. Our approach also leads to new ways to derive lower bounds on partition functions. We demonstrate empirically that our method excels in the typical \"high signal - high coupling\" regime. The setting results in ragged energy landscapes that are challenging for alternative approaches to sampling and/or lower bounds.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 29 Sep 2013 13:48:52 GMT  (1769kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.7598v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["tamir hazan", "subhransu maji", "tommi s jaakkola"], "accepted": true, "id": "1309.7598"}
