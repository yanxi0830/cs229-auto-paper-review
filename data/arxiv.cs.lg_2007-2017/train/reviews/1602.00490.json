This includes video titles classification of non HTTP adaptive streams (non-HAS). This paper presents an algorithm for \\emph{encrypted HTTP adaptive video streaming title classification}. We evaluated our algorithm on a new YouTube popular videos dataset that was collected from the internet under real-world network conditions. We provide the dataset and the crawler for future research. Our algorithm's classification accuracy is 98\\%.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 1 Feb 2016 12:15:27 GMT  (696kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00490v1", "9 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1602.00489"], ["v2", "Thu, 21 Jul 2016 06:42:01 GMT  (317kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00490v2", "9 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1602.00489"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap witharXiv:1602.00489", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.MM cs.LG cs.NI", "authors": ["ran dubin", "amit dvir", "ofir pele", "ofer hadar"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.00490"}
