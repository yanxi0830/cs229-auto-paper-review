However, music auto-tagging is distinguished from image classification in that the tags are highly diverse and have different levels of abstractions. Considering this issue, we propose a convolutional neural networks (CNN)-based architecture that embraces multi-level and multi-scaled features. The architecture is trained in three steps. First, we conduct supervised feature learning to capture local audio features using a set of CNNs with different input sizes. Second, we extract audio features from each layer of the pre-trained convolutional networks separately and aggregate them altogether given a long audio clip. Finally, we put them into fully-connected networks and make final predictions of the tags. Our experiments show that using the combination of multi-level and multi-scale features is highly effective in music auto-tagging and the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-arts on the Magnatagatune dataset and the million song dataset. We further show that the proposed architecture is useful in transfer learning.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 09:57:25 GMT  (2332kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01793v1", "5 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables"], ["v2", "Wed, 7 Jun 2017 17:21:04 GMT  (2434kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01793v2", "5 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG cs.MM cs.SD", "authors": ["jongpil lee", "juhan nam"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.01793"}
