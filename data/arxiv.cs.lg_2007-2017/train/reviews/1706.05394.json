{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "16-Jun-2017", "title": "A Closer Look at Memorization in Deep Networks", "abstract": "We examine the role of memorization in deep learning, drawing connections to capacity, generalization, and adversarial robustness. While deep networks are capable of memorizing noise data, our results suggest that they tend to prioritize learning simple patterns first. In our experiments, we expose qualitative differences in gradient-based optimization of deep neural networks (DNNs) on noise vs. real data. We also demonstrate that for appropriately tuned explicit regularization (e.g., dropout) we can degrade DNN training performance on noise datasets without compromising generalization on real data. Our analysis suggests that the notions of effective capacity which are dataset independent are unlikely to explain the generalization performance of deep networks when trained with gradient based methods because training data itself plays an important role in determining the degree of memorization.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Jun 2017 18:11:09 GMT  (8495kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05394v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2017), Devansh Arpit, Stanis{\\l}aw Jastrz\\k{e}bski, Nicolas Ballas, and David Krueger contributed equally to this work"], ["v2", "Sat, 1 Jul 2017 14:26:51 GMT  (8495kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05394v2", "Appears in Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2017), Devansh Arpit, Stanis{\\l}aw Jastrz\\k{e}bski, Nicolas Ballas, and David Krueger contributed equally to this work"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2017), Devansh Arpit, Stanis{\\l}aw Jastrz\\k{e}bski, Nicolas Ballas, and David Krueger contributed equally to this work", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["devansh arpit", "stanislaw k jastrzebski", "nicolas ballas", "david krueger", "emmanuel bengio", "maxinder s kanwal", "tegan maharaj", "asja fischer", "aaron c courville", "yoshua bengio", "simon lacoste-julien"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.05394"}
