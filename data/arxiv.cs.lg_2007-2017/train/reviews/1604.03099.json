Our approach uses finite truth-valued {\\L}ukasiewicz logic, wherein every connective can be defined by a neuron in an artificial network. This allowed the injection of first-order formulas into a network architecture, and also simplified symbolic rule extraction. For that we trained a neural networks using the Levenderg-Marquardt algorithm, where we restricted the knowledge dissemination in the network structure. This procedure reduces neural network plasticity without drastically damaging the learning performance, thus making the descriptive power of produced neural networks similar to the descriptive power of {\\L}ukasiewicz logic language and simplifying the translation between symbolic and connectionist structures. We used this method for reverse engineering truth table and in extraction of formulas from real data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Apr 2016 05:17:09 GMT  (16kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03099v1", "15 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1604.02780,arXiv:1604.02774"]], "COMMENTS": "15 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1604.02780,arXiv:1604.02774", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["carlos leandro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.03099"}
