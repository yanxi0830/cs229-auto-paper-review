In this study, two classification techniques, the J48 implementation of the C4.5 algorithm and a Naive Bayes classifier are applied to predict lung cancer survivability from an extensive data set with fifteen years of patient records. The purpose of the project is to verify the predictive effectiveness of the two techniques on real, historical data. Besides the performance outcome that renders J48 marginally better than the Naive Bayes technique, there is a detailed description of the data and the required pre-processing activities. The performance results confirm expectations while some of the issues that appeared during experimentation, underscore the value of having domain-specific understanding to leverage any domain-specific characteristics inherent in the data.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 6 Jun 2012 04:56:47 GMT  (597kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1121v1", "9 pages, 3 figures, 9 tables"], ["v2", "Sat, 1 Sep 2012 07:40:47 GMT  (603kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1121v2", "9 pages, 3 figures, 9 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages, 3 figures, 9 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["george dimitoglou", "james a adams", "carol m jim"], "accepted": false, "id": "1206.1121"}
