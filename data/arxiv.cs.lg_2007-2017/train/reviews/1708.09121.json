The problem requires two major data mining challenges to be addressed simultaneously: Learning models that are human-interpretable and mining of heterogeneous multivariate time series data. The intersection of these two areas is not adequately explored in the existing literature. To address this gap, we propose grammar-based decision trees and an algorithm for learning them. Grammar-based decision tree extends decision trees with a grammar framework. Logical expressions, derived from context-free grammar, are used for branching in place of simple thresholds on attributes. The added expressivity enables support for a wide range of data types while retaining the interpretability of decision trees. By choosing a grammar based on temporal logic, we show that grammar-based decision trees can be used for the interpretable classification of high-dimensional and heterogeneous time series data. In addition to classification, we show how grammar-based decision trees can also be used for categorization, which is a combination of clustering and generating interpretable explanations for each cluster. We apply grammar-based decision trees to analyze the classic Australian Sign Language dataset as well as categorize and explain near mid-air collisions to support the development of a prototype aircraft collision avoidance system.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 Aug 2017 05:21:26 GMT  (5015kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.09121v1", "10 pages, 7 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 7 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["ritchie lee", "mykel j kochenderfer", "ole j mengshoel", "joshua silbermann"], "accepted": false, "id": "1708.09121"}
