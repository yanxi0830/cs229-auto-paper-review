The core technique is to boost the confidence of recent $O(d / n)$ bounds, without sacrificing the rate, by leveraging a Bernstein-type condition which holds due to exp-concavity. This Bernstein-type condition implies that the variance of excess loss random variables are controlled in terms of their excess risk. Using this variance control, we further show that a regret bound for any online learner in this setting translates to a high probability excess risk bound for the corresponding online-to-batch conversion of the online learner.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 May 2016 14:22:59 GMT  (15kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01288v1", "13 pages"], ["v2", "Mon, 23 May 2016 09:15:28 GMT  (18kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01288v2", "13 pages, wider margins than previous version"], ["v3", "Thu, 18 Aug 2016 13:52:47 GMT  (18kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01288v3", "improved log(1/delta)^2 to log(1/delta) in main result"], ["v4", "Fri, 14 Oct 2016 15:24:08 GMT  (23kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01288v4", "added results on model selection aggregation (Section 7)"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["nishant a mehta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.01288"}
