In general, the ranking of $n$ objects can be identified by standard sorting methods using $n log_2 n$ pairwise comparisons. We are interested in natural situations in which relationships among the objects may allow for ranking using far fewer pairwise comparisons. Specifically, we assume that the objects can be embedded into a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space and that the rankings reflect their relative distances from a common reference point in $R^d$. We show that under this assumption the number of possible rankings grows like $n^{2d}$ and demonstrate an algorithm that can identify a randomly selected ranking using just slightly more than $d log n$ adaptively selected pairwise comparisons, on average. If instead the comparisons are chosen at random, then almost all pairwise comparisons must be made in order to identify any ranking. In addition, we propose a robust, error-tolerant algorithm that only requires that the pairwise comparisons are probably correct. Experimental studies with synthetic and real datasets support the conclusions of our theoretical analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Sep 2011 19:35:13 GMT  (212kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.3701v1", "13 pages, an extended version of our accepted paper with the same title that will appear at NIPS 2011"], ["v2", "Sat, 10 Dec 2011 01:02:14 GMT  (216kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1109.3701v2", "17 pages, an extended version of our NIPS 2011 paper.
