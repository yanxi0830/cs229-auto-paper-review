Our model benefits from a partial sampling scheme and is conceptually simple, yet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Chinese Discourse Treebank. We also visualize its attention activity to illustrate the model's ability to selectively focus on the relevant parts of an input sequence.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 26 Apr 2017 13:10:12 GMT  (198kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08092v1", "To appear at ACL2017, code available atthis https URL"]], "COMMENTS": "To appear at ACL2017, code available atthis https URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["samuel r\u00f6nnqvist", "niko schenk", "christian chiarcos"], "accepted": true, "id": "1704.08092"}
