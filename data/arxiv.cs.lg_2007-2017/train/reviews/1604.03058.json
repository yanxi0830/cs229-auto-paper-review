With a moderate size network of 10 layers, we obtained top-5 classification accuracy rate of 81 percent on validation set which is much better than previous published results. We expect training networks of a much better performance through increase network depth would be straight forward by following our current strategies. A detailed discussion on strategies used in the network training is included as well as preliminary analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 11 Apr 2016 18:39:33 GMT  (471kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03058v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 13 Apr 2016 03:22:37 GMT  (0kb,I)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03058v2", "More testing and verification is needed"], ["v3", "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 15:25:06 GMT  (430kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03058v3", "Updated with new results"], ["v4", "Tue, 8 Nov 2016 00:38:03 GMT  (512kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03058v4", null], ["v5", "Sat, 19 Nov 2016 01:37:40 GMT  (512kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03058v5", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["xundong wu", "yong wu", "yong zhao"], "accepted": false, "id": "1604.03058"}
