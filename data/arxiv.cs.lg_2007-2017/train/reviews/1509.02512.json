We evaluate the performance of our system on 14 healthy volunteers and compare it to that of other cough detection systems that have been reported in the literature. Experimental results show that our system achieves a classification sensitivity of 95.1% and a specificity of 99.5%.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 8 Sep 2015 19:59:19 GMT  (528kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02512v1", "BioCAS-2015"]], "COMMENTS": "BioCAS-2015", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["justice amoh", "kofi odame"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.02512"}
