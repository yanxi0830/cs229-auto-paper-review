In this work, we propose holographic embeddings (HolE) to learn compositional vector space representations of entire knowledge graphs. The proposed method is related to holographic models of associative memory in that it employs circular correlation to create compositional representations. By using correlation as the compositional operator HolE can capture rich interactions but simultaneously remains efficient to compute, easy to train, and scalable to very large datasets. In extensive experiments we show that holographic embeddings are able to outperform state-of-the-art methods for link prediction in knowledge graphs and relational learning benchmark datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 16 Oct 2015 16:29:07 GMT  (32kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04935v1", null], ["v2", "Mon, 7 Dec 2015 18:05:52 GMT  (29kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.04935v2", "To appear in AAAI-16"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["maximilian nickel", "lorenzo rosasco", "tomaso a poggio"], "accepted": true, "id": "1510.04935"}
