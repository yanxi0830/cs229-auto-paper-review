We study the effect of size and depth and train models of up to 8 layers. We investigate the training aspect and study different variants of optimization methods, batching, truncated backpropagation, different regularization techniques such as dropout and $L_2$ regularization, and different gradient clipping variants.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 22 Jun 2016 10:00:14 GMT  (38kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06871v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 29 Mar 2017 08:08:29 GMT  (30kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06871v2", "published on ICASSP 2017 conference, New Orleans, USA"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.CL cs.LG cs.SD", "authors": ["albert zeyer", "patrick doetsch", "paul voigtlaender", "ralf schl\\\"uter", "hermann ney"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.06871"}
