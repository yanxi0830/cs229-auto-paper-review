Here, we introduce a Perpetual Learning Machine; a new type of DNN that is capable of brain-like dynamic 'on the fly' learning because it exists in a self-supervised state of Perpetual Stochastic Gradient Descent. Thus, we provide the means to unify learning and memory within a machine learning framework.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Sep 2015 01:30:29 GMT  (473kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00913v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 8 Sep 2015 07:54:41 GMT  (467kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00913v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 29 Sep 2015 16:57:42 GMT  (590kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00913v3", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["andrew j r simpson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.00913"}
