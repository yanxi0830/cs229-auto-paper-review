We defined the 10 visemes based on vowel by analyzing of Korean utterance and proposed the method of extracting the 20-dimensional visual feature vector, combination of static features and dynamic features. Lastly, we took an experiment in recognizing words based on 3-viseme HMM and evaluated the efficiency.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 15 Nov 2014 05:44:10 GMT  (166kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.4114v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["ha jong won", "li gwang chol", "kim hyok chol", "li kum song"], "accepted": false, "id": "1411.4114"}
