This paper develops a simple and efficient chattering algorithm that learns near optimal decision policies through an open-loop feedback strategy. The optimal control problem reduces to a series of linear optimization programs that can be easily solved to recover a relaxed optimal trajectory. This algorithm is implemented on a real-time enterprise scheduling and control process.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 19 Mar 2017 18:25:52 GMT  (678kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06485v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["peeyush kumar", "wolf kohn", "zelda b zabinsky"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.06485"}
