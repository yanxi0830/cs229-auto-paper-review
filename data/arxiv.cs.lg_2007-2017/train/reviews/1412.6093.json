However, these architectures do not always adequately consider the temporal dependencies in data. We thus propose a new generic architecture called the Deep Belief Network - Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (DBN-BLSTM) network that models sequences by keeping track of the temporal information while enabling deep representations in the data. We demonstrate the generality of this new architecture by applying it to the generative task of music generation and obtain state-of-the-art results.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 18 Dec 2014 11:04:59 GMT  (251kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6093v1", "5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, ICLR 2015 submission under review"], ["v2", "Tue, 23 Dec 2014 18:44:33 GMT  (400kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6093v2", "6 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, ICLR 2015 conference track submission under review"]], "COMMENTS": "5 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, ICLR 2015 submission under review", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["kratarth goel", "raunaq vohra"], "accepted": false, "id": "1412.6093"}
