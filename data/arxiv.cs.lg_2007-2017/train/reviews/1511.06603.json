In this paper, a novel Exponential Natural Particle Filter (xNPF) is introduced to solve the above problems. In this approach, a state transitional probability with the use of natural gradient learning is proposed which balances exploration and exploitation more robustly. The results show that xNPF converges much closer to the true target states than the other state of the art particle filter.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 20 Nov 2015 14:08:33 GMT  (846kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06603v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE cs.RO", "authors": ["ghazal zand", "mojtaba taherkhani", "reza safabakhsh"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06603"}
