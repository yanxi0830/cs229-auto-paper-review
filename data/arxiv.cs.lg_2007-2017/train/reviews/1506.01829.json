We consider linear classifiers and propose to learn a prior over the space of labels to directly leverage the performance of such methods. This prior takes the form of a quadratic function of the labels and permits to encode both attractive and repulsive relations between labels. We cast this problem as a structured prediction one aiming at optimizing either the accuracies of the predictors or the F 1-score. This leads to an optimization problem closely related to the max-cut problem, which naturally leads to semidefinite and spectral relaxations. We show on standard datasets how such a general prior can improve the performances of multi-label techniques.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 5 Jun 2015 09:19:01 GMT  (18kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01829v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["r\\'emi lajugie", "piotr bojanowski", "sylvain arlot", "francis bach"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.01829"}
