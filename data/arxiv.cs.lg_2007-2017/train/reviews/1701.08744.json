Online advertising is a multi-billion-dollar industry and is growing every year with a rapid pace. The goal of this research is to enhance click through rate of the contextual advertisements using Linear Regression. In order to address this problem, a new technique propose in this paper to predict the CTR which will increase the overall revenue of the system by serving the advertisements more suitable to the viewers with the help of feature extraction and displaying the advertisements based on context of the publishers. The important steps include the data collection, feature extraction, CTR prediction and advertisement serving. The statistical results obtained from the dynamically used technique show an efficient outcome by fitting the data close to perfection for the LR technique using optimized feature selection.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Jan 2017 18:32:59 GMT  (829kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08744v1", "8 pages, 13 Figures, 11 Tables"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 13 Figures, 11 Tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IR cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["muhammad junaid effendi", "syed abbas ali"], "accepted": false, "id": "1701.08744"}
