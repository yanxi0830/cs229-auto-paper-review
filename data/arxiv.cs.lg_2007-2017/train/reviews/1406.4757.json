It is standard practice to use 1-NN with Euclidean or dynamic time warping (DTW) distance as a straw man for comparison. As part of a wider investigation into elastic distance measures for TSC~\\cite{lines14elastic}, we perform a series of experiments to test whether this standard practice is valid.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 18 Jun 2014 15:09:21 GMT  (117kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4757v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["anthony bagnall", "jason lines"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.4757"}
