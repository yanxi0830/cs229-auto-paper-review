To our knowledge, such loss functions have not been studied before in the area of property elicitation or in machine learning more broadly. As compared to traditional loss functions that take only a single data point, these multi-observation loss functions can in some cases drastically reduce the dimensionality of the hypothesis required. In elicitation, this corresponds to requiring many fewer reports; in empirical risk minimization, it corresponds to algorithms on a hypothesis space of much smaller dimension. We explore some examples of the tradeoff between dimensionality and number of observations, give some geometric characterizations and intuition for relating loss functions and the properties that they elicit, and discuss some implications for both elicitation and machine-learning contexts.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 Jun 2017 16:07:26 GMT  (2057kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01394v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["sebastian casalaina-martin", "rafael frongillo", "tom morgan", "bo waggoner"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.01394"}
