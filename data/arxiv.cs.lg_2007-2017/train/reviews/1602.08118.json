However, in practice, state of the art gradient descent based training methods are known to suffer from difficulties in learning long term dependencies. Here, we describe a novel training method that involves concurrent parallel cloned networks, each sharing the same weights, each trained at different stimulus phase and each maintaining independent activation histories. Training proceeds by recursively performing batch-updates over the parallel clones as activation history is progressively increased. This allows conflicts to propagate hierarchically from short-term contexts towards longer-term contexts until they are resolved. We illustrate the parallel clones method and hierarchical conflict propagation with a character-level deep RNN tasked with memorizing a paragraph of Moby Dick (by Herman Melville).", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Feb 2016 21:12:25 GMT  (841kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.08118v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["andrew j r simpson"], "accepted": false, "id": "1602.08118"}
