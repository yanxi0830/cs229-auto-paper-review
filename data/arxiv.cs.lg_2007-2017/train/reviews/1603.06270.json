Given a sequence of words, our model employs deep gated recurrent units on both character and word levels to encode morphology and context information, and applies a conditional random field layer to predict the tags. Our model is task independent, language independent, and feature engineering free. We further extend our model to multi-task and cross-lingual joint training by sharing the architecture and parameters. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in multiple languages on several benchmark tasks including POS tagging, chunking, and NER. We also demonstrate that multi-task and cross-lingual joint training can improve the performance in various cases.", "histories": [["v1", "Sun, 20 Mar 2016 21:15:56 GMT  (470kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06270v1", null], ["v2", "Tue, 9 Aug 2016 15:07:39 GMT  (470kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06270v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["zhilin yang", "ruslan salakhutdinov", "william cohen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.06270"}
