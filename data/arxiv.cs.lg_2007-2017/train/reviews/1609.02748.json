We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) for both aspect extraction and aspect-based sentiment analysis. We cast aspect extraction as a multi-label classification problem, outputting probabilities over aspects parameterized by a threshold. To determine the sentiment towards an aspect, we concatenate an aspect vector with every word embedding and apply a convolution over it. Our constrained system (unconstrained for English) achieves competitive results across all languages and domains, placing first or second in 5 and 7 out of 11 language-domain pairs for aspect category detection (slot 1) and sentiment polarity (slot 3) respectively, thereby demonstrating the viability of a deep learning-based approach for multilingual aspect-based sentiment analysis.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 9 Sep 2016 11:23:51 GMT  (98kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02748v1", "Published in Proceedings of SemEval-2016, 7 pages"], ["v2", "Thu, 22 Sep 2016 10:04:18 GMT  (98kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02748v2", "Published in Proceedings of SemEval-2016, 7 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "Published in Proceedings of SemEval-2016, 7 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["sebastian ruder", "parsa ghaffari", "john g breslin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1609.02748"}
