Like most numerical methods, they return point estimates. We construct a family of probabilistic numerical methods that instead return a Gauss-Markov process defining a probability distribution over the ODE solution. In contrast to prior work, we construct this family such that posterior means match the outputs of the Runge-Kutta family exactly, thus inheriting their proven good properties. Remaining degrees of freedom not identified by the match to Runge-Kutta are chosen such that the posterior probability measure fits the observed structure of the ODE. Our results shed light on the structure of Runge-Kutta solvers from a new direction, provide a richer, probabilistic output, have low computational cost, and raise new research questions.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 10 Jun 2014 15:13:24 GMT  (628kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2582v1", "18 pages (9 page conference paper, plus supplements)"], ["v2", "Fri, 24 Oct 2014 11:45:49 GMT  (866kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2582v2", "18 pages (9 page conference paper, plus supplements); appears in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS), 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "18 pages (9 page conference paper, plus supplements)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG cs.NA math.NA", "authors": ["michael schober", "david k duvenaud", "philipp hennig"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.2582"}
