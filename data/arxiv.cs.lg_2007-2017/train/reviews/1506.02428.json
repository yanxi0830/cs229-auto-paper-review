{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "8-Jun-2015", "title": "Robust Regression via Hard Thresholding", "abstract": "We study the problem of Robust Least Squares Regression (RLSR) where several response variables can be adversarially corrupted. More specifically, for a data matrix X \\in R^{p x n} and an underlying model w*, the response vector is generated as y = X'w* + b where b \\in R^n is the corruption vector supported over at most C.n coordinates. Existing exact recovery results for RLSR focus solely on L1-penalty based convex formulations and impose relatively strict model assumptions such as requiring the corruptions b to be selected independently of X.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 8 Jun 2015 10:13:53 GMT  (75kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02428v1", "24 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "24 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["kush bhatia", "prateek jain 0002", "purushottam kar"], "accepted": true, "id": "1506.02428"}
