The key challenge of this problem is how to learn a metric, such that the instances sharing the same label are more likely close to each other on the embedded space. However, little attention has been paid to learn better representations when the data lie on non-linear manifold. Fortunately, deep learning has led to great success on feature learning recently. Inspired by the advances of deep learning, we propose a deep transductive semi-supervised maximum margin clustering approach. More specifically, given pairwise constraints, we exploit both labeled and unlabeled data to learn a non-linear mapping under maximum margin framework for clustering analysis. Thus, our model unifies transductive learning, feature learning and maximum margin techniques in the semi-supervised clustering framework. We pretrain the deep network structure with restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) layer by layer greedily, and optimize our objective function with gradient descent. By checking the most violated constraints, our approach updates the model parameters through error backpropagation, in which deep features are learned automatically. The experimental results shows that our model is significantly better than the state of the art on semi-supervised clustering.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 26 Jan 2015 02:28:18 GMT  (58kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.06237v1", "14"]], "COMMENTS": "14", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["gang chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1501.06237"}
