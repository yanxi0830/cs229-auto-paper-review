{"conference": "iclr", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "20-Dec-2014", "title": "Discovering Hidden Factors of Variation in Deep Networks", "abstract": "We propose a method for learning latent representations of the factors of variation in data. By augmenting deep autoencoders with a supervised cost and an additional unsupervised cost, we create a semi-supervised model that can discover and explicitly represent factors of variation beyond those relevant for categorization. We use a novel unsupervised covariance penalty (XCov) to disentangle factors like handwriting style for digits and subject identity in faces. We demonstrate this on the MNIST handwritten digit database, the Toronto Faces Database (TFD) and the Multi-PIE dataset by generating manipulated instances of the data. Our model discovers additional high-level latent factors absent from the supervised signal.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 20 Dec 2014 02:52:03 GMT  (2795kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6583v1", "10 pages, 9 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 27 Feb 2015 20:41:40 GMT  (2798kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6583v2", "12 pages, 9 figures"], ["v3", "Fri, 17 Apr 2015 17:15:02 GMT  (2798kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6583v3", "12 pages, 9 figures"], ["v4", "Wed, 17 Jun 2015 06:47:48 GMT  (3042kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6583v4", "Presented at International Conference on Learning Representations 2015 Workshop"]], "COMMENTS": "10 pages, 9 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["brian cheung", "jesse a livezey", "arjun k bansal", "bruno a olshausen"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.6583"}
