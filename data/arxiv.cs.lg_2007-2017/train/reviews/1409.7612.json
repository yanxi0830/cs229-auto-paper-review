It has several advantages over supervised classification in natural language processing domain. For instance, supervised classification exploits only labeled data that are expensive, often difficult to get, inadequate in quantity, and require human experts for annotation. On the other hand, unlabeled data are inexpensive and abundant. Despite the fact that many factors limit the wide-spread use of semi-supervised classification, it has become popular since its level of performance is empirically as good as supervised classification. This study explores the possibilities and achievements as well as complexity and limitations of semi-supervised classification for several natural langue processing tasks like parsing, biomedical information processing, text classification, and summarization.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 25 Sep 2014 15:18:44 GMT  (549kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7612v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["rushdi shams"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.7612"}
