{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "23-Feb-2016", "title": "Search Improves Label for Active Learning", "abstract": "We investigate active learning with access to two distinct oracles: Label (which is standard) and Search (which is not). The Search oracle models the situation where a human searches a database to seed or counterexample an existing solution. Search is stronger than Label while being natural to implement in many situations. We show that an algorithm using both oracles can provide exponentially large problem-dependent improvements over Label alone.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 23 Feb 2016 19:05:09 GMT  (31kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07265v1", "22 pages"], ["v2", "Mon, 24 Oct 2016 06:29:08 GMT  (62kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07265v2", "32 pages; NIPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "22 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["alina beygelzimer", "daniel j hsu", "john langford", "chicheng zhang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.07265"}
