{"conference": "AAAI", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "15-Apr-2014", "title": "Optimizing the CVaR via Sampling", "abstract": "Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is a prominent risk measure that is being used extensively in various domains such as finance. In this work we present a new formula for the gradient of the CVaR in the form of a conditional expectation. Our result is similar to policy gradients in the reinforcement learning literature. Based on this formula, we propose novel sampling-based estimators for the CVaR gradient, and a corresponding gradient descent procedure for CVaR optimization. We evaluate our approach in learning a risk-sensitive controller for the game of Tetris, and propose an importance sampling procedure that is suitable for such domains.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Apr 2014 10:32:05 GMT  (79kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3862v1", null], ["v2", "Sun, 29 Jun 2014 15:35:36 GMT  (91kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3862v2", null], ["v3", "Tue, 16 Sep 2014 15:32:48 GMT  (97kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3862v3", null], ["v4", "Sat, 22 Nov 2014 14:44:54 GMT  (115kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3862v4", "To appear in AAAI 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["aviv tamar", "yonatan glassner", "shie mannor"], "accepted": true, "id": "1404.3862"}
