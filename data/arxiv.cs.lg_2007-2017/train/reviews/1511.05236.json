Unlike similar studies, this study considers networks where each layer may use different precision data. The key result of this study is that the tolerance of CNNs to reduced precision data not only varies across networks, a well established observation, but also within networks. Tuning precision per layer is appealing as it could enable energy and performance improvements. The trends of error tolerance across layers are studied and a method for finding a low precision configuration for a network while maintaining high accuracy is presented. A diverse set of CNNs is analyzed showing that compared to a conventional implementation using a 32-bit floating-point representation for all layers, and with less than 1% loss in relative accuracy, the data footprint required by these networks can be reduced by an average of 74% and up to 92%.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Nov 2015 01:03:03 GMT  (3577kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05236v1", "Submitted to ICLR 2016, 12 pages, 5 figures"], ["v2", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 20:38:17 GMT  (3653kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05236v2", "Submitted to ICLR 2016, 12 pages, 5 figures"], ["v3", "Wed, 2 Dec 2015 00:20:48 GMT  (3660kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05236v3", "Submitted to ICLR 2016, 12 pages, 5 figures"], ["v4", "Fri, 8 Jan 2016 07:22:41 GMT  (3666kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05236v4", "Submitted to ICLR 2016, 12 pages, 5 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to ICLR 2016, 12 pages, 5 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["patrick judd", "jorge albericio", "tayler hetherington", "tor aamodt", "natalie enright jerger", "raquel urtasun", "reas moshovos"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.05236"}
