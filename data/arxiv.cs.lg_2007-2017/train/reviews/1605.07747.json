{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "25-May-2016", "title": "NESTT: A Nonconvex Primal-Dual Splitting Method for Distributed and Stochastic Optimization", "abstract": "We study a stochastic and distributed algorithm for nonconvex problems whose objective consists of a sum of $N$ nonconvex $L_i/N$-smooth functions, plus a nonsmooth regularizer. The proposed NonconvEx primal-dual SpliTTing (NESTT) algorithm splits the problem into $N$ subproblems, and utilizes an augmented Lagrangian based primal-dual scheme to solve it in a distributed and stochastic manner. With a special non-uniform sampling, a version of NESTT achieves $\\epsilon$-stationary solution using $\\mathcal{O}((\\sum_{i=1}^N\\sqrt{L_i/N})^2/\\epsilon)$ gradient evaluations, which can be up to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ times better than the (proximal) gradient descent methods. It also achieves Q-linear convergence rate for nonconvex $\\ell_1$ penalized quadratic problems with polyhedral constraints. Further, we reveal a fundamental connection between {\\it primal-dual} based methods and a few {\\it primal only} methods such as IAG/SAG/SAGA.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 25 May 2016 06:42:51 GMT  (66kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07747v1", "35 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 7 Nov 2016 23:06:57 GMT  (70kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07747v2", "35 pages, 2 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "35 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "math.OC cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["davood hajinezhad", "mingyi hong", "tuo zhao", "zhaoran wang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.07747"}
