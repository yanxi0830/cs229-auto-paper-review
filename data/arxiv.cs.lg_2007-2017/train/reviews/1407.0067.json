{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "30-Jun-2014", "title": "Rates of Convergence for Nearest Neighbor Classification", "abstract": "Nearest neighbor methods are a popular class of nonparametric estimators with several desirable properties, such as adaptivity to different distance scales in different regions of space. Prior work on convergence rates for nearest neighbor classification has not fully reflected these subtle properties. We analyze the behavior of these estimators in metric spaces and provide finite-sample, distribution-dependent rates of convergence under minimal assumptions. As a by-product, we are able to establish the universal consistency of nearest neighbor in a broader range of data spaces than was previously known. We illustrate our upper and lower bounds by introducing smoothness classes that are customized for nearest neighbor classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 30 Jun 2014 22:00:57 GMT  (36kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0067v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 2 Jul 2014 00:44:29 GMT  (37kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.0067v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG math.ST stat.ML stat.TH", "authors": ["kamalika chaudhuri", "sanjoy dasgupta"], "accepted": true, "id": "1407.0067"}
