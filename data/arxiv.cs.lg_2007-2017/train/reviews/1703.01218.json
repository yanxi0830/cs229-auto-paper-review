We consider sparse linear influence games --- a parametric class of graphical games with linear payoffs, and represented by directed graphs of n nodes (players) and in-degree of at most k. We show that one can efficiently recover the PSNE set of a linear influence game with $O(k^2 \\log n)$ samples, under very general observation models. On the other hand, we show that $\\Omega(k \\log n)$ samples are necessary for any procedure to recover the PSNE set from observations of joint actions.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Mar 2017 15:55:16 GMT  (187kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.01218v1", "Accepted to AISTATS 2017, Florida. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1607.02959"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to AISTATS 2017, Florida. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap witharXiv:1607.02959", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["asish ghoshal", "jean honorio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1703.01218"}
