We propose a novel MIL formulation of multi-class semantic segmentation learning by a fully convolutional network. In this setting, we seek to learn a semantic segmentation model from just weak image-level labels. The model is trained end-to-end to jointly optimize the representation while disambiguating the pixel-image label assignment. Fully convolutional training accepts inputs of any size, eliminating the need for object proposals based pre-processing, and offers a pixelwise loss map for selecting latent instances. Our multi-class MIL loss exploits the further supervision given by images with multiple labels. We evaluate this approach through preliminary experiments on the PASCAL VOC 2011 segmentation data.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Dec 2014 20:49:54 GMT  (2090kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7144v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 24 Jan 2015 01:17:59 GMT  (2090kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7144v2", null], ["v3", "Sat, 7 Feb 2015 02:12:26 GMT  (2091kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7144v3", null], ["v4", "Wed, 15 Apr 2015 05:31:10 GMT  (2091kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7144v4", "in ICLR 2015"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["deepak pathak", "evan shelhamer", "jonathan long", "trevor darrell"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.7144"}
