It is of high interest in compressed sensing and statistical learning. This property is particularly important for computationally efficient recovery methods. As a consequence, even though it is in general NP-hard to check that RIP holds, there have been substantial efforts to find tractable proxies for it. These would allow the construction of RIP matrices and the polynomial-time verification of RIP given an arbitrary matrix. We consider the framework of average-case certifiers, that never wrongly declare that a matrix is RIP, while being often correct for random instances. While there are such functions which are tractable in a suboptimal parameter regime, we show that this is a computationally hard task in any better regime. Our results are based on a new, weaker assumption on the problem of detecting dense subgraphs.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 31 May 2016 14:38:03 GMT  (52kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.09646v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CC math.ST stat.ML stat.TH", "authors": ["tengyao wang", "quentin berthet", "yaniv plan"], "accepted": true, "id": "1605.09646"}
