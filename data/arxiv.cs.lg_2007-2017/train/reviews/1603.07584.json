An l1 regularization term enforces the sparsity constraint while we recover the sources of diffusion from a single snapshot of the diffusion process. The diffusion ker- nel is estimated by assuming the process to be as generic as the standard heat diffusion. We show with synthetic data that we can concomitantly learn the diffusion kernel and the sources, given an estimated initialization. We validate our model with cholera mortality and atmospheric tracer diffusion data, showing also that the accuracy of the solution depends on the construction of the graph from the data points.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 24 Mar 2016 14:15:17 GMT  (2851kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07584v1", null], ["v2", "Sat, 19 Nov 2016 08:56:13 GMT  (2797kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07584v2", "5 pages, 5 figures, published in \"Image, Video, and Multidimensional Signal Processing Workshop (IVMSP), 2016 IEEE 12th\""]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["rodrigo pena", "xavier bresson", "pierre vandergheynst"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.07584"}
