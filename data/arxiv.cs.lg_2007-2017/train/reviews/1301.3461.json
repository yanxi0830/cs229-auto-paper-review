The structured parameterization separately encodes variance that is shared between classes from variance that is private to each class by the introduction of a new prior. The approach allows for a more efficient inference and provides an intuitive interpretation of the data in terms of an informative signal together with structured noise. The factorized representation is shown to enhance inference performance for both image and text classification.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 15 Jan 2013 19:32:20 GMT  (1763kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3461v1", "11 pages include 2 appendix pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 16 Jan 2013 11:05:05 GMT  (1763kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3461v2", "11 pages include 2 appendix pages"], ["v3", "Thu, 24 Jan 2013 09:50:28 GMT  (1483kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3461v3", "11 pages include 2 appendix pages"], ["v4", "Thu, 7 Mar 2013 14:16:39 GMT  (1830kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3461v4", "11 pages include 2 appendix pages"], ["v5", "Fri, 15 Mar 2013 17:14:58 GMT  (2111kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3461v5", null], ["v6", "Wed, 10 Apr 2013 20:15:04 GMT  (1937kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3461v6", "ICLR 2013"], ["v7", "Tue, 23 Apr 2013 08:13:55 GMT  (1937kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3461v7", "ICLR 2013"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages include 2 appendix pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.IR", "authors": ["cheng zhang", "carl henrik ek", "andreas damianou", "hedvig kjellstrom"], "accepted": true, "id": "1301.3461"}
