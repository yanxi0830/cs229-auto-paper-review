The goal is to design an online learning algorithm with sublinear regret to the best sparse linear predictor in hindsight. Without any assumptions, this problem is known to be computationally intractable. In this paper, we make the assumption that data matrix satisfies restricted isometry property, and show that this assumption leads to computationally efficient algorithms with sublinear regret for two variants of the problem. In the first variant, the true label is generated according to a sparse linear model with additive Gaussian noise. In the second, the true label is chosen adversarially.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 14 Jun 2017 23:03:54 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04690v1", "Appearing in 34th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "Appearing in 34th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML), 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["satyen kale", "zohar s karnin", "tengyuan liang", "d\u00e1vid p\u00e1l"], "accepted": true, "id": "1706.04690"}
