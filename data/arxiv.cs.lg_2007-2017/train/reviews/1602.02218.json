{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "6-Feb-2016", "title": "Strongly-Typed Recurrent Neural Networks", "abstract": "Recurrent neural networks are increasing popular models for sequential learning. Unfortunately, although the most effective RNN architectures are perhaps excessively complicated, extensive searches have not found simpler alternatives. This paper imports ideas from physics and functional programming into RNN design to provide guiding principles. From physics we introduce type constraints, analogous to the constraints that disqualify adding meters to seconds in physics. From functional programming, we require that strongly-typed architectures factorize into stateless learnware and state-dependent firmware, thereby ameliorating the impact of side-effects. The features learned by strongly-typed nets have a simple semantic interpretation via dynamic average-pooling on one-dimensional convolutions. We also show that strongly-typed gradients are better behaved than in classical architectures, and characterize the representational power of strongly-typed nets. Finally, experiments show that, despite being more constrained, strongly-typed architectures achieve lower training error and comparable generalization error to classical architectures.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 6 Feb 2016 05:34:03 GMT  (25kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02218v1", "9 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 24 May 2016 21:35:23 GMT  (26kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02218v2", "10 pages, final version, ICML 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "9 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["david balduzzi", "muhammad ghifary"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.02218"}
