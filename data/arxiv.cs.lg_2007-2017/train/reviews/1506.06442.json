{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "22-Jun-2015", "title": "A Deep Memory-based Architecture for Sequence-to-Sequence Learning", "abstract": "We propose Neural Transformation Machine (NTram), a novel architecture for sequence-to-sequence learning, which performs the task through a series of nonlinear transformations from the representation of the input sequence (e.g., a Chinese sentence) to the final output sequence (e.g., translation to English). Inspired by the recent Neural Turing Machines [8], we store the intermediate representations in stacked layers of memories, and use read-write operations on the memories to realize the nonlinear transformations of those representations. Those transformations are designed in advance but the parameters are learned from data. Through layer-by-layer transformations, NTram can model complicated relations necessary for applications such as machine translation between distant languages. The architecture can be trained with normal back-propagation on parallel texts, and the learning can be easily scaled up to a large corpus. NTram is broad enough to subsume the state-of-the-art neural translation model in [2] as its special case, while significantly improves upon the model with its deeper architecture. Remarkably, NTram, being purely neural network-based, can achieve performance comparable to the traditional phrase-based machine translation system (Moses) with a small vocabulary and a modest parameter size.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 22 Jun 2015 02:12:54 GMT  (369kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06442v1", "12 pages"], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Nov 2015 13:55:44 GMT  (810kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06442v2", "12 pages, Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v3", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 14:23:34 GMT  (874kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06442v3", "12 pages, Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"], ["v4", "Thu, 7 Jan 2016 08:14:08 GMT  (901kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06442v4", "13 pages, Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "12 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["fandong meng", "zhengdong lu", "zhaopeng tu", "hang li", "qun liu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1506.06442"}
