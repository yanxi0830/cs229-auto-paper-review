A large set of city applications in the areas of Participating Urbanism, Augmented Reality and Sound-Mapping throughout participating cities is being applied, resulting into produced sets of millions of user-generated events and online SN reports fed into the RADICAL platform. Moreover, we study the application of data analytics such as sentiment analysis to the combined IoT and SN data saved into an SQL database, further investigating algorithmic and configurations to minimize delays in dataset processing and results retrieval.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 2 Jul 2016 13:35:02 GMT  (864kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00509v1", "Conference"]], "COMMENTS": "Conference", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CY cs.LG cs.SI", "authors": ["evangelos psomakelis", "fotis aisopos", "antonios litke", "konstantinos tserpes", "magdalini kardara", "pablo mart\\'inez campo"], "accepted": false, "id": "1607.00509"}
