We present an interleaved text/image deep learning system to extract and mine the semantic interactions of radiology images and reports from a national research hospital's Picture Archiving and Communication System. With natural language processing, we mine a collection of representative ~216K two-dimensional key images selected by clinicians for diagnostic reference, and match the images with their descriptions in an automated manner. Our system interleaves between unsupervised learning and supervised learning on document- and sentence-level text collections, to generate semantic labels and to predict them given an image. Given an image of a patient scan, semantic topics in radiology levels are predicted, and associated key-words are generated. Also, a number of frequent disease types are detected as present or absent, to provide more specific interpretation of a patient scan. This shows the potential of large-scale learning and prediction in electronic patient records available in most modern clinical institutions.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 4 May 2015 15:05:59 GMT  (28813kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00670v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["hoo-chang shin", "le lu", "lauren kim", "ari seff", "jianhua yao", "ronald m summers"], "accepted": false, "id": "1505.00670"}
