After providing some background information on information theory and Kolmogorov complexity, we provide a short explanation of Minimum Description Length and error minimization. We conclude with a discussion of the typical features of overfitting in model selection.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 13 May 2010 15:59:01 GMT  (78kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2364v1", "20 pages, from The Paradox of Overfitting, master's thesis, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, 2003"], ["v2", "Fri, 14 May 2010 11:28:03 GMT  (78kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2364v2", "20 pages, Chapter 1 of The Paradox of Overfitting, Master's thesis, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, 2003"]], "COMMENTS": "20 pages, from The Paradox of Overfitting, master's thesis, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen, 2003", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CC", "authors": ["volker nannen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1005.2364"}
