{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "17-Jun-2014", "title": "Self-Learning Camera: Autonomous Adaptation of Object Detectors to Unlabeled Video Streams", "abstract": "Learning object detectors requires massive amounts of labeled training samples from the specific data source of interest. This is impractical when dealing with many different sources (e.g., in camera networks), or constantly changing ones such as mobile cameras (e.g., in robotics or driving assistant systems). In this paper, we address the problem of self-learning detectors in an autonomous manner, i.e. (i) detectors continuously updating themselves to efficiently adapt to streaming data sources (contrary to transductive algorithms), (ii) without any labeled data strongly related to the target data stream (contrary to self-paced learning), and (iii) without manual intervention to set and update hyper-parameters. To that end, we propose an unsupervised, on-line, and self-tuning learning algorithm to optimize a multi-task learning convex objective. Our method uses confident but laconic oracles (high-precision but low-recall off-the-shelf generic detectors), and exploits the structure of the problem to jointly learn on-line an ensemble of instance-level trackers, from which we derive an adapted category-level object detector. Our approach is validated on real-world publicly available video object datasets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 17 Jun 2014 09:51:18 GMT  (1261kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4296v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 18 Jun 2014 12:33:22 GMT  (1261kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4296v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["adrien gaidon", "gloria zen", "jose a rodriguez-serrano"], "accepted": false, "id": "1406.4296"}
