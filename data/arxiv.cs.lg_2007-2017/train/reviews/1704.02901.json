In this work, we generalize the convolution operator from regular grids to arbitrary graphs while avoiding the spectral domain, which allows us to handle graphs of varying size and connectivity. To move beyond a simple diffusion, filter weights are conditioned on the specific edge labels in the neighborhood of a vertex. Together with the proper choice of graph coarsening, we explore constructing deep neural networks for graph classification. In particular, we demonstrate the generality of our formulation in point cloud classification, where we set the new state of the art, and on a graph classification dataset, where we outperform other deep learning approaches.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 10 Apr 2017 15:18:54 GMT  (218kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02901v1", "Accepted to CVPR 2017; extended version"], ["v2", "Sun, 6 Aug 2017 18:05:11 GMT  (218kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02901v2", "Accepted to CVPR 2017; extended version"], ["v3", "Tue, 8 Aug 2017 09:31:17 GMT  (218kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1704.02901v3", "Accepted to CVPR 2017; extended version"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted to CVPR 2017; extended version", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["martin simonovsky", "nikos komodakis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1704.02901"}
