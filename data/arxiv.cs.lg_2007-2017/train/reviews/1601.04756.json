Each data set is generated using a sampling technique applied on the original imbalanced data set. Five new sampling techniques are proposed in this paper (i.e., SMOTERandRep, Lax Random Oversampling, Lax Random Undersampling, Combined-Lax Random Oversampling Undersampling, and Combined-Lax Random Undersampling Oversampling) that were based on the three sampling techniques (i.e., Random Undersampling, Random Oversampling, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) usually used as solutions in imbalance learning. The metrics used to evaluate the classifier's performance were F-measure and G-mean. F-measure determines the performance of the classifier for every class, while G-mean measures the overall performance of the classifier. The results using F-measure showed that for the data without a sampling technique, the classifier's performance is good only for the majority class. It also showed that among the eight sampling techniques, RU and LRU have the worst performance while other techniques (i.e., RO, C-LRUO and C-LROU) performed well only on some classes. The best performing techniques in all data sets were SMOTE, SMOTERandRep, and LRO having the lowest F-measure values between 0.5 and 0.65. The results using G-mean showed that the oversampling technique that attained the highest G-mean value is LRO (0.86), next is C-LROU (0.85), then SMOTE (0.84) and finally is SMOTERandRep (0.83). Combining the result of the two metrics (F-measure and G-mean), only the three sampling techniques are considered as good performing (i.e., LRO, SMOTE, and SMOTERandRep).", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 18 Jan 2016 23:31:12 GMT  (429kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.04756v1", "7 pages, 10 figures, 16th Philippine Computing Science Congress (PCSC 2016)"]], "COMMENTS": "7 pages, 10 figures, 16th Philippine Computing Science Congress (PCSC 2016)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["maureen lyndel c lauron", "jaderick p pabico"], "accepted": false, "id": "1601.04756"}
