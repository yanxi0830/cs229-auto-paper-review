Traditional results dictate that for an algorithm to provably correctly recover the clusters, {\\em all} clusters must be sufficiently large (in particular, $\\tilde{\\Omega}(\\sqrt{n})$ where $n$ is the number of nodes of the graph). We show that this is not really a restriction: by a more refined analysis of the trace-norm based recovery approach proposed in Jalali et al. (2011) and Chen et al. (2012), we prove that small clusters, under certain mild assumptions, do not hinder recovery of large ones.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 19 Feb 2013 09:21:09 GMT  (57kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4549v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 20 Feb 2013 08:35:39 GMT  (56kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4549v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["nir ailon", "yudong chen", "huan xu"], "accepted": true, "id": "1302.4549"}
