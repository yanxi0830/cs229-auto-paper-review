We are given $n$ stochastic bandit arms. The $i$th arm has a reward distribution $D_i$ with an unknown mean $\\mu_i$. Upon each play of the $i$th arm, we can get a reward, sampled i.i.d. from $D_i$. We would like to identify the arm with largest mean with probability at least $1-\\delta$, using as few samples as possible. We also study an important special case where there are only two arms, which we call the sign problem. We achieve a very detailed understanding of the optimal sample complexity of sign, simplifying and significantly extending a classical result by Farrell in 1964, with a completely new proof. Using the new lower bound for sign, we obtain the first lower bound for BEST-1-ARM that goes beyond the classic Mannor-Tsitsiklis lower bound, by an interesting reduction from sign to BEST-1-ARM.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 12 Nov 2015 04:49:46 GMT  (51kb)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03774v1", "39 pages"], ["v2", "Fri, 13 Nov 2015 05:47:39 GMT  (51kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03774v2", "39 pages"], ["v3", "Tue, 23 Aug 2016 18:05:29 GMT  (63kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.03774v3", null]], "COMMENTS": "39 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.DS", "authors": ["lijie chen", "jian li"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.03774"}
