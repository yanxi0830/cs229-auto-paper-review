We show that, under a suitable parametrization of the problem, the optimal number of prediction mistakes can be characterized (up to logarithmic factors) by the cutsize of a random spanning tree of the graph. The cutsize is induced by the unknown adversarial labeling of the graph nodes. In deriving our characterization, we obtain a simple randomized algorithm achieving in expectation the optimal mistake bound on any polynomially connected weighted graph. Our algorithm draws a random spanning tree of the original graph and then predicts the nodes of this tree in constant expected amortized time and linear space. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method compares well to both global (Perceptron) and local (label propagation) methods, while being generally faster in practice.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 21 Dec 2012 23:51:21 GMT  (146kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.5637v1", "Appeared in ICML 2010"]], "COMMENTS": "Appeared in ICML 2010", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["nicol\u00f2 cesa-bianchi", "claudio gentile", "fabio vitale", "giovanni zappella"], "accepted": true, "id": "1212.5637"}
