While there are strong theoretical guarantees on the performance of Greedy for maximizing submodular functions, there are few guarantees for non-submodular ones. However, Greedy enjoys strong empirical performance for many important non-submodular functions, e.g., the Bayesian A-optimality objective in experimental design. We prove theoretical guarantees supporting the empirical performance. Our guarantees are characterized by the (generalized) submodularity ratio $\\gamma$ and the (generalized) curvature $\\alpha$. In particular, we prove that Greedy enjoys a tight approximation guarantee of $\\frac{1}{\\alpha}(1- e^{-\\gamma\\alpha})$ for cardinality constrained maximization. In addition, we bound the submodularity ratio and curvature for several important real-world objectives, e.g., the Bayesian A-optimality objective, the determinantal function of a square submatrix and certain linear programs with combinatorial constraints. We experimentally validate our theoretical findings for several real-world applications.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 6 Mar 2017 20:28:23 GMT  (355kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02100v1", "28 pages, 22 figures"], ["v2", "Wed, 19 Apr 2017 07:51:03 GMT  (355kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02100v2", "28 pages, 22 figures"], ["v3", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 08:22:12 GMT  (358kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.02100v3", "ICML 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "28 pages, 22 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DM cs.AI cs.DS cs.LG math.OC", "authors": ["andrew an bian", "joachim m buhmann", "andreas krause 0001", "sebastian tschiatschek"], "accepted": true, "id": "1703.02100"}
