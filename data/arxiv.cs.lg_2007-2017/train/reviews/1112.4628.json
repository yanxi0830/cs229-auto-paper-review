Chief among these is the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm. This paper investigates the use of ABC algorithm that simulates the intelligent foraging behaviour of a honey bee swarm. Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) trained with the standard back propagation algorithm normally utilises computationally intensive training algorithms. One of the crucial problems with the backpropagation (BP) algorithm is that it can sometimes yield the networks with suboptimal weights because of the presence of many local optima in the solution space. To overcome ABC algorithm used in this work to train MLP learning the complex behaviour of earthquake time series data trained by BP, the performance of MLP-ABC is benchmarked against MLP training with the standard BP. The experimental result shows that MLP-ABC performance is better than MLP-BP for time series data.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Dec 2011 09:50:53 GMT  (289kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4628v1", "8 pages,8 figures;this http URL"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages,8 figures;this http URL", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["habib shah", "rozaida ghazali", "nazri mohd nawi"], "accepted": false, "id": "1112.4628"}
