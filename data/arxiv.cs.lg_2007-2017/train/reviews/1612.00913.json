Conventional approaches aggregate separate models of natural language understanding (NLU) and system action prediction (SAP) as a pipeline that is sensitive to noisy outputs of error-prone NLU. To address the issues, we propose an end-to-end deep recurrent neural network with limited contextual dialogue memory by jointly training NLU and SAP on DSTC4 multi-domain human-human dialogues. Experiments show that our proposed model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art pipeline models for both NLU and SAP, which indicates that our joint model is capable of mitigating the affects of noisy NLU outputs, and NLU model can be refined by error flows backpropagating from the extra supervised signals of system actions.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 3 Dec 2016 02:13:18 GMT  (103kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00913v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 4 Jan 2017 08:39:09 GMT  (102kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00913v2", "Accepted in The 42nd IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP2017)"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG", "authors": ["xuesong yang", "yun-nung chen", "dilek hakkani-tur", "paul crook", "xiujun li", "jianfeng gao", "li deng"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.00913"}
