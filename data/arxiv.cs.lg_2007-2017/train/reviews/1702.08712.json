The main result of the paper bounds the generalization error of any learning algorithm in terms of its hypothesis stability. The bounds are based on martingale inequalities in the Banach space to which the hypotheses belong. We apply the general bounds to bound the performance of some learning algorithms based on empirical risk minimization and stochastic gradient descent.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 28 Feb 2017 09:39:03 GMT  (12kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08712v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 3 Aug 2017 11:45:15 GMT  (38kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.08712v2", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ML cs.LG", "authors": ["tongliang liu", "g\u00e1bor lugosi", "gergely neu", "dacheng tao"], "accepted": true, "id": "1702.08712"}
