{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "14-Jun-2014", "title": "From Stochastic Mixability to Fast Rates", "abstract": "Empirical risk minimization (ERM) is a fundamental algorithm for statistical learning problems where the data is generated according to some unknown distribution $\\mathsf{P}$ and returns a hypothesis $f$ chosen from a fixed class $\\mathcal{F}$ with small loss $\\ell$. In the parametric setting, depending upon $(\\ell, \\mathcal{F},\\mathsf{P})$ ERM can have slow $(1/\\sqrt{n})$ or fast $(1/n)$ rates of convergence of the excess risk as a function of the sample size $n$. There exist several results that give sufficient conditions for fast rates in terms of joint properties of $\\ell$, $\\mathcal{F}$, and $\\mathsf{P}$, such as the margin condition and the Bernstein condition. In the non-statistical prediction with experts setting, there is an analogous slow and fast rate phenomenon, and it is entirely characterized in terms of the mixability of the loss $\\ell$ (there being no role there for $\\mathcal{F}$ or $\\mathsf{P}$). The notion of stochastic mixability builds a bridge between these two models of learning, reducing to classical mixability in a special case. The present paper presents a direct proof of fast rates for ERM in terms of stochastic mixability of $(\\ell,\\mathcal{F}, \\mathsf{P})$, and in so doing provides new insight into the fast-rates phenomenon. The proof exploits an old result of Kemperman on the solution to the generalized moment problem. We also show a partial converse that suggests a characterization of fast rates for ERM in terms of stochastic mixability is possible.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 14 Jun 2014 23:25:05 GMT  (17kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3781v1", "13 pages"], ["v2", "Sat, 22 Nov 2014 11:16:28 GMT  (24kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3781v2", "21 pages, accepted to NIPS 2014"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["nishant a mehta", "robert c williamson"], "accepted": true, "id": "1406.3781"}
