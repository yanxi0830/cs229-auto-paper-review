To deal with these incomplete data, a new kernel function with asymmetric intrinsic mappings is proposed in this study. Such a new kernel uses three-side similarities for kernel matrix formation. The similarity between a test instance and a training sample relies on not only their distance but also the relation between this test sample and the centroid of the class, where the training sample belongs. This reduces biased estimation compared with typical methods when only one training sample is used for kernel matrix formation. Furthermore, the proposed kernel is capable of performing data imputation by using class-dependent averages. This enhances Fisher Discriminant Ratios and data discriminability. Experiments on two databases were carried out for evaluating the proposed method. The result indicated that the accuracy of the proposed method was higher than that of the baseline. These findings thereby demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed idea.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 25 Mar 2016 06:04:30 GMT  (1174kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07828v1", "8 pages, 11 figures"], ["v2", "Mon, 21 Nov 2016 14:20:34 GMT  (605kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07828v2", "Incomplete data analysis, partial similarity, multiside similarity, privacy preservation, kernel ridge regression (KRR), missing values, data imputation, kernel method, cloud computing, data analytics"]], "COMMENTS": "8 pages, 11 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR", "authors": ["bo-wei chen"], "accepted": false, "id": "1603.07828"}
