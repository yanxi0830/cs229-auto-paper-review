It has important applications in health informatics including pharmacovigilance and drug surveillance. The state of the art supervised machine learning models in this domain are based on Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with features calculated from fixed context windows. In this application, we explored various recurrent neural network frameworks and show that they significantly outperformed the CRF models.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 25 Jun 2016 19:46:28 GMT  (794kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07953v1", "In proceedings of NAACL HLT 2016"], ["v2", "Tue, 12 Jul 2016 17:10:38 GMT  (794kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07953v2", "In proceedings of NAACL HLT 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "In proceedings of NAACL HLT 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["abhyuday jagannatha", "hong yu"], "accepted": false, "id": "1606.07953"}
