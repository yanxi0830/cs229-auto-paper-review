Analyzing such data with probabilisic models can be delicate because the simple exchangeability assumptions underlying many boilerplate models no longer hold. In this paper, we describe a latent variable model of such data called the mixed membership stochastic blockmodel. This model extends blockmodels for relational data to ones which capture mixed membership latent relational structure, thus providing an object-specific low-dimensional representation. We develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate posterior inference. We explore applications to social and protein interaction networks.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 30 May 2007 23:22:59 GMT  (540kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4485v1", "46 pages, 14 figures, 3 tables"]], "COMMENTS": "46 pages, 14 figures, 3 tables", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ME cs.LG math.ST physics.soc-ph stat.ML stat.TH", "authors": ["edoardo m airoldi", "david m blei", "stephen e fienberg", "eric p xing"], "accepted": true, "id": "0705.4485"}
