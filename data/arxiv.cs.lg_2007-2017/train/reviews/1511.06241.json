Such reliance on large amounts of labeled data can be relaxed by exploiting hierarchical features via unsupervised learning techniques. In this work, we propose to train a deep convolutional network based on an enhanced version of the k-means clustering algorithm, which reduces the number of correlated parameters in the form of similar filters, and thus increases test categorization accuracy. We call our algorithm convolutional k-means clustering. We further show that learning the connection between the layers of a deep convolutional neural network improves its ability to be trained on a smaller amount of labeled data. Our experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other techniques that learn filters unsupervised. Specifically, we obtained a test accuracy of 74.1% on STL-10 and a test error of 1.4% on MNIST.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Nov 2015 16:31:46 GMT  (425kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06241v1", "11 pages"], ["v2", "Tue, 16 Feb 2016 16:46:53 GMT  (435kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06241v2", "11 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "11 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV", "authors": ["aysegul dundar", "jonghoon jin", "eugenio culurciello"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.06241"}
