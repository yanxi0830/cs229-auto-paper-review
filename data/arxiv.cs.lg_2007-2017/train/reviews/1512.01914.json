However, theoretical understanding of many aspects of it is still far from clear. In this paper, we studied the Rademacher complexity of both the asymptotic restricted Boltzmann machine and the practical implementation with single-step contrastive divergence (CD-1) procedure. Our results disclose the fact that practical implementation training procedure indeed increased the Rademacher complexity of restricted Boltzmann machines. A further research direction might be the investigation of the VC dimension of a compositional function used in the CD-1 procedure.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 7 Dec 2015 05:20:30 GMT  (9kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01914v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["xiao zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.01914"}
