Several neural networks are trained to modelize the value of rewards knowing the context. Two variants, based on multi-experts approach, are proposed to choose online the parameters of multi-layer perceptrons. The proposed algorithms are successfully tested on a large dataset with and without stationarity of rewards.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 29 Sep 2014 17:08:21 GMT  (36kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.8191v1", "21st International Conference on Neural Information Processing"]], "COMMENTS": "21st International Conference on Neural Information Processing", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.LG", "authors": ["robin allesiardo", "raphael feraud", "djallel bouneffouf"], "accepted": false, "id": "1409.8191"}
