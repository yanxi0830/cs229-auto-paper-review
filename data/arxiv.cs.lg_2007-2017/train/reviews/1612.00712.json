Probabilistic neural programs combine a computation graph for specifying a neural network with an operator for weighted nondeterministic choice. Thus, a program describes both a collection of decisions as well as the neural network architecture used to make each one. We evaluate our approach on a challenging diagram question answering task where probabilistic neural programs correctly execute nearly twice as many programs as a baseline model.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 2 Dec 2016 15:46:09 GMT  (763kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00712v1", "Appears in NAMPI workshop at NIPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in NAMPI workshop at NIPS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["kenton w murray", "jayant krishnamurthy"], "accepted": false, "id": "1612.00712"}
