{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "7-May-2016", "title": "Robust Dialog State Tracking for Large Ontologies", "abstract": "The Dialog State Tracking Challenge 4 (DSTC 4) differentiates itself from the previous three editions as follows: the number of slot-value pairs present in the ontology is much larger, no spoken language understanding output is given, and utterances are labeled at the subdialog level. This paper describes a novel dialog state tracking method designed to work robustly under these conditions, using elaborate string matching, coreference resolution tailored for dialogs and a few other improvements. The method can correctly identify many values that are not explicitly present in the utterance. On the final evaluation, our method came in first among 7 competing teams and 24 entries. The F1-score achieved by our method was 9 and 7 percentage points higher than that of the runner-up for the utterance-level evaluation and for the subdialog-level evaluation, respectively.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 7 May 2016 02:00:30 GMT  (594kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.02130v1", "Paper accepted at IWSDS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "Paper accepted at IWSDS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["franck dernoncourt", "ji young lee", "trung h bui", "hung h bui"], "accepted": false, "id": "1605.02130"}
