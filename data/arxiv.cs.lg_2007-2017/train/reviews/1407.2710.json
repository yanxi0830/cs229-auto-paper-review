In this work we introduce a new method in this class with a theoretical convergence rate four times faster than existing methods, for sums with sufficiently many terms. This method is also amendable to a sampling without replacement scheme that in practice gives further speed-ups. We give empirical results showing state of the art performance.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 10 Jul 2014 07:01:31 GMT  (570kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.2710v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["aaron defazio", "justin domke", "tib\u00e9rio s caetano"], "accepted": true, "id": "1407.2710"}
