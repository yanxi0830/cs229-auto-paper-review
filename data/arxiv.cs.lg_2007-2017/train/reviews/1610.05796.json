The privacy model is anatomization/fragmentation: the server sees data values, but the link between sensitive and identifying information is encrypted with a key known only to clients. Clients have limited processing and storage capability. Both sensitive and identifying information thus are stored on the server. The approach presented also retains most processing at the server, and client-side processing is amortized over predictions made by the clients. Experiments on various datasets show that the method produces decision trees approaching the accuracy of a non-private decision tree, while substantially reducing the client's computing resource requirements.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 18 Oct 2016 20:49:21 GMT  (1136kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.05796v1", "Presented in the Data Ethics Workshop at the 20th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining"]], "COMMENTS": "Presented in the Data Ethics Workshop at the 20th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CR cs.DB", "authors": ["koray mancuhan", "chris clifton"], "accepted": false, "id": "1610.05796"}
