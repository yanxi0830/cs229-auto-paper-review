{"conference": "ICML", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "10-Feb-2016", "title": "Conditional Dependence via Shannon Capacity: Axioms, Estimators and Applications", "abstract": "We conduct an axiomatic study of the problem of estimating the strength of a known causal relationship between a pair of variables. We propose that an estimate of causal strength should be based on the conditional distribution of the effect given the cause (and not on the driving distribution of the cause), and study dependence measures on conditional distributions. Shannon capacity, appropriately regularized, emerges as a natural measure under these axioms. We examine the problem of calculating Shannon capacity from the observed samples and propose a novel fixed-$k$ nearest neighbor estimator, and demonstrate its consistency. Finally, we demonstrate an application to single-cell flow-cytometry, where the proposed estimators significantly reduce sample complexity.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 10 Feb 2016 18:27:04 GMT  (89kb,D)", "https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03476v1", "41 pages, 3 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 12 Feb 2016 19:32:09 GMT  (89kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03476v2", "41 pages, 3 figures, typos fixed and references added"], ["v3", "Thu, 2 Jun 2016 15:55:46 GMT  (295kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.03476v3", "43 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "41 pages, 3 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.IT cs.LG math.IT stat.ML", "authors": ["weihao gao", "sreeram kannan", "sewoong oh", "pramod viswanath"], "accepted": true, "id": "1602.03476"}
