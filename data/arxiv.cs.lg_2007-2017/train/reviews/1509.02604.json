When the data size and/or the problem dimension is large, a distributed version of ADMM can be used, which is capable of distributing the computation load and the data set to a network of computing nodes. Unfortunately, a direct synchronous implementation of such algorithm does not scale well with the problem size, as the algorithm speed is limited by the slowest computing nodes. To address this issue, in a companion paper, we have proposed an asynchronous distributed ADMM (AD-ADMM) and studied its worst-case convergence conditions. In this paper, we further the study by characterizing the conditions under which the AD-ADMM achieves linear convergence. Our conditions as well as the resulting linear rates reveal the impact that various algorithm parameters, network delay and network size have on the algorithm performance. To demonstrate the superior time efficiency of the proposed AD-ADMM, we test the AD-ADMM on a high-performance computer cluster by solving a large-scale logistic regression problem.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 9 Sep 2015 02:07:27 GMT  (118kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02604v1", "submitted for publication, 28 pages"]], "COMMENTS": "submitted for publication, 28 pages", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.LG cs.SY", "authors": ["tsung-hui chang", "wei-cheng liao", "mingyi hong", "xiangfeng wang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.02604"}
