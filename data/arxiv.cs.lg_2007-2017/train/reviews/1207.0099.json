{"conference": "NIPS", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "30-Jun-2012", "title": "Density-Difference Estimation", "abstract": "We address the problem of estimating the difference between two probability densities. A naive approach is a two-step procedure of first estimating two densities separately and then computing their difference. However, such a two-step procedure does not necessarily work well because the first step is performed without regard to the second step and thus a small error incurred in the first stage can cause a big error in the second stage. In this paper, we propose a single-shot procedure for directly estimating the density difference without separately estimating two densities. We derive a non-parametric finite-sample error bound for the proposed single-shot density-difference estimator and show that it achieves the optimal convergence rate. The usefulness of the proposed method is also demonstrated experimentally.", "histories": [["v1", "Sat, 30 Jun 2012 14:21:46 GMT  (3469kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.0099v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["masashi sugiyama", "takafumi kanamori", "taiji suzuki", "marthinus christoffel du plessis", "song liu", "ichiro takeuchi"], "accepted": true, "id": "1207.0099"}
