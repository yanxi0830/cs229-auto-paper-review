{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "1-Aug-2013", "title": "An Enhanced Features Extractor for a Portfolio of Constraint Solvers", "abstract": "Recent research has shown that the performances of a single arbitrarily efficient solver can be significantly outperformed by a portfolio of possibly slower on-average solvers. The solver selection is usually done by using machine learning techniques which exploit features extracted from the problem specification. In this paper we present a tool that is able to extract an extensive set of features from a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) defined either in the MiniZinc format or in the XCSP format. We also report some empirical results showing that the performances that can be obtained using these features are competitive with state of the art CSP portfolio techniques.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 1 Aug 2013 14:40:14 GMT  (208kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0227v1", null], ["v2", "Thu, 19 Sep 2013 14:53:58 GMT  (112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0227v2", null], ["v3", "Wed, 2 Oct 2013 07:33:15 GMT  (112kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0227v3", null], ["v4", "Fri, 22 Nov 2013 00:53:57 GMT  (186kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0227v4", null], ["v5", "Thu, 19 Dec 2013 23:57:50 GMT  (133kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0227v5", null], ["v6", "Sat, 29 Mar 2014 07:54:42 GMT  (134kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0227v6", null], ["v7", "Wed, 2 Apr 2014 03:02:51 GMT  (135kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0227v7", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["roberto amadini", "maurizio gabbrielli", "jacopo mauro"], "accepted": false, "id": "1308.0227"}
