It's proposed to use an approach based on memberhsip and likelihood functions sharing. A number of performed experiments proved effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method is characterized by robustness to outliers due to a way of ordering values while constructing membership functions.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 3 Feb 2017 23:17:48 GMT  (1081kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01200v1", "International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications(IJISA), Vol. 9, No. 2, February 2017"]], "COMMENTS": "International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications(IJISA), Vol. 9, No. 2, February 2017", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["zhengbing hu", "yevgeniy v bodyanskiy", "oleksii k tyshchenko", "viktoriia o samitova"], "accepted": false, "id": "1702.01200"}
