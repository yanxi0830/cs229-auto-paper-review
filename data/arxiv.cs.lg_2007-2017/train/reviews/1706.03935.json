The teacher can receive from the learner an element~$d$ in the domain $X$ (a query) and returns the value of the function in $d$, $f(d)\\in R$. The learner goal is to find $f$ with a minimum number of queries, optimal time complexity, and optimal resources.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 13 Jun 2017 07:40:27 GMT  (1000kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03935v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["nader h bshouty"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.03935"}
