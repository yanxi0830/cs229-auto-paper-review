This scheme maintains for each memory cell two separate vectors, content and address vectors. This allows the D-NTM to learn a wide variety of location-based addressing strategies including both linear and nonlinear ones. We implement the D-NTM with both soft, differentiable and hard, non-differentiable read/write mechanisms. We investigate the mechanisms and effects for learning to read and write to a memory through experiments on Facebook bAbI tasks using both a feedforward and GRU-controller. The D-NTM is evaluated on a set of the Facebook bAbI tasks and shown to outperform NTM and LSTM baselines.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 30 Jun 2016 20:45:12 GMT  (173kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00036v1", "13 pages, 2 figures"], ["v2", "Fri, 17 Mar 2017 05:56:48 GMT  (406kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00036v2", "13 pages, 3 figures"]], "COMMENTS": "13 pages, 2 figures", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["caglar gulcehre", "sarath chandar", "kyunghyun cho", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1607.00036"}
