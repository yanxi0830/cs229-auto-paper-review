Our approach focuses on the first stage of many stereo algorithms: the matching cost computation. We approach the problem by learning a similarity measure on small image patches using a convolutional neural network. Training is carried out in a supervised manner by constructing a binary classification data set with examples of similar and dissimilar pairs of patches. We examine two network architectures for this task: one tuned for speed, the other for accuracy. The output of the convolutional neural network is used to initialize the stereo matching cost. A series of post-processing steps follow: cross-based cost aggregation, semiglobal matching, a left-right consistency check, subpixel enhancement, a median filter, and a bilateral filter. We evaluate our method on the KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, and Middlebury stereo data sets and show that it outperforms other approaches on all three data sets.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Oct 2015 17:15:05 GMT  (2585kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05970v1", "Submitted to the Journal of Machine Learning Research"], ["v2", "Wed, 18 May 2016 19:53:41 GMT  (2591kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05970v2", null]], "COMMENTS": "Submitted to the Journal of Machine Learning Research", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE", "authors": ["jure \\v{z}bontar", "yann lecun"], "accepted": false, "id": "1510.05970"}
