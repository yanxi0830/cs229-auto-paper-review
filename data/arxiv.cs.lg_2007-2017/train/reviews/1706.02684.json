Our purpose is to propose an efficient layer formulation that extends this property to any domain described by a graph. Namely, we use the support of its adjacency matrix to design learnable weight sharing filters able to exploit the underlying structure of signals. The proposed formulation makes it possible to learn the weights of the filter as well as a scheme that controls how they are shared across the graph. We perform validation experiments with image datasets and show that these filters offer performances comparable with convolutional ones.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 8 Jun 2017 17:03:34 GMT  (48kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02684v1", null], ["v2", "Wed, 20 Sep 2017 14:56:59 GMT  (52kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02684v2", "Camera-ready version, 2017, 5th IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing, 5 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables"], ["v3", "Thu, 5 Oct 2017 16:32:20 GMT  (22kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02684v3", "To appear in 2017, 5th IEEE Global Conference on Signal and Information Processing, 5 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables"]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.CV cs.NE", "authors": ["jean-charles vialatte", "vincent gripon", "gilles coppin"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.02684"}
