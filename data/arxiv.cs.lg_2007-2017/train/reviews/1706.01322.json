We demonstrate that with the help of existing 'deep' linguistic processing technology we are able to create challenging abstract datasets, which enable us to investigate the language understanding abilities of multimodal deep learning models in detail.", "histories": [["v1", "Mon, 5 Jun 2017 13:53:56 GMT  (71kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.01322v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CL cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["alexander kuhnle", "ann copestake"], "accepted": false, "id": "1706.01322"}
