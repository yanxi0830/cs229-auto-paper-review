To date, simultaneous or joint training of all layers of the DBM has been largely unsuccessful with existing training methods. We introduce a simple regularization scheme that encourages the weight vectors associated with each hidden unit to have similar norms. We demonstrate that this regularization can be easily combined with standard stochastic maximum likelihood to yield an effective training strategy for the simultaneous training of all layers of the deep Boltzmann machine.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 20 Mar 2012 12:59:15 GMT  (269kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.4416v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.NE cs.AI cs.LG", "authors": ["guillaume desjardins", "aaron courville", "yoshua bengio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1203.4416"}
