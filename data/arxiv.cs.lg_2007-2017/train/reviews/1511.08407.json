{"conference": "arxiv", "VERSION": "v1", "DATE_OF_SUBMISSION": "26-Nov-2015", "title": "The Mechanism of Additive Composition", "abstract": "We prove an upper bound for the bias of additive composition (Foltz et al., 1998; Landauer and Dutnais, 1997; Mitchell and Lapata, 2010), a widely used method for computing meanings of phrases by averaging the vector representations of their constituent words. The result endorses additive composition as a reasonable operation for calculating meanings of phrases, which is the first theoretical analysis on compositional frameworks from a machine learning point of view. The theory also suggests ways to improve additive compositionality, including: transforming entries of distributional word vectors by a function that meets a specific condition, constructing a novel type of vector representations to make additive composition sensitive to word order, and utilizing singular value decomposition to train word vectors.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 26 Nov 2015 14:58:17 GMT  (1936kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08407v1", "Submitted to Journal of Machine Learning Research; Under Review"], ["v2", "Fri, 18 Dec 2015 23:34:40 GMT  (1942kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08407v2", "Submitted to Journal of Machine Learning Research; Under Review"], ["v3", "Mon, 6 Jun 2016 04:28:21 GMT  (1939kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.08407v3", "In this version we have revised the mathematical proof.
