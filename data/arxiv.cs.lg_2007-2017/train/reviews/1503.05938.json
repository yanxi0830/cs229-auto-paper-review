The mathematical results here sharpen some of the key claims of i-theory -- a recent theory of feedforward processing in sensory cortex.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 19 Mar 2015 20:30:46 GMT  (35kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05938v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["fabio anselmi", "lorenzo rosasco", "tomaso poggio"], "accepted": false, "id": "1503.05938"}
