Analogously to the informal mathematical practice, only a tiny fraction of such statements is named and re-used in later proofs by formal mathematicians. In this work, we suggest and implement criteria defining the estimated usefulness of the HOL Light lemmas for proving further theorems. We use these criteria to mine the large inference graph of the lemmas in the HOL Light and Flyspeck libraries, adding up to millions of the best lemmas to the pool of statements that can be re-used in later proofs. We show that in combination with learning-based relevance filtering, such methods significantly strengthen automated theorem proving of new conjectures over large formal mathematical libraries such as Flyspeck.", "histories": [["v1", "Tue, 11 Feb 2014 03:08:02 GMT  (58kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3578v1", "journal version ofarXiv:1310.2797(which was submitted to LPAR conference)"]], "COMMENTS": "journal version ofarXiv:1310.2797(which was submitted to LPAR conference)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.AI cs.DL cs.LG cs.LO", "authors": ["cezary kaliszyk", "josef urban"], "accepted": false, "id": "1402.3578"}
