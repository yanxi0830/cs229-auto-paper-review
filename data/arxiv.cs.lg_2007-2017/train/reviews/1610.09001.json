We leverage the natural synchronization between vision and sound to learn an acoustic representation using two-million unlabeled videos. Unlabeled video has the advantage that it can be economically acquired at massive scales, yet contains useful signals about natural sound. We propose a student-teacher training procedure which transfers discriminative visual knowledge from well established visual recognition models into the sound modality using unlabeled video as a bridge. Our sound representation yields significant performance improvements over the state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks for acoustic scene/object classification. Visualizations suggest some high-level semantics automatically emerge in the sound network, even though it is trained without ground truth labels.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 27 Oct 2016 20:23:39 GMT  (5939kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1610.09001v1", "NIPS 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "NIPS 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG cs.SD", "authors": ["yusuf aytar", "carl vondrick", "antonio torralba 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1610.09001"}
