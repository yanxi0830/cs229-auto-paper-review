However, most existing keypoint trackers are incapable of effectively modeling and balancing the following three aspects in a simultaneous manner: temporal model coherence across frames, spatial model consistency within frames, and discriminative feature construction. To address this issue, we propose a robust keypoint tracker based on spatio-temporal multi-task structured output optimization driven by discriminative metric learning. Consequently, temporal model coherence is characterized by multi-task structured keypoint model learning over several adjacent frames, while spatial model consistency is modeled by solving a geometric verification based structured learning problem. Discriminative feature construction is enabled by metric learning to ensure the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Finally, the above three modules are simultaneously optimized in a joint learning scheme. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our tracker.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 4 Dec 2014 07:42:21 GMT  (1079kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1574v1", "Accepted by AAAI-15"]], "COMMENTS": "Accepted by AAAI-15", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.CV cs.LG", "authors": ["liming zhao", "xi li", "jun xiao", "fei wu", "yueting zhuang"], "accepted": true, "id": "1412.1574"}
