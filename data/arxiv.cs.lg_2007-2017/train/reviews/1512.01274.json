Embedded in the host language, it blends declarative symbolic expression with imperative tensor computation. It offers auto differentiation to derive gradients. MXNet is computation and memory efficient and runs on various heterogeneous systems, ranging from mobile devices to distributed GPU clusters.", "histories": [["v1", "Thu, 3 Dec 2015 22:49:21 GMT  (100kb,D)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.01274v1", "In Neural Information Processing Systems, Workshop on Machine Learning Systems, 2016"]], "COMMENTS": "In Neural Information Processing Systems, Workshop on Machine Learning Systems, 2016", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.DC cs.LG cs.MS cs.NE", "authors": ["tianqi chen", "mu li", "yutian li", "min lin", "naiyan wang", "minjie wang", "tianjun xiao", "bing xu", "chiyuan zhang", "zheng zhang"], "accepted": false, "id": "1512.01274"}
