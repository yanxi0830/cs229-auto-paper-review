However, in real recommendation settings only few items are presented to a user. This observation has recently encouraged the use of rank-based metrics. LambdaMART is the state-of-the-art algorithm in learning to rank which relies on such a metric. Despite its success it does not have a principled regularization mechanism relying in empirical approaches to control model complexity leaving it thus prone to overfitting.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 4 Nov 2015 10:49:15 GMT  (50kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.01282v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG cs.IR", "authors": ["phong nguyen", "jun wang", "alexandros kalousis"], "accepted": false, "id": "1511.01282"}
