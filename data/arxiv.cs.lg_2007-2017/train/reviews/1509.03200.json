In K-means algorithm, resulting set of clusters depend on the choice of initial centroids. If we can find initial centroids which are coherent with the arrangement of data, the better set of clusters can be obtained. This paper proposes a method based on the Dissimilarity Tree to find, the better initial centroid as well as every bit more accurate cluster with less computational time. Theory analysis and experimental results indicate that the proposed method can effectively improve the accuracy of clusters and reduce the computational complexity of the K-means algorithm.", "histories": [["v1", "Fri, 19 Jun 2015 11:43:14 GMT  (663kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.03200v1", null]], "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "cs.LG", "authors": ["abhishek kumar", "suresh chandra gupta"], "accepted": false, "id": "1509.03200"}
