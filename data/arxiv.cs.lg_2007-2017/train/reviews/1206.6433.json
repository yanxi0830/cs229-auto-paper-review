The model takes advantage of the great flexibility offered by the copulas framework to extend mixtures of Canonical Correlation Analysis to multivariate data with arbitrary continuous marginal densities. We formulate our model as a non-parametric Bayesian mixture, while providing efficient MCMC inference. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that the increased flexibility of the copula mixture significantly improves the clustering and the interpretability of the results.", "histories": [["v1", "Wed, 27 Jun 2012 19:59:59 GMT  (3026kb)", "http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6433v1", "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)"]], "COMMENTS": "Appears in Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2012)", "reviews": [], "SUBJECTS": "stat.ME cs.LG stat.ML", "authors": ["m\u00e9lanie rey", "volker roth 0001"], "accepted": true, "id": "1206.6433"}
