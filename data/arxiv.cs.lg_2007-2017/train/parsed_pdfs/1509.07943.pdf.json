      "text" : "We follow the standard mathematical abstraction of this problem (Candes & Fernandez-Granda [4, 3]): consider a d-dimensional signal x(t) modeled as a weighted sum of k Dirac measures in Rd:\nx(t) = k∑ j=1 wjδµ(j) , (1)\nwhere the point sources, the µ(j)’s, are in Rd. Assume that the weights wj are complex valued, whose absolute values are lower and upper bounded by some positive constant. Assume that we are given k, the number of point sources1.\nDefine the measurement function f(s) : Rd → C to be the convolution of the point source x(t) with a low-pass point spread function eiπ<s,t> as below:\nf(s) = ∫ t∈Rd eiπ<t,s>x(dt) = k∑ j=1 wje iπ<µ(j),s>. (2)\nIn the noisy setting, the measurements are corrupted by uniformly bounded perturbation z:\nf̃(s) = f(s) + z(s), |z(s)| ≤ z,∀s. (3)\nSuppose that we are only allowed to measure the signal x(t) by evaluating the measurement function f̃(s) at any s ∈ Rd, and we want to recover the parameters of the point source signal, i.e., {wj , µ(j) : j ∈ [k]}. We follow the standard normalization to assume that:\nµ(j) ∈ [−1,+1]d, |wj | ∈ [0, 1] ∀j ∈ [k].\nLet wmin = minj |wj | denote the minimal weight, and let ∆ be the minimal separation of the point sources defined as follows:\n∆ = min j 6=j′ ‖µ(j) − µ(j′)‖2, (4)\nwhere we use the Euclidean distance between the point sources for ease of exposition2. These quantities are key parameters in our algorithm and analysis. Intuitively, the recovery problem is harder if the minimal separation ∆ is small and the minimal weight wmin is small.\nThe first question is that, given exact measurements, namely z = 0, where and how many measurements should we take so that the original signal x(t) can be exactly recovered.\nDefinition 1.1 (Exact recovery). In the exact case, i.e. z = 0, we say that an algorithm achieves exact recovery with m measurements of the signal x(t) if, upon input of these m measurements, the algorithm returns the exact set of parameters {wj , µ(j) : j ∈ [k]}.\nMoreover, we want the algorithm to be measurement noise tolerant, in the sense that in the presence of measurement noise we can still recover good estimates of the point sources.\n1An upper bound of the number of point sources suffices. 2Our claims hold withut using the “wrap around metric”, as in [4, 3], due to our random sampling. Also, it is\npossible to extend these results for the `p-norm case.\nDefinition 1.2 (Stable recovery). In the noisy case, i.e., z ≥ 0, we say that an algorithm achieves stable recovery with m measurements of the signal x(t) if, upon input of these m measurements, the algorithm returns estimates {ŵj , µ̂(j) : j ∈ [k]} such that\nmin π\nmax { ‖µ̂(j) − µ(π(j))‖2 : j ∈ [k] } ≤ poly(d, k) z,\nwhere the min is over permutations π on [k] and poly(d,k) is a polynomial function in d and k.\nBy definition, if an algorithm achieves stable recovery with m measurements, it also achieves exact recovery with these m measurements.\nThe terminology of “super-resolution” is appropriate due to the following remarkable result (in the noiseless case) of Donoho [9]: suppose we want to accurately recover the point sources to an error of γ, where γ ∆. Naively, we may expect to require measurements whose frequency depends inversely on the desired the accuracy γ. Donoho [9] showed that it suffices to obtain a finite number of measurements, whose frequencies are bounded by O(1/∆), in order to achieve exact recovery; thus resolving the point sources far more accurately than that which is naively implied by using frequencies of O(1/∆). Furthermore, the work of Candes & Fernandez-Granda [4, 3] showed that stable recovery, in the univariate case (d = 1), is achievable with a cutoff frequency of O(1/∆) using a convex program and a number of measurements whose size is polynomial in the relevant quantities."

      "text" : "We are interested in stable recovery procedures with the following desirable statistical and computational properties: we seek to use coarse (low frequency) measurements; we hope to take a (quantifiably) small number of measurements; we desire our algorithm run quickly. Informally, our main result is as follows:\nTheorem 1.3 (Informal statement of Theorem 3.2). For a fixed probability of error, the proposed algorithm achieves stable recovery with a number of measurements and with computational runtime that are both on the order of O((k log(k) + d)2). Furthermore, the algorithm makes measurements which are bounded in frequency by O(1/∆) (ignoring log factors).\nNotably, our algorithm and analysis directly deal with the multivariate case, with the univariate case as a special case. Importantly, the number of measurements and the computational runtime do not depend on the minimal separation of the point sources. This may be important even in certain low dimensional imaging applications where taking physical measurements are costly (indeed, super-resolution is important in settings where ∆ is small). Furthermore, our technical contribution of how to decompose a certain tensor constructed with Fourier measurements may be of broader interest to related questions in statistics, signal processing, and machine learning."

      "text" : "Table 1 summarizes the comparisons between our algorithm and the existing results. The multidimensional cutoff frequency we refer to in the table is the maximal coordinate-wise entry of any measurement frequency s (i.e. ‖s‖∞). “SDP” refers to the semidefinite programming (SDP) based algorithms of Candes & Fernandez-Granda [3, 4]; in the univariate case, the number of measurements can be reduced by the method in Tang et. al. [23] (this is reflected in the table). “MP” refers to the matrix pencil type of methods, studied in [14] and [15] for the univariate case. Here, we are defining the infinity norm separation as ∆∞ = minj 6=j′ ‖µ(j) − µ(j ′)‖∞, which is understood\nas the wrap around distance on the unit circle. Cd ≥ 1 is a problem dependent constant (discussed below).\nObserve the following differences between our algorithm and prior work:\n1) Our minimal separation is measured under the `2-norm instead of the infinity norm, as in the SDP based algorithm. Note that ∆∞ depends on the coordinate system; in the worst case, it can underestimate the separation by a 1/ √ d factor, namely ∆∞ ∼ ∆/ √ d.\n2) The computation complexity and number of measurements are polynomial in dimension d and the number of point sources k, and surprisingly do not depend on the minimal separation of the point sources! Intuitively, when the minimal separation between the point sources is small, the problem should be harder, this is only reflected in the sampling range and the cutoff frequency of the measurements in our algorithm.\n3) Furthermore, one could project the multivariate signal to the coordinates and solve multiple univariate problems (such as in [19, 17], which provided only exact recovery results). Naive random projections would lead to a cutoff frequency of O( √ d/∆).\nSDP approaches: The work in [3, 4, 10] formulates the recovery problem as a total-variation minimization problem; they then show the dual problem can be formulated as an SDP. They focused on the analysis of d = 1 and only explicitly extend the proofs for d = 2. For d ≥ 1, Ingham-type theorems (see [20, 12]) suggest that Cd = O( √ d).\nThe number of measurements can be reduced by the method in [23] for the d = 1 case, which is noted in the table. Their method uses sampling “off the grid”; technically, their sampling scheme is actually sampling random points from the grid, though with far fewer measurements.\nMatrix pencil approaches: The matrix pencil method, MUSIC and Prony’s method are essentially the same underlying idea, executed in different ways. The original Prony’s method directly attempts to find roots of a high degree polynomial, where the root stability has few guarantees. Other methods aim to robustify the algorithm.\nRecently, for the univariate matrix pencil method, Liao & Fannjiang [14] and Moitra [15] provide a stability analysis of the MUSIC algorithm. Moitra [15] studied the optimal relationship between the cutoff frequency and ∆, showing that if the cutoff frequency is less than 1/∆, then stable recovery is not possible with matrix pencil method (with high probability)."

For some positive constants m ∈ Z, sample to get the measurements f(s) evaluated at the sampling set S3 = {0, 1, . . . , 2m}, and construct two Hankel matrices H0, H1 ∈ Cm×m:\nH0 =  f(0) f(1) . . . f(m− 1) f(1) f(2) . . . f(m) ... ...\nf(m− 1) f(m) . . . f(2m− 1)\n , H1 =  f(1) f(2) . . . f(m) f(2) f(3) . . . f(m+ 1) ... ...\nf(m) f(m+ 1) . . . f(2m)  . (5) Define Dw ∈ Ck×kdiag to be the diagonal matrix with the weights on the main diagonal: [Dw]j,j =\nwj . Define Dµ ∈ Ck×kdiag to be [Dµ]j,j = e iπµ(j) .\nA matrix V is called a Vandermonde matrix if each column is a geometric progression. defined the Vandermonde matrix Vm ∈ Cm×k as below:\nVm =  1 . . . 1 (eiπµ (1) )1 . . . (eiπµ (k) )1 ... ...\n(eiπµ (1) )m−1 . . . (eiπµ (k) )m−1\n . (6)\nThe two Hankel matrices H0 and H1 admit the following simultaneous diagonalization:\nH0 = VmDwV > m , H1 = VmDwDµV > m . (7)\nAs long as Vm is of full rank, this simultaneous diagonalization can be computed by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem, and the parameters of the point source can thus be obtained from the factor Vm and Dw.\nThe univariate matrix pencil method only needs m ≥ k to achieve exact recovery. In the noisy case, the stability of generalized eigenvalue problem depends on the condition number of the Vandermonde matrix Vm and the minimal weight wmin.\nSince all the nodes (eiπµ (j)\n’s) of this Vandermonde matrix lie on the unit circle in the complex plane, it is straightforward to see that asymptotically limm→∞ cond2(Vm) = 1. Furthermore, for m > 1/∆, [14, 15] showed that cond2(Vm) is upper bounded by a constant that does not depend on k and m. This bound on condition number is also implicitly discussed in [19].\nAnother way to view the matrix pencil method is that it corresponds to the low rank 3rd order tensor decomposition (see for example [1]). This view will help us generalize matrix pencil method to higher dimension d in a direct way, without projecting the signal on each coordinate and apply the univariate algorithm multiple times. For m ≥ k, construct a 3rd order tensor F ∈ Cm×m×2 with elements of H0 and H1 defined in (5) as:\nFi,i′,j = [Hj−1]i,i′ , ∀j ∈ [2], i, i′ ∈ [m].\nNote that the two slices along the 3rd dimension of F are H0 and H1. Namely F (I, I, e1) = H0, and F (I, I, e2) = H1. Recall the matrix decomposition of H0 and H1 in (7). Since m ≥ k and the µ(j)’s are distinct, we know that F has the unique rank k tensor decomposition:\nF = Vm ⊗ Vm ⊗ (V2Dw).\nGiven the tensor F , the basic idea of the well-known Jennrich’s algorithm ([11, 13]) for finding the unique low rank tensor decomposition is to consider two random projections v1, v2 ∈ Rm, and then with high probability the two matrices F (I, I, v1) and F (I, I, v2) admit simultaneous diagonalization. Therefore, the matrix pencil method is indeed a special case of Jennrich’s algorithm by setting v1 = e1 and v2 = e2"

      "text" : "One could naively extend the matrix pencil method to higher dimensions by using taking measurements from a hyper-grid, which is of size exponential in the dimension d. We now examine a toy problem which suggests that the high dimensional case may not be inherently more difficult than the univariate case.\nThe key ideas is that an appropriately sampled set can significantly reduce the number of measurements (as compared to using all the grid points). Tang et al [23] made a similar observation for the univariate case. They used a small random subset of measurements (actually still from the grid points) and showed that this contains enough information to recover all the measurement on the grid; the full measurements were then used for stably recovering the point sources.\nConsider the case where the dimension d ≥ k. Assume that wj ’s are real valued, and for all j ∈ [k] and n ∈ [d], the parameters µ(j)n are i.i.d. and uniformly distributed over [−1,+1]. This essentially corresponds to the standard (L2) incoherence conditions (for the µ\n(j)’s). 3 The following simple algorithm achieves stability with polynomial complexity.\n3 This setting is different from the 2-norm separation condition. To see the difference, note that the toy algorithm does not work for constant shift µ(1) = µ(2) + ∆. This issue is resolved in the general algorithm, when the condition is stated in terms of 2-norm separation.\nFirst, take d3 number of measurements by evaluating f(s) in the set S3 = {s = en1 + en2 + en3 : [n1, n2, n3] ∈ [d]× [d]× [d]}, noting that S3 contains only a subset of d3 points from the grid of [3]d. Then, construct a 3rd order tensor F ∈ Cd×d×d with the measurements in the following way:\nFn1,n2,n3 = f(s) ∣∣ s=en1+en2+en3 , ∀n1, n2, n3 ∈ [d].\nNote that the measurement f(e1+e2+e3) = ∑k j=1wje iπ(µ (j) 1 +µ (j) 2 +µ (j) 3 ) = ∑k j=1wje iπµ (j) 1 eiπµ (j) 2 eiπµ (j) 3 . It is straightforward to verify that F has a rank-k tensor factorization F = Vd⊗Vd⊗(VdDw), where the factor Vd ∈ Rd×k is given by:\nVd =  eiπµ (1) 1 . . . eiπµ (k) 1 eiπµ (1) 2 . . . eiπµ (k) 2 ... . . . ...\neiπµ (1) d . . . eiπµ (k) d\n . (8)\nUnder the distribution assumption of the point sources, the entries eiπµ (j) n are i.i.d. and uniformly distributed over the unit circle on the complex plane. Therefore almost surely the factor Vd has full column rank, and thus the tensor decomposition is unique. Moreover here wj ’s are real and each element of VS has unit norm, we have a rescaling constraint with the tensor decomposition, with which we can uniquely obtain the factor VS and the weights in Dw. By taking element-wise log of VS we can read off the parameters of the point sources from VS directly. Moreover, with high probability, we have that cond2(Vd) concentrates around 1, thus the simple algorithm achieves stable recovery."

Use F̃ as the input to Algorithm 2. With probability at least (1 − δv) over the random projections v(1) and v(2), we can bound the distance between columns of the output V̂ and that of V by:\nmin π max j\n{ ‖V̂j − Vπ(j)‖2 : j ∈ [k] } ≤ C √ dk2\n∆δv wmax w2min cond2(V ) 5 z, (13)\nwhere C is a universal constant.\nProof. (of Lemma 3.5) The proof is mostly based on the arguments in [16, 2], we still show the clean arguments here for our case.\nWe first introduce some notations for the exact case. Define D1 = diag([V2]1,:Dw) and D2 = diag([V2]2,:Dw). Recall that the symmetric matrix F1 = F (I, I, e1) = V D1V\n>. Consider its SVD F1 = PΛP >. Denote U = P>V ∈ Ck×k. Define the whitened rank-k tensor\nE = F (P, P, I) = (P>V )⊗ (P>V )⊗ (V2Dw) = U ⊗ U ⊗ (V2Dw) ∈ Ck×k×3.\nDenote the two slices of the tensor E by E1 = E(I, I, e1) = UD1U > and E2 = E(I, I, e2) = UD2U >. Define M = E1E −1 2 , and its eigen decomposition is given by M = UDU −1, where D = D1D −1 2 . Note that in the exact case, D is given by:\nD = diag(eiπ<µ (j),v(1)−v(2)> : j ∈ [k])\nNote that |Dj,j | = 1 for all j. Define the minimal separation of the diagonal entries in D to be:\nsep(D) = min{min j 6=j′ |Dj,j −Dj′,j′ |},\n1. We first apply perturbation bounds to show that the noise in F̃ propagates the estimates P̂ and Ê in a mild way when the condition number of V is bounded by a constant.\nProof. Apply Wedin’s matrix perturbation bound, we have:\n‖P̂ − P‖2 ≤ ‖F̃1 − F1‖2 σmin(F1)\n≤ z √ m\nwminσmin(V )2\nAnd then for the two slices of Ê = F̃ (P̂ , P̂ , I), namely Êi = Ei +Zi for i = 1, 2, we can bound the distance between estimates and the exact case, namely Zi = P̂ >F̃iP̂ − P>FiP , by:\n‖Zi‖ ≤ 8‖Fi‖‖P‖‖P̂ − P‖+ 4‖P‖2‖F̃i − Fi‖ ≤ 16 wmax wmin cond2(V ) 2 z √ m\n2. Then, recall that M = E1E −1 2 = UDU −1. Note that\nM̂ = (E1 + Z1)(E2 + Z2) −1 = E1E −1 2 (I − Z2(I + E −1 2 Z2) −1E−12 ) + Z1E −1 2 .\nLet H and G denote the perturbation matrices:\nH = −Z2(I + E−12 Z2) −1E−12 , G = Z1E −1 2 .\nIn the following claim, we show that given M̂ = Ê1Ê −1 2 = M(I+H)+G for some small perturbation matrixH andG, if the perturbation ‖H‖ and ‖G‖ are small enough and that sep(D) is large enough, the eigen decomposition M̂ = ÛD̂Û−1 is close to that of M .\nClaim 3.6. If ‖MH +G‖ ≤ sep(D) 2 √ kcond2(U) , then the eigenvalues of M̂ are distinct and we can bound the columns of Û and U by:\nmin π max j ‖Ûj − Uπ(j)‖2 ≤ 3\nσmax(H)σmax(D) + σmax(G)\nσmin(U)sep(D) ‖Ûj‖2‖Vj‖2.\nProof. Let λj and Uj for j ∈ [k] denote the eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvectors of M . If ‖MH +G‖ ≤ sep(D)\n2 √ kcond2(U) , we can bound\n‖M̂ −M‖ = ‖U−1(M + (MH +G))U −D‖ = ‖U−1(MH +G)U‖ ≤ sep(D)/2 √ k,\nthus apply Gershgorin’s disk theorem, we have |λ̂j−λj | ≤ ‖[U−1(MH+G)U ]j‖1 ≤ √ k‖[U−1(MH+ G)U ]j‖2 ≤ sep(D)/2. Therefore, the eigenvalues are distinct and we have\n|λ̂j − λj′ | ≥ |λj − λj′ | − |λ̂j − λj | ≥ 1\n2 |λj − λj′ | ≥\n1 2 sep(D). (14)\nNote that {Uj′} and {Ûj} define two sets of basis vectors, thus we can write Ûj = ∑ j′ cj′Uj′\n(with the correct permutation for columns of Ûj and Uj) for some coefficients ∑ j′ c 2 j′ = 1. Apply first order Taylor expansion of eigenvector definition we have:\nλ̂jÛj = M̂Ûj = (M + (MH +G)) ∑ j′ cj′Uj′ = ∑ j′ λj′cj′Uj′ + (MH +G)Ûj .\nSince we also have λ̂jÛj = ∑ j′ λ̂jcj′Uj′ , we can write ∑\nj′(λ̂j−λj′)cj′Uj′ = (MH+G)Ûj , and we can solve for the coefficients cj′ ’s from the linear system as [(λ̂j − λj′)cj′ : j′ ∈ [k]] = U−1(MH +G)Ûj . Finally plug in the inequality in (14) we have that for any j:\n‖Ûj − Uj‖22 = ∑ j′ 6=j c2j′‖Uj′‖22 + (cj − 1)2‖Uj‖22\n≤ 2 ∑ j′ 6=j c2j′‖Vj′‖22 ≤ 8‖U −1(MH +G)Ûj‖22\nsep(D)2\n≤ 8(σmax(D)σmax(H) + σmax(G)) 2\nσmin(U)2sep(D)2 ‖Ûj‖22‖Vj‖22\n3. Note that in the above bound for ‖Ûj −Uj‖, we can bound the perturbation matrices H and G by:\nσmax(H) ≤ ‖Z2‖ (1− σmax(E−12 Z2))σmin(E2) ≤ ‖Z2‖ σmin(E2)− ‖Z2‖ ≤ ‖Z2‖ σmin(U)2σmin(D2)− ‖Z2‖ , σmax(G) ≤ σmax(Z1)\nσmin(E2) ≤ ‖Z2‖ σmin(U)2σmin(D2) ,\nNote that σmin(D2) ≥ wmin and σmax(D) = 1 by definition. In the following claim, we apply anti-concentration bound to show that with high probability sep(D) is large.\nClaim 3.7. For any δv ∈ (0, 1), with probability at least 1− δv, we can bound sep(D) by:\nsep(D) ≥ ∆δv√ dk2 .\nProof. Denote v = v(1) − v(2), and note that ‖v‖ ≤ √ 2. In the regime we concern, for any pair j 6= j′, we have |eiπ<µ(j),v> − eiπ<µ(j ′),v>| ≤ | < µ(j) − µ(j′), v > |. Apply Lemma 4.3, we have that for δ ∈ (0, 1),\nP(| < µ(j) − µ(j′), v > | ≤ ‖µ(j) − µ(j′)‖ δ√ d ) ≤ δ.\nTake a union bound over all pairs of j 6= j′, we have that\nP (\nfor somej 6= j′, | < µ(j) − µ(j′), v > | ≤ ‖µ(j) − µ(j′)‖ δ√ dk2\n) ≤ k2 δ\nk2 = δ.\nRecall that ∆ = minj 6=j′ ‖µ(j) − µ(j ′)‖.\n4. Recall that U = P>V . Note that since P has orthonormal columns, we have σmin(U) = σmin(V ) and ‖Ui‖ ≤ ‖Vi‖ = √ m.\nFinally we apply perturbation bound to the estimates V̂i = P̂ Ûi and conclude with the above inequalities:\n‖V̂i − Vi‖ ≤ 2(‖P̂ − P‖‖Ui‖+ ‖P‖‖Ûi − Ui‖) ≤ 2 ( z √ m\nwminσmin(V )2 + 3\nσmax(H)σmax(D) + σmax(G)\nσmin(U)sep(D) ‖Vi‖\n) ‖Vi‖\n≤ 2 (\nz √ m\nwminσmin(V )2 + 6 ‖Z2‖‖Vi‖ (σmin(V )2σmin(D2)− ‖Z2‖)σmin(V )sep(D)\n) ‖Vi‖\n≤ C( √ dk2m\n∆δv\nwmaxcond2(V ) 2\nw2minσmin(V ) 3\n)‖Vi‖ z,\nfor some universal constant C. Note that the last inequality used the assumption that z is small enough.\nCondition number of VS′: The following lemma is helpful:\nLemma 3.8. Let VS′ ∈ C(m+d+1)×k be the factor as defined in (11). Recall that VS′ = [VS ;Vd; 1], where Vd is defined in (8), and VS is the characteristic matrix defined in (10).\nWe can bound the condition number of VS′ by cond2(VS′) ≤ √ 1 + √ kcond2(VS). (15)\nProof. (of Lemma 3.8) By definition, there exist some constants λ and λ′ such that cond2(VS) = λ′/λ, and for all w ∈ Pk1,2, we have λ ≤ ‖VSw‖ ≤ λ′. Note that each element of the factor VS′ lies on the unit circle in the complex plane, then we have:\nλ2 ≤ ‖VSw‖22 ≤ ‖VS′w‖22 ≤ (λ′)2 + √ kd.\nWe can bound the condition number of VS′ by:\ncond2(VS′) ≤\n√ (λ′)2 + √ kd\nλ2 =\n√ 1 + √ kd\n(λ′)2 cond2(VS) ≤\n√ 1 + √ kcond2(VS),\nwhere the last inequality is because that maxw ‖VSw‖22 ≥ ‖VSe1‖22 = d, we have (λ′)2 ≥ d.\nCondition number of the characteristic matrix VS: Therefore, the stability analysis of the proposed algorithm boils down to understanding the relation between the random sampling set S and the condition number of the characteristic matrix VS . This is analyzed in Lemma 3.10 (main technical lemma).\nLemma 3.9. For any fixed number x ∈ (0, 1/2). Consider a Gaussian vector s with distribution N (0, R2Id×d), where R ≥ √ 2 log(k/ x) π∆ for d ≥ 2, and R ≥ √ 2 log(1+2/ x) π∆ for d = 1. Define the Hermitian random matrix Xs ∈ Ck×kherm to be\nXs =  e−iπ<µ (1),s> e−iπ<µ (2),s> ...\ne−iπ<µ (k),s>\n [ eiπ<µ (1),s>, eiπ<µ (2),s>, . . . eiπ<µ (k),s> ] . (16)\nWe can bound the spectrum of Es[Xs] by:\n(1− x)Ik×k Es[Xs] (1 + x)Ik×k. (17)\nProof. (of Lemma 3.9) Denote Y = Es[Xs]. Note that Yj,j = 1 for all diagonal entries. For d = 1 case, the point sources all lie on the interval [−1, 1], we can bound the summation of the off diagonal entries in the matrix Y by:∑\nj′ 6=j |Yj,j′ | = Es[eiπ<µ\n(j′)−µ(j),s>]\n= ∑ j′ 6=j e− 1 2 π2‖µ(j)−µ(j′)‖22R2 ≤ 2(e− 1 2 (π∆R)2 + e− 1 2 (π(2∆)R)2 + · · ·+ e− 1 2 (π(k/2)∆R)2)\n≤ 2e− 1 2 (π∆R)2/(1− e− 1 2 (π∆R)2)\n≤ x.\nFor d ≥ 2 case, we simply bound each off-diagonal entries by:\nYj,j′ = e − 1 2 π2‖µ(j)−µ(j′)‖22R2 ≤ e− 1 2 π2∆2R2 ≤ x/k.\nApply Lemma 4.2 (Gershgorin’s Disk Theorem) and we know that all the eigenvalues of Y are bounded by 1± x.\nLemma 3.10 (Main technical lemma). In the same setting of Lemma 3.9, Let S = {s(1), . . . , s(m)} be m independent samples of the Gaussian vector s. For m ≥ k x √ 8 log kδs , with probability at least 1− δs over the random sampling, the condition number of the factor VS is bounded by:\ncond2(VS) ≤ √\n1 + 2 x 1− 2 x . (18)\nProof. (of Lemma 3.10) Let {X(1), . . . , X(m)} denote the i.i.d. samples of the random matrix Xs defined in (16), with s evaluated at the i.i.d. random samples in S. Note that we have\n‖VSw‖22 = w>V ∗S VSw = w> ( 1\nm m∑ i=1 X(i)\n) w.\nBy definition of condition number, to show that cond2(VS) ≤ √\n1+2 x 1−2 x , it suffices to show that\n(1− 2 x)Ik×k\n( 1\nm m∑ i=1 X(i)\n) (1 + 2 x)Ik×k.\nBy Lemma 3.9, the spectrum of Es[Xs] lies in (1− x, 1 + x). Here we only need to show that the spectrum of the sample mean ( 1 m ∑m i=1X (i) )\nis close to the spectrum of the expectation Es[Xs]. Since each element of the random matrix Xs ∈ Ck×k lies on the unit circle in the complex plane, we have X2s k2I almost surely. Therefore we can apply Lemma 4.1 (Matrix Hoeffding) to show that for m > k x √ 8 log kδs , with probability at least 1−δs, it holds that ‖ 1 m ∑m i=1X (i)−Es[Xs]‖2 ≤ x."

      "text" : "We empirically demonstrate the performance of the proposed super-resolution algorithm in this section.\nFirst, we look at a simple instance with dimension d = 2 and the minimal separation ∆ = 0.05. Our perturbation analysis of the stability result limits to small noise, i.e. z is inverse polynomially small in the dimensions, and the number of measurements m needs to be polynomially large in the dimensions. However, we believe these are only the artifact of the crude analysis, instead of being intrinsic to the approach. In the following numerical example, we examine a typical instance of 8 randomly generated 2-D point sources. The minimal separation ∆ is set to be 0.01, and the weights are uniformly distributed in [0.1, 1.1] The measurement noise level z is set to be 0.1, and we take only 2178 noisy measurements ( 1/∆2). Figure 1 shows reasonably good recovery result.\nNext, we examine the phase transition properties implied by the main theorem.\nFigure 2 shows the dependency between the cutoff frequency and the minimal separation. For each fixed pair of the minimal separation and the cutoff frequency (∆, R), we randomly generate k = 8 point sources in 4-dimensional space while maintaining the same minimal separation. The weights are uniformly distributed in [0.1, 1.1]. The recovery is considered successful if the error∑\nj∈[k] √ ‖µ̂(j) − µ(j)‖22 ≤ 0.1 (on average it tolerates around 4% error per coordinate per point source). This process is repeated 50 times and the rate of success was recorded. Figure 2 plots the success rate in gray-scale, where 0 is black and 1 is white.\nWe observe that there is a sharp phase transition characterized by a linear relation between the cutoff frequency and the inverse of minimal separation, which is implied by Theorem 3.2.\nThe recovery is considered successful if the error\n∑\nj∈[k]\n√\n‖µ̂(j) − µ(j)‖22 ≤ 0.1. This process is\nrepeated 50 times and the rate of success was recorded.\nIn a similar setup, we examine the success rate while varying the minimal separation ∆ and the number of measurement m.\nIn Figure 3, we observe that there is a threshold of m below which the number of measurements is too small to achieve stable recovery; when m is above the threshold, the success rate increases with the number of measurements as the algorithm becomes more stable. However, note that given the appropriately chosen cutoff frequency R, the number of measurements required does not depend on the minimal separation, and thus the computation complexity does not depend on the minimal separation neither."

      "heading" : "4.2 Connection with learning GMMs",
      "text" : "One reason we are interested in the scaling of the algorithm with respect to the dimension d is that it naturally leads to an algorithm for learning Gaussian mixture models (GMMs).\nWe first state the problem: given a number of N i.i.d. samples coming from a random one out of k Gaussian distributions in d dimensional space, the learning problem asks to estimate the\nmeans and the covariance matrices of these Gaussian components, as well as the mixing weights. We denote the parameters by {(wj , µ(j),Σ(j))}i∈[k] where the mean vectors µ(j) ∈ [−1,+1]d, the covariance matrices Σ(j) ∈ Rd×d and the mixing weights wj ∈ R+. Learning mixture of Gaussians is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning, whose study dates back to Pearson[18] in the 1900s, and later arise in numerous areas of applications.\nIn this brief discussion, we only consider the case where the components are spherical Gaussians with common covariance matrices, namely Σ(j) = σ2Id×d for all j. Moreover, we define the separation ∆G by:\n∆G = minj 6=j′ ‖µ(j) − µ(j ′)‖2 σ ,\nand we will focus on the well-separated case where ∆G is sufficiently large. This class of wellseparated GMMs is often used in data clustering.\nBy the law of large numbers, for large d, the probability mass of a d-dimensional Gaussian distribution tightly concentrates within a thin shell with a √ dσ distance from the mean vector. This concentration of distance leads to a line of works of provably learning GMMs in the wellseparated case, started by the seminal work of Dasgupta[6] (spherical and identical Σ, ∆G ≥ Ω(d1/2), complexity poly(d, k)) and followed by works of Dasgupta & Schulman [8] (spherical and identical Σ, d log(k), ∆G ≥ Ω(d1/4), complexity poly(d, k)), Arora & Kannan [21] (general and identical Σ, ∆G ≥ Ω(d1/4) complexity O(kd)).\nInstead of relying on the concentration of distance and use distance based clustering to learn the GMM, we observe that in the well-separated case the characteristic function of the GMM has nice properties, and one can exploit the concentration of the characteristic function to learn the parameters. Note that we do not impose any other assumption on the dimensions k and d.\nNext, we sketch the basic idea of applying the proposed super-resolution algorithm to learn well-separated GMMs, guaranteeing that N the required number of samples from the GMM, as well as the computation complexity both are in the order of poly(d, k). Since σ is a bounded scalar parameter, we can simply apply grid-search to find the best match. In the following we assume that the σ is given and focus on learning the mean vectors and the mixing weights.\nEvaluate the characteristic function of a d dimensional Gaussian mixture X, with identical and spherical covariance matrix Σ = σ2Id×d, at s ∈ Rd:\nφX(s) = E[ei<x,s>] = ∑ j∈[k] wje − 1 2 σ2‖s‖22+i<µ(j),s>.\nAlso we let φ̂X(s) denote the empirical characteristic function evaluated at s based on N i.i.d. samples {x1, . . . xN} drawn from this GMM:\nφ̂X(s) = 1\nN ∑ l∈[N ] ei<xl,s>.\nNote that |ei<xl,s>| = 1 for all samples, thus we can apply Bernstein concentration inequality to the characteristic function and argue that |φ̂X(s)− φX(s)| ≤ O( 1√N ) for all s.\nIn order to apply the proposed super-resolution algorithm, define\nf(s) = e 1 2 σ2π2‖s‖22φX(πs) = ∑ j∈[k] wje iπ<µ(j),s>, and f̃(s) = e 1 2 π2σ2‖s‖22 φ̂X(s).\nIn the context of learning GMM, taking measurements of f̃(s) corresponding to evaluating the empirical characteristic function at different s, for ‖s‖∞ ≤ R, where R is the cutoff frequency. Note that this implies ‖s‖22 ≤ dR2. Therefore, we have that with high probability the noise level z can be bounded by\nz = max ‖s‖∞≤R\n|f(s)− f̃(s)| = O\n( eσ 2dR2\n√ N\n) .\nIn order to achieve stable recovery of the mean vector µ(j)’s using the proposed algorithm, on one hand, we need the cutoff frequency R = Ω(1/σ∆G); on the other hand, we need the noise level z = o(1). It suffices to require σ\n2dR2 = o(1), namely having large enough separation ∆G ≥ Ω(d1/2). In summary, when the separation condition is satisfied, to achieve target accuracy in estimating the parameters, we need the noise level z to be upper bounded by some inverse polynomial in the dimensions, and this is equivalent to requiring the number of samples from the GMM to be lower bounded by poly(k, d).\nAlthough this algorithm does not outperform the scaling result in Dasgupta[6], it still sheds light on a different approach of learning GMMs. We leave it as future work to apply super-resolution algorithms to learn more general cases of GMMs or even learning mixtures of log-concave densities."

      "text" : "In a recent work, Chen & Chi [5] showed that via structured matrix completion, the sample complexity for stable recovery can be reduced to O(k log4 d). However, the computation complexity is still in the order of O(kd) as the Hankel matrix is of dimension O(kd) and a semidefinite program is used to complete the matrix. It remains an open problem to reduce the sample complexity of our\nalgorithm from O(k2) to the information theoretical bound O(k), while retaining the polynomial scaling of the computation complexity.\nRecently, Schiebinger et al [22] studied the problem of learning a mixture of shifted and re-scaled point spread functions f(s) = ∑ j wjϕ(s, µ (j)). This model has the Gaussian mixture as a special case, with the point spread function being Gaussian point spread ϕ(s, µ(j)) = e−(s−µ (j))>Σ−1j (s−µ\n(j)). We have discussed the connection between super-resolution and learning GMM. Another interesting open problem is to generalize the proposed algorithm to learn mixture of broader classes of nonlinear functions."

This signal processing problem arises in numerous imaging problems, ranging from astronomy to biology to spectroscopy, where it is common to take (coarse) Fourier measurements of an object. Of particular interest is in obtaining estimation procedures which are robust to noise, with the following desirable statistical and computational properties: we seek to use coarse Fourier measurements (bounded by some cutoff frequency); we hope to take a (quantifiably) small number of measurements; we desire our algorithm to run quickly. Suppose we have k point sources in d dimensions, where the points are separated by at least ∆ from each other (in Euclidean distance). This work provides an algorithm with the following favorable guarantees: • The algorithm uses Fourier measurements, whose frequencies are bounded by O(1/∆) (up to log factors). Previous algorithms require a cutoff frequency which may be as large as Ω( √ d/∆). • The number of measurements taken by and the computational complexity of our algorithm are bounded by a polynomial in both the number of points k and the dimension d, with no dependence on the separation ∆. In contrast, previous algorithms depended inverse polynomially on the minimal separation and exponentially on the dimension for both of these quantities. Our estimation procedure itself is simple: we take random bandlimited measurements (as opposed to taking an exponential number of measurements on the hyper-grid). Furthermore, our analysis and algorithm are elementary (based on concentration bounds for sampling and the singular value decomposition). 1 ar X iv :1 50 9. 07 94 3v 1 [ cs .L G ] 2 6 Se p 20 15",
