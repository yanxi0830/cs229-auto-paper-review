      "text" : "We often encounter situations in which an experimenter wants to find, by sequential experimentation, ~xmax = arg max~x y = f(~x), where f(~x) is a (possibly unknown) function of a well controllable variable ~x. To solve this problem in physics and engineering applications, scientists have been routinely implemented techniques that rely on the idea of systematically changing the value of the controllable variable in time and following, via so-called lock-in amplifier techniques, how those changes affect the dependent variable y. Applications of the problem of finding arg maxx f(x) are manifold and prominent in a much wider range of fields. For example, in economics, firms might be able to manipulate features of a product (~x), such as the price, and observe the revenue (y). The exact functional relationship between product features and revenue might not be known but can sequentially be sampled (for examples see Kung et al., 2002; Jiang et al., 2011) (especially using modern interactive communication technologies, such as, for instance, e-commerce). The obvious aim of the firm is to select the product features that maximize the revenue. The problem also presents itself in the medical sciences when considering the dose of medication or composition of nutrition: often researchers seek for an optimal dosage according to some observable criterion, but the functional relationship between the dosage and the outcome measure is unknown (see, e.g., Sapareto and Dewey, 1984; Marschner, 2007). Despite the fact that the problem presents itself in many places, there is however no single agreed upon method to approach it. It is thus worth asking whether it be possible to adapt the lock-in a amplifier algorithm used in physics and engineering as a generic tool to find ~xmax = arg max~x y = f(~x). The goal of this paper is to address this topic. We focus on the simple case where x is a scalar. In the remainder of this paper, we index sequential trials by t ∈ {1, . . . , T } and our ultimate aim is to describe a novel method for manipu-\n1\nimsart-generic ver. 2011/11/15 file: arXiv_Lockin.tex date: October 6, 2017\nar X\niv :1\n50 2.\n00 59\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\nF eb\n2 01\n5\nlating xt (in discrete time) to find, sequentially, the value of x that maximizes y. We coin the method Lock-in Feedback (LiF).\nThe problem of finding arg max~x f(~x) is treated in a number of branches in the experimental design and machine learning literature. The problem can be approached as an optimal design problem, in which the main aim is to design an experiment that efficiently provides us with information regarding f(~x) (see, e.g., O’Brien and Funk, 2003; Myung and Pitt, 2009a). However, one could also frame the problem as a bandit problem (Berry and Fristedt, 1985), where the actions a ∈ A are the choice for the (continuous) value of x, and the rewards at each interaction rt are (some function of) y (Bubeck et al., 2011). In this paper we focus on the introduction and examination of our novel approach to this specific problem, and defer the embedding within the bandit and optimal design literature to the discussion Section.\nAS mentioned above, our method is based on an approach used in physics and engineering, where, if a physical variable y depends on the value of a well controllable physical variable x, the search for arg maxx f(x) can be solved via what is nowadays considered as standard electronics. This approach relies on the possibility of making the variable x oscillate at a fixed frequency and to look at the response of the dependent variable y at the very same frequency by means of a lock-in amplifier (Meade, 1983). The method is particularly suitable when y is immersed in a high noise level, where other more direct methods would fail. Furthermore, should the entire curve shift (or, in other words, if arg maxx f(x) changes in time, also known as concept drift), the circuit will automatically adjust to the new situation and quickly reveal the new maximum position. This approach is widely used in a very large number of applications, both in industry and research (Meade, 1983), and is the basis for the Lock-in Feedback (LiF) method we introduce in this paper.\nIn the following sections we first introduce LiF in more detail. We present an analysis of LiF in continuous time and demonstrate how an oscillating manipulation of the independent variable x can be used as a strategy to find arg maxx y = f(x). Subsequently we present two algorithms to use LiF in sequential experiments. We then, by simulation, compare the two algorithms, and examine the performance of LiF in several scenario’s of signal-to-noise ratio and in situations of concept drift (e.g., Gaber et al., 2005). Finally we discuss the opportunities that LiF may offer for future experiments and a number of open questions regarding this proposed experimental regime."

      "text" : "In this section we detail the basic principles behind LiF assuming continuous time in which x can be manipulated. Let’s assume that y is a continuous function f of x: y = f(x). Let’s further assume that x oscillates with time according to:\nx(t) = x0 +A cos (ωt) (1)\nimsart-generic ver. 2011/11/15 file: arXiv_Lockin.tex date: October 6, 2017\nwhere ω is the angular frequency of the oscillation, x0 its central value, and A its amplitude. For relatively small values of A, Taylor expanding f(x) around x0 to the second order, one obtains:\ny(x(t)) = f(x0) + (x0 − x0 −A cos (ωt))\n( ∂f\n∂x ∣∣∣∣ x=x0 )\n+ 1\n2 (x0 − x0 −A cos (ωt))2\n( ∂2f\n∂x2 ∣∣∣∣ x=x0 ) (2) which can be simplified to:\ny(x(t)) = k −A cos (ωt)\n( ∂f\n∂x ∣∣∣∣ x=x0 )\n+ 1\n4 A2 cos (2ωt)\n( ∂2f\n∂x2 ∣∣∣∣ x=x0 ) (3)\nwhere k = f(x0) + 1/4 ( ∂2f/∂x2 ∣∣ x=x0 ) . It is thus evident that, for small oscillations, y becomes the sum of three terms: a constant term, a term oscillating at angular frequency ω, and a term oscillating at angular frequency 2ω.\nSuppose we ourselves can actively manipulate x and measure y, and that f is continuous and only has one maximum and no minimum.1 Further suppose that one is interested to find the value arg maxx y = f(x) which we denote with xmax, and that our measurements of y contain noise\ny(t) = f(x(t)) + (4)\nwhere denotes the noise and ∼ π() where π is some probability density function and E[ |x] = 0.\nFollowing the scheme used in physical lock-in amplifiers (see, e.g., Scofield, 1994), we multiply the observed y variable by cos (ωt). Using eq. 3 and eq. 4, one obtains:\nyω(t) = cos (ωt)\n[ k −A cos (ωt) ( ∂f\n∂x ∣∣∣∣ x=x0 )\n+ 1\n4 A2 cos (2ωt)\n( ∂2f\n∂x2 ∣∣∣∣ x=x0 ) + ] (5) where yω is the value of y after it has been multiplied by cos (ωt). Eq. 5 can be written more compactly as:\nyω = − A\n2\n( ∂f\n∂x ∣∣∣∣ x=x0 ) + kω cos (ωt) + k2ω cos (2ωt)\n+ k3ω cos (3ωt) + cos (ωt)\n(6)\n1For simplicity of exposure we only consider these well-behaved functions in this paper.\nimsart-generic ver. 2011/11/15 file: arXiv_Lockin.tex date: October 6, 2017\nwhere\nkω = k +A 2/8 ( ∂2f/∂x2 ∣∣ x=x0 ) (7)\nk2ω = −A/2 ( ∂2f/∂x2 ∣∣ x=x0 ) (8)\nk3ω = A 2/8 ( ∂2f/∂x2 ∣∣ x=x0 ) . (9)\nIntegrating yω over a time T = 2πN ω , where N is a positive integer and T denotes the time needed to integrate N full oscillations, one obtains:\ny∗ω = − TA\n2\n( ∂f\n∂x ∣∣∣∣ x=x0 ) + ∫ T 0 cos (ωt) (10)\nDepending on the noise level, one can tailor the integration time, T , in such a way to reduce the second addendum of the right hand of eq. 10 to negligible levels, effectively averaging out the noise in the measurements. Under those circumstances, y∗ω provides a direct measurement of the value of the first derivative of f at x = x0.\nThe above method thus yields quantitative information regarding the first derivative of f at x = x0, providing, in this way, a logical update strategy of x0: if y ∗ ω < 0, then x0 is larger than the value of x that maximizes f ; likewise, if y∗ω > 0, x0 is smaller than the value of x that maximizes f . Thus, based on the oscillation observed in yω we are now able to move x0 closer to x = arg maxx f(x) using an update rule x0 := x0 + γy ∗ ω where γ quantifies the learn rate of the procedure. Hence, we can setup a feedback loop that allows us to keep x0 close to xmax, even if f(x) changes over time.\nNote that, multiplying y by cos 2ωt and using a similar approach as the one described above to extract the amplitude of the oscillation of y at frequency 2ω, one would be able to measure the second derivative of the function f at x = x0. This property can be useful when, for instance, f(x) is known to be an exact parabola to not only derive the direction of the step towards the maximum, but to work out the exact step size (see Appendix A)."

To simplify notation, we will index sequential measurements by yt where t = 1, . . . , t = T where T denotes the length—possibly infinite—of the experiment that is ran to find arg maxx f(x).\nIn discrete time we can use the same procedure as above in which we start with x0, and for each sample oscillate around x0 with a known frequency ω and known amplitude A:\nxt = x0 +A cosωt (11)\nimsart-generic ver. 2011/11/15 file: arXiv_Lockin.tex date: October 6, 2017\nwhich will result in measurements given by\nyt = f(x0 +A cosωt) + t (12)\nOn the basis of the arguments reported above, we can now implement a feedback loop that iteratively adjusts the value of x0 until x reaches xmax. After that, if the function f changes, the loop can follow the value of x to the new maximizing position and thus stay “locked”. The procedure is similar to that given in Equation 6 and 10, where we first multiply the outcome yt by cos(ωt) and subsequently integrate out the noise term (summing in the discrete case).

The more accurate the information, the closer the initial x0 to xmax, the faster the convergence of the loop to xmax. • The amplitude A affects the costs of the search procedure, because a large A implies querying a large range of x values with (possibly) low resulting y values. However, A also influence the learning speed: a very small A leads to small updates steps, while a large value of A might lead to a value of γy∗ω that “overshoots” xmax.\nimsart-generic ver. 2011/11/15 file: arXiv_Lockin.tex date: October 6, 2017\n• The integration time T affects the variability of the update of x0, with larger integration times leading to a smoother update but slower convergence. • The learn-rate γ < 1 determines the step size at each update of x0.

Taking inspiration from physics and engineering, we have designed a new method to address this problem. In this paper, we first introduce the method in continuous time, and then present two algorithms for use in sequential experiments. Through a series of simulation studies, we show that the method is effective for finding maxima of unknown functions by experimentation, even when the maximum of the functions drifts or when the signal to noise ratio is low.",
