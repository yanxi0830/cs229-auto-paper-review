      "text" : "Multitask learning exploits the relationships between several learning tasks in order to improve performance, which is especially useful if a common subset of features are useful for all tasks at hand. The group lasso (Glasso) [21, 10] is naturally suited for this situation: if a feature is selected for one task, then it is selected for all tasks. This may be too restrictive in many applications, and this motivates a less rigid approach to multitask feature selection. Suppose that the available features can be organized into overlapping subsets according to a notion of similarity, and that the features useful in one task are similar, but not necessarily identical, to those best suited for other tasks. In other words, a feature that is useful for one task suggests that the subset it belongs to may contain the features useful in other tasks (Figure 1).\nIn this paper, we introduce the sparse overlapping sets lasso (SOSlasso), a convex program to recover the sparsity patterns corresponding to the situations explained above. SOSlasso generalizes lasso [18] and Glasso, effectively spanning the range between these two well-known procedures. SOSlasso is capable of exploiting the similarities between useful features across tasks, but unlike Glasso it does not force different tasks to use exactly the same features. It produces sparse solutions, but unlike lasso it encourages similar patterns of sparsity across tasks. Sparse group lasso [16] is a special case of SOSlasso that only applies to disjoint sets, a significant limitation when features cannot be easily partitioned, as is the case of our motivating example in fMRI. The main contribution of this paper is a theoretical analysis of SOSlasso, which also covers sparse group lasso as a special case (further differentiating us from [16]). The performance of SOSlasso is analyzed, error\nar X\niv :1\n31 1.\n54 22\nv2 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 2\nbounds are derived for general loss functions, and its consistency is shown for squared error loss.

      "text" : "SOSlasso encourages sparsity patterns that are similar, but not identical, across tasks. This is accomplished by decomposing the features of each task into groups G1 . . . GM , where M is the same for each task, and Gi is a set of features that can be considered similar across tasks. Conceptually, SOSlasso first selects subsets that are most useful for all tasks, and then identifies a unique sparse solution for each task drawing only from features in the selected subsets. In the fMRI application discussed later, the subsets are simply clusters of adjacent spatial data points (voxels) in the brains of multiple subjects. Figure 1 shows an example of the patterns that typically arise in sparse multitask learning applications, where rows indicate features and columns correspond to tasks.\nPast work has focused on recovering variables that exhibit within and across group sparsity, when the groups do not overlap [16], finding application in genetics, handwritten character recognition [17] and climate and oceanography [2]. Along related lines, the exclusive lasso [23] can be used when it is explicitly known that variables in certain sets are negatively correlated."

      "text" : "In psychological studies involving fMRI, multiple participants are scanned while subjected to exactly the same experimental manipulations. Cognitive Neuroscientists are interested in identifying the patterns of activity associated with different cognitive states, and construct a model of the activity that accurately predicts the cognitive state evoked on novel trials. In these datasets, it is reasonable to expect that the same general areas of the brain will respond to the manipulation in every participant. However, the specific patterns of activity in these regions will vary, both because neural codes can vary by participant [4] and because brains vary in size and shape, rendering neuroanatomy only an approximate guide to the location of relevant information across individuals. In short, a voxel useful for prediction in one participant suggests the general anatomical neighborhood where useful voxels may be found, but not the precise voxel. While logistic Glasso [19], lasso [15], and the elastic net penalty [14] have been applied to neuroimaging data, these methods do not exclusively take into account both the common macrostructure and the differences in microstructure across brains. SOSlasso, in contrast, lends itself well to such a scenario, as we will see from our experiments."

      "text" : "We formalize the notations used in the sequel. Lowercase and uppercase bold letters indicate vectors and matrices respectively. We assume a multitask learning framework, with a data matrix Φt ∈ Rn×p for each task t ∈ {1, 2, . . . , T }. We assume there exists a vector x?t ∈ Rp such that measurements obtained are of the form yt = Φtx?t + ηt ηt ∼ N (0, σ2I). Let X? := [x?1 x ? 2 . . .x ? T ] ∈ Rp×T . Suppose we are given M (possibly overlapping) groups G̃ = {G̃1, G̃2, . . . , G̃M}, so that G̃i ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , p} ∀i, of maximum size B. These groups contain sets of “similar” features, the notion of similarity being application dependent. We assume that all but k M groups are identically zero. Among the active groups, we further assume that at most only a fraction α ∈ (0, 1) of the coefficients per group are non zero. We consider the following optimization program in this paper\nX̂ = arg min x { T∑ t=1 LΦt(xt) + λnh(x) } (1)\nwhere x = [xT1 x T 2 . . .x T T ] T , h(x) is a regularizer and Lt := LΦt(xt) denotes the loss function, whose value depends on the data matrix Φt. We consider least squares and logistic loss functions. In the least squares setting, we have Lt = 12n‖yt−Φtxt‖\n2. We reformulate the optimization problem (1) with the least squares loss as\nx̂ = arg min x\n{ 1\n2n ‖y −Φx‖22 + λnh(x)\n} (2)\nwhere y = [yT1 y T 2 . . .y T T ] T and the block diagonal matrix Φ is formed by block concatenating the Φ′ts. We use this reformulation for ease of exposition (see also [10] and references therein). Note that x ∈ RT p, y ∈ RT n, and Φ ∈ RT n×T p. We also define G = {G1, G2, . . . , GM} to be the set of groups defined on RT p formed by aggregating the rows of X that were originally in G̃, so that x is composed of groups G ∈ G. We next define a regularizer h that promotes sparsity both within and across overlapping sets of similar features:\nh(x) = inf W ∑ G∈G (αG‖wG‖2 + ‖wG‖1) s.t. ∑ G∈G wG = x (3)\nwhere the αG > 0 are constants that balance the tradeoff between the group norms and the `1 norm. Each wG has the same size as x, with support restricted to the variables indexed by group G. W is a set of vectors, where each vector has a support restricted to one of the groups G ∈ G:\nW = {wG ∈ RT p| [wG]i = 0 if i /∈ G}\nwhere [wG]i is the ith coefficient of wG. The SOSlasso is the optimization in (1) with h(x) as defined in (3).\nWe say the set of vectors wG is an optimal decomposition of x if they achieve the inf in (3). The objective function in (3) is convex and coercive. Hence, ∀x, an optimal decomposition always exists. As the αG → ∞ the `1 term becomes redundant, reducing h(x) to the overlapping group lasso penalty introduced in [6], and studied in [12, 13]. When the αG → 0, the overlapping group lasso term vanishes and h(x) reduces to the lasso penalty. We consider αG = 1 ∀G. All the results in the paper can be easily modified to incorporate different settings for the αG.\nSupport Values ∑ G ‖xG‖2 ‖x‖1 ∑ G (‖xG‖2 + ‖xG‖1)\n{1, 4, 9} {3, 4, 7} 12 14 26 {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} {2, 5, 2, 4, 5} 8.602 18 26.602 {1, 3, 4} {3, 4, 7} 8.602 14 22.602\nTable 1: Different instances of a 10-d vector and their corresponding norms.\nThe example in Table 1 gives an insight into the kind of sparsity patterns preferred by the function h(x). The optimization problems (1) and (2) will prefer solutions that have a small value of h(·).\nConsider 3 instances of x ∈ R10, and the corresponding group lasso, `1, and h(x) function values. The vector is assumed to be made up of two groups, G1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and G2 = {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}. h(x) is smallest when the support set is sparse within groups, and also when only one of the two groups is selected. The `1 norm does not take into account sparsity across groups, while the group lasso norm does not take into account sparsity within groups.\nTo solve (1) and (2) with the regularizer proposed in (3), we use the covariate duplication method of [6], to reduce the problem to a non overlapping sparse group lasso problem. We then use proximal point methods [8] in conjunction with the MALSAR [22] package to solve the optimization problem."

      "text" : "We derive certain key properties of the regularizer h(·) in (3), independent of the loss function used.\nLemma 3.1 The function h(x) in (3) is a norm The proof follows from basic properties of norms and because if wG,vG are optimal decompositions of x,y, then it does not imply that wG + vG is an optimal decomposition of x + y. For a detailed proof, please refer to the supplementary material.\nThe dual norm of h(x) can be bounded as\nh∗(u) = max x {xTu} s.t. h(x) ≤ 1 = max W { ∑ G∈G wTGuG} s.t. ∑ G∈G (‖wG‖2 + ‖wG‖1) ≤ 1\n(i) ≤ max W { ∑ G∈G wTGuG} s.t. ∑ G∈G 2‖wG‖2 ≤ 1\n= max W { ∑ G∈G wTGuG} s.t. ∑ G∈G ‖wG‖2 ≤ 1 2\n⇒ h∗(u) ≤ max G∈G\n1 2 ‖uG‖2 (4)\n(i) follows from the fact that the constraint set in (i) is a superset of the constraint set in the previous statement, since ‖a‖2 ≤ ‖a‖1. (4) follows from noting that the maximum is obtained by setting wG∗ =\nuG∗ 2‖uG∗‖2 , where G∗ = arg maxG∈G ‖uG‖2. The inequality (4) is far more tractable than the actual dual norm, and will be useful in our derivations below. Since h(·) is a norm, we can apply methods developed in [11] to derive consistency rates for the optimization problems (1) and (2). We will use the same notations as in [11] wherever possible.\nDefinition 3.2 A norm h(·) is decomposable with respect to the subspace pair sA ⊂ sB if h(a + b) = h(a) + h(b) ∀a ∈ sA, b ∈ sB⊥.\nLemma 3.3 Let x? ∈ Rp be a vector that can be decomposed into (overlapping) groups with withingroup sparsity. Let G? ⊂ G be the set of active groups of x?. Let S = supp(x?) indicate the support set of x. Let sA be the subspace spanned by the coordinates indexed by S, and let sB = sA. We then have that the norm in (3) is decomposable with respect to sA, sB\nThe result follows in a straightforward way from noting that supports of decompositions for vectors in sA and sB⊥ do not overlap. We defer the proof to the supplementary material.\nDefinition 3.4 Given a subspace sB, the subspace compatibility constant with respect to a norm ‖ ‖ is given by\nΨ(B) = sup\n{ h(x)\n‖x‖ ∀x ∈ sB\\{0} } Lemma 3.5 Consider a vector x that can be decomposed into G? ⊂ G active groups. Suppose the maximum group size is B, and also assume that a fraction α ∈ (0, 1) of the coordinates in each active group is non zero. Then,\nh(x) ≤ (1 + √ Bα) √ |G?|‖x‖2\nProof For any vector x with supp(x) ⊂ G?, there exists a representation x = ∑ G∈G? wG, such that the supports of the different wG do not overlap. Then,\nh(x) ≤ ∑ G∈G? (‖wG‖2 + ‖wG‖1) ≤ (1 + √ Bα) ∑ G∈G? ‖wG‖2 ≤ (1 + √ Bα) √ |G?|‖x‖2\nWe see that (1 + √ Bα) √ |G?| (Lemma 3.5) gives an upper bound on the subspace compatibility constant with respect to the `2 norm for the subspace indexed by the support of the vector, which is contained in the span of the union of groups in G?.\nDefinition 3.6 For a given set S, and given vector x?, the loss function LΦ(x) satisfies the Restricted Strong Convexity(RSC) condition with parameter κ and tolerance τ if\nLΦ(x? + ∆)− LΦ(x?)− 〈∇LΦ(x?),∆〉 ≥ κ‖∆‖22 − τ2(x?) ∀∆ ∈ S\nIn this paper, we consider vectors x? that lie exactly in k M groups, and display within-group sparsity. This implies that the tolerance τ(x?) = 0, and we will ignore this term henceforth.\nWe also define the following set, which will be used in the sequel:\nC(sA, sB,x?) := {∆ ∈ Rp|h(ΠsB⊥∆) ≤ 3h(ΠsB∆) + 4h(ΠsA⊥x?)} (5) where ΠsA(·) denotes the projection onto the subspace sA. Based on the results above, we can now apply a result from [11] to the SOSlasso:\nTheorem 3.7 (Corollary 1 in [11]) Consider a convex and differentiable loss function such that RSC holds with constants κ and τ = 0 over (5), and a norm h(·) decomposable over sets sA and sB. For the optimization program in (1), using the parameter λn ≥ 2h∗(∇LΦ(x?)), any optimal solution x̂λn to (1) satisfies\n‖x̂λn − x?‖22 ≤ 9λ2n κ Ψ2(sB)\nThe result above shows a general bound on the error using the lasso with sparse overlapping sets. Note that the regularization parameter λn as well as the RSC constant κ depend on the loss function LΦ(x). Convergence for logistic regression settings may be derived using methods in [1]. In the next section, we consider the least squares loss (2), and show that the estimate using the SOSlasso is consistent."

In (ii), we have defined σm = maxG σmG. Finally, we have made use of Lemma 4.1 in (iii). We then set\nc2 = log(M) + T B T Bn\nto obtain the result.\nWe combine the results developed so far to derive the following consistency result for the SOS lasso, with the least squares loss function.\nTheorem 4.3 Suppose we obtain linear measurements of a sparse overlapping grouped matrix X? ∈ Rp×T , corrupted by AWGN of variance σ2. Suppose the matrix X? can be decomposed into M possible overlapping groups of maximum size B, out of which k are active. Furthermore, assume that a fraction α ∈ (0, 1] of the coefficients are non zero in each active group.

This stems from the fact that the signal has a sparse structure “embedded” within a group sparse structure. Visualizing the optimization problem as that of solving a lasso within a group lasso framework lends some intuition into this result. Note that since α < 1, this bound is much smaller than that of the standard group lasso."

      "text" : "In this experiment, we compared SOSlasso, lasso, and Glasso in analysis of the star-plus dataset [20]. 6 subjects made judgements that involved processing 40 sentences and 40 pictures while their brains were scanned in half second intervals using fMRI1. We retained the 16 time points following each stimulus, yielding 1280 measurements at each voxel. The task is to distinguish, at each point in time, which stimulus a subject was processing. [20] showed that there exists cross-subject consistency in the cortical regions useful for prediction in this task. Specifically, experts partitioned each dataset into 24 non overlapping regions of interest (ROIs), then reduced the data by discarding all but 7 ROIs and, for each subject, averaging the BOLD response across voxels within each ROI and showed that a classifier trained on data from 5 subjects generalized when applied to data from a 6th.\nWe assessed whether SOSlasso could leverage this cross-individual consistency to aid in the discovery of predictive voxels without requiring expert pre-selection of ROIs, or data reduction, or any alignment of voxels beyond that existing in the raw data. Note that, unlike [20], we do not aim to learn a solution that generalizes to a withheld subject. Rather, we aim to discover a group sparsity pattern that suggests a similar set of voxels in all subjects, before optimizing a separate solution for each individual. If SOSlasso can exploit cross-individual anatomical similarity from this raw, coarsely-aligned data, it should show reduced cross-validation error relative to the lasso applied separately to each individual. If the solution is sparse within groups and highly variable across individuals, SOSlasso should show reduced cross-validation error relative to Glasso. Finally, if SOSlasso is finding useful cross-individual structure, the features it selects should align at least somewhat with the expert-identified ROIs shown by [20] to carry consistent information.\n1Data and documentation available at http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/project/theo-81/www/\nSO Sl as so\nG la ss o\nla ss o\nR\n(a)\n0.24\n0.26\n0.28\n0.3\n0.32\n0.34\n0.36\nlasso Glasso SOSlasso\nEr ro r\n(b)\nPicture only Sentence only Picture and Sentence\n(c)\nFigure 3: Results from fMRI experiments.

We group regions of 5×5×1 voxels and considered overlapping groups “shifted” by 2 voxels in the first 2 dimensions.2 Figure 3(b) shows the individual error rates across the 6 subjects for the three methods. Across subjects, SOSlasso had a significantly lower cross-validation error rate (27.47 %) than individual lasso (33.3 %; within-subjects t(5) = 4.8; p = 0.004 two-tailed), showing that the method can exploit anatomical similarity across subjects to learn a better classifier for each. SOSlasso also showed significantly lower error rates than glasso (31.1 %; t(5) = 2.92; p = 0.03 two-tailed), suggesting that the signal is sparse within selected regions and variable across subjects.\nFigure 3(a) presents a sample of the the sparsity patterns obtained from the different methods, aggregated over all subjects. Red points indicate voxels that contributed positively to picture classification in at least one subject, but never to sentences; Blue points have the opposite interpretation. Purple points indicate voxels that contributed positively to picture and sentence classification in different subjects. The remaining slices for the SOSlasso are shown in Figure 3(c). There are three things to note from Figure 3(a). First, the Glasso solution is fairly dense, with many voxels signaling both picture and sentence across subjects. We believe this “purple haze” demonstrates why Glasso is illsuited for fMRI analysis: a voxel selected for one subject must also be selected for all others. This approach will not succeed if, as is likely, there exists no direct voxel-to-voxel correspondence or if the neural code is variable across subjects. Second, the lasso solution is less sparse than the SOSlasso because it allows any task-correlated voxel to be selected. It leads to a higher cross-validation error, indicating that the ungrouped voxels are inferior predictors (Figure 3(b)). Third, the SOSlasso not only yields a sparse solution, but also clustered. To assess how well these clusters align with the anatomical regions thought a-priori to be involved in sentence and picture representation, we calculated the proportion of selected voxels falling within the 7 ROIs identified by [20] as relevant to the classification task (Table 2). For SOSlasso an average of 70% of identified voxels fell within these ROIs, significantly more than for lasso or Glasso."

Future work involves experimenting with different parameters for the group and l1 penalties, and using other similarity groupings, such as functional connectivity in fMRI.\n2The irregular group size compensates for voxels being larger and scanner coverage being smaller in the z-dimension (only 8 slices relative to 64 in the x- and y-dimensions)."

Then by definition,\nh(x+ y) ≤ ∑ G∈G (‖wG + vG‖+ ‖wG + vG‖1)\n≤ ∑ G∈G (‖wG‖+ ‖vG‖+ ‖wG‖1 + ‖vG‖1)\n= h(x) + h(y)\nThe first and second inequalities follow by definition and the triangle inequality respectively."

      "text" : "Analysis of fMRI data poses a number of computational and conceptual challenges. Healthy brains have much in common: anatomically, they have many of the same structures; functionally, there is rough correspondence among which structures underly which processes. Despite these high level commonalities, no two brains are identical, neither in their physical form nor their functional activity. Thus, to benefit from handling a multi-subject fMRI dataset as a multitask learning problem, a balance must be struck between similarity in macrostructure and dissimilarity in microstructure.\n(a) LASSO (b) Glasso\nStandard multi-subject analysis involve voxel-wise “massively univariate” statistical methods that test explicitly, independently at each datapoint in space, if that point is responding in the same way to the presence of a stimulus. To align voxels somewhat across subjects, each subject’s data is co-registered to a common atlas, but because only crude alignment is possible, datasets are also typically spatially blurred so that large scale region level effects are emphasized at the expense of idiosyncratic patterns of activity at a finer scale. This approach has many weaknesses, such as it’s blindness to the multivariate relationships among voxels, its reliance on unattainable alignment, and subsequent spatial blurring that restricts analysis to very coarse descriptions of the signal—problematic because it is now well established that a great deal of information is carried within these local distributed patterns [5].\nMutltitask learning has the potential to address these problems, by leveraging information across subjects in some way while discovering multivariate solutions for each subject. However, if the method requires that an identical set of features be used in all solutions, as with standard group lasso (Glasso; [21]), then the same problems with alignment and non-correspondence of voxels across subjects are confronted. In the main paper, we demonstrate this issue.\nSparse group lasso [16] and our extension, sparse overlapping sets lasso, were motivated by these multitask challenges in which similar but not identical sets of features are likely important across tasks. SOSlasso addresses the problem by solving for a sparsity pattern over a set of arbitrarily defined and potentially overlapping groups, and then allowing unique solutions for each task that draw from this sparse common set of groups. A related solution to the same problem is proposed in [9]."

      "text" : "We trained a classifier using 4-fold cross validation on the star plus dataset [20]. Figure 4 shows the discovered sparsity patterns in their entirety for the three methods considered, projected into a brain space that is the union over all size subjects; anatomical data was not available. In each slice, we aggregate the data for all the 6 subjects. Red points indicate voxels that contributed positively to picture classification in at least one subject, but never to sentences; Blue points have the opposite interpretation. Purple points indicate voxels that contributed positively to picture and sentence classification in different subjects.\nThe following observations are to be noted from Figure 4. The lasso solution (Figure 4(a)) results in a highly distributed sparsity pattern across individuals. This stems from the fact that the method does not explicitly take into account the similarities across brains of individuals, and hence does not look to “tie” the patterns together. Since the alignment is not perfect across brains, the 6 resulting patterns when aggregated result in a distributed pattern, and the largest error among the methods tested.\nThe Glasso (Figure 4(b)) for multitask learning ties a single voxel across 6 subjects into a single group. If a particular group is active, then all the coefficients in the group are active. Hence, if a particular voxel in a particular subject is selected, then the same (i, j, k) location in another subject will also be selected. This forced selection of voxels results in many coefficients that are almost but not exactly 0, and random signs as can be seen from the histogram of the selected voxels in Figure 4(c).\nThe lasso with Sparse Overlapping Sets (Figure 4(d)) overcomes the drawback of the Glasso by not forcing all the voxels at a particular location to be active. Also, since we consider 5× 5× 1 groups here, we also tend to group voxels that are spatially clustered. This results is selecting voxels in a subject that are “close-by” (in a spatial sense) to voxels in other subjects. The result is a more clustered sparsity pattern compared to the lasso, and very few ambiguous voxels compared to the Glasso.\nThe mere fact that we specify groups of colocated voxels does not account for the fact that we discovered clear sparse-group structure. Indeed, we trained the latent group lasso [6] with the same group size (5 × 5 × 1 voxels) and absolutely no structure was recovered, and classification performance was near chance (45% error, relative to chance 50%). It fails because of it’s inflexibility with respect to the voxels within groups. If a group is selected, all the voxels contained must be utilized by all subjects. This forces many detrimental voxels into individual solutions, and leads to no group out performing any others. As a result, almost all groups are activated, and the feature selection effort fails. SOSlasso succeeds because it allows task-specific within group sparsity, and because, by allowing overlap, the set of groups is larger. This second factor reduces the chance that the informative regions of the brain are not well captured in any group.\nAn advantage of using this dataset is that each subject’s brain was been partitioned into 24 regions of interests, and expert neuroscientists identified 7 of these regions in particular that ought to be especially involved in processing the pictures and sentences in this study [20]. No one expects that every neural unit in these regions behave the same way, and that identical sets of these neural units will be involved in different subject’s brains as they complete the study. But it is reasonable to expect that there will be similar sparse sets voxels in these regions across subjects that are useful to classifying the kind of stimulus being viewed. Because the signal is sparse within subjects, and because spatially similar voxels may be more correlated than spatially dissimilar voxels, standard lasso without multitask learning will miss this structure; because not all voxels within these regions are relevant in all subjects, standard Glasso—even Glasso set up to explicitly handle the 24 regions of interests as groups—will do poorly at recovering the expected pattern of group sparsity. SOSlasso is expected to excel at recovering this pattern, and as we show in Figure 5 our method finds solutions with a high proportion of voxels in these 7 expected ROIs, far higher than the other methods considered."

    "abstractText" : "Multitask learning can be effective when features useful in one task are also useful for other tasks, and the group lasso is a standard method for selecting a common subset of features. In this paper, we are interested in a less restrictive form of multitask learning, wherein (1) the available features can be organized into subsets according to a notion of similarity and (2) features useful in one task are similar, but not necessarily identical, to the features best suited for other tasks. The main contribution of this paper is a new procedure called Sparse Overlapping Sets (SOS) lasso, a convex optimization that automatically selects similar features for related learning tasks. Error bounds are derived for SOSlasso and its consistency is established for squared error loss. In particular, SOSlasso is motivated by multisubject fMRI studies in which functional activity is classified using brain voxels as features. Experiments with real and synthetic data demonstrate the advantages of SOSlasso compared to the lasso and group lasso.",
