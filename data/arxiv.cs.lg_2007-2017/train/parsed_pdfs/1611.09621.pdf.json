      "text" : "Associative memories aim to address a problem that naturally arises in many information processing systems: given a dataset M which consists of n-length vectors, design a mechanism to concisely store this dataset so that any future query corresponding to a noisy version of one of the vectors in the dataset can be mapped to the correct vector. An associative memory based solution to this problem is broadly required to have two key components: 1) dataset must be stored in the form of a neural network (graph) and 2) the mechanism to map a noisy query to the associated valid vector should be implementable in an iterative neurally feasible manner over the network (a neurally feasible algorithm employs only local computations at the nodes of the corresponding network based on the information obtained from their neighboring nodes). The tasks of learning the graph representation from the dataset and mapping erroneous vectors to the associated correct vectors are referred to as learning phase and recall phase, respectively.\nThe overarching goal of designing an associative memory that can store a large dataset (ideally containing exp(n) message vectors using a neural network with O(n) nodes) while ensuring robustness to a large number of errors (ideally Ω(n) errors) during the recall phase has led to multiple research efforts in the ∗This work was done when the author was with the Computer Science Department, Carnegie Mellon University, PA, USA.\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n09 62\n1v 1\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\nliterature. The binary Hopfield networks, as studied in [13, 22], provide one of the earliest designs for the associative memories. Given a dataset containing binary vectors from {±1}n, Hopfield networks learn this dataset in the form of an n-node weighted graph by employing Hebbian learning [11], i.e., the weighted adjacency matrix of the graph is defined by summing the outer products of all message vectors in the dataset. However, in their most general form, these networks suffer from small capacity. In [22], McEliece et al. show that these networks can only store O ( n\nlogn) message vectors when these messages correspond to arbitrary n-length binary vectors and the recall phase is required to tolerate linear Ω(n) random errors. This has motivated the researchers to look at various generalizations of Hopfield networks (see, [9,16,21,23,31] and references therein). However, these solutions again fail to simultaneously achieve both large capacity and error tolerance.\nOne remedy to small capacity is to design associative memories with structural assumptions on the dataset. This approach has been considered in [8, 12, 18–20, 27]. In particular in [8], Gripon et al. store a dataset comprising O(n2) sparse vectors in the form of cliques in a neural network. In [12], Hillar and Tran design a Hopfield network with n nodes that can store ∼ 2 √ 2n/n1/4 message vectors and is robust against n/2 random errors. In [18–20, 27], the message vectors that need to be stored are assumed to constitute a subspace. In [18, 19, 27], the task is to learn a bipartite factor graph of the linear constraints satisfied by the dataset subspace. The error correction during recall phase is then performed by running a belief propagation algorithm [26] over the bipartite graph. In [18], Karbasi et al. work with a model where the message vectors in the dataset have overlapping sets of coordinates so that shortened vectors obtained by restricting the original message vectors to each of these overlapping sets belong to a subspace. Under this model, they design associative memories that can store exponential number (in n) of message vectors while correcting linear number (in n) of random errors during the recall phase.\nThe results in [18] hinge on the fact that the learning phase of their memory design recovers a bipartite graph which has certain desirable structural properties that are required for belief propagation type decoders to converge. However, no guarantee of recovering such a bipartite graph during the learning phase is provided in [18] even when we assume the subspace associated with the dataset has one such graphical representation to begin with. Recognizing the requirement of learning correct bipartite graph during the learning phase, Mazumdar and Rawat explore a sparse recovery based approach to design associative memories with the subspace dataset model in [20]. This approach assumes that the dataset belongs to a subspace whose orthogonal subspace has null space property, a sufficient condition for sparse signal recovery. This allows one to learn any basis for the orthogonal subspace during the learning phase and then recast the recall phase as a sparse recovery problem [4, 6]. The approach in [20] also allows for the strong error model containing adversarial errors. Specifically, [20] considers two candidate signal models which contain n-length message vectors and utilize O(n) sized neural networks to store the signals. The two models have the datasets of sizes exp(n3/4) and exp(r) with 1 ≤ r ≤ n, respectively. Furthermore, the designed associative memories based on these two signal models respectively allow for recovery from Ω(n1/4) and Ω ( n−r\nlog6 n\n) adversarial\nerrors in a neurally feasible manner. In this paper, we also follow the subspace model as in [18–20, 27]. We assume the dataset to form a subspace which is defined by sparse linear constraints. The model of sparse linear constraints are quite natural and less restrictive than the previous models of works such as [20]. Note that this signal model is similar to the model explored in Karbasi et al. [18]. However, our approach and contributions differ from [18], as we ensure that the learning phase provably generates the correct bipartite graph which can guarantee the error correction from a large number of errors using an iterative algorithm during the recall phase. We also note that similar to [20] we work with the stronger error model involving adversarial errors, but our scheme is superior to that of [20] in terms of storage capacity (see, Theorems 1, 3) and number of correctable adversarial errors (improvement by poly-log factors, see, Theorems 1, 2, 3). We want to point out that the main technical challenge in associative memory is not to individually design the learning or\nrecall phases, but to interface them in a way that is consistent with the operations of both phases, and to give an end-to-end performance guarantee.\nHere, we note that the problem of designing an associative memory is closely related to the well studied nearest neighbor search (NNS) problem and its relaxation approximate nearest neighbor search (A-NNS) problem [2, 14, 28, 32]. The solutions to the A-NNS problem enable one to store a dataset in such a manner that noisy versions of the vectors in a dataset (with bounded noise) can be mapped to the correct vectors. Additionally, the A-NNS solutions do not put assumptions on the dataset. However, this comes at the cost of removing the requirement of having a fast iterative or neurally feasible recall phase. Furthermore, the A-NNS solutions, especially based on locally sensitive hashing [10, 14] have large space complexity, i.e., polynomial in size of dataset. We note that the A-NNS solutions are very much aligned to the vector (image) retrieval task [7, 17, 33] which need not have a neurally feasible retrieval algorithm.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2, we define the dataset model considered in this paper and present the main results of this paper along with key techniques and ideas involved in establishing those results. Sec. 3 is dedicated to the proof of the main theorem. In Sec. 3.1, we describe the learning phase of the associative memory design results along with the relevant technical details. In Sec. 3.2, we present an iterative error correction algorithm which is employed during the recall phase of the designed associative memory. This analysis of the algorithm relies on the expansion properties of the bipartite graph which defines the dataset and is learnt during the learning phase. We conclude the paper with some comments on performance in Sec. 5."

Let M ⊆ Rn denote the set of message vectors (signals) that need to be stored on the associative memory. Let B be an m × n matrix comprising the linear constraints that define the message setM. In particular, we have\nBx = 0 ∀ x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) ∈M. (1)\nIn order to fully specify the message setM, we still need to provide a stochastic model for the matrix B. Towards this, we consider a random ensemble of sparse matrices. For each j ∈ [n] := {1, 2, . . . , n}, we consider the following experiment. We pick d element uniformly at random with replacement from the set [m]. Let Nj denote the set comprising these randomly picked elements.

We work with various values of d which we specify while stating different parameters that we obtain for the designed associative memories in Sec. 2.2.\nThis model is a quite natural random model of bipartite graphs that allow for multi-edges. Indeed, consider a bipartite graph with disjoint sets of vertices [n] (variable nodes) and [m] (check nodes). There are d edges out of each variable node, being incident on uniformly and independently chosen vertices from the check nodes.\nRemark 1. The requirement on Ri,j is quite generic as it allows for many distributions. For example, we can assume that Ri,j belongs to a finite set of integers {−L,−L + 1, . . . ,−1, 1, . . . , L − 1, L}.

      "text" : "We establish that, for a datasetM corresponding to the null-space defined by the matrix B, the said matrix B can be exactly recovered from the dataset in polynomial time. Recall that there can be many sets of basis-vectors for the null-space ofM. Still, we claim that it is possible to accurately recover the matrix B that has been generated by the sparse-sub-Gaussian model described above.\nIt is essential for us that we recover the matrix B exactly. Being generated by the random model defined above, B exhibits certain graph expansion property that is necessary for our recall phase to be successful. This matrixB enables the error correction during the recall phase with the help of a simple iterative (neurally feasible algorithm). We summarize the parameters achieved by such memory as follows.\nTheorem 1. Suppose that c, c′, c′′ > 0 are three constants. Let n be a large enough integer and m = c nlogn . Assume that B is an m × n matrix generated from the sparse-sub-Gaussian model described in Sec. 2.1.1 with c′ ≤ d ≤ c′′ log n, andM = {x ∈ Rn : Bx = 0}. Then, with high probability (w.h.p.) M is an n−m = n(1− c/ log n) dimensional subspace that can be stored in a neural network (learned in poly-time in the learning phase) while allowing for correct recovery from Ω( n\nd2 log2 n ) adversarial errors during the\nrecall phase with a neurally feasible algorithm.\nThe proof of this theorem has been provided in Sec. 3. This result is obtained by utilizing a novel connection between recovering the matrix B defining the underlying datasetM and the dictionary learning problem with a square dictionary as studied in [1,3,30]. Given access to the datasetM, we can easily find a basis for the null-space ofM containingm = n−dim(M) n-length vectors. LetA denote them×nmatrix which has the m vectors in this basis as its rows. Note that the row vectors of B also span the subspace orthogonal to the dataset M. Moreover, w.h.p., B is a full rank matrix. This implies that the following relationship holds w.h.p.,\nA = DB, (4)\nwhere D is an invertible m × m matrix. Note that recovering the matrix B from A is now equivalent to dictionary learning problem [24] where n columns of A and B corresponds to n observations and the associated coefficients, respectively. Furthermore the matrix D corresponds to a square dictionary [30].\nAs for the recall phase, we rely on the observations (as shown in Sec. 3.2) that w.h.p. the bipartite graph associated with the sparse random matrix B is an expander graph. Assume that we are given a noisy version y of a valid message vector x ∈M such that we have\ny = x + e (5)\nwhere e denotes the error vector. Recovering x from the observation y can be cast as a sparse recovery problem of recovering e from\nz = By = B(x + e) = Be.\nIf the bipartite graphs associated with B is an expander graph (which holds w.h.p.), we can solve this sparse recovery problem by an efficient and iterative algorithm [15] which is motivated by the decoding algorithm of expander codes [29] in coding theory literature.\nDue to the sample complexity requirements for efficient square-dictionary learning algorithms [1,3,30], the above model allows us to store datasets that satisfy at most O\n( n\nlogn\n) linear constraints. However if we\nallow for a learning-phase that takes quasi-polynomial time, then it is possible to store restricted datasets that satisfy m = Θ(n) sparse-linear constraints. We summarize the result below.\nTheorem 2. Let n be a large enough integer and m = cn for a some constant c < 1/200. For a large enough constant C > 0, letB be anm×n matrix generated from the sparse-sub-Gaussian model described in Sec. 2.1.1 with d = C log n and M = {x ∈ Rn : Bx = 0}. Then w.h.p., M is an n − m = n(1− c) dimensional subspace that can be stored in a neural network (learned in quasi-polynomial-time in the learning phase) while allowing for error correction from Ω( n\nlog2 n ) adversarial errors during the recall\nphase with a neurally feasible algorithm.\nWhile in terms of storage capacity this theorem is inferior to that of Theorem 1, it may represent some datasets better, and has better error correction capability. While the recall phase of this algorithm works same as above, for the learning phase we can no longer rely on the dictionary-learning algorithms. Instead we do an exhaustive search over all possible sparse vectors to find out a sparse basis for the null-space ofM which end up taking a quasi-polynomial time, if we choose parameters suitable for the recall phase. We here crucially use the fact that for m = cn and d = C log n such a sparse basis is unique, which can be obtained from the results of [30]. The proof of the recall phase for this theorem remains same as that of Theorem 1.\nFinally, while both Theorems 1 and 2 have their counterparts when storing binary vectors, we present only one result for brevity. A sketch of the proof of the following theorem has been given in Sec. 4.\nTheorem 3 (Binary dataset). Suppose that c, c′, c′′ > 0 are three constants. Let n be a large enough integer such that m = c nlogn . Assume that B is an m × n matrix generated from the binary dataset model described in Sec. 2.1.2 with c′ ≤ d ≤ c′′ log n and M = {x ∈ {±1}n : Bx = 0}. Then w.h.p., |M| = exp(n−αn log(d log n)/ log n) for a constant α andM can be stored in a neural network (learned in polynomial-time in the learning phase) while allowing for error correction from O( n\nd2 log2 n ) adversarial\nerrors during the recall phase with a neurally feasible algorithm."

Only a representative figure is presented here (Fig. 2). We consider three sets of system parameters (m,n, d) for the dataset to be stored. For each set of parameters, we first generate an m × n random matrix B according to the sparse-sub-Gaussian model (cf. Sec. 2.1). Each non-zero entry of the matrix B is drawn uniformly at random from the set {±1,±2,±3}. We then generate multiple message vectors which belong to the subspace orthogonal to all the rows of the matrix B and provide the learning phase with these vectors. Given these vectors we employ the dictionary learning based approach described in Sec. 3.1.1 to obtain an estimate B̂ for the matrix B. As guaranteed by Theorem 4, in our simulations, B̂ contains all the rows of the original matrix B (however, in a different order). For all three sets of parameters under consideration, we then utilize the estimate B̂ to evaluate the performance of the expander decoding based recall phase (cf. Sec. 3.2). For a fixed number E of errors, we generate 100 error vectors e ∈ Rn with the number of non-zero entries in each error vector equal to E. The non-zero entries in these vectors are uniformly generated from the set {±1, . . . ,±4}. The positions of the non-zeros entries in each of these vectors are chosen according to a uniform random permutation on the set [n].\nStudent Version of MATLAB\nThe performance of the recall algorithm in our simulations is illustrated in Fig. 2 where we plot the fraction of incorrectly recovered error vectors as we increase the number of errors.

On the other hand, increasing m while keeping d and the ratio mn fixed improves the performance of the recall phase.\nConcluding remarks While we use dictionary learning as a tool in the learning phase, the model of our datasets are subspace models. A large number of datasets on the other hand are also modeled by the sparse dictionary model (or union of subspaces). It is of interest to design associative memories, where the datasets are modeled as such. One other possible direction of future research would be to consider a subspace model with a mixture of sparse and dense constraints, which potentially will be inclusive of larger classes of real datasets. For such datasets, under suitable assumption on the generative model, one can potentially employ the techniques of recovering planted sparse vectors in a subspace spanned by dense random sub-Gaussian vectors [5,25] and utilize the recovered sparse constraints to design an iterative recall phase similar to the one presented in this paper. As in the case of [18], the networks (graphs) appearing in our associative memory design share some similarities with the neural networks used for classification tasks. It is an interesting problem to further explore such connections."

      "text" : "In [30], Spielman et al. consider the following problem of exact dictionary learning. Let D ∈ Rm×m be an invertible matrix also referred to as the dictionary. Given n observations\nuj = Dvj for j ∈ [n], (13)\nthe task is to exactly learn the dictionary D and the coefficient matrix\nV = [v1,v2, . . . ,vn] ∈ Rm×n.\nSpielman et al. assume that the coefficient vectors of the observation are randomly generate so that the entries of the coefficient matrix V are independent and identically distributed [30]. In particular, let\nVi,j = ηi,jRi,j ,\nwhere ηi,j ∈ {0, 1} and Ri,j ∈ R are independent random variables. In particular, for some constant α, they assume that\nP { ηi,j = 1 } = 1− P { ηi,j = 0 } = θ ∈ [ 2 m , α√ m ] , (14)\nand Ri,j is a zero mean sub-Gaussian random variable such that\nE [ |Ri,j | ] ≥ 1\n10 and P\n{ |Ri,j | ≥ t } ≤ 2 exp(−t2/2).\nThis random generative model for the coefficients V is referred to as Bernoulli-sub-Gaussian model. Under the Bernoulli-sub-Gaussian model, Spielman et al. show that the dictionary learning problem is well defined. In particular, as long as n ≥ Ω(m logm), for an alternative representation of the observations\nU = [u1,u2, . . . ,un] = D ′V ′,\nwhereA′ ∈ Rm×m is an invertible matrix and V ′ ∈ Rm×n is coefficient matrix with the per-column sparsity bounded by that of the original coefficient matrix V , we have\nD′ = DΠΛ\nand V ′ = Λ−1ΠV.\nHere, Λ ∈ Rm×m and Π ∈ Rm×m denote a diagonal matrix and a permutation matrix, respectively. This implies that for n ≥ Ω(m logm), any other representation of the observations which is explained by a square dictionary and the sparsest coefficient vectors have its dictionary and coefficient matrix as some permutation and scaling of the columns and rows of the original dictionary D and the coefficient matrix V , respectively. Furthermore, Spielman et al. also present an algorithm for the exact dictionary learning problem that recovers the dictionaryD (up to scaling and permutations of the columns ofD) and the coefficient matrix V (up to scaling and permutations of the rows of V ) provided that n = O(m2 log2m) samples. Recently, Adamczak further improve the sample complexity of the dictionary learning algorithm2 to n = O(m logm) [1]. Since we rely on the dictionary learning algorithm in this paper, we describe the algorithm in Fig. 3 and present the exact recovery guarantees from [1].\n2In [1], Adamczak analyze a slight modification of the dictionary learning algorithm proposed by Spielman et al.\nModiefied ER-SpUD (DC): Exact recovery of sparsely-used dictionaries using the sum of two columns of U as constraint vectors.\nInput: n observations U = [u1,u2, . . . ,un] ∈ Rm×n. 1: Initialize the set V = ∅. 2: for i = 1, . . . , n− 1 do 3: for j = i+ 1, . . . , n do 4: Let rij = ui + uj . 5: Solve minimizew∈Rm‖w\nTU‖1 subject to rTijw = 1, and set sij = wTY ∈ Rn. 6: V = V ∪ {sij} 7: end for 8: end for 9: for i = 1, . . . ,m do\n10: Repeat 11: vi ← argminv∈V‖v‖0, breaking ties arbitrarily 12: V = V\\{vi}. 13: Until rank([v1,v2, . . . ,vi]) = i. 14: end for Output: V = [v1,v2, . . . ,vm]T and D = UUT (V V T )−1.\nFigure 3: Description of the dictionary learning algorithm from [1].\nProposition 3. There exists absolute constants c, α ∈ (0,∞) such that if\n2 m ≤ θ ≤ α√ m\nand V follows the Bernoulli-sub-Gaussian model with parameter θ, then for n ≥ cm logm, with probability at least 1 − 1/n the modified ER-SpUD algorithm (cf. Fig. 3) successfully recovers all the rows of V , i.e., multiples of all the rows of U are present among the set V .\nA.1 Proof of Theorem 4\nIn this section we highlight the proof of Theorem 4 which provides the guarantees for the exact recovery of the matrix B using the learning algorithm described in Fig. 3. In [1, Theorem 1.1], Adamczak establishes the analogue of Theorem 4 for m×n matrices generated by the Bernoulli-sub-Gaussian model (cf. Sec. A). Theorem 4 can be established by suitably modifying the analysis of Adamczak which comprises four main steps as highlighted in [1, Sec. 2.1]. Due to the small differences between the sparse-sub-Gaussian model (cf. Sec. 2.1) for the matrixB considered in this paper and the Bernoulli-sub-Gaussian model from [1], these steps continue to work after small modifications in the analysis. In the rest of this section, we demonstrate this by establishing Lemma 1 for the sparse-sub-Gaussian model which is analogue to [1, Lemma 2.4] for the Bernoulli-sub-Gaussian model. The analogue to other key lemmas from [1] can be similarly obtained.\nLet’s first define the required notation. In what follows, for p ≥ 1,\n‖v‖p := ( m∑ i=1 vpi )1/p\ndenotes the `p-norm of the vector v ∈ Rm. Moreover, we use Bm1 ⊂ Rm to denote the set of m-length vectors with unit `1-norm, i.e.,\nBm1 := { v ∈ Rm : ‖v‖1 = 1 } .\nIn [1], Adamczak proves the following concentration result using Bernstein’s inequality and Talagrand’s contraction principle. Here, we restate this result as it is utilized in the proof of Lemma 1 below.\nProposition 4. [1, Proposition 2.1] Let R1, R2, . . . , Rn ∈ Rm and ξ1, ξ2, . . . , ξn ∈ {0, 1}m be two sets of independent random vectors. Assume that for some constant L, we have\nE [ e|Ri,j |/L ] ≤ 2 ∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n. (15)\nFurthermore, assume that we have P { ξi,j = 1 } ≤ θ ∀ 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n. (16)\nLet Z1, Z2, . . . , Zn ∈ Rm be n random vectors defined as follows.\nZj = ( R1,jξ1,j , R2,jξ2,j , . . . , Rm,jξm,j )T ∀ 1 ≤ j ≤ n. (17) Consider the random variable\nW = supv∈Bm1 ∣∣∣∣∣∣ 1n n∑ j=1 ( vTZj − E [ vTZj ])∣∣∣∣∣∣ . (18) Then, for some universal constant C and every q ≥ max(2, logm), we have\n‖W‖q ≤ C\nn\n(√ nqθ + q ) L (19)\nand\nP { W ≥ Ce\nn\n(√ nqθ + q ) L } ≤ e−q. (20)\nBefore we proceed, we make the following simple claim about our generative model.\nClaim 1. For the random matrix ensemble generated by the sparse-sub-Gaussian model (cf. Sec. 2.1), whenever d = o(m), we have have the following\n( 1− o(1) ) d m ≤ P { ξi,j = 1 } = 1− ( 1− 1 m )d ≤ d m .\nWe now present the following result which is analogue to [1, Lemma 2.4].\nLemma 1. Let S ⊆ [n] be a fixed subset of size |S| < n4 . Let X ∈ R m×n be an m × n matrix which is generated as follows.\n(i) For every j ∈ S̄ := [n]\\S, we pick d elements uniformly at random from [m] with replacement. Let Nj ⊆ [m] denote the set of picked elements. LetRj = (R1,j , R2,j , . . . , Rm,j)T ∈ Rm be a vector containing i.i.d. sub-Gaussian random variables and ξj ∈ {0, 1}m denote the indicator vector for the set Nj ⊆ [m]. Now the j-th column of the matrixX is defined asXj = (ξ1,jR1,j , ξ2,jR2,j , . . . , ξm,jRm,j)T ∈ Rm.\n(ii) Let s ≤ 2d. For every j ∈ S, we pick d elements uniformly at random from the set [m + s] with replacement. Let Ñj ⊆ [m + s] denote the set of picked elements. We take a subset Nj = Ñj ∩ [m]. LetRj = (R1,j , R2,j , . . . , Rm,j)T ∈ Rm be a vector containing i.i.d. sub-Gaussian random variables and ξj ∈ {0, 1}m denote the indicator vector for the setNj ⊆ [m]. Now the j-th column of the matrix X is defined as Xj = (ξ1,jR1,j , ξ2,jR2,j , . . . , ξm,jRm,j)T ∈ Rm.\nLet XS denote the sub-matrix of X comprising the columns indexed by the set S ⊆ [n]. Then, with probability at least 1− n−8, for any v ∈ Rm, we have\n‖vTX‖1 − 2‖vTXS‖1 ≥ Ω ( nµ √ θ\nm\n) ‖v‖1, (21)\nwhere θ = dm and E [ |Ri,j | ] ≤ µ.\nProof. It follows from Proposition 4 that, with probability at least 1− n−8, we have that\nsup v∈Bm1 ∣∣‖vTX‖1 − E[‖vTX‖]1∣∣ ≤ C (√nθ log n+ log n) ≤ 2C √ nθ log n\nand\nsup v∈Bm1 ∣∣‖vTXS‖1 − E[‖vTXS‖]1∣∣ ≤ 2C√nθ log n. This implies that for any v ∈ Rm, we have that\n‖vTX‖1 ≥ E [ ‖vTX‖ ] 1 − 2C √ nθ log n‖v‖1\nand\n‖vTXS‖1 ≤ E [ ‖vTXS‖ ] 1 + 2C √ nθ log n‖v‖1.\nCombining these two inequalities, we obtain that the following holds for each v ∈ Rm.\n‖vTX‖1 − 2‖vTXS‖1 ≥ E [ ‖vTX‖ ] 1 − 2E [ ‖vTXS‖ ] 1\n− 6C √ nθ log n‖v‖1\n= ∑ j∈S E [ ∣∣vTXj∣∣ ]+∑\nj∈S̄\nE [ ∣∣vTXj∣∣ ]− 2∑ j∈S E [ ∣∣vTXj∣∣ ]\n− 6C √ nθ log n‖v‖1\n= ∑ j∈S̄ E [ ∣∣vTXj∣∣ ]−∑ j∈S E [ ∣∣vTXj∣∣ ]\n− 6C √ nθ log n‖v‖1. (22)\nWe now bound E [ ∣∣vTXj∣∣ ] for j ∈ S. Recall that all the columns of the matrix X indexed by the set S are identically distributed. Similarly, all the columns of the matrix X indexed by the set S̄ = [n]\\S are identically distributed. In the following, we use Z = (Z1, . . . , Zm)T and Ẑ = (Ẑ1, . . . , Ẑm)T to denote two random vectors with their distribution identical to the columns of the matrixX indexed by the set S̄ and S, respectively.\nE [∣∣vT Ẑ∣∣] = E[∣∣vT (Ẑ + Z − Z)∣∣]\n≤ E [∣∣vTZ∣∣]+ E[∣∣vT (Z − Ẑ)∣∣]\n≤ E [∣∣vTZ∣∣]+ µE[ m∑\ni=1\n|vi|Wi ] . (23)\nHere, for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, Wi = ∑d l=1 Y l i denotes the sum of d indicator random variable which are defined as follows.\nY li =\n{ 1 with probability 2dm+2d 1 m\n0 with probability 1− 2dm+2d 1 m .\n(24)\nCombining (23) and (24), we obtain\nE [∣∣vT Ẑ∣∣] ≤ E[∣∣vTZ∣∣]+ µ 2d2\n(m+ 2d)m ‖v‖1\n≤ E [∣∣vTZ∣∣]+ µ2d2\nm2 ‖v‖1. (25)\nNote that we have\nE [∣∣vTXj∣∣] = E[∣∣vT Ẑ∣∣] ∀ j ∈ S (26)\nE [∣∣vTXj∣∣] = E[∣∣vTZ∣∣] ∀ j ∈ S̄ = [n]\\S. (27)\nTherefore, combining (22) and (25), we obtain that for any v ∈ Rm,\n‖vTX‖1 − 2‖vTXS‖1 ≥ (p− 2|S|)E [∣∣vTZ∣∣]\n− |S|µ2d 2\nm2 ‖v‖1 − 4C\n√ nθ log n‖v‖1. (28)\nNow using m = c nlogn , d ≤ c ′′ log n and the lower bound on E [∣∣vTZ∣∣] from [1, Lemma 2.3], one can argue that\n‖vTX‖1 − 2‖vTXS‖1 ≥ Ω ( nµ √ θ\nm\n) ‖v‖1. (29)"
