      "text" : "Future projections of climate variables such as temperature, precipitation, and pressure are usually produced by physics-based models known as Earth System Models (ESMs). ESMs consist of four components and their interactions, viz. atmosphere, oceans, land, and sea ice (Tebaldi and Knutti, 2007; IPCC, 2013). Climate projections generated from ESMs form the basis for understanding and inferring future climate change, global warming, greenhouse gas concentration and its impact on Earth systems and other complex phenomena such as El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO, for instance, has a global impact, ranging from droughts in Australia and northeast Brazil to heavy rains over Malaysia, the Philippines, and Indonesia (IPCC, 2013). Then, producing accurate projections of climate variables is essential to anticipate extreme events.\n∗Paper published in the 31st AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI’17). San Francisco, CA. 2017.\nar X\niv :1\n70 1.\n08 84\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 3\n0 Ja\nn 20\nMany ESMs have been developed by climate research institutes. A single and possibly more robust projection can be built as a combination (ensemble) of multiple ESMs simulations (Tebaldi and Knutti, 2007; McQuade and Monteleoni, 2013; Sanderson et al., 2015).\nRecently, the problem of constructing ESMs ensemble was approached from a multitask learning (MTL) perspective (Gonçalves et al., 2014), where building an ESMs ensemble for each geographical location was viewed as a learning task. The joint estimation of the ESM ensemble produced more accurate projections than when independent estimation was performed for each location. The MTL method was able to capture the relationship among geographical locations (tasks) and used it to guide information sharing among tasks.\nModeling task relationship in multitask learning has been the focus of recent research (Zhang and Schneider, 2010; Zhang and Yeung, 2010; Yang et al., 2013; Gonçalves et al., 2016). This is a fundamental step to promote information sharing only among related tasks, while avoiding the unrelated ones. Besides estimating task specific parameters (Θ), the task dependency structure (Ω) is also estimated from the data. The latter is usually estimated from the former, i.e., task dependency is defined based on the relation of the task parameters. Two tasks are said to be related if their parameters are related in some sense.\nInconsistently estimated task dependency structure in MTL can misguide information sharing and, hence, can be harmful to the MTL method performance. The problem of estimating statistical dependency structure of a set of random variables is known as structure learning (Meinshausen and Buhlmann, 2006). Existing methods for the problem guarantee to recover the true underlying dependence structure given a sufficient amount of data samples. In the MTL case (Gonçalves et al., 2016), the random variables are tasks parameters and, depending on the ratio between dimensionality and the number of tasks, the amount of data samples may not be sufficient.\nIn this paper, we introduce the Hierarchical Multitask Learning (HMTL) method that jointly learn multiple tasks by letting each task be, by itself, a MTL problem. The associated hierarchical multitask learning problem is then said to be composed of super-tasks and the tasks involved in each super-task as sub-tasks. Our formulation is motivated by the problem of constructing ESM ensembles for multiple climate variables, with multiple geolocations for each variable. The problem of obtaining ESMs weights for all regions for a certain climate variable is a super-task.\nThe paper is organized as follows. We first discuss existing MTL methods with task dependency estimation, on which our proposed ideas are built; then, we briefly talk about the climate projection problem that motived our work. In the sequel, we present our proposed framework, perform experiments and analyze the results. Concluding remarks and next research steps complete the paper.\nNotation. Let T be the number of super-tasks, d the problem dimension, and n(t,k) the number of samples for the (t, k)-th sub-task. For the purposes of the current paper, we assume that all super-tasks have m sub-tasks and all sub-tasks have problem dimension d. X(t,k) ∈ Rn(t,k)×d and y(t,k) ∈ Rn(t,k)×1 are the input and output data for the k-th sub-task of the t-th super-task. Θ(t) ∈ Rd×m is the matrix whose columns are the set of weights for all sub-tasks for the t-th super-task, that is, Θ(t) = [θ(t,1), ...,θ(t,m)]. For the ease of exposition, we represent {X} = X(t,k) and {Y } = y(t,k), k = 1, ...,mt; t = 1, ..., T . For the weight and precision matrices, {Θ} = Θ(t) and {Ω} = Ω(t),∀t = 1, ..., T . Identity matrix of dimension m×m is denoted by Im. U(a, b) is an uniform probability distribution in the range [a,b]."

      "text" : "Explicitly modeling task dependencies has been made by means of Bayesian models. Features across tasks (rows of the parameter matrix Θ) were assumed to be drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Task relationship is then encoded in the inverse of the covariance matrix Σ−1 = Ω, also known as precision matrix. Sparsity is desired in such matrix, as zero entries of the precision matrix indicate conditional independence between the corresponding two random variables (tasks) (Friedman et al., 2008). The associated learning problem (1) consists of jointly estimating the task parameters Θ and the precision matrix Ω, which is done by an alternating optimization procedure.\nmin Θ,Ω m∑ k=1 L(Xk,yk,Θ)− log |Ω|+ λ0tr(ΘΩΘ>) +R(Θ,Ω)\ns.t. Ω 0. (1)\nNote that in (1) the regularization penalty R(Θ,Ω) is a general penalization function that will be discussed later in the paper. A solution for (1) alternates between the following two steps until a stopping criterion is met:\nStep 1 Estimate Θ from current estimation of Ω;\nStep 2 Estimate Ω from updated parameters Θ.\nSetting initial Ω to identity matrix, i.e., all tasks are independent at the beginning, is usually a suitable start.\nIn Step 1, task dependency information is incorporated into the joint cost function through the trace term penalty tr(ΘΩΘ>). It helps to promote information exchange among tasks. The problem associated with Step 2, known as sparse inverse covariance selection problem (Friedman et al., 2008), seeks to find some sparsity pattern in the precision matrix. Experimental analysis have shown that these approaches usually outperform MTL with pre-defined task dependency structure for a variety of problems (Zhang and Schneider, 2010; Gonçalves et al., 2014)."

      "heading" : "3 Mathematical Formulation of ESMs Climate Projection",
      "text" : "A common projection method is to perform the combination of multiple ESMs in a least square sense, that is, to estimate a set of weights for the ESMs based on past observations.\nFor a given location k the predicted climate variable (temperature, for example) for a certain timestamp i (expected mean temperature for a certain month/year, for example) is given by:\nŷik = 〈xik,θk〉+ ik (2)\nwhere xik is the set of values predicted by the ESMs for the k-th location in the timestamp i, θk is the weight vector of each ESM for the k-th location, and ik is a residual. The weight vector θk is estimated from a training data. The combined estimate ŷik is then used as a more robust prediction of temperature for the k-th location in a certain month/year in the future.\nESMs weights (θk) are defined for each geographical location and it possibly varies for different locations. It is possible that some ESMs are more accurate for some regions/climate than others\nand the difference between weights of two locations will reflect this behavior. In summary, the ESMs ensemble consists of solving a least square problem for each geographical location.\nThe ESMs weights may vary for the prediction of different climate variables, such as precipitation, temperature, and pressure. Then, solving an MTL problem for each climate variable is required. In this paper, we propose to simultaneously tackle multiple MTL problems through a hierarchical (two-level) MTL formulation."

      "heading" : "4 The HMTL Formulation",
      "text" : "The HMTL formulation seeks to minimize the following cost function C(Γ) with Γ = {{Θ}, {Ω}, λ0}:\nL(Γ) = T∑ t=1 ( mt∑ k=1 L ( X(t,k)θ(t,k),y(t,k) ) − log |Ω(t)|+ λ0tr ( S(t)Ω(t) )) +R({Ω}) (3)\nwhere R({Ω}) is a regularization term over the precision matrices, S(t) is the sample covariance matrix of the task parameters for the t-th super-task. For simplicity, we dropped the `1-penalization on the weight matrix Θ as is often done in MTL (Zhang and Schneider, 2010; Yang et al., 2013; Gonçalves et al., 2016). However, it can be added, if one desires sparse Θ, with minor changes in the algorithm. All super-tasks are assumed to have the same number of sub-tasks. Squared loss was used as loss function.\nThe formulation (3) is a penalized cumulative cost function of the form (1) for several multitask learning problems. The penalty function R({Ω}) is to favor common structural sparseness across the precision matrices. Here, we focus on the group lasso penalty (Yuan and Lin, 2006), which we denote by RG, and is defined as\nRG({Ω}) = λ1 T∑ t=1 ∑ k 6=j |Ω(t)kj |+ λ2 ∑ k 6=j √√√√ T∑ t=1 Ω (t)2 kj (4)\nwhere λ1 and λ2 are two nonnegative tuning parameters. The first penalty term is an `1-penalization of the off-diagonal elements, so that non-structured sparsity in the precision matrices is enforced. The larger the value of λ1, the sparser the precision matrices. The second term of the group sparsity penalty encourages the precision matrices for different super-tasks to have the same sparsity pattern. Group lasso does not impose any restriction on the degree of similarity of the non-zero entries of the precision matrices.\nSetting λ2 to zero, super-tasks are decoupled into independent MTL formulations. Then, λ2 can be seen as a coupling parameter, as larger values push the super-tasks to be coupled, so that different Ω(t) have similar sparsity patterns. On the other hand, lower (or zero) values lead to decoupled super-tasks, recovering existing MTL formulations, such as in (Gonçalves et al., 2014).\nFigure 1 shows the hierarchy of tasks for the projection of multiple climate variables. At the level of super-tasks, group lasso regularization encourages precision matrices to have a similar sparseness pattern. The learned precision matrices are consequently used to control with whom each sub-task will share information.\nThe correspondence between the variables in the HMTL formulation and the elements in the climate problem is shown in Table 1."

Both steps now consist of convex problems, for which efficient methods have been proposed. In the experiments, 20 to 30 iterations were required for convergence."

      "text" : "A lattice graph is used to represent the regional relationship in (Subbian and Banerjee, 2013), where immediate neighbor locations are assumed to have similar ESMs weights. Weights for all geolocations are estimated jointly (in a least square sense) with graph Laplacian regularization to encourage spatial smoothness.\nIn (McQuade and Monteleoni, 2013) the online ESMs ensemble problem is tackled by using a lattice Markov Random Field. The state of each hidden variable, which is associated with a geographical location, is the identity of the best ESM for that specific location. The marginal probabilities of the hidden variables act as the weights of the ensemble. Hence, ESMs with a higher probability of being the best has a larger weight in the ensemble. At each time step marginal probabilities are updated based on the performance of the ESMs in the previous time step via the loopy belief propagation algorithm.\nDifferently, (Gonçalves et al., 2014) do not assume any fixed dependence graph, but, instead, estimate it through a multitask learning model that makes use of a sparse Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) to capture the relationship of ESMs weights among locations. ESM weights for all locations and the GMRF are jointly estimated via an alternating minimization scheme.\nOur work differs from the existing research as it (1) leverages information not only from immediate neighbors but also from any related geographical locations; (2) allows two levels of information sharing: ESMs weights and precision matrices that encodes the relationship of locations; and (3) handles the projection of multiple climate variables (exploring their resemblance) simultaneously."

      "text" : "We first generated a synthetic dataset to assess the performance of HMTL over traditional MTL methods. For comparison, we used the MTL method proposed in (Gonçalves et al., 2014, 2016), called MSSL, that has shown to be competitive with existing MTL algorithms including (Zhang and Yeung, 2010; Kumar and Daume III, 2012; Kang et al., 2011). We also seek to investigate the effect of the increase in the number of super-tasks. For this analysis we generated 7 super-tasks containing 15 sub-tasks each, with dimension of 50. For each sub-task 100 data samples were generated. Inverse covariance matrices Ω(t), t = 1, ..., T were drawn from a Wishart distribution with a scale matrix Λ and n = 10 degrees of freedom. Scale matrix Λ was designed to reflect a structure containing three groups of related variables. As sampled precision matrices are also likely to present the group structure, jointly sparse precision matrices are suitable to capture such pattern, which is precisely what HMTL formulation assumes.\nGiven Ω(t), the sub-tasks parameters Θ(t) were constructed as: Θ(t)(j, :) = N (0,Ω(t)), j = 1, .., d; and, finally, the design matrix X(t,k) were sampled from N (0, I), and Y (t,k) = X(t,k)Θ(t) + (t,k), where (t,k) ∼ N (0, 0.1), ∀k = 1, ..,m; t = 1, .., T.\nTen independent runs for both HMTL and MSSL were carried out. Each run with a different random train/test data split. Table 2 shows the relative improvement1 of HMTL over MSSL for distinct number of super-tasks. Two scenarios were tested: using 50 and 30 samples for training and the remaining for test (50 and 70, respectively). Penalization parameters (λ’s) were chosen by cross-validation on the training set.\nFrom Table 2, we observe that HMTL has a continuous increase on the relative improvement compared to independently running MSSL, as the number of super-tasks grows. From the sixth super-task on, the relative improvement shows a tendency to stabilize. Such behavior is also observed in the scenario with only 30 training samples. It is worth noting that the smaller a set of training data (30 samples) the sharper the improvements obtained by HMTL over MSSL."

Clearly, the length of the training period affects the performance of the algorithm. A moving window of 20, 30 and 50 years were used for training and the next 10 years for test. The performance is measured in terms of root-mean-squared error (RMSE).\nSeasonality strongly affect climate data analysis. Winter and summer precipitation patterns, for example, are distinct. Also, by looking at seasonal data, it becomes easier to identify anomalous\n1Relative improvement is given by the difference between MSSL and HMTL performance (RMSE) divided by MSSL performance as percents (%).\npatterns, possibly useful to characterize climate phenomena as El Niño. We extracted summer and winter data and performed climate variable projection specifically for these seasons.\nFive baseline algorithms were considered:\n1. multi-model average (MMA): set equal weights for all ESMs. This is currently performed by IPCC (IPCC, 2013);\n2. best-ESM in training phase: it is not an ensemble, but a single best ESM in terms of mean squared error;\n3. ordinary least square (OLS): perform independent OLS for each location and climate variable;\n4.

Using this protocol, the selected parameter values were: S2M2R used λ = 1000; MSSL λ0 = 0.1 and λ1 = 0.1; and HMTL λ0 = 0.1, λ1 = 0.0002, λ2 = 0.01."

First, we note that simply assigning equal weights to all ESMs does not seem to exploit the potential of ensemble methods. MMA (as used by IPCC, (IPCC, 2013)) presented the largest RMSE among the algorithms for the majority of periods (summer, winter and year) and number of years for training. Second, the MTL methods, MSSL and HMTL, clearly outperform the baseline methods. S2M2R does not always produce better projections than OLS. In fact, it is slightly worse for the year dataset. As expected, the assumption of spatial neighborhood dependence does not seem to hold for all climate variables.\nHMTL presented better results than performing MSSL for precipitation and temperature independently in many situations. HMTL was able to significantly reduce RMSE in summer precipitation projections, which has shown to be the most challenging scenario. Significant improvement was also seen for winter and year temperature projections.\nRMSE per geographical location for precipitation and temperature are presented in Figure 2. For precipitation, more accurate projections (lower RMSE) was obtained by HMTL in Northernmost regions of South America, including Colombia and Venezuela. More accurate temperature projections were obtained in central North region of South America, which comprises part of the Amazon rainforest.\nWe believe that the improvements of the hierarchical MTL model are due to the same reasons as general MTL models: reduction of sample complexity by leveraging information from other related super-tasks. As a consequence, the precision matrices, which guide information sharing among subtasks, are estimated more accurately. The reduced sample complexity probably explains the better climate variable prediction capacity in situations with limited amount of measurements (samples), as the results shown in Table 2."

A group lasso regularization is responsible for capturing similar sparsity patterns across multiple precision matrices.\nExperiments on joint projection of temperature and precipitation in South America showed that the HMTL produced more accurate predictions in many situations, when compared to the independent execution of existing MTL methods for each climate variable. Simulations on synthetic datasets also showed that the proposed HMTL achieved higher performance as the number of internal MTL problems increase. Here, only temperature and precipitation were used, as they are two of the most studied variables in the climate literature. Future works include a wider analysis with other climate variables, such as geopotential heights and wind directions."

While IPCC has traditionally used a simple model output average, recent work has illustrated potential advantages of using a multitask learning (MTL) framework for projections of individual climate variables. In this paper we introduce a framework for hierarchical multitask learning (HMTL) with two levels of tasks such that each super-task, i.e., task at the top level, is itself a multitask learning problem over sub-tasks. For climate projections, each super-task focuses on projections of specific climate variables spatially using an MTL formulation. For the proposed HMTL approach, a group lasso regularization is added to couple parameters across the supertasks, which in the climate context helps exploit relationships among the behavior of different climate variables at a given spatial location. We show that some recent works on MTL based on learning task dependency structures can be viewed as special cases of HMTL. Experiments on synthetic and real climate data show that HMTL produces better results than decoupled MTL methods applied separately on the super-tasks and HMTL significantly outperforms baselines for climate projection.
