Jain Technische Universität Berlin, Germany\ne-mail: brijnesh.jain@gmail.com\nThe expectation and the mean of partitions generated by a cluster ensemble are not unique in general. This issue poses challenges in statistical inference and cluster stability. In this contribution, we state sufficient conditions for uniqueness of expectation and mean. The proposed conditions show that a unique mean is neither exceptional nor generic. To cope with this issue, we introduce homogeneity as a measure of how likely is a unique mean for a sample of partitions. We show that homogeneity is related to cluster stability. This result points to a possible conflict between cluster stability and diversity in consensus clustering. To assess homogeneity in a practical setting, we propose an efficient way to compute a lower bound of homogeneity. Empirical results using the k-means algorithm suggest that uniqueness of the mean partition is not exceptional for real-world data. Moreover, for samples of high homogeneity, uniqueness can be enforced by increasing the number of data points or by removing outlier partitions. In a broader context, this contribution can be placed as a further step towards a statistical theory of partitions.\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n02 54\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 8\nF eb\n2 01\n6\nContents"

      "text" : "Clustering is a standard technique for exploratory data analysis that finds applications across different disciplines such as computer science, biology, marketing, and social science. The goal of clustering is to group a set of unlabeled data points into several clusters based on some notion of dissimilarity. Inspired by the success of classifier ensembles, consensus clustering has emerged as a research topic [9, 22]. Consensus clustering first generates several partitions of the same dataset. Then it combines the sample partitions to a single consensus partition. The assumption is that a consensus partition better fits to the hidden structure in the data than individual partitions.\nOne standard approach of consensus clustering combines the sample partitions to a mean partition [3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 14, 18, 20, 21]. A mean partition best summarizes the sample partitions with respect to some (dis)similarity function. In general, a mean partition is not unique. Non-uniqueness of a mean partition poses a number of challenges, including (i) comparability, (ii) consistency, (iii) asymptotic behavior, and (iv) clustering stability.\nUniqueness allows us to directly compare the performance of two clustering ensembles via their respective mean partitions. Without uniqueness, comparing two distributions of partitions based on randomly generated samples can be elusive. Moreover, under reasonable conditions, uniqueness implies strong consistency and gives rise to different versions of the law of large numbers [13, 19]. These findings indicate that without uniqueness, statistical inference based on mean partitions can hardly proceed. With regard to clustering stability, non-uniqueness of the mean partition could potentially entail instability of the clustering.\nDespite being a desirable property coming along with several benefits, not much research has been devoted to uniqueness of the mean partition in consensus clustering. In particular, it is unclear under which conditions a sample has a unique mean partition. In addition, it is also unclear whether uniqueness only occurs in trivial and exceptional cases or is a feasible property of practical relevance. To approach these issues, we assume that the set of (hard and soft) partitions is endowed with an intrinsic metric induced by the Euclidean distance.\nThe contributions of this paper are as follows:\n1. Conditions of uniqueness. We establish conditions of uniqueness showing that the mean partition is unique if the cluster ensemble generates sample partitions within a sufficiently small ball.\n2. Homogeneity. We propose homogeneity as a measure of how close a sample is to having a unique mean partition. We present a lower-bound of homogeneity that can easily be computed and at the same time identifies outlier-partitions that need to be removed in order to guarantee a subsample with unique mean partition.\n3. Relationship to cluster stability. We show that homogeneity of a sample is related to cluster stability. This result points to potentially colliding approaches in clustering: standard clustering advocates stability [11, 16] and consensus clustering\nadvocates diversity [5, 22, 23], which will be briefly discussed.\n4. Empirical evidence. In experiments we assessed the homogeneity of samples obtained by the k-means algorithm applied to synthetic and real-world data. The results suggest that uniqueness of the mean partition is not exceptional and can be enforced by a larger dataset or by removing outlier-partitions if homogeneity is high.\nThough uniqueness of the mean partition is not a side issue, it is still a strict property not valid for many samples. Homogeneity relaxes this strict property and gives us an alternative way to assess the performance of clusterings and cluster ensembles that goes beyond uniqueness of the mean partition. In a wider context, the results presented in this paper contribute towards a statistical theory of partitions [13].\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 represents partitions as points of an orbit space. In Section 3, we present the theoretical contributions. Section 4 discusses experimental results. Finally, Section 5 concludes with a summary of the main results and with an outlook to further research. Proofs are delegated to the appendix."

Then we endow orbit spaces P of partitions with a distance function δ related to the Euclidean metric such that (P, δ) becomes a geodesic metric space."

Based on the notion of asymmetry, we characterize partitions with positive max-hom radius.\nLet Π∗ = Π\\{I} denote the subset of (`× `)-permutation matrices without identity matrix I. The degree of asymmetry of a partition Z ∈ P is defined by\nαZ = min {‖Z − PZ‖ : Z ∈ Z and P ∈ Π∗} .\nA partition Z is asymmetric if αZ > 0. If αZ = 0, the partition Z is called symmetric. The next result establishes a relationship between the degree of asymmetry and the max-hom radius.\nProposition 3.2. Let Z ∈ P be a partition. Then we have\n1. αZ/4 ≤ ρZ\n2. αZ > 0 ⇔ ρZ > 0.\nProposition 3.2(1) says that AZ = B(Z,α/4) is a homogeneous ball. We call AZ the asymmetry ball of Z. From Theorem 3.1 and AZ ⊆ BZ follows that expectation and mean are unique if the support SQ is contained in an open subset of AZ .\nProposition 3.2(2) states that being an asymmetric partition and having a positive max-hom radius are equivalent properties. Thus, we can characterize partitions with positive max-hom radius by asymmetric partitions:\nProposition 3.3.\n1. Almost all partitions are asymmetric.\n2. A partition is asymmetric if and only if its clusters are mutually distinct.\nThe first assertion of Prop. 3.3 states that partitions with degenerated max-hom ball that collapse to a single point are the pathological cases in the sense that they are contained in some subset of measure zero.\nThe second assertion of Prop. 3.3 provides us a way of how to compute the degree of asymmetry as we will see shortly. Recall that a cluster of a partition Z is represented by a row zk of a representation Z ∈ Z. Empty clusters are represented by zero rows. A pair of clusters of Z is distinct if the corresponding rows of Z are distinct. The next results are an immediate consequence of Prop. 3.3(2).\nCorollary 3.4.\n1. Every hard partition with at most one empty cluster is asymmetric.\n2. A symmetric partition has at least one pair of identical clusters.\n3. A partition with more than one empty cluster is symmetric.\nNext, we show how the degree of asymmetry of a partition can be determined.\nProposition 3.5. Let Z ∈ Pm,` be a partition.\n1. Let Z ∈ Z be a representation with rows z1, . . . ,z`. Then αZ = min {√ 2 · ‖zp − zq‖ : 1 ≤ p < q ≤ ` }\n2. Suppose that Z is a hard partition. Then αZ = √ 2 (m1 +m2),\nwhere m1 ≤ m2 are the sizes of the two smallest clusters of Z.\n3. Suppose that Z is an asymmetric hard partition. Then\n√ 2 ≤ αZ ≤ 2 · √⌈m ` ⌉ .\nwhere dxe denotes the smallest integer larger than or equal to x.\nThe first statement of Prop. 3.3 tells us how to compute the degree of asymmetry of an arbitrary partition. The second statement of Prop. 3.3 gives us a simpler formula for computing the degree of asymmetry for the subset of hard partitions. Finally, the last statement of Prop. 3.3 tells us the range of values the degree of asymmetry can take for the subset of asymmetric hard partitions. Hard partitions have largest degree of asymmetry if the data points are evenly distributed across all clusters. Conversely, the degree of asymmetry is small if there are clusters with few data points."

By H (Sn) we denote the set of all homogeneous sub-samples of Sn, that is the set of all subsamples of Sn with unique mean partition. Obviously, H (Sn) is non-empty, because sub-samples consisting of a singleton are homogeneous. If Sn is homogeneous, then H (Sn) coincides with the power set of Sn.\nThe homogeneity of a sample Sn is defined by H(Sn) = max { |S| n : S ∈ H (Sn) } .\nHomogeneity measures how close a sample is to being homogeneous. Homogeneity quantifies the largest fraction of partitions that have a unique mean partition. Conversely, the value 1 −H tells us how many partitions we need to remove from Sn to obtain a sub-sample with unique mean partition. Homogeneous samples have homogeneity one and heterogeneous samples have homogeneity less than one. In the worst case, the homogeneity of a sample Sn is H(Sn) = 1/n.\nIt is unclear how to compute the homogeneityH(Sn) efficiently. We therefore present a procedure to determine a lower bound of H(Sn) by using the degree of asymmetry. Let Ai be the asymmetry ball of the i-th sample partition Xi. By\nIAi(Xj) = { 1 : Xj ∈ Ai 0 : otherwise,\nwe denote the indicator function of Ai. We can evaluate IAi(Xj) by first determining the degree of asymmetry αi of Xi according to Prop. 3.5.

Note that h∗(Sn) = 1 implies that the sample Sn is homogeneous and therefore has a unique mean partition. If h∗(Sn) < 1 no statement can be made about whether Sn is homogeneous or heterogeneous. In this case, h∗(Sn) measures how likely a unique mean is."

Following [16], model selection in clustering is posed as the problem of minimizing the function\nIn,k = 1\nn2 n∑ i=1 n∑ j=1 ∆k(Xi, Xj)\nover all numbers k of clusters such that 1 ≤ kmin ≤ k ≤ kmax ≤ m.

Following [5], diversity is measured in the same way as cluster instability, namely by the sum of pairwise distances between sample partitions.\nThough diversity corresponds to cluster instability, its application in consensus clustering does not contradict the goal of cluster stability per se. What matters – from the point of view of cluster stability – is whether the resulting consensus partitions are stable. Since diversity corresponds to low homogeneity, it is unlikely that a sample of diverse partitions has a unique mean. To comply with cluster stability, the question is under which conditions are two different mean partitions similar? To answer this question, we need the following result proved by [3]:\nTheorem 3.6. LetM ∈ P is a mean partition of the sample Sn = (X1, . . . , Xn) ∈ Pn. Then every representation M ∈M is of the form\nM = 1\nn n∑ i=1 Xi,\nwhere Xi ∈ Xi are in optimal position with M , that is δ(Xi,M) = ‖Xi −M‖.\nTheorem 3.6 describes the form of a mean partition in terms of representations of the sample partition. Since every partition has only finitely many different representations, the set of mean partitions of a given sample is finite and therefore discrete.\nNow suppose that the sample Sn has two different mean partitions M and M ′. Let M ∈M and M ′ ∈M ′ be representations of both mean partitions in optimal position. Applying Theorem 3.6 gives\nδ(M,M ′) = ‖M −M ′‖ = ∥∥∥∥∥ 1n n∑\ni=1\nXi − 1\nn n∑ i=1 X ′i ∥∥∥∥∥ = 1n ∥∥∥∥∥ n∑ i=1 (Xi −X ′i) ∥∥∥∥∥ where Xi,X ′ i ∈ Xi are representations in optimal position with M and M ′, respectively. Since both means are different, there is a non-empty subset J ⊆ {1, . . . , n} of indices such that Xj 6= X ′j for all j ∈ J . We obtain\nδ(M,M ′) ≤ 1 n n∑ i=1 ‖Xi −X ′i‖ = 1 n ∑ j∈J ∥∥Xj −X ′j∥∥ . Consider the following conditions:\n1. The index set J is small, that is |J | n,\n2. The degree of asymmetry αj of partitions Xj is low for all j ∈ J , 3. The distance ∥∥Xj −X ′j∥∥ is close to αj for all j ∈ J .\nThen two different mean partitions are similar if condition (1) or if both conditions (2) and (3) hold. Under these conditions, cluster stability and diversity in consensus clustering are not conflicting approaches.\nIn general, it is not self-evident that different mean partitions of a sample of diverse partitions are similar. Therefore, we point to the possibility that cluster stability and diversity in consensus clustering can be contradictory approaches in achieving the common goal of improved cluster performance."

The mean vectors of the G2 dataset are the four vertices of the unit square. The nine mean vectors of the G9 dataset are of the form (x, y) with x, y ∈ {−1, 0, 1}. The U2 and U4 dataset consists of m data points forming concave and convex U-Shapes. The data points were generated by imposing Gaussian noise with mean zero and standard deviation σ on the positive and negative component of the sine-function. The U2 dataset has one concave and one convex U-Shape, whereas the U4 dataset has two of both types of U–Shapes.\nData points were evenly distributed across the different clusters of the G4, G9, U2, and U4 datasets. Figure 1 shows examples of all datasets with the exception of the UD dataset. The parameters for all datasets were σ = 0.1 and mc = 50, where mc is the number of data points of a single cluster (with mc = 50, we have mUD = 50, mG4 = 200, mG9 = 450, mU2 = 100, and mU4 = 200).\nGeneric Protocol. A single experiment was conducted according to the following generic scheme:\nInput : m – number of data points σ – standard deviation k – parameter of k-means\nProcedure: Generate a dataset Z of size m with standard deviation σ Repeat n = 100 times:\nApply the k-means algorithm to dataset Z to obtain sample Sn,k Compute the α-homogeneity h∗(Sn,k)\nOutput : α-homogeneity h∗(Sn,k)\nThe procedure was repeated 100-times using the same input parameters. Finally, the average α-homogeneity h∗ over the 100 trials was recorded.\nThe UD datasets served as a base-line. For these datasets, σ is a factor with which the uniformly generated data points were multiplied."

      "text" : "The goal of the first series of experiments is to assess homogeneity as a function of the parameters k, σ, and m under the assumption that the cluster structure in the data can be essentially discovered by the k-means algorithm for a suitable value of k.\nWe considered G4 datasets and contrasted the results to those obtained on UD datasets. Unless otherwise stated, the default input parameters were\n• k = 4 for the k-means algorithm, • m = 100 for the size of the datasets, • σ = 1 as factor for the UD datasets.\nHomogeneity as a function of k. We considered three types of datasets: (i) G4 generated with standard deviation σ = 0.05, (ii) G4 generated with standard deviation σ = 0.7, and (iii) UD generated with factor σ = 1. For every k ∈ {2, . . . , 10} and for all three types of datasets, we conducted experiments according to the above described generic protocol.\nFigure 2a shows the average α-homogeneities h∗ as a function of the number k. We made the following observations:\n1. The general trend is that homogeneity decreases with increasing k. To understand why homogeneity decreases with increasing k, recall that the degree of asymmetry of a partition Z is\nαZ = √ 2(m1 +m2),\nwhere m1 and m2 are the sizes of the two smallest clusters (see Prop. 3.5(2)). From the strong form of the pigeonhole principle follows\nm1 +m2 2 ≤ m k .\nThus, the sum m1 + m2 decreases with increasing number k of clusters. This means that homogeneity is likely to be lower for large k given a fixed number m of data\npoints. Imbalanced cluster sizes further deteriorate the situation. Figure 2b shows the average cluster sizes of k-means with k = 10 for all three types of datasets. The cluster sizes are normalized by m. We see that the cluster sizes of all types of datasets are imbalanced, in particular both types of the G4 datasets. These findings indicate that increasing the parameter k results in increasingly less stable clusterings and makes a unique mean partition increasingly less likely.\n2. The trend is interrupted at k = 4 for UD datasets and for G4 datasets with σ = 0.05. For σ = 0.05 the G4 dataset has a clearly visible cluster structure (see Figure 3). The k-means algorithm with k = 4 recovers this structure resulting in high homogeneity. Only a few partitions need to be removed in order to guarantee uniqueness of the mean. For σ = 0.7 no cluster structure is visible as shown in Figure 3. Consequently, nothing unexpected happened and homogeneity is low. These findings suggest that uniqueness of the mean partition is more likely when k-means is capable to essentially discover the cluster structure of the dataset.\nSurprisingly, there is a moderate peak at k = 4 on UD datasets conveying that k-means is most stable when viewing uniformly distributed data as a 2, and 4 cluster problem (homogeneity of samples of partitions with one cluster is always one). This moderate peak is even more notable when compared to the results on G4 datasets with σ = 0.7. This result indicates that peaks in homogeneity do not necessarily allow us to draw conclusions about the cluster structure in a dataset.\nBy combining both findings, we hypothesize that an evident cluster structure discovered by the underlying algorithm implies peaks in homogeneity but the converse claim does not necessarily hold.\n3. For k 6= 4 homogeneity is lower the more structure we assume in the dataset. We assume higher structure in G4 datasets with lower variance and we assume higher structure in any G4 datasets than in UD datasets. The results show that the more evident the assumed cluster structure is the lower is the homogeneity for a wrong choice of k. These findings suggest that mismatching an evident cluster structure in the data can introduce additional instability into the clusterings. Further research is necessary to test this hypothesis.\nHomogeneity as a function of σ. For every σ ∈ {0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, . . . , 1.0} and for both datasets of type G4 and UD, we conducted experiments according to the above described generic protocol. Figure 3 depicts examples of G4 datasets with varying standard deviation σ.\nFigure 4 shows the average α-homogeneity h∗ as a function of the standard deviation σ. We observed that the average α-homogeneity on G4 datasets decreases with increasing standard deviation σ until saturation. Homogeneity is at a high level with values above 0.9, when the four clusters are clearly visible. For larger standard deviations, the clusters become increasingly blurred and the average α-homogeneity rapidly drops below 0.4. The turning point between high and low homogeneity is around σ = 0.3 and roughly corresponds to the subjective turning point of what we might perceive as a visible cluster structure (cf. Figure 3). Moreover, homogeneity on G4 datasets around\nthe turning point is comparable to homogeneity on UD datasets, which is invariant under scaling of σ. Based on these results we raise the hypothesis that an algorithm that essentially discovers a visible cluster structure in the data is stable and guarantees a unique mean partition after removing a small fraction of partitions.\nHomogeneity as a function of m. We considered three types of datasets: (i) G4 with σ = 0.3, (ii) G4 with σ = 0.7, and (iii) UD with factor σ = 1. Let mc denote the number of data points of component c of a dataset. Then G4 datasets have size m = 4mc and UD datasets are of size m = mc. For every\nmc ∈ {25, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000}\nand for all three types of datasets, we conducted experiments according to the above described generic protocol.\nFigure 5 shows an excerpt of the average α-homogeneities h∗ as a function of the number mc of data points in each component. We observed that homogeneity increases with increasing dataset size m. Moreover, homogeneity increases faster and more substantially for G4 datasets with lower standard deviation. If the four clusters are just visible as for σ = 0.3, the mean partition is likely to be unique for datasets with\nat least mc = 2000 data points in each cluster. Surprisingly, homogeneity is high even for UD datasets with more than 5, 000 data points. These results indicate that homogeneity can be improved and uniqueness of the mean partition can be eventually enforced by increasing the size of the dataset."

For this we considered U2 and U4 datasets and contrasted the results to those obtained on G4 and G9 datasets. The parameters for all datasets were σ = 0.1 and mc = 50, where mc is the number of data points of a single cluster. Figure 1 shows examples of all four datasets.\nFigure 6 shows the average α-homogeneities for all four datasets. As before, the general trend is that homogeneity decreases with increasing k and is only interrupted when the clearly visible cluster structure in the dataset can be discovered by the k-\nmeans algorithm. The peaks at k = 4 and k = 9 are evident for the G4 and G9 datasets, respectively. This shows that k-means is most stable and a unique mean partition is most likely when the parameter k coincides with the number of clusters in the datasets.\nThe situation is different for both U-Shape datasets. The k-means algorithm is not able to essentially discover the cluster structure of the U2 and U4 datasets. Nevertheless, homogeneity is at the highest level for k = 2 for both datasets. While this result is desirable for the U2 dataset at the first glance, it is unsatisfactory for the U4 dataset. The result for the U2 dataset with k = 2 is only desirable at the first glance for the following reason: Although k-means performed stable and only a small fraction of partitions need to be removed in order to guarantee a unique mean partition, the discovered cluster structure does not properly match with the underlying cluster structure in the data as indicated by the top-left plot of Figure 7. The same holds for the U4 dataset as shown by the top-right plot of Figure 7. Though the result for the U4 dataset with k = 2 is unsatisfactory, closer inspection of the plots reveals that homogeneity has a moderate peak at k = 4 for the U4 dataset not present for the U2 dataset. A further small peak is at k = 6 for the U2 dataset. In the latter case, k-means frequently refines each of the two U-Shapes into three clusters (c.f. plots at bottom row of Figure 7). Such peaks may indicate that there could be a cluster structure but the underlying algorithm is unable to essentially discover this structure. A counter-example for this claim is the peak at k = 4 for UD datasets as discussed in the\nprevious experiment. The conclusion is that high homogeneity and stability are merely indicators for a possible cluster structure in the data but need further examination."

This result indicates that uniqueness\nis of practical relevance and not a matter of exceptional cases. Observation (ii) is in line with the results on synthetic data and an explanation follows the same argumentation as in Section 4.1.1. As shown in Figure 9, the clusters are highly unbalanced for k = 10. Consequently, uniqueness of the mean partition is less likely for large k. Increasing the number m of data points can improve homogeneity. This is possibly one reason why the eye dataset has substantially larger α-homogeneity than the other datasets for all k and has an additional peak of high homogeneity for k = 9, although it has the most imbalanced partitions for k = 10."

      "heading" : "5. Conclusion",
      "text" : "Uniqueness of the mean partition is a desirable property in consensus clustering that comes along with several benefits. We showed that both, the expected partition and the mean partition, are unique when the support is contained in an open subset of some max-hom ball. According to this condition, uniqueness is neither an exceptional nor a generic property. To cope with this issue, we proposed homogeneity as a measure of how close a sample is to having a unique mean. Homogeneity is not confined to consensus clustering but is also related to cluster stability. This in turn points to the possibility that cluster stability and diversity in consensus clustering can be conflicting\ngoals. Homogeneity can be efficiently bounded from below by α-homogeneity, which applies the degree of asymmetry of a partition. With α-homogeneity, we can identify a sub-sample of the largest sub-sample of partitions that can be retained in order to guarantee a unique mean partition. Preliminary empirical results show that uniqueness occurs in real-world data and can be enforced by increasing the size of the dataset or by removing outlier partitions when α-homogeneity is high. The results also indicate that α-homogeneity can be used as a criterion for model selection. The results of this paper can be placed into the general context of a statistical theory of partitions, which embraces consensus clustering and cluster stability as special cases.\nThe main limitations of the proposed approach are twofold: restriction to the intrinsic metric on partitions derived from the Euclidean distance and restriction of uniqueness conditions on max-hom balls. Generalizing both restrictions are two possible directions of future research. Another important issue is to understand when cluster stability and diversity in consensus clustering collide."

There is a fundamental set FZ such that D◦Z ⊆ FZ ⊆ DZ . 2. We have Z ∈ D◦Z . 3. Every point X ∈ D◦Z represents an asymmetric partition. 4. Suppose that X,PX ∈ DZ for some P ∈ Π∗. Then X,PX ∈ ∂DZ . 5. PDZ = DPZ for all P ∈ Π.\nProof. The proof follows [12], Prop. 3.13 but is adapted to the notation and terminology of this contribution.\n1. [17], Theorem 6.6.11.\n2. Since Z is asymmetric, we have ‖Z −Z‖ < ‖Z − PZ‖ for all P ∈ Π∗. This shows that Z ∈ D◦Z . 3. Let X ∈ D◦Z be a representation of partition X. Suppose that X is symmetric. Then there is a P ∈ Π∗ with X = PX. This implies X ∈ P DZ ∩ DZ . Then X ∈ ∂DZ is a boundary point of DZ by [17], Theorem 6.6.4. This contradicts our assumption that X ∈ D◦Z and shows that X is asymmetric.\n4. From X,PX ∈ DZ follows ‖X −Z‖ = ‖PX −Z‖. Since Π acts by isometries, we have ‖X −Z‖ = ‖PX − PZ‖. Thus, we have ‖PX −Z‖ = ‖PX − PZ‖. This shows that PX ∈ ∂DZ . Let P ′ ∈ Π be the inverse of P . Since P 6= I, we have P ′ 6= I. Then\n‖X −Z‖ = ‖PX −Z‖ = ∥∥P ′PX − P ′Z∥∥ = ∥∥X − P ′Z∥∥,\nFrom ‖X −Z‖ = ‖X − P ′Z‖ follows X ∈ ∂DZ . 5. Let X ∈ P DZ . We have ‖X − PZ‖ ≤ ‖P ′X − PZ‖ for all P ′ ∈ Π showing that X ∈ DPZ .

Both assertions directly follow from the definitions of cross section and fundamental set. max-hom of µ directly follows from the property π ◦ µ = id. Again from π ◦ µ = id follows that µ maps partitions to representations. Finally, since µ is injective, the image µ(P) contains exactly one representation of each partition.

We select an arbitrary representation Z ∈ Z and an arbitrary cross section µ : P → DZ . Let SZ = µ (SQ) be the image of the support SQ. Since BZ is a homogeneous ball, we have\nF (Y ) = ∫ P δ(X,Y )2dQ(X) = ∫ SQ δ(X,Y )2dQ(X) = ∫ SZ ‖µ(X)− µ(Y )‖2 dq(µ(X)),\nwhere q is the image measure of measure Q under cross section µ.

A.3 follows that partition M is independent of the choice of a particular cross section along Z. From Prop. A.2 follows that partition M is independent of the choice of a particular representation of Z. It remains to show that partition M of the second part of\nthis proof is independent of the choice of partition Z that satisfies SQ ⊆ BZ . This is proved in the sequel.\n3. Suppose that Z′ ∈ P is a partition satisfying SQ ⊆ BZ′ . Let Z′ ∈ Z′ be a representation such that Z,Z′ ∈ DZ ∩ DZ′ and let µ′ : P → DZ′ be a cross section. By S = µ (SQ) and S ′ = µ′ (SQ) we denote the images of SQ under the cross sections µ and µ′, respectively.\nWe show that there is a permutation matrix P ∈ Π such that S ′ = PS. Observe that the composition µ′ ◦ π : S → S ′ is bijective. Let X ∈ S and X ′ ∈ S ′ be representations such that X ′ = µ′(π(X)). Since µ′ is a cross section, both elements X and X ′ represent the same partition π(X) ∈ SQ. Then there is a permutation matrix P ∈ Π such that X ′ = PX. We assume that there are representations Y ∈ S and Y ′ ∈ S ′ such that\nY ′ = µ′(π(Y )) 6= PY .\nSince Y and Y ′ represent the same partition π(Y ) ∈ SQ, there is another permutation matrix Q ∈ Π\\{P } such that Y ′ = QY . We find that PY 6= QY . To see this, observe that Y ∈ S ⊂ D◦Z is an interior point of DZ . From Prop. A.2 follows that Y = π(Y ) is asymmetric. This implies that Y 6= RY for all R ∈ Π∗. Since P 6= Q, we obtain PY 6= QY .\nAlthough PY 6= QY , we have\n‖X − Y ‖ = ‖PX − PY ‖ = ‖PX −QY ‖ . (3)\nThe first equation holds, because Π acts isometrically on X . The second equation follows from X ′,Y ′ ∈ BZ′ together with the fact that BZ′ is a homogeneous ball. From Equation (3) follows that the Dirichlet fundamental domain DX′ centered at X ′ = PX contains PY and QY . Then by Prop. A.2 both representations PY and QY are elements of the boundary of DX′ . By assumption, only QY ∈ S ′ is an element of BZ′ . Moreover, since S ′ ( B◦Z′ , we have V = D◦QX ∩ BZ′ 6= ∅. Suppose that V ∈ V is a representation of partition V . Then δ(X,V ) < ‖X ′ − V ‖, because V is in the interior of DQX and X ′ is in the interior of DX′ . This contradicts the assumption that BZ′ is a homogeneous ball isometric to BZ′ . Hence, Y ′ = PY and therefore S ′ = PS.\n4. This part shows that partition M is independent of the choice of Z. A permutation matrix P ∈ Π gives rise to a diffeomorphism\nLP : X → X , X 7→ P−1X\nwith Jacobi matrix L′P = P −1 and |detL′P | = ∣∣detP−1∣∣ = 1. Let q′ be the image measure of Q under the cross section µ′. From\nµ′(SQ) = S ′ = PS = L−1P ◦ µ(SQ)\nfollows µ = LP ◦ µ′. Then we have\nq = µ(Q) = LP ◦ µ′(Q) = LP (q′),\nthat is q is the image measure of q′ under LP . For every Y ∈ S, we define the function\ngY (X) = ‖X − Y ‖2 .\nThen we rewrite f(Y ) by\nf(Y ) = ∫ S ‖X − Y ‖2 dq(X) = ∫ S gY (X)dq(X).\nApplying the transformation formula for integrals gives\nf(Y ) = ∫ S gY (X)dq(X) = ∫ S′ gY ◦ LP (X ′) · ∣∣detL′P ∣∣ dq′(X ′) = ∫ S′ ∥∥P−1X ′ − Y ∥∥2 dq′(X ′). Since Π acts isometrically on X , we have\nf(Y ) = ∫ S′ ∥∥PP−1X ′ − PY ∥∥2 dq′(X ′) = ∫ S′ ∥∥X ′ − PY ∥∥2 dq′(X ′) = f ′(PY ). From Y ∈ S and S ′ = PS follows PY ∈ S ′. Then the unique minimizer M of f(Y ) gives PM as the unique minimizer of f ′(Y ′) on S ′. Both elements M and PM represent the same partition M . This shows that M is independent of the choice of Z such that SQ ⊆ BZ . Hence, M is the unique minimizer of F (Z).\n5. We show uniqueness of the mean partition. Let Sn = (X1, . . . , Xn) be a sample of n partitions. Let S{n} = {X1, . . . , Xn} denote the the set of partitions induced by Sn. We define a probability measure Qn as a probability mass function of the form\nQn(X) = 1\nn n∑ i=1 δX,Xi\nfor all X ∈ SQ, where δX,Y is the Kronecker delta that gives one when X = Y agree and zero, otherwise. We use Qn as probability measure and SQ as set containing the support of Qn. Then the assertion follows from Part 1–4 of this proof.\nB.2. Proof of Prop. 3.2\n1. The first assertion holds for symmetric partitions Z, because αZ = 0 and therefore αZ/4 ≤ ρZ . We assume that Z is asymmetric. The group Π is a discontinuous group acting isometrically on X . The isotropy group\nΠZ = {P ∈ Π : PZ = Z}\nis trivial for any representation Z ∈ Z. Since P ∼= X/Π, we have a bijective isometry\nφ : B(Z, ρ) −→ B(Z, ρ), X 7→ π(X).\nfor all 0 < ρ ≤ αZ/4 by [17], Theorem 13.1.1. Setting ψ = φ−1 we find that B(Z, ρ) is a homogeneous ball. This shows αZ/4 ≤ ρZ .\n2. We show the second assertion. From Part 1 of this proof follows αZ > 0 ⇒ ρZ > 0. We show the opposite direction. Let ρZ > 0. We assume that αZ = 0. Suppose that Z ∈ Z is a representation. Then there is a permutation matrix P ∈ Π∗ such that Z = PZ. Consider the ball Bε = B(Z, ε) for ε > 0. Suppose that X ∈ Bε is an element representing an asymmetric partition. Such am element exists according to Prop. 3.3(1). Then X 6= PX and X,PX ∈ Bε. This shows that there is no bijective mapping between B(Z, ε) and Bε for any ε > 0. This contradicts our assumption that ρZ > 0. Hence, we have αZ > 0.\nB.3. Proof of Prop. 3.3\n1. To prove the first assertion, it is sufficient to show that the set of asymmetric partitions forms an open and dense subset in P. The projection π : X → X/Π is open and surjective. Then the image π(U) of an open and dense subset U ⊆ X is open and dense in X/Π. To see this observe that from π(X ) = π(U) and surjectivity of π follows π(U) = X/Π. From X/Π = π(U) ⊆ π(U) follows that π(U) is open and dense in X/Π.\nNow let Z ∈ X be a representation of an asymmetric partition Z ∈ P. Suppose that µ : P → DZ is a cross section. From Prop. A.3 follows that µ(P) ⊂ DZ is a fundamental set containing the open set D◦Z . Since D◦Z is open and dense in DZ , we find that π (D◦Z) is open and dense in P. This shows that almost all partitions are asymmetric.\n2. We show the second assertion. Let Z ∈ P be an asymmetric partition. Suppose that Z ∈ Z is a representation matrix with rows z1, . . . .z`. We assume that Z has two identical clusters. Then there are two distinct indices 1 ≤ p < q ≤ ` such that zp = zq. Let P ∈ Π∗ be the permutation matrix that swaps rows p and q. Then we have αZ ≤ ‖Z − PZ‖ = 0. This contradicts our assumption that Z is asymmetric. Hence, the clusters of Z are mutually distinct.\nNext, we assume that all clusters of Z are mutually distinct. Suppose that Z is asymmetric. Then there is a representation Z ∈ Z and a permutation matrix P ∈ Π∗ such that αZ = ‖Z − PZ‖. As stated in Section A.1, we can express P as a minimal product of t > 0 transpositions. Hence, representation Z has at least one pair of identical rows. This contradicts our assumption that the clusters of Z are mutually distinct showing that partition Z is asymmetric.\nB.4. Proof of Prop. 3.5\nThe first three parts of this proof prepare the proofs of the assertions shown in Part 4–6.\n1. Let P ∈ Π∗ be a transposition that permutes rows p < q. Then we have\n‖Z − PZ‖2 = ‖zp − zq‖2 + ‖zq − zp‖2 = 2 ‖zp − zq‖2 .\nThis gives ‖Z − PZ‖ = √ 2 ‖zp − zq‖.\n2. Let P ,Q ∈ Π∗ be two different transpositions. Suppose that P permutes rows p < q and Q permutes rows r < s such that either (i) {p, q}∩ {r, s} = ∅ or (ii) q = r. For case (i), we have\n‖Z − PQZ‖2 = 2 ‖zp − zq‖2 + 2 ‖zr − zs‖2\naccording to the first part of this proof. This implies ‖Z − PZ‖ ≤ ‖Z − PQZ‖ and ‖Z −QZ‖ ≤ ‖Z − PQZ‖.\n3. As stated in Section A.1, we can write P = Π∗ as a matrix product P = Q1 · · ·Qt of transpositions Qi ∈ Π with minimum number t > 0 of factors. From the second part of this proof follows\n‖Z −QiZ‖ ≤ ‖Z −Q1Q2 · · ·QtZ‖ = ‖Z − PZ‖\nfor all i ∈ {1, . . . , t}. This shows that it is sufficient to restrict to transpositions for determining the degree of asymmetry of a partition.\n4. Let Πτ denote the subset of all transpositions. From part 1 and 3 of this proof follows αZ = min {‖Z − PZ‖ : P ∈ Πτ} = min {√ 2 ‖zp − zq‖ : 1 ≤ p < q ≤ ` } .\nThis shows the first assertion.\n5. The second assertion assumes that Z is a hard partition. Then the elements of Z take binary values from {0, 1} such that zTp zq = 0 for all 1 ≤ p < q ≤ `. Moreover, np = zTk zk is the size of the k-th cluster. Then we have\n‖zp − zq‖2 = zTp zp − 2zTp zq + zTq zq = np + nq.\nFrom the fourth part of this proof follows αZ = min {√ 2 (np + nq) : 1 ≤ p < q ≤ ` } .\nThis implies the second assertion.\n6. The second assertion assumes that Z is an asymmetric hard partition. We first prove the lower bound of αZ . From Prop. 3.3 follows that Z has at most one empty cluster. Then m1 = 0 and m2 > 0. Using part 5 of this proof, we obtain √ 2 ≤ √ 2m2 = αZ . Next, we show the upper bound of αZ . From the strong form of the pigeonhole principle follows that there is a cluster with at least µ1 = dm/`e elements. Let m′ = m − µ1 be the number of remaining elements. Then again applying the pigeonhole principle gives a cluster with at least µ2 = dm′/(`− 1)e elements. From µ1 ≥ m/` follows\nµ2 = m− µ1 `− 1 ≤ m−m/` `− 1 = m ` ≤ ⌈m ` ⌉ .\nWe can bound the cardinality of the two smallest clusters by m1 +m2 ≤ µ1 + µ2 ≤ 2 ⌈m ` ⌉ .\nUsing part 5 of this proof shows the third assertion.\nB.5. Proof of Equation (1)\nWe have\nIn,k = 1\nn2 ∑ i,j ∆k(Xi, Xj)\n≥ 1 n2 ∑ i,j ∆k(Mk, Xj) = 1\nn ∑ j ∆k(Mk, Xj)\n= Fn,k(Mk) .\nThe inequality in the second line holds, because Mk is a mean or medoid. This shows the assertion."

In this contribution, we state sufficient conditions for uniqueness of expectation and mean. The proposed conditions show that a unique mean is neither exceptional nor generic. To cope with this issue, we introduce homogeneity as a measure of how likely is a unique mean for a sample of partitions. We show that homogeneity is related to cluster stability. This result points to a possible conflict between cluster stability and diversity in consensus clustering. To assess homogeneity in a practical setting, we propose an efficient way to compute a lower bound of homogeneity. Empirical results using the k-means algorithm suggest that uniqueness of the mean partition is not exceptional for real-world data. Moreover, for samples of high homogeneity, uniqueness can be enforced by increasing the number of data points or by removing outlier partitions. In a broader context, this contribution can be placed as a further step towards a statistical theory of partitions.",
