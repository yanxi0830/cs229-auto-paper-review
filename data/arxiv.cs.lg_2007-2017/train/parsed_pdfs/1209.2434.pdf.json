However, there are situations in which DFO is unavoidable, and for such situations we propose a new DFO algorithm that is proved to be near optimal for the class of strongly convex objective functions. A distinctive feature of the algorithm is that it uses only Boolean-valued function comparisons, rather than function evaluations. This makes the algorithm useful in an even wider range of applications, such as optimization based on paired comparisons from human subjects, for example. We also show that regardless of whether DFO is based on noisy function evaluations or Boolean-valued function comparisons, the convergence rate is the same."

      "text" : "Optimizing large-scale complex systems often requires the tuning of many parameters. With training data or simulations one can evaluate the relative merit, or incurred loss, of different parameter settings, but it may be unclear how each parameter influences the overall objective function. In such cases, derivatives of the objective function with respect to the parameters are unavailable. Thus, we have seen a resurgence of interest in Derivative Free Optimization (DFO) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. When function evaluations are noiseless, DFO methods can achieve the same rates of convergence as noiseless gradient methods up to a small factor depending on a low-order polynomial of the dimension [9, 5, 10]. This leads one to wonder if the same equivalence can be extended to the case when function evaluations and gradients are noisy.\nSadly, this paper proves otherwise. We show that when function evaluations are noisy, the optimization error of any DFO is Ω( √ 1/T ), where T is the number of evaluations. This lower bound holds even for strongly convex functions. In contrast, noisy gradient methods exhibit Θ(1/T ) error scaling for strongly convex functions [9, 11]. A consequence of our theory is that finite differencing cannot achieve the rates of gradient methods when the function evaluations are noisy.\nOn the positive side, we also present a new derivative-free algorithm that achieves this lower bound with near optimal dimension dependence. Moreover, the algorithm uses only boolean comparisons of function values, not actual function values. This makes the algorithm applicable to situations in which the optimization is only able to probably correctly decide if the value of one configuration is better than the value of another. This is especially interesting in optimization based on human subject feedback, where paired comparisons are often used instead of numerical scoring. The convergence rate of the new algorithm is optimal in terms of T and near-optimal in terms of its dependence on the ambient dimension. Surprisingly, our lower bounds show that this new algorithm that uses only function comparisons achieves the same rate in terms of T as any algorithm that has access to function evaluations."

      "text" : "We now formalize the notation and conventions for our analysis of DFO. A function f is strongly convex with constant τ on a convex set B ⊂ Rd if there exists a constant τ > 0 such that\nf(y) ≥ f(x) + 〈∇f(x), y − x〉+ τ 2 ||x− y||2\nfor all x, y ∈ B. The gradient of f , if it exists, denoted ∇f , is Lipschitz with constant L if ||∇f(x) − ∇f(y)|| ≤ L||x − y|| for some L > 0. The class of strongly convex functions with Lipschitz gradients defined on a nonempty, convex set B ⊂ Rn which take their minimum in B with parameters τ and L is denoted by Fτ,L,B. The problem we consider is minimizing a function f ∈ Fτ,L,B. The function f is not explicitly known. An optimization procedure may only query the function in one of the following two ways.\nFunction Evaluation Oracle: For any point x ∈ B an optimization procedure can observe Ef (x) = f(x) + w\nwhere w ∈ R is a random variable with E[w] = 0 and E[w2] = σ2. Function Comparison Oracle: For any pair of points x, y ∈ B an optimization procedure can\nobserve a binary random variable Cf (x, y) satisfying\nP (Cf (x, y) = sign{f(y)− f(x)}) ≥ 1\n2 + min\n{ δ0, µ|f(y)− f(x)|κ−1 } (1)\nfor some 0 < δ0 ≤ 1/2, µ > 0 and κ ≥ 1. When κ = 1, without loss of generality assume µ ≤ δ0 ≤ 1/2. Note κ = 1 implies that the comparison oracle is correct with a probability that is greater than 1/2 and independent of x, y. If κ > 1, then the oracle’s reliability decreases as the difference between f(x) and f(y) decreases.\nTo illustrate how the function comparison oracle and function evaluation oracles relate to each other, suppose Cf (x, y) = sign{Ef (y) − Ef (x)} where Ef (x) is a function evaluation oracle with additive noise w. If w is Gaussian distributed with mean zero and variance σ2 then κ = 2 and µ ≥ ( 4πσ2e )−1/2 (see Appendix A). In fact, this choice of w corresponds to Thurston’s law of comparative judgment which is a popular model for outcomes of pairwise comparisons from human subjects [12]. If w is a “spikier” distribution such as a two-sided Gamma distribution with shape parameter in the range of (0, 1] then all values of κ ∈ (1, 2] can be realized (see Appendix A). Interest in the function comparison oracle is motivated by certain popular derivative-free optimization procedures that use only comparisons of function evaluations (e.g. [7]) and by optimization problems involving human subjects making paired comparisons (for instance, getting fitted for prescription lenses or a hearing aid where unknown parameters specific to each person are tuned with the familiar queries “better or worse?”). Pairwise comparisons have also been suggested as a novel way to tune web-search algorithms [13]. Pairwise comparison strategies have previously been analyzed in the finite setting where the task is to identify the best alternative among a finite set of alternatives (sometimes referred to as the dueling-bandit problem) [13, 14]. The function comparison oracle presented in this work and its analysis are novel. The main contributions of this work and new art are as follows (i) lower bounds for the function evaluation oracle in the presence of measurement noise (ii) lower bounds for the function comparison oracle in the presence of noise and (iii) an algorithm for the function comparison oracle, which can also be applied to the function evaluation oracle setting, that nearly matches both the lower bounds of (i) and (ii).\nWe prove our lower bounds for strongly convex functions with Lipschitz gradients defined on a compact, convex set B, and because these problems are a subset of those involving all convex functions (and have non-empty intersection with problems where f is merely Lipschitz), the lower bound also applies to these larger classes. While there are known theoretical results for DFO in the noiseless setting [15, 5, 10], to the best of our knowledge we are the first to characterize lower bounds for DFO in the stochastic setting. Moreover, we believe we are the first to show a novel upper bound for stochastic DFO using a function comparison oracle (which also applies to the function evaluation oracle). However, there are algorithms with upper bounds on the rates of convergence for stochastic DFO with the function evaluation oracle [15, 16]. We discuss the relevant results in the next section following the lower bounds .\nWhile there remains many open problems in stochastic DFO (see Section 6), rates of convergence with a stochastic gradient oracle are well known and were first lower bounded by Nemirovski and Yudin [15]. These classic results were recently tightened to show a dependence on the dimension of the problem [17]. And then tightened again to show a better dependence on the noise [11] which matches the upper bound achieved by stochastic gradient descent [9]. The aim of this work is to start filling in the knowledge gaps of stochastic DFO so that it is as well understood as the stochastic gradient oracle. Our bounds are based on simple techniques borrowed from the statistical learning literature that use natural functions and oracles in the same spirit of [11]."

This matches the rate of convergence as a function of T and σ2, but has worse dependence on the dimension n.\nAlternatively, under a less restrictive setting, Nemirovski and Yudin proposed two algorithms for the class of convex, Lipschitz functions that obtain rates of n1/2/T 1/4 and p(n)/T 1/2, respectively, where p(n) was left as an unspecified polynomial of n [15]. While focusing on stochastic DFO with bandit feedback, Agarwal et. al. built on the ideas developed in [15] to obtain a result that they point out implies a convergence rate of n16/T 1/2 in the optimization setting considered here [16]. Whether or not these rates can be improved to those obtained under the more restrictive function classes of above is an open question.\nA related but fundamentally different problem that is somewhat related with the setting considered in this paper is described as online (or stochastic) convex optimization with multi-point feedback [18, 5, 19]. Essentially, this setting allows the algorithm to probe the value of the function f plus noise at multiple locations where the noise changes at each time step, but each set of samples at each time experiences the same noise. Because the noise model of that work is incompatible with the one considered here, no comparisons should be made between the two."

      "heading" : "4 Lower Bounds",
      "text" : "The lower bounds in Theorems 1 and 3 are proved using a general minimax bound [20, Thm. 2.5]. Our proofs are most related to the approach developed in [21] for active learning, which like optimization involves a Markovian sampling process. Roughly speaking, the lower bounds are established by considering a simple case of the optimization problem in which the global minimum is known a priori to belong to a finite set. Since the simple case is “easier” than the original optimization, the minimum number of queries required for a desired level of accuracy in this case yields a lower bound for the original problem.\nThe following theorem is used to prove the bounds. In the terms of the theorem, f is a function to be minimized and Pf is the probability model governing the noise associated with queries when f is the true function.\nTheorem 4. [20, Thm. 2.5] Consider a class of functions F and an associated family of probability measures {Pf}f∈F . Let M ≥ 2 be an integer and f0, f1, . . . , fM be functions in F . Let d(·, ·) : F × F → R be a semi-distance and assume that:\n1. d(fi, fj) ≥ 2s > 0, for all 0 ≤ i < j ≤ M , 2. 1M ∑M j=1 KL(Pi||P0) ≤ a logM ,\nwhere the Kullback-Leibler divergence KL(Pi||P0) := ∫ log dPidP0 dPi is assumed to be well-defined (i.e., P0 is a dominating measure) and 0 < a < 1/8 . Then\ninf f̂ sup f∈F P(d(f̂ , f) ≥ s) ≥ inf f̂ max f∈{f0,...,fM}\nP(d(f̂ , f) ≥ s) ≥ √ M\n1+ √ M\n( 1− 2a− 2 √ a\nlogM\n) > 0 ,\nwhere the infimum is taken over all possible estimators based on a sample from Pf .\nWe are concerned with the functions in the class F := Fτ,L,B. The volume of B will affect only constant factors in our bounds, so we will simply denote the class of functions by F and refer explicitly to B only when necessary. Let xf := argminx f(x), for all f ∈ F . The semi-distance we use is d(f, g) := ‖xf − xg||, for all f, g ∈ F . Note that each point in B can be specified by one of many f ∈ F . So the problem of selecting an f is equivalent to selecting a point x ∈ B. Indeed, the semi-distance defines a collection of equivalence classes in F (i.e., all functions having a minimum at x ∈ B are equivalent). For every f ∈ F we have infg∈F f(xg) = infx∈B f(x), which is a useful identity to keep in mind.\nWe now construct the functions f0, f1, . . . , fM that will be used for our proofs. Let Ω = {−1, 1}n so that each ω ∈ Ω is a vertex of the d-dimensional hypercube. Let V ⊂ Ω with cardinality |V| ≥ 2n/8 such that for all ω 6= ω′ ∈ V , we have ρ(ω, ω′) ≥ n/8 where ρ(·, ·) is the Hamming distance. It is known that such a set exists by the Varshamov-Gilbert bound [20, Lemma 2.9]. Denote the elements\nof V by ω0, ω1, . . . , ωM . Next we state some elementary bounds on the functions that will be used in our analysis. Lemma 1. For ǫ > 0 define the set B ⊂ Rn to be the ℓ∞ ball of radius ǫ and define the functions on B: fi(x) := τ2 ||x − ǫωi||2, for i = 0, . . . ,M , ωi ∈ V , and xi := argminx fi(x) = ǫωi. Then for all 0 ≤ i < j ≤ M and x ∈ B the functions fi(x) satisfy\n1. fi is strongly convex-τ with Lipschitz-L gradients and xi ∈ B 2. ||xi − xj || ≥ ǫ √ n 2 3. |fi(x) − fj(x)| ≤ 2τnǫ2 .\nWe are now ready to prove Theorems 1 and 3. Each proof uses the functions f0, . . . , fM a bit differently, and since the noise model is also different in each case, the KL divergence is bounded differently in each proof. We use the fact that if X and Y are random variables distributed according to Bernoulli distributions PX and PY with parameters 1/2 + µ and 1/2− µ, then KL(PX ||PY ) ≤ 4µ2/(1/2− µ). Also, if X ∼ N (µX , σ2) =: PX and Y ∼ N (µY , σ2) =: Py then KL(PX ||PY ) = 1 2σ2 ||µX − µY ||2."

The algorithm is explained in full detail in Appendix B, and is summarized as follows. At each iteration the algorithm picks a coordinate uniformly at random from the n possible dimensions and then performs an approximate line search. By exploiting the fact that the function is strongly convex with Lipschitz gradients, one guarantees using standard arguments that the approximate line search makes a sufficient decrease in the objective function value in expectation [23, Ch.9.3]. If the pairwise comparison oracle made no errors then the approximate line search is accomplished by a binary-search-like scheme, essentially a golden section line-search algorithm [24]. However, when responses from the oracle are only probably correct we make the line-search robust to errors by repeating the same query until we can be confident about the true, uncorrupted direction of the pairwise comparison using a standard procedure from the active learning literature [25] (a similar technique was also implemented for the bandit setting of derivate-free optimization [8]).

      "text" : "Now assume that the responses from the pairwise comparison oracle are only probably correct in accordance with the model introduced above. Essentially, the robust procedure runs the line search as if the oracle made no errors except that each time a comparison is needed, the oracle is repeatedly queried until we can be confident about the true direction of the comparison. This strategy applied to active learning is well known because of its simplicity and its ability to adapt to unknown noise conditions [25]. However, we mention that when used in this way, this sampling procedure is known to be sub-optimal so in practice, one may want to implement a more efficient approach like that of [21]. Nevertheless, we have the following lemma.\nLemma 2. [25] For any x, y ∈ B with P (Cf (x, y) = sign{f(y)− f(x)}) = p, with probability at least 1 − δ the coin-tossing algorithm of [25] correctly identifies the sign of E [Cf (x, y)] and requests no more than log(2/δ)4|1/2−p|2 log2 ( log(2/δ) 4|1/2−p|2 ) pairwise comparisons.\nIt would be convenient if we could simply apply the result of Lemma 2 to our line search procedure. Unfortunately, if we do this there is no guarantee that |f(y) − f(x)| is bounded below so for the case when κ > 1, it would be impossible to lower bound |1/2 − p| in the lemma. To account for this, we will sample at multiple locations per iteration as opposed to just two in the noiseless algorithm to ensure that we can always lower bound |1/2− p|. Intuitively, strong convexity ensures that f cannot be arbitrarily flat so for any three equally spaced points x, y, z on the line dk, if f(x) is equal to f(y), then it follows that the absolute difference between f(x) and f(z) must be bounded away from zero. Applying this idea and union bounding over the total number of times one must call the coin-tossing algorithm, one finds that with probability at least 1 − δ, the total number of calls to the pairwise comparison oracle over the course of the whole algorithm does not exceed Õ (\nnL τ ( n ǫ )2(κ−1) log2 ( f(x0)−f(x∗) ǫ ) log(n/δ) ) . By finding a T > 0 that satisfies this\nbound for any ǫ we see that this is equivalent to a rate of O ( n log(n/δ) ( n T ) 1 2(κ−1) ) for κ > 1 and O ( exp { −c √ T\nn log(n/δ)\n}) for κ = 1, ignoring polylog factors."

      "text" : "This paper presented lower bounds on the performance of derivative-free optimization for (i) an oracle that provides noisy function evaluations and (ii) an oracle that provides probably correct boolean comparisons between function evaluations. Our results were proven for the class of strongly convex functions but because this class is a subset of all, possibly non-convex functions, our lower bounds hold for much larger classes as well. Under both oracle models we showed that the expected error decays like Ω ( (n/T )1/2 ) . Furthermore, for the class of strongly convex functions with Lipschitz gradients, we proposed an algorithm that achieves a rate of Õ ( n(n/T )1/2 ) for both oracle models which shows that the lower bounds are tight with respect to the dependence on the number of iterations T and no more than a factor of n off in terms of the dimension.\nA number of open questions still remain. In particular, one would like to resolve the gap between the lower and upper bounds with respect to the dependence on the dimension. Due to real world constraints, it is also desirable to extend the pairwise comparison algorithm to operate under the conditions of constrained optimization where B is a convex, proper subset of Rd. Also, while the analysis of our algorithm relies heavily on the assumption that the function is strongly convex with Lipschitz gradients, it is unclear whether these assumptions are necessary to achieve the same rates of convergence. Developing a practical algorithm that achieves our lower bounds and does not suffer from these limiting assumptions would be a significant contribution."

Let w be a Gaussian random variable with mean zero and variance σ2. Then η(y, x) ≥ 12 +min { 1√ 2πe , 1√ 4πσ2e |f(y)− f(x)| } .\nProof.

      "heading" : "B Upper Bounds - Extended",
      "text" : "The algorithm that achieves the upper bound using a pairwise comparison oracle is a combination of a few standard techniques and methods pulled from the convex optimization and statistical learning literature. The algorithm can be summarized as follows. At each iteration the algorithm picks a coordinate uniformly at random from the n possible dimensions and then performs an approximate line search. By exploiting the fact that the function is strongly convex with Lipschitz gradients, one guarantees using standard arguments that the approximate line search makes a sufficient decrease in the objective function value in expectation [23, Ch.9.3]. If the pairwise comparison oracle made no errors then the approximate line search is accomplished by a binary-search-like scheme that is known in the literature as the golden section line-search algorithm [24]. However, when responses from the oracle are only probably correct we make the line-search robust to errors by repeating the same query until we can be confident about the true, uncorrupted direction of the pairwise comparison using a standard procedure from the active learning literature [25].\nB.1 Coordinate descent algorithm\nTheorem 7. Let f ∈ Fτ,L,B with B = Rn. For any η > 0 assume the line search in the algorithm of Figure 1 requires at most Tℓ(η) queries from the pairwise comparison oracle.

First note that ||dk|| = 1 for all k with probability 1. Because the gradients of f are Lipschitz (L) we have from Taylor’s theorem\nf(xk+1) ≤ f(xk) + 〈∇f(xk), αkdk〉+ α2kL\n2 .\nNote that the right-hand-side is convex in αk and is minimized by\nα̂k = − 〈∇f(xk), dk〉\nL .\nHowever, recalling how αk is chosen, if α∗ = argminα f(xk + αdk) then we have\nf(xk + αkdk)− f(xk + α∗dk) ≤ L 2 ||(αk − α∗)dk||2 = L 2 |αk − α∗|2 ≤ L 2 η2.\nThis implies\nf(xk + αkdk)− f(xk) ≤ f(xk + α∗dk)− f(xk) + L\n2 η2\n≤ f(xk + α̂kdk)− f(xk) + L\n2 η2\n≤ −〈∇f(xk), dk〉 2\n2L +\nL 2 η2.\nTaking the expectation with respect to dk, we have\nE [f(xk+1)] ≤ E [f(xk)]− E [ 〈∇f(xk), dk〉2\n2L\n] + L\n2 η2\n= E [f(xk)]− E [ E [ 〈∇f(xk), dk〉2 2L ∣∣∣∣d0, . . . , dk−1 ]] + L 2 η2 = E [f(xk)]− E [ ||∇f(xk)||2\n2nL\n] + L\n2 η2\nwhere we applied the law of iterated expectation.

Because we are minimizing over a single variable, α, we will restart the indexing at 0 such that the line search algorithm produces a sequence α0, α1, . . . , αK′ . This indexing should not be confused with the indexing of the iterates x1, x2, . . . , xK . We will first present an algorithm that assumes the pairwise comparison oracle makes no errors and then extend the algorithm to account for the noise model introduced in Section 2.\nConsider the algorithm of Figure 2. At each iteration, one is guaranteed to eliminate at least 1/2 the search space at each iteration such that at least 1/4 the search space is discarded for every pairwise comparison that is requested. However, with a slight modification to the algorithm, one can guarantee a greater fraction of removal (see the golden section line-search algorithm). We use this sub-optimal version for simplicity because it will help provide intuition for how the robust version of the algorithm works.\nTheorem 8. Let f ∈ Fτ,L,B with B = Rn and let Cf be a function comparison oracle that makes no errors. Let x ∈ Rn be an initial position and let d ∈ Rn be a search direction with ||d|| = 1. If αK is an estimate of α∗ = argminα f(x + dα) that is output from the algorithm of Figure 2 after requesting no more than K pairwise comparisons, then for any η > 0\n|αK − α∗| ≤ η whenever K ≥ 2 log2 ( 256L (f(x)− f(x+ dα∗))\nτ2η2\n) .\nProof. First note that if αK is output from the algorithm, we have 12 |αK −α∗| ≤ |α+K −α−K | ≤ 12η, as desired.\nWe will handle the cases when |α∗| is greater than one and less than one separately. First assume that |α∗| ≥ 1. Using the fact that f is strongly convex (τ), it is straightforward to show that immediately\nafter exiting the initial while loops, (i) at most 2+ 12 log2 ( 8 τ (f(x)− f(x+ dα∗)) ) pairwise comparisons were requested, (ii) α∗ ∈ [α−k , α+k ], and (iii) |α+k −α−k | ≤ ( 8 τ (f(x)− f(x+ dα∗)) )1/2 . We also have that α∗ ∈ [α−k+1, α+k+1] if α∗ ∈ [α−k , α+k ] for all k. Thus, it follows that\n|α+k+l − α−k+l| = 2−l|α+k − α−k | ≤ 2−l ( 8\nτ (f(x)− f(x+ dα∗))\n)1/2 .\nTo make the right-hand-side less than or equal to η/2, set l = log2\n( ( 8τ (f(x)−f(x+dα ∗)))1/2\nη/2\n) .\nThis brings the total number of pairwise comparison requests to no more than\n2 log2\n( 32(f(x)−f(x+dα∗))\nτη\n) .\nNow assume that |α∗| ≤ 1. A straightforward calculation shows that the while loops will terminate after requesting at most 2 + 12 log2 ( L τ ) pairwise comparisons. And immediately after exiting the while loops we have |α+k − α−k | ≤ 2. It follows by the same arguments of above that if we want |α+k+l − α−k+l| ≤ η/2 it suffices to set l = log2 ( 4 η ) . This brings the total number of pairwise comparison requests to no more than 2 log2 ( 8L τη ) . For sufficiently small η both cases are positive and the result follows from adding the two.\nThis implies that if the function comparison oracle makes no errors and it is given an iterate xk and direction dk then Tℓ (√ ǫτ 4nL2 ) ≤ 2 log2 ( 2048nL2(f(xk)−f(xk+dk α∗)) τ3ǫ ) which brings the total number of pairwise comparisons requested to at most 8nL τ log ( f(x0)−f(x∗) ǫ/2 ) log2 ( 2048nL2 maxk(f(xk)−f(xk+dk α∗)) τ3ǫ ) .\nB.3 Proof of Theorem 2\nWe now introduce a line search algorithm that is robust to a function comparison oracle that makes errors. Essentially, the algorithm consists of nothing more than repeatedly querying the same random pairwise comparison. This strategy applied to active learning is well known because of its simplicity and its ability to adapt to unknown noise conditions [25]. However, we mention that when used in this way, this sampling procedure is known to be sub-optimal so in practice, one may want to implement a more efficient approach like that of [21]. Consider the subroutine of Figure 3.\nLemma 5. [25] For any x, y ∈ Rn with P (Cf (x, y) = sign{f(y)− f(x)}) = p, then with probability at least 1−δ the algorithm of Figure 3 correctly identifies the sign of E [Cf (x, y)] and requests no more than\nlog(2/δ) 4|1/2− p|2 log2 ( log(2/δ) 4|1/2− p|2 )\npairwise comparisons.\nIt would be convenient if we could simply apply the result of Lemma 2 to the algorithm of Figure 2. Unfortunately, if we do this there is no guarantee that |f(y)−f(x)| is bounded below so for the case when κ > 1, it would be impossible to lower bound |1/2− p| in the lemma. To account for this, we will sample at four points per iteration as opposed to just two in the noiseless algorithm to ensure that we can always lower bound |1/2 − p|. We will see that the algorithm and analysis naturally adapts to when κ = 1 or κ > 1.\nConsider the following modification to the algorithm of Figure 2. We discuss the sampling process that takes place in [αk, α + k ] but it is understood that the same process is repeated symmetrically in [α−k , αk]. We begin with the first two while loops. Instead of repeatedly samplingCf (x, x+dα + k ) we will have two sampling procedures running in parallel that repeatedly compare αk to α + k and αk to 2α+k . As soon as the repeated sampling procedure terminates for one of them we terminate the second sampling strategy and proceed with what the noiseless algorithm would do with α+k assigned to be the sampling location that finished first. Once we’re out of the initial while loops, instead of comparing αk to 12 (αk + α + k ) repeatedly, we will repeatedly compare αk to 1 3 (αk + α + k ) and αk to 2 3 (αk + α + k ). Again, we will treat the location that finishes its sampling first as 1 2 (αk + α + k ) in the noiseless algorithm.\nIf we perform this procedure every iteration, then at each iteration we are guaranteed to remove at least 1/3 the search space, as opposed to 1/2 in the noiseless case, so we realize that the number of iterations of the robust algorithm is within a constant factor of the number of iterations of the noiseless algorithm. However, unlike the noiseless case where at most two pairwise comparisons were requested at each iteration, we must now apply Lemma ?? to determine the number of pairwise comparisons that are requested per iteration.\nIntuitively, the repeated sampling procedure requests the most pairwise comparisons when the distance between the two function evaluations being compared smallest. This corresponds to when the distance between probe points is smallest, i.e. when η/2 ≤ |αk − α∗| ≤ η. By considering this worst case, we can bound the number of pairwise comparisons that are requested at any iteration. By strong convexity (τ) we find through a straightforward calculation that max { |f(x+ dαk)− f(x+ d 23 (αk + α+k ))|, |f(x + dαk)− f(x+ d 13 (αk + α+k ))| } ≥ τ18η2 for all k. This implies |1/2 − p| ≥ µ (\nτ 18η\n2 )κ−1\nso that on on any given call to the repeated querying\nsubroutine, with probability at least 1 − δ the subroutine requests no more than Õ ( log(1/δ)\n(τη2)2(κ−1)\n)\npairwise comparisons. However, because we want the total number of calls to the subroutine to hold with probability 1 − δ, not just one, we must union bound over 4 pairwise comparisons per iteration times the number of iterations per line search times the number of line searches. This brings the total number of calls to the repeated query subroutine to no more than 4 × 3 2 log2 ( 256Lmaxk(f(xk)−f(xk+dk α∗k)) τ2η2 ) × 4nLτ log ( f(x0)−f(x∗) η22nL2/τ ) = O ( nLτ log 2 ( f(x0)−f(x∗) nη2 )) . If we set η = (\nǫτ 4nL2 )1/2 so that E [f(xK)− f(x∗)] ≤ ǫ by Theorem 7, then the total number of\nrequested pairwise comparisons does not exceed\nÕ\n( nL\nτ (n ǫ )2(κ−1) log2 ( f(x0)− f(x∗) ǫ ) log(n/δ) ) .\nBy finding a T > 0 that satisfies this bound for any ǫ we see that this is equivalent to a rate of O ( n log(n/δ) ( n T ) 1 2(κ−1) ) for κ > 1 and O ( exp { −c √ T n log(n/δ) }) for κ = 1, ignoring polylog factors."

However, there are situations in which DFO is unavoidable, and for such situations we propose a new DFO algorithm that is proved to be near optimal for the class of strongly convex objective functions. A distinctive feature of the algorithm is that it uses only Boolean-valued function comparisons, rather than function evaluations. This makes the algorithm useful in an even wider range of applications, such as optimization based on paired comparisons from human subjects, for example. We also show that regardless of whether DFO is based on noisy function evaluations or Boolean-valued function comparisons, the convergence rate is the same.",
