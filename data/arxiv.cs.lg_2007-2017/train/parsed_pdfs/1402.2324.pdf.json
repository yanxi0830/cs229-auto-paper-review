      "text" : "In this paper, we study the problem of universal low-rank matrix completion. Low-rank matrix completion is an important problem with several applications in areas such as recommendation systems, sketching, and quantum tomography (Recht et al., 2010; Candès & Recht, 2009; Gross et al., 2010). The goal in matrix completion is to recover a rank-r matrix, given a small number of entries of the matrix. That is, to find a matrix M given values {Mij , (i, j) ∈ Ω}, where Ω is the set of observed indices.\nRecently, several methods with provable guarantees have been proposed for solving the problem under the following two assumptions: a) M is incoherent, b) Ω is sampled uniformly and |Ω| ≥ cnr log n. Moreover, Ω needs to be re-sampled for each matrix M that is to be recovered, i.e., the same Ω cannot be re-used without worsening the guarantees significantly.\nWhile the first assumption can be shown to be necessary for any matrix oblivious sampling, the second assumption is relatively restrictive and might not hold in several practical settings. The main goal of this work is to develop a general result that can handle other sampling schemes as well. Moreover, we aim to develop a universal method where one fixed Ω would be enough to recover any low-rank matrix M . Such a universal recovery result is highly desirable in several signal processing applications, where the goal is to design one Ω that can recover any low-rank signal matrix M by observing M over Ω alone.\nTo this end, we reduce the problem of recoverability using an index set Ω to the spectral gap (gap between largest and second largest singular values) of G, where G is a bipartite graph whose biadjacency matrix G ∈ Rn×n is given by: Gij = 1 iff (i, j) ∈ Ω and Gij = 0 otherwise. In particular, we show that if G has a large enough spectral gap and if the rank-r matrix M satisfies the standard incoherence property, then the best rank-r approximation of PΩ(M) (see (1)) itself is enough to get a “reasonable” approximation to M (see Theorem 4.1 for details).\nNote that our approximation result is similar to Theorem 1.1 of (Keshavan et al., 2010), but our result holds for any Ω with large spectral gap unlike (Keshavan et al., 2010) that requires uniform sampling. On the other hand, we require explicit incoherence condition on singular vectors of M , while the result of (Keshavan et al., 2010) only requires a bound on Mmax = maxij Mij . The later assumption is strictly weaker assumption; the assumptions coincide for PSD matrices.\nNext, we show that by assuming certain stronger incoherence properties, the number of samples required by the popular nuclear-norm minimization method (Candès & Recht, 2009) to recover back M depends only on n, r and the spectral gap of the d-regular bipartite graph G. In particular, we require d ≥ σ2(G) · r, where σ2(G) is the second largest singular value of G. Hence, if σ2(G) = O(\n√ d), i.e., if G is an expander, then |Ω| = nd = O(nr2) samples suffice for exact recovery. Our recovery results applies to any low rank matrix M that satisfies the stronger incoherence property, given that the fixed graph G has a large spectral gap. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first universal guarantee for matrix completion. Furthermore, using recent results by (Feige & Ofek, 2005) we show that for the standard uniform sampling of Ω, only O(nr2) samples suffice for exact recovery of a rank-r matrix M that satisfies a stronger incoherence condition (see A2 in Section 3).\nNext, we discuss the stronger incoherence property that we require for our universal recovery guarantees. In particular, we show that the standard incoherence condition alone cannot provide universal recovery with any graph G and hence a stronger incoherence property is required.\nFinally, we empirically demonstrate our observation that, instead of the number of samples, the spectral gap of G is what really governs recoverability of the true matrix. In particular, we construct a family of graphs based on the stochastic block model and show that the probability of success grows linearly with the spectral gap, irrespective of the number of samples.\nNotation: We denote matrices by capital letters (e.g. U) and vectors by small letters (e.g. u). UT denotes the transpose of the matrix U . Uij represents the (i, j)-th element of U . Ui represents the i-th column of U and U i represents the i-th row of U (but in column format). ‖u‖ represents the L2 norm of u and ‖U‖ represents the spectral norm of U , i.e., ‖U‖ = maxx:‖x‖≤1 ‖Ux‖. ‖U‖F represents the Frobenius norm and ‖U‖∞ is the absolute maximum element of U . C = A.B represents the Hadamard product of A,B, i.e., Cij = AijBij . Similarly, (u.v)i = uivi. 1 denotes the all 1’s vector. 1⊥ represents a unit vector that is perpendicular to 1 and is determined appropriately by the context.\nPaper Organization: In the next section, we discuss some related works. Then, in Section 3, we define the problem of matrix completion and the bipartite graph G that we use. We present our main results in Section 4 and discuss the additional incoherence assumption in Section 5. In Section 6, we present observations from our empirical study. Finally in Section 7, we provide the proof of our exact recovery result."

      "text" : "Matrix completion: In a seminal paper on matrix completion, (Candès & Recht, 2009) showed that any n × n incoherent matrix of rank r can be recovered from Cn1.2r log(n) uniform random samples using nuclear norm minimization. Later, assuming the matrix to be strongly incoherent, (Candès & Tao, 2010) improved the sample complexity for nuclear norm minimization method to O(nr log6(n)). Subsequently, (Recht, 2009; Gross, 2011) generalized this result for any incoherent matrix using matrix Bernstein inequalities and presented significantly simpler proofs. Concurrently other algorithms were shown to recover incoherent matrices using O(nr log(n)) (or worse) samples such as: SVD followed by descent on Grassmanian manifold (Keshavan et al., 2010), alternating minimization (Jain et al., 2012). We note that all the above mentioned results need to assume a rather restrictive sampling scheme, i.e., each entry is sampled uniformly at random and furthermore require a fresh set of samples for each new matrix. Moreover, the number of samples required is at least O(nr log n).\nOther sampling schemes: Recently, there has been some results for different type of sampling schemes such as power-law distributions (Meka et al., 2009), but here again universal results are not known and furthermore the proposed algorithms are not robust to noise. Another line of work has been to devise sampling schemes dependent on the data matrix (Chen et al., 2013), (Király & Tomioka, 2012). Naturally, these schemes cannot be universal as the sampling scheme itself is dependent on the data matrix. Furthermore, practicality of such schemes is not clear a priori.\nUniversality: Universality is an important property in signal processing or sketching applications, as the goal there is to have one fixed sampling operator that performs well for all the given signals. While, universality results are well known for several other sensing problems, such as sparse vector recovery (Candes & Tao, 2005), one-bit compressive sensing (Gopi et al., 2013), similar results for low-rank matrix sensing are mostly restricted to RIP-type operators (Recht et al., 2010; Liu, 2011). Unfortunately, RIP-type of operators are typically dense, requiring knowledge of all elements of matrix to get observations, and also require large storage/computational complexity. On the other hand sampling individual elements is a sparse operator and hence computationally efficient. Hence, for several signal processing applications, universal matrix completion results are critical.\nIn fact, several recent works have studied problems similar to that of universal matrix completion. For example, (Király & Tomioka, 2012; Heiman et al., 2013) and (Lee & Shraibman, 2013). However, there are critical differences in our results/approaches that we now highlight. In (Király & Tomioka, 2012) authors consider an algebraic approach to analyze sufficient conditions for matrix completion. While they propose interesting deterministic sufficient conditions, the algorithm analyzed in the paper requires solving an NP hard problem. In contrast we analyze the nuclear norm minimization method which is known to have several efficient implementations. In (Heiman et al., 2013) and (Lee & Shraibman, 2013) authors consider sampling based on expanders but only provide generalization error bounds rather than exact recovery guarantee. Moreover, the recovered matrix using their algorithm need not have a low-rank."

We observe a small number of entries of M indexed by a set Ω ∈ [n1]× [n2]. That is, we observe Mij ,∀(i, j) ∈ Ω. Define the sampling operator PΩ : R n1×n2 → Rn1×n2 as:\nPΩ(M) =\n{\nMij , if (i, j) ∈ Ω, 0, if (i, j) 6∈ Ω.\n(1)\nNext, we define a bipartite graph associated with the sampling operator PΩ. That is, let G = (V,E) be a bipartite graph where V = {1, 2, . . . , n1} ∪ {1, 2, . . . , n2} and (i, j) ∈ E iff (i, j) ∈ Ω. Let G ∈ Rn1×n2 be the biadjacency matrix of the bipartite graph G with Gij = 1 iff (i, j) ∈ Ω. Note that, PΩ(M) = M.G, where . denotes the Hadamard product.\nNow, the goal in universal matrix completion is to design a set Ω and a recovery algorithm, s.t., all rank-r matrices M can be recovered using only PΩ(M). In the next section, we present two results for this problem. Our first result gives an approximate solution to the matrix completion problem and our second result gives exact recovery guarantees.\nFor our results, we require G, that is associated with Ω, to be a d-regular bipartite graph with large spectral gap. More concretely, we require the following two properties from the sampling graph G:\nAssumptions on G/Ω:\n• G1 Top singular vectors of G are all 1’s vector. • G2 σ1(G) = d and σ2(G) ≤ C √ d.\nNote that as the graph is d-regular, hence |Ω| = nd. The eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the bipartite graph G are {σi(G),−σi(G)}, i = 1, ..n. We state all the definitions in terms of singular values of G instead of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. The above two properties are satisfied by a class of expander graphs called Ramanujan graphs; in fact, Ramanujan graphs are defined by using this spectral gap property:\nDefinition 3.1 (Ramanujan graph (Hoory et al., 2006)). Let σ1(G), σ2(G), ..., σn(G) be the singular values of G in decreasing order. Then, a d-regular bipartite graph G is a Ramanujan graph if σ2(G) ≤ 2 √ d− 1.\nRamanujan graphs G are well-studied in literature and there exists several randomized/deterministic methods to generate such graphs. We briefly discuss a couple of popular constructions in Section 4.2.\nIncoherence assumptions: Now, we present incoherence assumptions that we impose on M :\nA1 ||U i||2 ≤ µ0r n1 ,∀i and ||V j ||2 ≤ µ0r n2 ,∀j (2) A2 ‖ ∑\nk∈S\nn1 d UkUk T − I‖ ≤ δd,∀S ⊂ [n1], |S| = d and\n‖ ∑\nk∈S\nn2 d′ V kV k T − I‖ ≤ δd,∀S ⊂ [n2], |S| = d′. (3)\nd′ = dn2/n1. Note that A1 is the standard incoherence assumption required by most of the existing matrix completion results. However, A2 is a stricter assumption than A1 and is similar to the stronger incoherence property introduced by (Candès & Tao, 2010). We discuss necessity of such assumption for universal matrix completion in Section 5."

For non-PSD matrices, our result requires a bound on norm of each row of singular vectors of M , while the result of (Keshavan et al., 2010) only requires a bound on the largest element of M , hence is similar to our requirement but is strictly weaker as well.\nOn the other hand, our result holds for all M for a given Ω, if Ω’s associated graph G satisfies both G1 and G2.

      "text" : "We now present our result for exact recovery of the matrix M using PΩ(M) alone. For recovery, we use the standard nuclear norm minimization algorithm, i.e., we obtain a matrix X by solving the following convex optimization problem:\nmin ‖X‖∗ s. t. PΩ(X) = PΩ(M),\n(7)\nwhere ‖X‖∗ denotes the nuclear norm of X; nuclear norm of X is equal to the sum of its singular values.\nAs mentioned in Section 2, nuclear norm minimization technique is a popular technique for the low-rank matrix completion problem and has been shown to provably recover the true matrix, assuming that Ω is sampled uniformly at random and |Ω| ≥ cnr log n (Candès & Tao, 2010).\nBelow, we provide a universal recovery result for the nuclear-norm minimization method as long as the samples Ω come from G that satisfies G1 and G2.\nTheorem 4.2. Let M be an n1 × n2 matrix of rank r satisfying assumptions (A1) and (A2) with δd ≤ 16 , and Ω is generated from a d-regular graph G that satisfies the assumptions (G1) and (G2). Also, let d ≥ 36C2µ20r2, i.e., |Ω| = nd ≥ 36C2µ20r2max{n1, n2}. Then M is the unique optimum of problem (7).\nNote that the above result requires only deterministic constraints on the sampling operator PΩ and guarantees exact recovery for any matrix M that satisfies A1, A2. As mentioned earlier, A2 is a stronger assumption than A1. But as we show in Section 5, universal recovery is not possible with assumption A1 alone.\nWe can use the above theorem to derive results for several interesting sampling schemes such as random d-regular graphs. Using Theorem 1 in (Friedman, 2003), the second singular value of a random d-regular graph is ≤ 2 √ d− 1 + ǫ, for every ǫ > 0, with high probability. Hence, a random d-regular graph, with high probability, obeys G1 and G2 which implies the following exact recovery result:\nCorollary 4.3. Let M be an n1 × n2 matrix of rank r satisfying assumptions (A1) and (A2) with δd ≤ 16 , and Ω is generated from a random d-regular graph, then M is the unique optimum of program (7) when d ≥ 36 ∗ 4µ20r2, with high probability.\nNote that the standard completion results such as (Candès & Recht, 2009), (Keshavan et al., 2010) generate Ω using Erdös-Rényi graph, which are slightly different than the random d-regular graph we considered above. However, (Feige & Ofek, 2005) showed that the second largest singular value of the Erdös-Rényi graph, G(n1, n2, p), is O( √ d) when p is Θ(log(n1)/n2). Interestingly, even when p = c/n2, i.e. n2 · p is a constant, trimming the graph (i.e., removing few nodes with high degree) gives a graph G s.t. σ2(G) = O( √ d). Hence, we can again apply Theorem 4.2 to obtain the following result:\nCorollary 4.4. Let M be an n1 ×n2 matrix of rank r satisfying assumptions (A1) and (A2) with δd ≤ 16 , and Ω is generated from a G(n, p) graph after trimming, then M is the unique optimum of program (7) when p ≥ 36cµ 2 0 r2\nmin{n1,n2} , with high probability.\nWhile the above two results exploit the fact that a random graph is almost a Ramanujan expander and hence our general recovery result can be applied, the graph construction is still randomized. Interestingly, (Lubotzky et al., 1988; Margulis, 1988; Morgenstern, 1994) proposed explicit deterministic constructions of Ramanujan graphs when d− 1 is a prime power. Moreover, (Marcus et al., 2013) showed that bipartite Ramanujan graphs exist for all n and d. However, explicit construction for all n and d still remains an open problem."

      "heading" : "5 Discussion",
      "text" : "In this section, we discuss the two assumptions A1 and A2 that are mentioned in Section 3. Note that A1 is a standard assumption that is used by most of the existing approaches (Candès & Recht, 2009), (Keshavan et al., 2010). Moreover, it is easy to show that for any matrix “oblivious” sampling approach, this assumption is necessarily required for exact recovery. For example, if Gij = 0, i.e., (i, j)-th element is not observed then we cannot recover M = eie T j .\nHowever, A2 is a slightly non-standard assumption and intuitively it requires the singular vectors of M to satisfy RIP. Note that A2 is similar to the strong incoherence property introduced by (Candès & Tao, 2010). Below we show the connection between strong incoherence property (SIP) assumed in (Candès & Tao, 2010) and assumption A2.\nClaim 5.1. Let M ∈ Rn1×n2 be a rank-r matrix. Let M = UΣV T satisfy SIP i.e.,\n|〈ei, UUTej〉 − r\nn1 1i=j | ≤ µ1\n√ r n1 ,∀1 ≤ i, j ≤ n1,\n|〈ei, V V Tej〉 − r\nn1 1i=j | ≤ µ1\n√ r n2 ,∀1 ≤ i, j ≤ n2. (8)\nThen, M satisfies A2 for all d ≥ r and δd ≤ µ1 √ r.\nNote that the above claim holds with δd = µ1 √ r, ∀d ≥ r. This bound is independent of d and\nhence weak; as d becomes close to n1, ∥ ∥ ∥ n1 d ∑ k∈S U kUk T − I ∥ ∥ ∥ gets close to 0 since UTU = I. We leave the task of obtaining a stronger bound as an open problem.\nIn the context of universal recovery, a natural question is if any additional assumption is required or the standard A1 assumption alone suffices. Here, we answer this question in negative. Specifically, we show that if M satisfies A1 only, then universal recovery guarantee for even rank-2 matrices cannot be provided by using as many as n1n2/4 observations.\nClaim 5.2. Let Ω be a fixed set of indices and let PΩ be the sampling operator as defined in (1). Let n1 = n2 = n and let |Ω| = n2/4. Then, there exists a rank-2 matrix M that cannot be recovered exactly from PΩ(M).\nNow, another question is if we require a property as strong as A2 and if just a lower-bound on ‖U i‖2, ‖V j‖2 is enough for universal recovery. The proof of the above claim (in appendix) shows that even if ‖U i‖2, ‖V j‖2 are lower-bounded, then also exact recovery is not possible."

      "text" : "In this section, we will present a few empirical results on both synthetic and real data sets. The goal of this section is to demonstrate effect of the spectral gap of the sampling graph G (associated with Ω) on successful recovery of a matrix.\nFirst, we use synthetic data sets generated in the following manner. We first sample U, V ∈ R 500×10 using standard normal distribution. We then generate rank-10 matrix M , using M = UV T . As U, V are sampled from the normal distribution, hence w.h.p., M satisfies incoherence assumptions A1, A2 mentioned in Section 3. Next, we generate a sequence of sampling operators PΩ (and the associated graph G) with varying (relative) spectral gap(1− σ2(G)/σ1(G)) by using a stochastic block model. In the basic stochastic block model, the nodes can be thought of as being divided into two clusters. Now, each intra-cluster edge is sampled uniformly with probability p and an inter-cluster edge is sampled uniformly with probability q. Note that, when p = q, then the spectral gap is largest and when p = 1, q = 0, then spectral gap is smaller as there are two distinct clusters in that case (Nadakuditi & Newman, 2012).\nNote that number of samples generated in this model depends only on the value of p + q. To generate Ω (i.e., G), we first fix a value for p+q, hence fixing the number of samples, and then vary p, q, which gives graphs of different spectral gap. As value of p goes from 0 to p+q2 , the spectral gap goes up and from p+q2 to p+ q, the spectral gap goes down. Figure 1(a) clearly demonstrates this trend.\nWe use an Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM) based method (Lin et al., 2010) to solve the nuclear norm minimization (7) problem. A trial is considered to be successful if the relative error (in Frobenius norm) is less than 0.01. We average over 50 such trials to determine the success ratio.\nFigure 1(a) plots the (relative) spectral gap (dotted lines) and the success ratio (solid lines) as p varies. Lines of different colors indicate different number of samples (p + q). As expected, the spectral gap increases initially, as p varies from 0 to p+q2 and then it decreases. Moreover, the trend of successful recovery also follows a similar trajectory and hence, is more or less independent of the number of samples (given a particular spectral gap).\nFigure 1(b) shows fraction of successful recoveries as the spectral gap increases. Here again, lines of different colors indicate different number of samples (p + q). Clearly, success ratio is positively correlated with the spectral gap of the sampling operator and in fact exhibits a phase transition type of phenomenon. We expect the difference in success ratio for different p+ q values to decrease with increasing problem size, i.e, dimensionality of M .\nNow, we conduct an experiment to show that spectral gap of G helps in reducing effect of noise as well. To this end, we generated noisy input matrix (M + Z), where Z is a random Gaussian matrix and let σ = ||Z||F /||M ||F . We consider two values of σ, i.e., σ = 0.1 and 0.2. Figure 2(a) plots the error(in Frobenius norm) in the recovered matrix against the relative spectral gap in the noisy setting. Solid lines represent σ = 0.1 and dotted lines represent σ = 0.2. Clearly, larger spectral gap leads to smaller error in recovery. Moreover, the “matrix completion denoising” effect (Candes & Plan, 2010) can also be observed. For example, when ||Z||F = 0.1 and p + q = 0.4, output error is less than 0.05, and when ||Z||F = 0.2, error is less than 0.1\nTemperature prediction: Finally we take a real dataset of temperature values(T ) for 365 days at 316 different locations from (NCDC), which has been used to test matrix completion algorithms (Candes & Plan, 2010) before. Note that T is approximately rank-1 matrix with\nσ1(T )/||T ||F = 0.98(σi(T ) are singular values of T ). We use the block model sampling scheme to sample entries from T , and let the output of (7) be T̂ . In figure 2(b) we plot the error ||T̂ −T ||/||T || for different values of spectral gap of G and for different number of samples (p + q). Note that ||X − T ||/||T || ≥ σ2(T )/σ1(T ) for any rank-1 matrix X, and we see that for large enough spectral gap we achieve this bound.\nFinally in figure 2(c) we compare running times of the r-closure algorithm proposed in (Király & Tomioka, 2012) with the nuclear norm minimization algorithm. While it is noted that this algorithm has better error guarantees, it is combinatorial and takes exponential time to compute."

      "text" : "In this section, we present the proof of our main result (Theorem 4.2). The main steps of our proof are similar to the proof given by (Recht, 2009). The main difference is that the bounds in the existing proof assume that Ω is independent of M and hence is not adversarial and holds with high probability. In contrast, for our proofs, bounds are deterministic and our proofs have to work under the assumption that M is adversarially selected for a given Ω.\nThe key steps in the proof are: a) provide conditions that an optimal dual solution (or dual certificate) of problem (7) should satisfy, so that the true matrix M is the unique optimum of (7), b) construct such a dual certificate and hence guarantee that M is the unique optimum of (7).\nWe first introduce a few notations required by our proof. For simplicity, we assume that n1 = n2 = n. Note that, our proof easily generalizes to case when n1 6= n2. Define T which is a subspace of Rn×n, and is span of all matrices of form UXT and Y V T , i.e. all matrices with either row space in V or column space in U . Hence, the projection operator PT is defined as follows:\nPT (Z) = UUTZ + ZV V T − UUTZV V T = UUTZ + (I − UUT )ZV V T .\nHence any matrix in T can be written as UXT + Y V T , for some X and Y such that Y and U are orthogonal to each other. Similarly, we can define the projection operator onto T⊥, the orthogonal complement of T : PT⊥(Z) = (I − UUT )Z(I − V V T ). Now, before presenting conditions on the dual certificate and construction of the dual certificate, we provide a few structural lemmas that show “goodness” of operators PT and PΩ. We would like to stress that the key differences of our proof from that of (Recht, 2009) is in fact proofs of these structural lemmas and also in the way we apply Lemma 7.3. We specifically show (using Lemma 7.3) that each matrix in the series used in the construction of dual certificate Y (discussed later in the section) is incoherent and has small infinity norm.\nThe first lemma proves injectivity of operator PΩ on the subspace T :\nLemma 7.1. Let M = UΣV T satisfies A1, A2 and let the graph G that generates Ω satisfies G1, G2 (see Section 3). Then, for any matrix Z ∈ T ,\n‖n d PTPΩ(Z)− Z‖F ≤\n√\n2(δ2d + C2µ20r 2\nd )‖Z‖F .\nNext, we provide a lemma that characterizes the “difference” between PΩ(Z) and Z, for any incoherent-type Z ∈ T :\nLemma 7.2. Let Z ∈ T , i.e., Z = UXT + Y V T and Y is orthogonal to U , and X and Y be incoherent, i.e.,\n‖Xi‖2 ≤ c 2 1µ0r n , ‖Y j‖2 ≤ c 2 2µ0r n .\nLet Ω satisfy the assumptions G1 and G2, then:\n‖n d PΩ(Z)− Z‖ ≤ (c1 + c2) Cµ0r√ d .\nThe next lemma is a stronger version of Lemma 7.1 for special incoherent-type matrices Z ∈ T .\nLemma 7.3. Let Z ∈ T , i.e., Z = UXT + Y V T and Y is orthogonal to U . Let X and Y be incoherent, i.e.,\n‖Xi‖2 ≤ c 2 1µ0r n , ‖Y j‖2 ≤ c 2 2µ0r n .\nLet Z̃ = Z − n d PTPΩ(Z). Then, the following holds for M,Ω that satisfy conditions given in Lemma 7.1:\n• ‖Z̃‖∞ ≤ (c1+c2)µ0rn (δd + Cµ0r√ d ).\n• Z̃ = UX̃T + Ỹ V T and X̃ and Ỹ are incoherent. ‖X̃i‖2 ≤ µ0r n\n(\nδdc1 + 2c2 Cµ0r√\nd\n)2 and ‖Ỹ j‖2 ≤\nµ0r n (δdc2 + (c1 + c2) Cµ0r√ d )2.\nThe proof of the above three lemmas is provided in the appendix. Conditions on the dual certificate: We now present the lemma that characterizes the conditions a dual certificate should satisfy so that M is the unique optimum of (7):\nLemma 7.4. Let M,Ω satisfy A1, A2 and G1, G2, respectively. Then, M is the unique optimum of (7), if there exists a Y ∈ Rn×n that satisfies the following:\n• PΩ(Y ) = Y\n• ||PT (Y )− UV T ||F ≤ √ d 8n\n• ||PT⊥(Y )|| < 12 Having specified the conditions on dual certificate and also the key structural lemma, we are\nnow ready to present the proof of Theorem 4.2.\nProof of Theorem 4.2. We prove the theorem by constructing a dual certificate Y that satisfies conditions in lemma 7.4 and hence guarantee that M is exactly recovered by (7). Our construction of Y is similar to the golfing scheme based construction given in (Gross, 2011; Recht, 2009). In particular, Y is obtained as the p-th term of the series given below:\nWk+1 = Wk − n\nd PTPΩWk, Yk =\nk−1 ∑\ni=0\nn d PΩWi,\nwhere W0 = UV T . That is, Y = Yp where p = ⌈12 log3( n18C2µ2 0 r )⌉. Also, define α = Cµ0r√ d . As d ≥ 36C2µ20r2, we get: α ≤ 16 .\nNow, the first condition of Lemma 7.4 is satisfied trivially by construction as Yp is a sum of PΩ(Wi) terms. Bounding ||PT (Y )− UV T ||F : By construction:\nPT (Y )− UV T = p−1 ∑\ni=0\nn d PTPΩWi − UV T = −Wp. (9)\nNow, note that each Wk ∈ T . Hence, using Lemma 7.1,\n‖Wk+1‖F = ‖Wk − n\nd PTPΩWk‖F (10)\n≤ √ 2(δ2d + C2µ20r 2\nd )‖Wk‖F ≤\n1 3 ‖Wk‖F , (11)\nwhere the last inequality follows by using assumption on δd and by using α ≤ 1/6. Hence, using (9), (11), we have:\n‖PT (Y )− UV T ‖F = ‖Wp‖F ≤ ( 1\n3\n)p ‖W0‖F ≤ √ d\n8n , (12)\nwhere the last inequality follows by using p = ⌈12 log3( n18C2µ2 0 r )⌉ and by using ‖W0‖F =\n√ r.\nBounding ‖PT⊥(Y )‖: Recall that, Wk ∈ T . Now, let Wk = UXTWk + YWkV T with YWk perpendicular to U . Moreover, let,\n‖XiWk‖ ≤ cWk1 √ µ0r√ n , ‖Y iWk‖ ≤ cWk2 √ µ0r√ n .\nNote that, for W0 = UV T , cW01 = 1 and c W0 2 = 0. Hence, using Lemma 7.3: c W1 1 ≤ 16 , c W1 2 ≤ 16 . Similarly, applying Lemma 7.3 k-times, we get:\ncWk1 = c Wk 2 ≤ 3k−1\n1\n6k . (13)\nNow, by using construction of Y , by triangle inequality, and by using the fact that PT⊥ is a contraction operator:\n‖PT⊥(Y )‖ ≤ p ∑\nk=1\n‖n d PΩ(Wk−1)−Wk−1‖ ≤\np ∑\nk=1\n(c Wk−1 1 + c Wk−1 2 ) Cµ0r√ d , (14)\nwhere the last inequality follows by using Lemma 7.2. Now, using (13), (14), and Lemma 7.3, we have:\n‖PT⊥(Y )‖ ≤ Cµ0r√ d (1 + 2 · 1 6 (\np−1 ∑\nk=2\n3k−2 1 6k−2 )) ≤ α(1 + 2 · 1 6 · 1 1− 12 ) < 1/2.\nHence, proved."

      "text" : "In this paper, we provided the first (to the best of our knowledge) universal recovery guarantee for matrix completion. The main observation of the paper is that the spectral gap of G (that generates Ω) is the key property that governs recoverability of M using PΩ(M) alone. For example, if G is a Ramanujan expander (i.e., σ2(G) = O( √ d)), then we have universal recovery guarantees for matrices with strong incoherence property. For uniformly sampled Ω, our main result implies exact recovery of constant rank matrices using O(n) entries, in contrast to the O(n log n) entries required by the existing analyses. One caveat is that we require stronger incoherence property to obtain the above given sample complexity. Our results also provide a recipe to determine if a given index set Ω is enough to recover a low-rank matrix. That is, given Ω and its associated graph G, we can measure the spectral gap of G and if it is large enough then our results guarantee exact recovery of strongly incoherent matrices.\nIn Section 5, we showed that the standard incoherence assumption alone is not enough for universal recovery and a property similar to A2 (see Section 3) is required. However, it is an open problem to obtain precise information theoretic limits on δd (see A2) for universal recovery guarantees. Another interesting research direction is to study the alternating minimization method under assumptions given in Section 3. Finally, we also plan to apply our universal recovery guarantees to specific applications in the domains of sketching and signal-processing."

Now, let S = {j s.t., (1, j) ∈ Ω or (2, j) ∈ Ω} be the set of all the columns of M that have an observed entry in any of the first two rows.\nAs |Ω| = n2/4, hence wlog we can assume that |S| ≤ n/2. Let S′ = S ∪ S1, where S1 is any set of columns s.t. |S′| = n/2.

Hence, even if V is known exactly, one cannot obtain any information about a, b from the observed entries. Only other constraints on a, b comes from orthonormality of U , which reduces to a2 + b2 = 2/n. Now, without violating incoherence assumptions, we can have multiple solutions to the above given equation that cannot be distinguished from each other. For example, a = 1√ 2n and b = √ 3 2n , or vice-versa, i.e., a = √ 3 2n and b = 1√ 2n .\nHence, exact recovery is not possible for the above given M for any Ω s.t. |Ω| ≤ n2/4."

However, in order to do so, these methods make assumptions that can be quite restrictive in practice. More specifically, the methods assume that: a) the observed indices are sampled uniformly at random, and b) for every new matrix, the observed indices are sampled afresh. In this work, we address these issues by providing a universal recovery guarantee for matrix completion that works for a variety of sampling schemes. In particular, we show that if the set of sampled indices come from the edges of a bipartite graph with large spectral gap (i.e. gap between the first and the second singular value), then the nuclear norm minimization based method exactly recovers all low-rank matrices that satisfy certain incoherence properties. Moreover, we also show that under certain stricter incoherence conditions, O(nr) uniformly sampled entries are enough to recover any rank-r n×n matrix, in contrast to the O(nr logn) sample complexity required by other matrix completion algorithms as well as existing analyses of the nuclear norm method.",
