      "text" : "D ISTANCE metric learning aims to train a validdistance metric which can enlarge the distances between samples of different classes and reduce the distances between samples of the same class [1]. Metric learning is closely related to k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) classification [2], clustering [3], ranking [4], [5], feature extraction [6] and support vector machine (SVM) [7], and has been widely applied to face recognition [8], person re-identification [9], [10], image retrieval [11], [12], activity recognition [13], document classification [14], and link prediction [15], etc. One popular metric learning approach is the Mahalanobis distance metric learning, which is to learn a linear transformation matrix L or a matrix M = LTL from the training data. Given two samples xi and xj , the Mahalanobis distance between them is defined as:\nd2 M (xi,xj) = ‖L(xi − xj)‖ 2 2\n= (xi − xj) T M (xi − xj) .\n(1)\nTo satisfy the nonnegative property of a distance metric, M should be positive semidefinite (PSD).

(e-mail: dymeng@mail.xjtu.edu.cn)\nManuscript received XXX; revised XXX.\nto which one of M and L is learned, Mahalanobis distance metric learning methods can be grouped into two categories. Methods that learn L, including neighborhood components analysis (NCA) [16], large margin components analysis (LMCA) [17] and neighborhood repulsed metric learning (NRML) [18], are mostly formulated as nonconvex optimization problems, which are solved by gradient descent based optimizers. Taking the PSD constraint into account, methods that learn M, including large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) [19] and maximally collapsing metric learning (MCML) [20], are mostly formulated as convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problems, which can be optimized by standard SDP solvers [19], projected gradient [3], Boosting-like [21], or Frank-Wolfe [22] algorithms. Davis et al. [23] proposed an information-theoretic metric learning (ITML) model with an iterative Bregman projection algorithm, which does not need projections onto the PSD cone. Besides, the use of online solvers for metric learning has been discussed in [9], [24], [25].\nOn the other hand, kernel methods [26]–[31] have been widely studied in many learning tasks, e.g., semisupervised learning, multiple instance learning, multitask learning, etc. Kernel learning methods, such as support vector machine (SVM), exhibit good generalization performance. There are many open resources on kernel classification methods, and a variety of toolboxes and libraries have been released [32]–[38]. It is thus important to investigate the connections between metric learning and kernel classification and explore how to utilize the kernel classification resources in the research and development of metric learning methods.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel formulation of metric learning by casting it as a kernel classification problem, which allows us to effectively and efficiently\n2\nlearn distance metrics by iterated training of SVM. The off-the-shelf SVM solvers such as LibSVM [33] can be employed to solve the metric learning problem. Specifically, we propose two novel methods to bridge metric learning with the well-developed SVM techniques, and they are easy to implement. First, we propose a Positive-semidefinite Constrained Metric Learning (PCML) model, which can be solved via iterating between PSD projection and dual SVM learning. Second, by re-parameterizing the matrix M, we transform the PSD constraint into a nonnegative coefficient constraint and consequently propose a Nonnegativecoefficient Constrained Metric Learning (NCML) model, which can be solved by iterated learning of two SVMs. Both PCML and NCML have globally optimal solutions, and our extensive experiments on UCI dataset classification, handwritten digit recognition, face verification and person re-identification clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of them.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews the related works. Section 3 presents the PCML model and the optimization algorithm. Section 4 presents the model and algorithm of NCML. Section 5 presents the experimental results, and Section 6 concludes the paper.\nThe main abbreviations used in this paper are summarized in Table 1."

      "text" : "Compared with nonconvex metric learning models [16], [17], [40], convex formulation of metric learning [2], [3], [20]–[22] has drawn increasing attentions due to its desired properties such as global optimality. Most convex metric learning models can be formulated as SDP or quadratic SDP problems. Standard SDP solvers,\nhowever, are inefficient for metric learning, especially when the size of training samples is big or the feature dimension is high. Therefore, customized optimization algorithm needs to be developed for each specific metric learning model. For LMNN, Weinberger et al. developed an efficient solver based on the sub-gradient descent and the active set techniques [41]. In ITML, Davis et al. [23] suggested an iterative Bregman projection algorithm. Iterative projected gradient descent method [3], [42] has been widely employed for metric learning but it requires an eigenvalue decomposition in each iteration. Other algorithms such as block-coordinate descent [43], smooth optimization [44], and Frank-Wolfe [22] have also been studied for metric learning. Unlike the customized algorithms, in this work we formulate metric learning as a kernel classification problem and solve it using the offthe-shelf SVM solvers, which can guarantee the global optimality and the PSD property of the learned M, and is easy to implement and efficient in training.\nAnother line of work aims to develop metric learning algorithms by solving the Lagrange dual problems. Shen et al. derived the Lagrange dual of the exponential loss based metric learning model, and proposed a boostinglike approach, namely BoostMetric, where the matrix M is learned as a linear positive combination of rank-one matrices [21], [45]. MetricBoost [46] and FrobMetric [47], [48] were further proposed to improve the performance of BoostMetric. Liu and Vemuri incorporated two regularization terms in the duality for robust metric learning [49]. Note that BoostMetric [21], [45], MetricBoost [46], and FrobMetric [47] are proposed for metric learning with triplet constraints, whereas in many applications such as verification, only pairwise constraints are available in the training stage.\nSeveral SVM-based metric learning approaches [50]– [53] have also been proposed. Using SVM, Nguyen and Guo [50] formulated metric learning as a quadratic semidefinite programming problem, and suggested a projected gradient descent algorithm. The formulations of the proposed PCML and NCML in this work are different from the model in [50], and they are solved by the dual problems with the off-the-shelf SVM solvers. Brunner et al. [51] proposed a pairwise SVM method to learn a dissimilarity function rather than a distance metric. Different from [51], the proposed PCML and NCML learn a distance metric and the matrix M is constrained to be a PSD matrix. Do et al. [52] studied SVM from a metric learning perspective and presented an improved variant of SVM classification. Wang et al. [53] developed a kernel classification framework for metric learning and proposed two learning models which can be efficiently implemented by the standard SVM solvers. However, they adopted a two-step greedy strategy to solve the models and neglected the PSD constraint in the first step. In this work, the proposed PCML and NCML models have different formulations from [53], and their solutions are globally optimal.\n3"

Since the previous solution can serve as a good guess, warmstart results in significant improvement in efficiency. Construction of pairwise constraints: Based on the training set, we can introduce N2 pairwise constraints in total. However, in practice we only need to choose a subset of pairwise constraints to reduce the computational cost. For each sample, we find its k nearest neighbors to construct similar pairs and its k farthest neighbors to construct dissimilar pairs. Thus, we only need 2kN pairwise constraints. By this strategy, we can reduce the scale of pairwise constraints from O ( N2 ) to O (kN). Since k is usually small constant (=1∼3) in practice, the computational cost of metric learning is much reduced. Similar strategy for constructing pairwise or triplet constraints can be found in [2], [11]. Computational Complexity: We use the LibSVM library for SVM training. The computational complexity of SMO-type algorithms [34] is O(k2N2d). For PSD projection, the complexity of conventional SVD algorithms is O(d3)."

The cost of constructing the matrix M is less than O ( kNd2 )\n, and this operation is required only once after the convergence of β and µ. Nonlinear extensions: Note that 〈Xij ,Xkl〉 = tr (\nX T ijXkl\n)\ncan be treated as an inner product of two pairs of samples: (xi,xj) and (xk,xl). Analogous to PCML, if we can define a kernel K ((xi,xj), (xk,xl)) on (xi,xj) and (xk,xl), we can substitute 〈Xij ,Xkl〉 with K ((xi,xj), (xk,xl)) to develop new linear or even nonlinear metric learning algorithms, and the Mahalanobis distance between any two samples xm and xn can be formulated as:\n(xm − xn) T M (xm − xn) = ∑\ni,j αijK ((xi,xj) , (xm,xn)) .\n(33)\nAnother nonlinear extension strategy is to define a kernel k (xi,xj) on xi and xj . Since 〈Xij ,Xkl〉 = ( x T i xk − x T i xl − x T j xk + x T j xl )2 , we can substitute 〈Xij ,Xkl〉 with (k (xi,xk)− k (xi,xl)− k (xj ,xk) + k (xj ,xl)) 2 and formulate the Mahalanobis distance between xm and xn as:\n(xm − xn) T M (xm − xn)\n= ∑\ni,j αij\n(\nk (xi,xm)− k (xi,xn)\n− k (xj ,xm) + k (xj ,xn)\n)2\n. (34)\nThat is to say, NCML allows us to learn nonlinear metrics for histograms and structural data by designing proper kernel functions and incorporating appropriate regularizations on α. Metric learning for structural data beyond\n7 ξ (n) ij =  \n\n0 for all β (n) ij < C [\n1− hij\n(\n∑\nk,l α (n) kl 〈Xij ,Xkl〉+ b\n(n) )]\n+ =\n[\nδ (n+1) ij − hij\n(\nγ (n) ij + b\n(n) )]\n+ for all β\n(n) ij = C.\n(30)\nvector data has been recently receiving considerable research interests [5], [56], and NCML can provide a new perspective on this topic. SVM solvers: Although our implementation is based on LibSVM, there are a number of well-studied SVM training algorithms, e.g., core vector machines [35], LaRank [36], BMRM [37], and Pegasos [38], which can be utilized for large scale metric learning. Moreover, we can refer to the progresses in kernel methods [26]–[28] for developing semi-supervised, multiple instance, and multitask metric learning approaches."

Fig. 3 shows the curves of classification error rate versus C for PCML and NCML on the SPECTF Heart dataset. The curves on other datasets are similar. We can observe that when C < 1, the classification error rates of PCML and NCML will be low and stable. When C is higher than 1, the classification error rates jump dramatically. Thus, we set C < 1 in our experiments.\nWe compare the classification error rates of the competing methods in Table 3. On the Cardiotocography and Segmentation datasets, PCML achieves the lowest error rates. On the Segmentation and SPECTF Heart datasets, NCML achieves the lowest error rates. The average ranks of competing methods are listed in the last row of Table 3. On each dataset, we rank the methods based on their error rates, i.e., we assign rank 1 to the method with the lowest error rate and rank 2 to the method with the second lowest error rate, and so on. The average rank is defined as the mean rank of one method over the nine datasets, which can provide a fair comparison of the learning methods [58]. From Table 3, we can see that both PCML and NCML achieve the first and second best average ranks, respectively, demonstrating strong classification capability for general classification tasks.\nWe then compare the training time of competing metric learning methods in Fig. 4. All the experiments\n8\nare run in a PC with 4 Intel Core i5-2410 CPUs (2.30 GHz) and 16GB RAM. Clearly, the proposed PCML and NCML are the fastest in most cases. Although DML-eig is faster than PCML on the Letter dataset, its classification error rate on this dataset is much higher than PCML and NCML. On average, PCML and NCML are 23 and 18 times faster than PLML, the third fastest algorithm, respectively."

Table 4 summarizes the basic information of these four handwritten digit datasets. On the MNIST, PenDigits, and USPS datasets, we use the defined training sets to train the metrics, and use the defined test sets to compute the classification error rates. On the Semeion dataset, we use 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the metric learning methods, and the classification error rate and training time are obtained by averaging over 10 runs of 10-fold cross-validation.\nAs the dimensions of images in the MNIST, Semeion and USPS datasets are relatively high, we use principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce the feature dimension to 100, and train the metrics in the PCA subspace. Table 5 lists the classification error rates of the ten competing methods on the four handwritten digit datasets. The last row of Table 5 lists the average ranks of the competing methods. We do not report the\nerror rate and training time of MCML on the MNIST dataset because MCML requires too large memory space (more than 30 GB) on this dataset and cannot run in our PC. From Table 5, we can see that both PCML and NCML achieve the best average rank. Again, the results indicate that the proposed methods have better classification performance.\nAll the experiments were executed in the same PC as used in Subsection 5.1. Fig. 5 compares the training time of NCA, ITML, MCML, LDML, LMNN, DML-eig, PLML, PCML, and NCML. Clearly, the proposed PCML and NCML methods are much faster than the other methods. On average, PCML and NCML are 61 and 27 times faster than PLML, the third fastest algorithm, respectively. One can conclude that PCML and NCML offer promising solutions to effective and efficient metric learning.\nFinally, we compare the running time of PCML and NCML under different feature dimensions d. As analyzed in Subsections 3.4 and 4.4, the time complexities of PCML and NCML are O(N2d + d3) and O(N2d), respectively. Fig. 6 shows the training time on the Semeion\n9\ndataset with different PCA dimensions. We can see that when the dimension is lower than 110, the training time of NCML is longer than PCML. When the dimension is higher than 110, the training time of PCML increases and becomes longer than NCML."

For each of the 10 runs, the database provides 300 positive pairs and 300 negative pairs for testing, and 5,400 image pairs for training. The verification rate and Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve of each method are obtained by averaging over the 10 runs.\nIn our experiments, we use the SIFT [61] features and the attribute features provided by [8] and [60] to evaluate the metric learning methods. Since the dimension of SIFT features is high (i.e., 128 × 3 × 9), PCA is used to reduce the feature dimension to 150. Under the restricted setting of the LFW database, we only know whether two images are matched or not for the given pairs. In the training stage, we use the training pairs to train a Mahalanobis distance metric. In the test stage, we\ncompare the Mahalanobis distance of the test pair with a threshold t to decide whether the two images are matched or not.\nWe report the ROC curves of PCML, NCML, DML-eig [22], ITML [23], KISSME [9], LDML [8] and Euclidean distance in Fig. 7. We also compare the verification accuracies of PCML and NCML and other metric learning methods by using the SIFT and the attribute features in Table 6.

    "abstractText" : "Distance metric learning aims to learn from the given training data a valid distance metric, with which the similarity between data samples can be more effectively evaluated for classification. Metric learning is often formulated as a convex or nonconvex optimization problem, while many existing metric learning algorithms become inefficient for large scale problems. In this paper, we formulate metric learning as a kernel classification problem, and solve it by iterated training of support vector machines (SVM). The new formulation is easy to implement, efficient in training, and tractable for large-scale problems. Two novel metric learning models, namely Positive-semidefinite Constrained Metric Learning (PCML) and Nonnegative-coefficient Constrained Metric Learning (NCML), are developed. Both PCML and NCML can guarantee the global optimality of their solutions. Experimental results on UCI dataset classification, handwritten digit recognition, face verification and person re-identification demonstrate that the proposed metric learning methods achieve higher classification accuracy than state-of-the-art methods and they are significantly more efficient in training.",
