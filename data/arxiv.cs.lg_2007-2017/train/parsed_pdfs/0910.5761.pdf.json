      "text" : "Given a graph G = (V = [p], E), and a positive parameter θ > 0 the ferromagnetic Ising model on G is the pairwise Markov random field\nµG,θ(x) = 1\nZG,θ\n∏\n(i,j)∈E\neθxixj (1)\nover binary variables x = (x1, x2, . . . , xp). Apart from being one of the most studied models in statistical mechanics, the Ising model is a prototypical undirected graphical model, with applications in computer vision, clustering and spatial statistics. Its obvious generalization to edge-dependent parameters θij , (i, j) ∈ E is of interest as well, and will be introduced in Section 1.2.2. (Let us stress that we follow the statistical mechanics convention of calling (1) an Ising model for any graph G.)\nIn this paper we study the following structural learning problem: Given n i.i.d. samples x(1), x(2),. . . , x(n) with distribution µG,θ( · ), reconstruct the graph G. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the parameter θ is known, and that G has no double edges (it is a ‘simple’ graph).\nThe graph learning problem is solvable with unbounded sample complexity, and computational resources [1]. The question we address is: for which classes of graphs and values of the parameter θ is the problem solvable under appropriate complexity constraints? More precisely, given an algorithm Alg, a graph G, a value θ of the model parameter, and a small δ > 0, the sample complexity is defined as\nnAlg(G, θ) ≡ inf { n ∈ N : Pn,G,θ{Alg(x(1), . . . , x(n)) = G} ≥ 1− δ } , (2)\nwhere Pn,G,θ denotes probability with respect to n i.i.d. samples with distribution µG,θ. Further, we let χAlg(G, θ) denote the number of operations of the algorithm Alg, when run on nAlg(G, θ) samples.1\n1For the algorithms analyzed in this paper, the behavior of nAlg and χAlg does not change significantly if we require only ‘approximate’ reconstruction (e.g. in graph distance).\nThe general problem is therefore to characterize the functions nAlg(G, θ) and χAlg(G, θ), in particular for an optimal choice of the algorithm. General bounds on nAlg(G, θ) have been given in [2, 3], under the assumption of unbounded computational resources. A general charactrization of how well low complexity algorithms can perform is therefore lacking. Although we cannot prove such a general characterization, in this paper we estimate nAlg and χAlg for a number of graph models, as a function of θ, and unveil a fascinating universal pattern: when the model (1) develops long range correlations, low-complexity algorithms fail. Under the Ising model, the variables {xi}i∈V become strongly correlated for θ large. For a large class of graphs with degree bounded by ∆, this phenomenon corresponds to a phase transition beyond some critical value of θ uniformly bounded in p, with typically θcrit ≤ const./∆. In the examples discussed below, the failure of low-complexity algorithms appears to be related to this phase transition (although it does not coincide with it)."

If ∆ > 3 and θ > K/∆, there are graphs of bounded degree ∆ such that for any τ , nThr(τ) = ∞, i.e. the thresholding algorithm always fails with high probability.\nThese results confirm the idea that the failure of low-complexity algorithms is related to long-range correlations in the underlying graphical model. If the graph G is a tree, then correlations between far apart variables xi, xj decay exponentially with the distance between vertices i, j. The same happens on bounded-degree graphs if θ ≤ const./∆. However, for θ > const./∆, there exists families of bounded degree graphs with long-range correlations."

      "text" : "A recurring approach to structural learning consists in exploiting the conditional independence structure encoded by the graph [1, 4, 5, 6].\nLet us consider, to be definite, the approach of [4], specializing it to the model (1). Fix a vertex r, whose neighborhood we want to reconstruct, and consider the conditional distribution of xr given its neighbors2: µG,θ(xr |x∂r). Any change of xi, i ∈ ∂r, produces a change in this distribution which is bounded away from 0. Let U be a candidate neighborhood, and assume U ⊆ ∂r. Then changing the value of xj , j ∈ U will produce a noticeable change in the marginal of Xr, even if we condition on the remaining values in U and in any W , |W | ≤ ∆. On the other hand, if U * ∂r, then it is possible to find W (with |W | ≤ ∆) and a node i ∈ U such that, changing its value after fixing all other values in U ∪W will produce no noticeable change in the conditional marginal. (Just choose i ∈ U\\∂r and W = ∂r\\U ). This procedure allows us to distinguish subsets of ∂r from other sets of vertices, thus motivating the following algorithm.\nLOCAL INDEPENDENCE TEST( samples {x(ℓ)}, thresholds (ǫ, γ) ) 1: Select a node r ∈ V ; 2: Set as its neighborhood the largest candidate neighbor U of\nsize at most ∆ for which the score function SCORE(U) > ǫ/2; 3: Repeat for all nodes r ∈ V ;\nThe score function SCORE( · ) depends on ({x(ℓ)},∆, γ) and is defined as follows,\nmin W,j max xi,xW ,xU ,xj\n|P̂n,G,θ{Xi = xi|XW = xW , XU = xU}−\nP̂n,G,θ{Xi = xi|XW = xW , XU\\j = xU\\j , Xj = xj}| . (5) In the minimum, |W | ≤ ∆ and j ∈ U . In the maximum, the values must be such that\nP̂n,G,θ{XW = xW , XU = xU} > γ/2, P̂n,G,θ{XW = xW , XU\\j = xU\\j , Xj = xj} > γ/2\nP̂n,G,θ is the empirical distribution calculated from the samples {x(ℓ)}. We denote this algorithm by Ind(ǫ, γ). The search over candidate neighbors U , the search for minima and maxima in the computation of the SCORE(U) and the computation of P̂n,G,θ all contribute for χInd(G, θ).\nBoth theorems that follow are consequences of the analysis of [4].\nTheorem 1.3. Let G be a graph of bounded degree ∆ ≥ 1. For every θ there exists (ǫ, γ), and a numerical constant K , such that\nnInd(ǫ,γ)(G, θ) ≤ 100∆\nǫ2γ4 log\n2p\nδ , χInd(ǫ,γ)(G, θ) ≤ K (2p)2∆+1 log p .\nMore specifically, one can take ǫ = 14 sinh(2θ), γ = e −4∆θ 2−2∆.\nThis first result implies in particular that G can be reconstructed with polynomial complexity for any bounded ∆. However, the degree of such polynomial is pretty high and non-uniform in ∆. This makes the above approach impractical.\nA way out was proposed in [4]. The idea is to identify a set of ‘potential neighbors’ of vertex r via thresholding: B(r) = {i ∈ V : Ĉri > κ/2} , (6) For each node r ∈ V , we evaluate SCORE(U) by restricting the minimum in Eq. (5) overW ⊆ B(r), and search only over U ⊆ B(r). We call this algorithm IndD(ǫ, γ, κ). The basic intuition here is that Cri decreases rapidly with the graph distance between vertices r and i. As mentioned above, this is true at small θ.\nTheorem 1.4. Let G be a graph of bounded degree ∆ ≥ 1. Assume that θ < K/∆ for some small enough constant K . Then there exists ǫ, γ, κ such that\nnIndD(ǫ,γ,κ)(G, θ) ≤ 8(κ2 + 8∆) log 4p\nδ , χIndD(ǫ,γ,κ)(G, θ) ≤ K ′p∆∆\nlog(4/κ) α +K ′∆p2 log p .\nMore specifically, we can take κ = tanh θ, ǫ = 14 sinh(2θ) and γ = e −4∆θ 2−2∆.\n2If a is a vector and R is a set of indices then we denote by aR the vector formed by the components of a with index in R."

      "heading" : "1.2.2 Regularized Pseudo-Likelihoods",
      "text" : "A different approach to the learning problem consists in maximizing an appropriate empirical likelihood function [7, 8, 9, 10, 13]. To control the fluctuations caused by the limited number of samples, and select sparse graphs a regularization term is often added [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].\nAs a specific low complexity implementation of this idea, we consider the ℓ1-regularized pseudolikelihood method of [7]. For each node r, the following likelihood function is considered\nL(θ; {x(ℓ)}) = − 1 n\nn∑\nℓ=1\nlogPn,G,θ(x (ℓ) r |x (ℓ) \\r ) (7)\nwhere x\\r = xV \\r = {xi : i ∈ V \\ r} is the vector of all variables except xr and Pn,G,θ is defined from the following extension of (1),\nµG,θ(x) = 1\nZG,θ\n∏\ni,j∈V\neθijxixj (8)\nwhere θ = {θij}i,j∈V is a vector of real parameters. Model (1) corresponds to θij = 0, ∀(i, j) /∈ E and θij = θ, ∀(i, j) ∈ E.\nThe function L(θ; {x(ℓ)}) depends only on θr,· = {θrj , j ∈ ∂r} and is used to estimate the neighborhood of each node by the following algorithm, Rlr(λ),\nREGULARIZED LOGISTIC REGRESSION( samples {x(ℓ)}, regularization (λ)) 1: Select a node r ∈ V ; 2: Calculate θ̂r,· = arg min\nθr,·∈R p−1\n{L(θr,·; {x(ℓ)}) + λ||θr,·||1};\n3: If θ̂rj > 0, set (r, j) ∈ E;\nOur first result shows that Rlr(λ) indeed reconstructs G if θ is sufficiently small.\nTheorem 1.5. There exists numerical constants K1, K2, K3, such that the following is true. Let G be a graph with degree bounded by ∆ ≥ 3. If θ ≤ K1/∆, then there exist λ such that\nnRlr(λ)(G, θ) ≤ K2 θ−2 ∆ log 8p2\nδ . (9)\nFurther, the above holds with λ = K3 θ∆−1/2.\nThis theorem is proved by noting that for θ ≤ K1/∆ correlations decay exponentially, which makes all conditions in Theorem 1 of [7] (denoted there by A1 and A2) hold, and then computing the probability of success as a function of n, while strenghtening the error bounds of [7].\nIn order to prove a converse to the above result, we need to make some assumptions on λ. Given θ > 0, we say that λ is ‘reasonable for that value of θ if the following conditions old: (i) Rlr(λ) is successful with probability larger than 1/2 on any star graph (a graph composed by a vertex r connected to ∆ neighbors, plus isolated vertices); (ii) λ ≤ δ(n) for some sequence δ(n) ↓ 0. Theorem 1.6. There exists a numerical constant K such that the following happens. If ∆ > 3, θ > K/∆, then there exists graphs G of degree bounded by ∆ such that for all reasonable λ, nRlr(λ)(G) = ∞, i.e. regularized logistic regression fails with high probability.\nThe graphs for which regularized logistic regression fails are not contrived examples. Indeed we will prove that the claim in the last theorem holds with high probability when G is a uniformly random graph of regular degree ∆.\nThe proof Theorem 1.6 is based on showing that an appropriate incoherence condition is necessary for Rlr to successfully reconstruct G. The analogous result was proven in [14] for model selection using the Lasso. In this paper we show that such a condition is also necessary when the underlying model is an Ising model. Notice that, given the graph G, checking the incoherence condition is NP-hard for general (non-ferromagnetic) Ising model, and requires significant computational effort\neven in the ferromagnetic case. Hence the incoherence condition does not provide, by itself, a clear picture of which graph structure are difficult to learn. We will instead show how to evaluate it on specific graph families.\nUnder the restriction λ → 0 the solutions given by Rlr converge to θ∗ with n [7]. Thus, for large n we can expand L around θ∗ to second order in (θ − θ∗). When we add the regularization term to L we obtain a quadratic model analogous the Lasso plus the error term due to the quadratic approximation. It is thus not surprising that, when λ → 0 the incoherence condition introduced for the Lasso in [14] is also relevant for the Ising model."

      "text" : "In order to explore the practical relevance of the above results, we carried out extensive numerical simulations using the regularized logistic regression algorithm Rlr(λ). Among other learning algorithms, Rlr(λ) strikes a good balance of complexity and performance. Samples from the Ising model (1) where generated using Gibbs sampling (a.k.a. Glauber dynamics). Mixing time can be very large for θ ≥ θcrit, and was estimated using the time required for the overall bias to change sign (this is a quite conservative estimate at low temperature). Generating the samples {x(ℓ)} was indeed the bulk of our computational effort and took about 50 days CPU time on Pentium Dual Core processors (we show here only part of these data). Notice that Rlr(λ) had been tested in [7] only on tree graphs G, or in the weakly coupled regime θ < θcrit. In these cases sampling from the Ising model is easy, but structural learning is also intrinsically easier.\nFigure reports the success probability of Rlr(λ) when applied to random subgraphs of a 7 × 7 two-dimensional grid. Each such graphs was obtained by removing each edge independently with probability ρ = 0.3. Success probability was estimated by applying Rlr(λ) to each vertex of 8 graphs (thus averaging over 392 runs of Rlr(λ)), using n = 4500 samples. We scaled the regularization parameter as λ = 2λ0θ(log p/n)1/2 (this choice is motivated by the algorithm analysis and is empirically the most satisfactory), and searched over λ0.\nThe data clearly illustrate the phenomenon discussed. Despite the large number of samples n ≫ log p, when θ crosses a threshold, the algorithm starts performing poorly irrespective of λ. Intriguingly, this threshold is not far from the critical point of the Ising model on a randomly diluted grid θcrit(ρ = 0.3) ≈ 0.7 [15, 16].\nFigure 2 presents similar data when G is a uniformly random graph of degree ∆ = 4, over p = 50 vertices. The evolution of the success probability with n clearly shows a dichotomy. When θ is below a threshold, a small number of samples is sufficient to reconstruct G with high probability. Above the threshold even n = 104 samples are to few. In this case we can predict the threshold analytically, cf. Lemma 3.3 below, and get θthr(∆ = 4) ≈ 0.4203, which compares favorably with the data."

(10). To simplify notation we will omit {x(ℓ)} in all the expression derived from L.\nLet ẑ be a subgradient of ||θ|| at θ̂ and assume ∇L(θ̂) + λẑ = 0. An application of the mean value theorem yields ∇2L(θ∗)[θ̂ − θ∗] = Wn − λẑ +Rn , (13) where Wn = −∇L(θ∗) and [Rn]j = [∇2L(θ̄(j))−∇2L(θ∗)]Tj (θ̂− θ∗) with θ̄ (j) a point in the line from θ̂ to θ∗. Notice that by definition ∇2L(θ∗) = Qn∗ = Qn(θ∗). To simplify notation we will omit the ∗ in all Qn∗. All Qn in this proof are thus evaluated at θ∗.\nBreaking this expression into its S and Sc components and since θ̂SC = θ ∗ SC = 0 we can eliminate θ̂S − θ∗S from the two expressions obtained and write [WnSC −RnSC ]−QnSCS(QnSS)−1[WnS −RnS ] + λQnSCS(QnSS)−1ẑS = λẑSC .

Since EG,θ(Qn) = Q∗ and EG,θ(Wn) = 0 and noticing that both Qn and Wn are sums of bounded i.i.d. random variables, a simple application of Azuma-Hoeffding inequality upper bounds the probability of E as in (10). From E it follows that σmin(QnSS) > σmin(Q∗SS) − Cmin/2 > Cmin/2.

The upper bound of Rn follows along similar lines via an mean value theorem, and is deferred to a longer version of this paper.\nProof. (Lemma 3.3.) Let us state explicitly the local weak convergence result mentioned in Sec. 3.1. For t ∈ N, let T(t) = (VT, ET) be the regular rooted tree of t generations and define the associated Ising measure as\nµ+T,θ(x) = 1\nZT,θ\n∏\n(i,j)∈ET\neθxixj ∏\ni∈∂T(t)\neh ∗xi . (16)\nHere ∂T(t) is the set of leaves of T(t) and h∗ is the unique positive solution of h = (∆ − 1) atanh {tanh θ tanhh}. It can be proved using [17] and uniform continuity with respect to the ‘external field’ that non-trivial local expectations with respect to µG,θ(x) converge to local expectations with respect to µ+T,θ(x), as p → ∞.\nMore precisely, let Br(t) denote a ball of radius t around node r ∈ G (the node whose neighborhood we are trying to reconstruct). For any fixed t, the probability that Br(t) is not isomorphic to T(t) goes to 0 as p → ∞. Let g(xBr(t)) be any function of the variables in Br(t) such that g(xBr(t)) = g(−xBr(t)). Then almost surely over graph sequences Gp of uniformly random regular graphs with p nodes (expectations here are taken with respect to the measures (1) and (16))\nlim p→∞\nEG,θ{g(XBr(t))} = ET(t),θ,+{g(XT(t))} . (17)\nThe proof consists in considering [Q∗ScSQ ∗ SS −1ẑ∗S ]i for t = dist(r, i) finite. We then write (Q∗SS)lk = E{gl,k(XBr(t))} and (Q ∗ ScS)il = E{gi,l(XBr(t))} for some functions g·,·(XBr(t)) and apply the weak convergence result (17) to these expectations. We thus reduced the calculation of [Q∗ScSQ ∗ SS\n−1ẑ∗S]i to the calculation of expectations with respect to the tree measure (16). The latter can be implemented explicitly through a recursive procedure, with simplifications arising thanks to the tree symmetry and by taking t ≫ 1. The actual calculations consist in a (very) long exercise in calculus and we omit them from this outline.\nThe lower bound on σmin(Q∗SS) is proved by a similar calculation."
