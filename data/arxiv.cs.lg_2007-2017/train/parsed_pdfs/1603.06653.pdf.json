      "text" : "Deep, regularized neural networks work better in practice than shallow unconstrained neural networks [1]. This regularization takes classic forms such as L2-norm ridge regression, L1-norm LASSO, architectural constraints such as convolutional layers [2], but also uses modern techniques such as dropout [3]. Recently, especially in the subfield of autoencoding neural networks, regularization has been accomplished with variational methods [4][5]. In this paper we propose Information Theoretic-Learning [6] divergence measures for variational regularization.\nIn deep learning, variational regularization forces the function implemented by a neural network to be as close as possible to an imposed prior, which is a stronger restriction than that imposed by point-wise regularization methods such as L1 or L2 norms. Variational methods for deep learning were popularized by the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework proposed by [4] and [5] which also brought the attention of deep learning researchers to the reparametrization trick. The Gaussian reparametrization trick works as follows: the encoder (deep) network outputs a mean µ and a standard deviation σ, from which we sample a latent factor z = µ+σ ·ǫ, where ǫ ∼ N(0, 1). This latent factor is then fed forward to the decoder network and the parameters µ and σ are regularized using the KL-divergence KL(N(µ, σ)‖N(0, 1)) between the inferred distribution and the imposed prior, which has a simple form [4]. After training, one can generate data from a VAE by first sampling from the Gaussian prior distribution and feeding it to the VAE’s decoder. This is an approach similar to the inverse cumulative distribution method and does not involve estimation of the partition function, rejection sampling, or other complicated approaches [7]. VAE’s methodology has been successfully extended to convolutional autoencoders [8] and more elaborate architectures such as Laplacian pyramids for image generation [9].\nUnfortunately, VAE cannot be used when there does not exist a simple closed form solution for the KL-divergence. To cope with that, generative adversarial networks (GAN) were proposed [10]. GAN uses two neural networks that are trained competitively—a generator network G for sampling data and a discriminator network D for discerning the outputs of G from real data. Unfortunately, training G to match a high dimensional dataset distribution using only D’s binary “fake” or “legit” outputs is not a stable or simple process.\n∗The companion source code of this paper can be found online: https://github.com/cnel/itl-ae\nMakhzani et. al. proposed adversarial autoencoders [11] which use an adversarial discriminator D to tell the low dimensional codes in the output of the encoder from data sampled from a desired distribution. In this way adversarial autoencoders can approximate variational regularization as long as it is possible to sample from the desired distribution. We note that although this partially solves the problem of generalized functional regularization for neural networks 1, adversarial autoencoders require us to train a third network, the discriminator, in addition to the encoder and decoder already being trained.\nHere we observe that, assuming we can sample from the desired distribution, we can use empirical distribution divergence measures proposed by Information Theoretic-Learning (ITL) as a measure of how close the function implemented by an encoder network is to a desired prior distribution. Thus, we propose Information Theoretic-Learning Autoencoders (ITL-AE).\nIn the next section of this paper we review ITL’s Euclidean and Cauchy-Schwarz divergence measures [12]. In Section 3 we propose the ITL-AE and run experiments to illustrate the proposed method in Section 4. We conclude the paper afterwards."

For the case of α = 2, equation (2) simplifies to H2 = − log ∫ p2(x)dx which is known as Renyi’s quadratic entropy.\nPlugging (1) into (2), for α = 2, we obtain:\nĤ2(X) = − log\n∫\n(\n1\nN\nN ∑\ni=1\nGσ(x− xi)\n)2\ndx (3)\n= − log\n\n\n1\nN2\nN ∑\ni=1\nN ∑\nj=1\nGσ √ 2 (xj − xi)\n\n (4)\nwhere Gσ(x, y) = 1√ 2πσ\nexp ( ‖x−y‖2 2σ2 ) is the Gaussian kernel, and σ is the kernel size. The argu-\nment of the logarithm in equation (4) is called the information potential by analogy with potential fields from physics and is denoted by V̂σ(X).\nAnother important ITL descriptor is Renyi’s cross-entropy which is given by:\nH2(X,Y ) = − log\n∫\npX(z)pY (z)dz (5)\nSimilarly to equation (2), cross-entropy can be estimated by\nĤ2(X,Y ) = − log 1\nNXNY\nNX ∑\ni=1\nNY ∑\nj=1\nG√ 2σ(xi − yj) (6)\nThe argument of the logarithm in equation (5) is called cross-information potential and is denoted V̂σ(X,Y ). Cross-information potential can be viewed as the average sum of interactions of samples drawn from pX with the estimated pdf p̂Y (or vice-versa).\nITL has also described a number of divergences connected with Renyi’s entropy. In particular, the Euclidean and Cauchy-Schwarz divergences are given by:\nDED(pX‖pY ) =\n∫\n(pX(z)− pY (z)) 2 dz (7)\n=\n∫\np2X(z)dz +\n∫\np2Y (z)dz − 2\n∫\npX(z)pY (z)dz (8)\nand\nDCS(pX‖pY ) = − log\n(∫ pX(z)pY (z)dz )2\n∫ p2X(z)dz ∫ p2Y (z)dz , (9)\nrespectively. Equations (7) and (9) can be put in terms of information potentials:\nDED(pX ||pY ) = V (X) + V (Y )− 2V (X,Y ) (10)\nDCS(pX ||pY ) = log V (X)V (Y )\nV 2(X,Y ) (11)\nEuclidean divergence is so named because it is equivalent to the Euclidean distance between pdfs. Furthermore, it is equivalent to maximum mean discrepancy [15] (MMD) statistical test. CauchySchwarz divergence is named for the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which guarantees the divergence\nis only equal to zero when the pdfs are equal almost everywhere. DCS is symmetric but, unlike DED, does not obey the triangle equality.\nMinimizing either divergence over pX , i.e., minpX D(pX‖pY ), is a tradeoff between minimizing the information potential (maximizing entropy) of pX and maximizing the cross-information potential (minimizing cross-entropy) of pX with respect to pY . Intuitively, minimizing the information potential encourages samples from pX to spread out, while maximizing the cross-information potential encourages samples from pX to move toward samples from pY ."

      "text" : "Let us define autoencoders as a 4-tuple AE = {E,D,L,R}. Where E and D are the encoder and the decoder functions, here parameterized as neural networks. L is the reconstruction cost function that measures the difference between original data samples x and their respective reconstructions x̃ = D(E(x)). A typical reconstruction cost is mean-squared error. R is a functional regularization. Here this functional regularization will only be applied to the encoder E. Nonetheless, although we are only regularizing the encoder E, the interested investigator could also regularize another intermediate layer of the autoencoder 2.\nThe general cost function for the ITL-AE can be summarized by the following equation:\ncost = L (x, x̃) + λR(E,P ), (12)\nwhere the strength of regularization is controlled by the scale parameter λ, and P is the imposed prior.\nThe functional regularization costs investigated in this paper are the ITL Euclidean and CauchySchwarz divergences. Both types of divergence encourage a smooth manifold similar to the imposed prior. That is, maximizing latent code distribution entropy encourages code samples to spread out, while minimizing the cross-entropy between the latent code and the prior distributions encourages code samples to be similar to prior samples.\nNote that if the data dimensionality is too high, ITL divergence measures require larger batch sizes to be reliably estimated, this explains why Li et. al. [16] used batches of 1000 samples in their experiments and also why they reduced the data dimensionality with autoencoders. In our own experiments (not shown), the Cauchy-Schwarz divergence worked better than Euclidean for highdimensional data."

In our method adding more regularization does not increase the number of adaptive weights.\nfunction L is given by the Euclidean divergence measure. GMMNs could be applied to generate samples from the original input space itself or from a lower dimensional previously trained stacked autoencoder (SCA) [17] hidden space. An advantage of our approach compared to GMMNs is that we can train all the elements in the 4-tuple AE together without the elaborate process of training layerwise stacked autoencoders for dimensionality reduction.\nVariational Autoencoders (VAE) [4] adapt a lower bound of the variational regularization, R, using parametric, closed form solutions for the KL-divergence. That divergence can be defined using Shannon’s entropy or Hα=1. Thus, we can also interpret ITL-AE as nonparametric variational autoencoders, where the likelihood of the latent distribution is estimated empirically using Parzen windows. Note that since we can estimate that distribution directly, we do not use the reparametrization trick. Here the reparametrization trick could possibly be used for imposing extra regularization, just like how adding dropout noise regularizes neural networks.\nAdversarial autoencoders (AA) [11] have the architecture that inspired our method the most. Instead of using the adversarial trick to impose regularization on the encoder, we defined that regularization from first principles, which allowed us to train a competing method with much fewer trainable parameters. Our most recent experiments show that AA scales better than ITL-AE for high dimensional latent codes. We leave investigation into high dimensional ITL-AE for future work."

      "heading" : "5 Experiments",
      "text" : "In this section we show experiments using the ITL-AE architecture described in the previous section. First, for a visual interpretation of the effects of variational regularization we trained autoencoders with 2-dimensional latent codes. We used as desired priors a Gaussian, a Laplacian, and a 2D swissroll distribution. The resulting codes are shown in Fig. 3. Note that in all of these examples the autoencoder was trained in a completely unsupervised manner. However, given the simplicity of the data and the imposed reconstruction cost, some of the numbers were clustered in separate regions of the latent space. Fig. 4 shows some images obtained by sampling from a linear path on the swiss-roll and random samples from the Gaussian manifold.\nFor easier comparisons and to avoid extensive hyperparameter search, we constrained our encoder and decoders, E and D, to have the same architecture as those used in [11] i.e., each network is a two hidden layer fully connected network with 1000 hidden neurons. Thus, the only hyperparameters investigated in this paper were kernel size σ and scale parameter λ. For the MNIST dataset, the Euclidean distance worked better with smaller kernels, such as σ = 1 or σ = 5, while the Cauchy-Schwarz divergence required larger kernel, σ = 10 for example. Nevertheless, here we will focus in regularizing the low dimensional latent codes and leave experiments using Cauchy-Schwarz divergence for future work.\nOur best results for small batch sizes common in deep learning had 3-dimensional latent codes in the output of the encoder, euclidean divergence as the regularization R and mean-squared error as the reconstruction cost L. As we will show in the next section, we were able to obtain competitive results and reproduce behaviors obtained by methods trained with larger networks or extra adversarial networks."

Those generated MNIST images were used estimate a distribution using Parzen windows on the high dimensional image space3. We calculated the log-likelihood of separate 10k samples from the test set and report the results on Table 1. The kernel size of that Parzen estimator was chose using the best results on a held-out cross-validation dataset. That kernel size was σ = 0.16. Note that our method obtained the second best results between all the compared fully connected generative models. Remember that this was obtained with about 106 less adaptive parameters than the best method Adversarial autoencoders."

We also revisited ITL for neural networks, but this time, instead of focusing on nonparametric cost functions for non-Gaussian signal processing, we focused on distribution divergences for regularizing deep architectures.\nOur results using relatively small, for deep learning standards, 4 layer networks with 3-dimensional latent codes obtained competitive results on the log-likelihood analysis of the MNIST dataset.\nAlthough our results were competitive for fully connected architectures, future work should address the scalability of the ITL estimators for large dimensional latent spaces, which is common on large neural networks and convolutional architectures as well."
