      "text" : "Spatial partition trees are data structures that hierarchically subdivide a set of data points with the goal that resulting partitions contain “similar” points. A ubiquitous example is the k-d tree, which is widely used in many unsupervised learning methods including classification, regression, nearest-neighbor finding, and vector quantization.\nAt level L of the tree, the data has been partitioned into 2L different classes. Every time we subdivide a set of points, we do so with the hope of reducing the\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012.

This substantially improves upon the error for RP trees without significant computational overhead.\nthe average distance between points in the same subsets as much as possible. The goal is similar to that in k-means clustering, but unfortunately, k-means clustering is an NP-hard problem even when k = 2 (Dasgupta, 2008).\nWe know that k-d trees are vulnerable to the so-called curse of dimensionality – if the dimensionality of our data is D, then we may have to traverse O(D) levels to halve the average diameter. This is shown to be true even when the intrinsic dimensionality of the data is low (Verma et al., 2009). Thus, k-d tree are not well suited to applications that involve high-dimensional data, because to produce a good classifier, we would need to branch our tree O(2D) times. Similarly, it has been shown that using a k-d tree to do nearestneighbor queries in high-dimensional data is not much more efficient than scanning every element (Lee & Wong, 1977).\nRecently, random-projection (RP) trees (Dasgupta & Freund, 2008) and PCA trees (Verma et al., 2009) have been proposed as alternatives to k-d trees that adapt to intrinsic dimensionality. RP trees and PCA trees\ndiffer from k-d trees in that their splitting planes are not restricted to being axis-aligned. Thus, unlike k-d trees, they can adapt to the covariance of the data (see Figure 2).\nOf the two choices, RP trees are appealing because they can be computed very efficiently. Each subdivision in an RP tree is determined by a randomly-chosen hyperplane. PCA trees are significantly more expensive to compute, because the normal of each hyperplane is chosen by doing principal component analysis (PCA) on the data to find the principal direction. This requires one to compute the covariance matrix and perform eigendecomposition, or to do singular value decomposition (SVD). However, PCA trees perform significantly better than RP trees at reducing the average diameter, as demonstrated in (Verma et al., 2009).\nAPD Trees. We propose a new spatial partition tree, the approximate principal direction tree or APD trees, which generalize the idea behind RP trees, but perform almost as well as PCA trees when it comes to reducing average diameter with respect to intrinsic dimensionality.\nWhen choosing the normal of the hyperplane, APD trees start with random vectors like RP trees, but then apply a small number of power-method iterations (Burden & Faires, 2010) to these vectors. The power method is often used in data intensive applications to approximate principal eigenvectors (e.g., Google’s PageRank (Wills, 2007)) and for spectral clustering (Lin & Cohen, 2010). However, it is important to note that in our application we are not simply concerned with getting a good approximation of the principal eigenvector. Rather, we are finding a hyperplane that will yield a good subdivision. This is important because the power method can be slow to converge when the first principal component has the same variance as the second principal component. However, this is not a concern for us since either component (or some linear combination thereof) would suffice for a good split.\nWe show strong performance guarantees with only one or two power-method iterations. See Figure 1 for an empirical illustration. Furthermore, when the intrinsic dimension of a dataset is d, we prove that O(log d) power-iterations are sufficient to produce trees that reduce average diameter at the same rate as PCA trees. Again, this is true even when the principal direction is not dominant in the data.\nOutline. In Section 2, we present the necessary definitions including that of local covariance dimension (Dasgupta & Freund, 2008) and what it means for a tree to adapt to intrinsic dimensionality. In Section 3, we presents the algorithm for building APD trees. Then, in Section 4, we prove that it adapts to intrinsic dimensionality with the average diameter converging at a similar rate to PCA trees. This is further demonstrated by our experimental results (Section 5), which also show that APD tree is much faster than the standard PCA tree algorithm. Finally, we also present a GPU-based implementation, which is even faster."

We will analysis APD trees using the same definition.\nRecall that the covariance matrix C ∈ RD×D of a set of points S = {x1, . . . , xn} ⊂ RD with mean(S) = 0, can be written as C = XTX where X ∈ Rn×D is the matrix whose i-th row equals xi. The idea behind local covariance dimension is as follows. The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix form an orthonormal basis for the data. If a small number of the eigenvectors describe almost all the variance in the data, then we know that the data is well represented by the subspace spanned by those eigenvectors. We can think of the dimension of this subspace as being the intrinsic dimension of the data.\nDefinition 2.3 (Local Covariance Dimension).

Before we discuss the partitioning rule used in APD trees, we review a general template for possible rules. This template is presented in Algorithm 1. If we assume S corresponds to the set of points assigned to a particular node in the tree, then it is obvious that this meta-algorithm can be applied recursively to produce a balanced binary tree.\nThe tree produced by this meta-algorithm is a hybrid of a BSP tree and a sphere tree (Devroye et al., 1996). If S is considered to contain “outliers”, we use a sphere to partition points that are close to the center of the data away from those that are not. We discuss this case further in Section 3.2.

However, this splitting rule does not achieve as good accuracy as the PCA splitting rule."

The result follows from the observation that∑n h=1(xh · p)xTh = (XTX)p = Cp.\nBelow are two properties of the APD splitting rule:\nGeneralization of RP and PCA: As t increases, p will converge to the principal eigenvector of the covariance matrix, i.e., the vector we would get if we were to use the PD splitting rule. On the other hand, when t = 0, p is a random unit vector in RD, and thus equivalent to if we were using the RP splitting rule. So intuitively, using the APD splitting rule gives us a trade-off between the RP splitting rule and the PCA splitting rule.\nDoesn’t require convergence of power method: It is important to emphasize that the idea behind applying the power method in our setting is not to approximate the principal eigenvector per se. We need the splitting rule to be computed quickly and will primarily be interested in the case when t = 1 or 2. In this case, it is unlikely that the vector returned is similar to the principal eigenvector. For example, the power method converges slowly when the first few principal values are very close to each other. However, this is not an issue in our setting since a few iterations will still ensure that the direction of p has high variance."

In vector quantization, the goal is to map all vectors (or points) in a given data set to a small number of representative vectors (or points). This can be done with a spatial partitioning tree – the points belonging to each partition are represented by the average of the points in that partition. Following this, the VQ-error is defined as the average squared representation error.

We ran our experiments on a synthetic dataset and the MNIST test dataset. Additionally we use a protein homology dataset from the KDD Cup 2004 data mining competition.\nAs in (Freund et al., 2008), the synthetic dataset consists of 10,000 points, each a 1,000-d vector and gener-\nated as follows: choose a peak value p uniformly randomly from [0, 1], and then generates the coordinates of the point from the normal distribution N(p, 1). The MNIST test dataset is a set of 10,000 images of handwritten digits, each of which has been normalized to 28 × 28 pixels, and is thus a 784-d vector. The protein homology dataset consists of pairs of proteins that have been tested for homology. It contains 285,409 data points, each of which is a 74-d vector.\nFor RP trees and APD trees, we perform 15 runs of each experiment, and calculated the average VQ-error. For PCA trees, we only needed to run each experiment once since there is no randomization in that algorithm. The results are shown in Figure 3. Each curve plots the decay of average VQ-errors as the depth of the tree increases. For APD trees, we show results of applying 1, 2, and 3 power iterations. RP tree is equivalent to applying no power iteration. The quality differences between APD trees and PCA trees are small, while the differences of RP trees with them are much more visible. Note that using 1 power iteration in APD trees already provides very good quality and gives the the biggest drop in VQ-error from RP trees.\nGPU Implementation of APD Trees. Our APD tree algorithm is well-suited for parallel computation\non modern GPUs. Since it only relies on basic matrix operations, most GPU-based linear algebra packages can be applied directly. Our implementation is written in MATLAB using the Jacket GPU library (AccelerEyes). The main tree building uses a standard recursive subdivision algorithm controlled by the host CPU, while the tree splitting algorithm (Algorithm 1) is accelerated on the GPU. Experimental results are presented in Figure 1 and 4. These results were obtained on a PC with NVIDIA 470 GTX graphics card (1.2GB GPU memory) and an Intel Core-i7 3.0GHz CPU with 8 hyperthreads.\nFigure 1 lists the computation time using the GPU and CPU implementations. The timing is averaged over 15 runs per test. The GPU implementation generally achieves 5 ∼ 12× speedup compared to the CPU version, which is also written in MATLAB and multithreaded. This performance gain is mainly due to the acceleration of matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplications, which can easily exploit the GPU’s parallel computation power. Note that the speedup for the KDDCup04 dataset is moderate, mainly because of the small vector size. We generally obtain higher performance gain on higher dimensional datasets, because they can better utilize available GPU resources.\nFor comparison we have also included a CPU PCA tree implementation using MATLAB’s svds routine. As seen from the table, the CPU PCA trees are 4 ∼ 6 times slower than the CPU APD trees, which are in turn 5 ∼ 12 times slower than the GPU APD trees. We did not include a GPU PCA tree because the Jacket library only provides a full svd routine but not svds. As a result, the GPU PCA tree is only moderately faster than the CPU counterpart. This shows that our APD tree algorithm is well-suited for exploiting the GPU, due to its simplicity, at the same time providing comparable quality to PCA trees.\nFigure 4 plots the computation times for synthetic data sets containing different numbers of points. Each point is a 512-d vector generated using the same algorithm before. We plot the CPU and GPU timing for each data set and with 0 to 4 power iterations. From this plot we observe that the cost incurred by each additional APD iteration is generally quite small."

APD-trees use a small number of power iterations to achieve computational efficiency (comparable to RP trees) and high quality (comparable to PCA trees). The approach is insensi-\ntive to the convergence properties of the power method and is well-suited for GPU computation."

Our algorithm ensures vector-quantization accuracy similar to that of computationally-expensive PCA trees with similar time-complexity to that of loweraccuracy RP trees. APD trees use a small number of powermethod iterations to find splitting planes for recursively partitioning the data. As such they provide a natural trade-off between the running-time and accuracy achieved by RP and PCA trees. Our theoretical results establish a) strong performance guarantees regardless of the convergence rate of the powermethod and b) that O(log d) iterations suffice to establish the guarantee of PCA trees when the intrinsic dimension is d. We demonstrate this trade-off and the efficacy of our data structure on both the CPU and GPU.",
