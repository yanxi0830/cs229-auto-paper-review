The smallest inner dimension of any such factorization is called the nonnegative rank of M , written rank+(M).\nIn machine learning, NMF was popularized by the seminal work of Lee and Seung [14] as a tool for finding features in facial-image databases. Since then, NMF has found a broad range of applications—including document clustering, topic modelling, computer vision, recommender systems, bioinformatics, and acoustic signal processing [5, 4, 7, 19, 21, 22]. In applications, matrix M can typically be seen as a matrix of data points: each column of M corresponds to a data point and each row to a feature. Then, computing a nonnegative factorization M = W ·H corresponds to expressing the data points (columns of M) as convex combinations of latent factors (columns of W ), i.e., as linear combinations of latent factors with nonnegative coefficients (columns of H).\n∗ Present address: Department of Computer Science, University of Oxford, UK.\n43rd International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming (ICALP 2016).

Formally, the NMF problem asks whether rank+(M) ≤ k. In practical applications, various heuristics and local-search algorithms are used to compute an approximate nonnegative factorization, but little is known in terms of their theoretical guarantees. The NMF problem under the separability assumption of Donoho and Stodden [9] is tractable: an NMF M = W ·H is called separable if every column of W is also a column of M . In 2012, Arora et al. [2] showed that it is decidable in polynomial time whether a given matrix admits a separable NMF with a given inner dimension. Further progress was made recently, with several efficient algorithms for computing near-separable NMFs [13, 12].\nVavasis [20] showed that the problem of deciding whether the rank of a nonnegative matrix is equal to its nonnegative rank is NP-hard. This result implies that generalizations of this problem, such as the aforementioned NMF problem, the problem of computing the factors W,H (in both exact and approximate versions), and nonnegative rank determination, are also NP-hard. It is not known whether any of these problems are in NP.\nVavasis [20] notes that the difficulty in proving membership in NP lies in the fact that a certificate for a positive answer to the NMF problem seems to require the sought factors: a pair of nonnegative matrices W,H such that M = W ·H. Related to this, Cohen and Rothblum [8] posed the question of whether, given a nonnegative matrix of rational numbers M , there always exists an NMF M = W ·H of inner dimension equal to rank+(M) such that both W and H are also matrices of rational numbers. A natural route to proving membership of the NMF problem in NP would be to give a positive answer to the question of Cohen and Rothblum (as well as a polynomial bound on the bit-length of the factors W and H). However, the question remains open. Currently the best complexity bound for the NMF problem is membership in PSPACE, which is obtained by translation into the existential theory of real-closed fields [2]. Such a translation shows that one can always choose the entries of W and H to be algebraic numbers.\nIn this work, we focus on the so-called restricted NMF (RNMF) problem, introduced by Gillis and Glineur [11]. The RNMF problem is defined as the NMF problem, except that the column spaces of M and W are required to coincide. (Note that for any NMF, the column space of M is a subspace of the column space of W .) This problem has a natural geometric interpretation as the nested polytope problem (NPP): the problem of finding a minimum-vertex polytope nested between two given convex polytopes. In more detail, for a rank-r matrix M , finding an RNMF with inner dimension d is known to correspond exactly to finding a nested polytope with d vertices in an (r − 1)-dimensional NPP.\nOur contributions are as follows. 1. We establish a tight connection between NMF and the coverability relation in labelled\nMarkov chains (LMCs). The latter notion was introduced by Paz [15]. Loosely speaking, an LMCM′ covers an LMCM if for any initial distribution over the states ofM there is an initial distribution over the states ofM′ such thatM andM′ are equivalent. In 1971, Paz [15] asked a question about the nature of minimal covering LMCs. The question was supposedly answered positively in 1974 [3]. However, we show that the correct answer is negative, thus falsifying the claim in [3]. Instrumental to our counterexample is the observation that restricted nonnegative rank and nonnegative rank can be different. (Indeed, the wrong claims in [3] seem to implicitly rely on the opposite assumption, although the notions of NMF and RNMF had not yet been developed.)\n2. We show that the RNMF problem for matrices M of rank 3 or less can be solved in polynomial time. In fact, we show that there is always a rational NMF of M with inner"

This improves a result in [11] where the RNMF problem is shown to be solvable in polynomial time assuming a RAM model with unit-cost arithmetic. Both our algorithm and the one in [11] exploit the connection to the 2-dimensional NPP, allowing us to take advantage of a geometric algorithm by Aggarwal et al. [1]. We need to adapt the algorithm in [1] to ensure that the occurring numbers are rational and can be computed in polynomial time in the Turing model of computation.\n3. We exhibit a rank-4 matrix that has an RNMF with inner dimension 5 but no rational RNMF with inner dimension 5. We construct this matrix via a particular instance of the 3-dimensional NPP, again taking advantage of the geometric interpretation of RNMF. Our result answers the RNMF variant of Cohen and Rothblum’s question in [8] negatively. The original (NMF) variant remains open.\nDetailed proofs of all results can be found in the appendix.\n2 Nonnegative Matrix Factorization\nLet N and N0 denote the set of all positive and nonnegative integers, respectively. For every n ∈ N, we write [n] for the set {1, 2, . . . , n} and write In for the identity matrix of order n. For any ordered field F, we denote by F+ the set of all its nonnegative elements. For any vector v, we write vi for its ith entry. A vector v is called stochastic if its entries are nonnegative real numbers that sum up to one. For every i ∈ [n], we write ei for the ith coordinate vector in Rn. We write 1(n) for the n-dimensional column vector with all ones. We omit the superscript if it is understood from the context.\nFor any matrix M , we write Mi for its ith row, M j for its jth column, and Mi,j for its (i, j)th entry. The column space (resp., row space) of M , written Col(M) (resp., Row(M)), is the vector space spanned by the columns (resp., rows) of M . A matrix is called nonnegative (resp., zero or rational) if so are all its entries. A nonnegative matrix is column-stochastic (resp., row-stochastic) if the element sum of each of its columns (resp., rows) is one."

      "text" : "Let F be an ordered field, such as the reals R or the rationals Q. Given a nonnegative matrix M ∈ Fn×m+ , a nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) over F of M is any representation of the form M = W ·H where W ∈ Fn×d+ and H ∈ Fd×m+ are nonnegative matrices. Note that Col(M) ⊆ Col(W ). We refer to d as the inner dimension of the NMF, and hence refer to NMF M = W ·H as being d-dimensional. The nonnegative rank over F of M is the smallest number d ∈ N0 such that there exists a d-dimensional NMF over F of M . An equivalent characterization [8] of the nonnegative rank over F of M is as the smallest number of rank-1 matrices in Fn×m+ such that M is equal to their sum. The nonnegative rank over R will henceforth simply be called nonnegative rank, and will be denoted by rank+(M). For any nonnegative matrix M ∈ Rn×m+ , it is easy to see that rank(M) ≤ rank+(M) ≤ min{n,m}.\nGiven a nonzero matrixM ∈ Fn×m+ , by removing the zero columns ofM and dividing each remaining column by the sum of its elements, we obtain a column-stochastic matrix M ′ with equal nonnegative rank. Similarly, if M = W ·H then after removing zero columns in W and multiplying with a suitable diagonal matrixD, we getM = W ·H = WD·D−1H whereWD is column-stochastic. IfM is column-stochastic then 1> = 1>M = 1>WD ·D−1H = 1>D−1H, hence D−1H is column-stochastic as well. Thus, without loss of generality one can consider NMFs of column-stochastic matrices into column-stochastic matrices [8, Theorem 3.2].\nICALP 2016\nXXX:4 On Restricted Nonnegative Matrix Factorization\nNMF problem: Given a matrix M ∈ Qn×m+ and k ∈ N, is rank+(M) ≤ k?\nThe NMF problem is NP-hard, even for k = rank(M) (see [20]). On the other hand, it is reducible to the existential theory of the reals, hence by [6, 16] it is in PSPACE.\nFor a matrixM ∈ Qn×m+ , its nonnegative rank over Q is clearly at least rank+(M). While those ranks are equal if rank(M) ≤ 2, a longstanding open question by Cohen and Rothblum asks whether they are always equal [8]. In other words, it is conceivable that there exists a rational matrix M ∈ Qn×m+ with rank+(M) = d that has no rational NMF with inner dimension d. Recently, Shitov [17] exhibited a nonnegative matrix (with irrational entries) whose nonnegative rank over a subfield of R is different from its nonnegative rank over R."

      "text" : "For all matrices M ∈ Fn×m+ , an NMF M = W ·H is called restricted NMF (RNMF) [11] if rank(M) = rank(W ). As we know Col(M) ⊆ Col(W ) holds for all NMF instances, the condition rank(M) = rank(W ) is then equivalent to Col(M) = Col(W ). The restricted nonnegative rank over F of M is the smallest number d ∈ N0 such that there exists a d-dimensional restricted nonnegative factorization over F of M . Unless indicated otherwise, henceforth we will assume F = R when speaking of the restricted nonnegative rank of M , and denote it by rrank+(M).\nRNMF problem: Given a matrix M ∈ Qn×m+ and k ∈ N, is rrank+(M) ≤ k?\nWe have the following basic properties.\nI Lemma 1 ([11]). Let M ∈ Rn×m+ . Then rank(M) ≤ rank+(M) ≤ rrank+(M) ≤ m. Moreover, if rank(M) = rank+(M) then rank(M) = rrank+(M).\nThus, with the above-mentioned NP-hardness result, it follows that the RNMF problem is also NP-hard and in PSPACE.\nFor a matrix M ∈ Qn×m+ , its restricted nonnegative rank over Q is clearly at least rrank+(M). As with nonnegative rank, in general it is not known whether the restricted nonnegative ranks of M over R and over Q are equal. By [8, Theorem 4.1] and Lemma 1, this is true when rank(M) ≤ 2.\nRNMF has the following geometric interpretation. For a dimension ` ∈ N, the convex combination of a set {v1, . . . , vm} ⊂ R` is a point λ1v1 + · · ·+ λmvm where (λ1, . . . , λm) is a stochastic vector. The convex hull of {v1, . . . , vm}, written as conv{v1, . . . , vm}, is the set of all convex combinations of {v1, . . . , vm}. We call conv{v1, . . . , vm} a polytope spanned by v1, . . . , vm. A polyhedron is a set {x ∈ R` | Ax+ b ≥ 0 } with A ∈ Rn×` and b ∈ Rn. A set is a polytope if and only if it is a bounded polyhedron. A polytope is full-dimensional (i.e., has volume) if the matrix (A b) ∈ Rn×(`+1) has rank `+ 1.\nNested polytope problem (NPP): Given r, n ∈ N, let A ∈ Qn×(r−1) and b ∈ Qn be such that P = {x ∈ Rr−1 | Ax + b ≥ 0 } is a full-dimensional polytope. Let S ⊆ P be a full-dimensional polytope described by spanning points. The nested polytope problem (NPP) asks, given A, b, S and a number k ∈ N, whether there exist k points that span a polytope Q with S ⊆ Q ⊆ P . Such a polytope Q is called nested between P and S.\nThe following proposition appears as Theorem 1 in [11].\nI Proposition 2. The RNMF problem and the NPP are interreducible in polynomial time."

Using the geometric interpretation of restricted nonnegative rank it follows easily that, in general, we may have rank(M) < rank+(M) < rrank+(M). Let 3D-cube NPP be the NPP instance where the inner and outer polytope are the standard 3D cube, i.e., P = S = {x ∈ R3 | xi ∈ [0, 1], 1 ≤ i ≤ 3 }. The only nested polytope is Q = P .

We have rrank+(M) = 8 and rank(M) = 4. Since rank+(M) is bounded above by the number of rows in M , we have rank+(M) ≤ 6. It is shown in [11] that rank+(M) = 6.\n3 Coverability of Labelled Markov Chains\nIn this section, we establish a connection between RNMF and the coverability relation for labelled Markov chains. We thereby answer an open question posed in 1971 by Paz [15] about the nature of minimal covering labelled Markov chains.\nA labelled Markov chain (LMC ) is a tupleM = (n,Σ, µ) where n ∈ N is the number of states, Σ is a finite alphabet of labels, and function µ : Σ→ [0, 1]n×n specifies the transition matrices and is such that ∑ σ∈Σ µ(σ) is a row-stochastic matrix. The intuitive behaviour of the LMCM is as follows: WhenM is in state i ∈ [n], it emits label σ and moves to state j, with probability µ(σ)i,j .\nWe extend the function µ to words by defining µ(ε) := In and µ(σ1 . . . σk) := µ(σ1) · · ·µ(σk) for all k ∈ N, and all σ1, . . . , σk ∈ Σ. Observe that µ(xy) = µ(x) ·µ(y) for all words x, y ∈ Σ∗. We view µ(w) for a word w ∈ Σ∗ as follows: ifM is in state i ∈ [n], it emits w and moves to state j in |w| steps, with probability µ(w)i,j .\nFor i ∈ [n] and w ∈ Σ∗, we write prMi (w) := e>i · µ(w) · 1(n) for the probability that, starting in state i, M emits word w. For example, in Figure 1 we have prM0 (a1b1) = 112 . More generally, for a given initial distribution π on the set of states [n] (viewed as a stochastic row vector), we write prMπ (w) := π · µ(w) · 1(n) for the probability thatM emits word w starting from state distribution π. We omit the superscriptM from prMπ when it is clear from the context.\nWe say that an LMCM is covered by an LMCM′, written asM′ ≥M, if for every initial distribution π forM there exists a distribution π′ forM′ such that prMπ (w) = prM ′\nπ′ (w) for all words w ∈ Σ∗.\nICALP 2016\nXXX:6 On Restricted Nonnegative Matrix Factorization\nThe backward matrix ofM is a matrix BackM∈ R[n]×Σ ∗\n+ where (BackM)i,w = prMi (w) for every i ∈ [n] and w ∈ Σ∗. The rank of M is defined by rank(M) = rank(BackM). (Matrix BackM is infinite, but since it has n rows, its rank is at most n.) It follows easily from the definition (see also [15, Theorem 3.1]) thatM′ ≥M if and only if there exists a row-stochastic matrix A such that A · BackM′ = BackM.\nLMCs can be seen as a special case of stochastic sequential machines, a class of probabilistic automata introduced and studied by Paz [15]. More specifically, they are stochastic sequential machines with a singleton input alphabet and Σ as output alphabet. In his seminal 1971 textbook on probabilistic automata [15], Paz asks the following question:\nI Question 4 (Paz [15], p. 38). If an n-state LMC M is covered by an n′-state LMC M′ where n′ < n, isM necessarily covered by some n∗-state LMCM∗, where n∗ < n, such that M∗ andM have the same rank?\nIn 1974, a positive answer to this question was claimed [3, Theorem 13]. In fact, the author of [3] makes a stronger claim, namely that the answer to Question 4 is yes, even if the inequality n∗ < n in Question 4 is replaced by n∗ ≤ n′. To the contrary, we show:\nI Theorem 5. The answer to Question 4 is negative.\nTheorem 5 falsifies the claim in [3]. In Appendix B.1 we discuss in detail the mistake in [3]. To prove Theorem 5 we establish a tight connection between NMF and LMC coverability:\nI Proposition 6. Given a nonnegative matrix M ∈ Qn×m+ of rank r, one can compute in polynomial time an LMCM = (m+ 2,Σ, µ) of rank r + 2 such that for all d ∈ N: (a) any d-dimensional NMF M = W · H determines an LMC M′ = (d + 2,Σ, µ′) with M′ ≥M and rank(M′) = rank(W ) + 2, and (b) any LMCM′ = (d+2,Σ, µ′) withM′ ≥M determines a d-dimensional NMF M = W ·H with rank(M′) = rank(W ) + 2.\nIn particular, for all d ∈ N the inequality rrank+(M) ≤ d holds if and only ifM is covered by some (d+ 2)-state LMCM′ such thatM′ andM have the same rank.\nAssuming Proposition 6 we can prove Theorem 5:\nProof of Theorem 5. Let M ∈ {0, 1}6×8 be the matrix from Example 3. LetM = (10,Σ, µ) be the associated LMC from Proposition 6. Since M = I6 · M is an NMF with inner dimension 6, by Proposition 6 (a) there is an LMCM′ = (8,Σ, µ′) withM′ ≥M. Towards a contradiction, suppose the answer to Question 4 were yes. Then M is also covered by some n∗-state LMC M∗, where n∗ ≤ 9, such that M∗ and M have the same rank. The last sentence of Proposition 6 then implies that rrank+(M) ≤ 7. But this contradicts the equality rrank+(M) = 8 from Example 3. Hence, the answer to Question 4 is no. J\nTo prove Proposition 6 we adapt a reduction from NMF to the trace-refinement problem in Markov decision processes [10].\nProof sketch of Proposition 6. Let M ∈ Qn×m+ be a nonnegative matrix of rank r. As argued in Section 2.1, without loss of generality we may assume that M is column-stochastic and consider factorizations of M into column-stochastic matrices only.\nWe define an LMC M = (m + 2,Σ, µ) with m + 2 states {0, 1, . . . ,m,m + 1}. The alphabet is Σ = {a1, . . . , am} ∪ {b1, . . . , bn} ∪ {X} and the function µ, for all i ∈ [m] and all j ∈ [n], is defined by:\nµ(ai)0,i = 1m , µ(bj)i,m+1 = (M >)i,j = Mj,i, µ(X)m+1,m+1 = 1,\nD.

The first n + 2 columns (indexed by ε, b1, . . . , bn,X) in BackM span Col(BackM). Therefore, rank(M) = rank(M) + 2 = r + 2.\nFor d ∈ N, letM = W ·H for some column-stochastic matricesW ∈ Rn×d+ and H ∈ Rd×m+ . Define an LMCM′ = (d+ 2,Σ, µ′) where the states are {0, 1, . . . , d, d+ 1}. The function µ′, for all i ∈ [m], j ∈ [n], and l ∈ [d], is defined by:\nµ′(ai)0,l = 1mHl,i, µ ′(bj)l,d+1 = Wj,l, µ′(X)d+1,d+1 = 1,\nand all other entries of µ′(ai), µ′(bj), and µ′(X) are 0.

It follows thatM′ ≥M. J\n4 Restricted NMF of Rank-3 Matrices\nIn this section we consider rational matrices of rank at most 3. We show that for such matrices the restricted nonnegative ranks over R and Q are equal and we give a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a minimal-dimension RNMF over Q.\nI Theorem 7. Given a matrix M ∈ Qn×m+ where rank(M) ≤ 3, there is a rational RNMF of M with inner dimension rrank+(M) and it can be computed in polynomial time in the Turing model of computation.\nICALP 2016\nXXX:8 On Restricted Nonnegative Matrix Factorization\nUsing reduction 1 of Proposition 2, we can reduce in polynomial time the RNMF problem for rank-3 matrices to the 2-dimensional NPP, i.e., the nested polygon problem in the plane. As noted in Section 2.2, the correspondence between restricted nonnegative factorizations and nested polygons preserves rationality. Thus to prove Theorem 7 it suffices to prove:\nI Theorem 8. Given polygons S ⊆ P ⊆ R2 with rational vertices, there exists a minimumvertex polygon Q nested between P and S that also has rational vertices. Moreover there is an algorithm that, given P and S, computes such a polygon in polynomial time in the Turing machine model.\nIn fact, Aggarwal et al. [1] give an algorithm for the 2-dimensional NPP and prove that it runs in polynomial time in the RAM model with unit-cost arithmetic. However, they freely use trigonometric functions and do not address the rationality of the output of the algorithm nor its complexity in the Turing model. To prove Theorem 8 we show that, by adopting a suitable representation of the vertices of a nested polygon, the algorithm in [1] can be adapted so that it runs in polynomial time in the Turing model. We furthermore use this representation to prove that the minimum-vertex nested polygon identified by the resulting algorithm has rational vertices.\nThe remainder of the section is devoted to the proof of Theorem 8. We first recall some terminology from [1] and describe their algorithm.\nA supporting line segment is a directed line segment, with its initial and final points on the boundary of the outer polygon P , that touches the inner polygon S on its left. A nested polygon with vertices on the boundary of P is said to be supporting if all but at most one of its edges are supporting line segments. A polygon nested between P and S is called minimal if it has the minimum number of vertices among all polygons nested between P and S. It is shown in [1, Lemma 4] that there is always a supporting polygon that is also minimal, and the algorithm given therein outputs such a polygon.\nLet k be the number of vertices of a minimal nested polygon. Given a vertex v on the boundary of P , there is a uniquely defined supporting polygon Qv with at most k+ 1 vertices. To determine Qv one computes the supporting line segments v1v2, . . . , vkvk+1, where v1 = v; see Figure 2. Then Qv is either the polygon with vertices v1, . . . , vk or the polygon with vertices v1, . . . , vk+1. In the first case, Qv is minimal. The idea behind the algorithm of [1] is to search along the boundary of P for an initial vertex v such that Qv is minimal.\nAs a central ingredient for our proof of Theorem 8, we choose a convenient representation of the vertices of supporting polygons. To this end, we assume that the edges of P are oriented counter-clockwise, and we represent a vertex v on an edge pq of P by the unique λ ∈ [0, 1] such that v = (1− λ)p+ λq. We call this the convex representation of v.\nSimilar to [1], we associate with each supporting line segment uv a ray function r, such that if λ is the convex representation of u then r(λ) is the convex representation of v. The same ray function applies for supporting line segments u′v′ with u′ in a small enough interval containing u.\nIn the following, when we say polynomial time, we mean polynomial time in the Turing model. To obtain a polynomial time bound, the key lemma is as follows:\nI Lemma 9. Consider bounded polygons S ⊆ P ⊆ R2 whose vertices are rational and of bit-length L. Then the ray function associated with a supporting line segment uv has the form r(λ) = aλ+bcλ+d , where coefficients a, b, c, d are rational numbers with bit-length O(L) that can be computed in polynomial time.\nSuppose that v1v2, . . . , vkvk+1 is a sequence of k supporting line segments, with corresponding ray functions r1, . . . , rk. Then v1, . . . , vk are the vertices of a minimal supporting\nD. Chistikov and S. Kiefer and I. Marušić and M. Shirmohammadi and J. Worrell XXX:9\npolygon if and only if (rk ◦ . . . ◦ r1)(λ) ≥ λ, where λ is the convex representation of v1. It follows from [1] that, for each edge of P , one can compute in polynomial time a partition I of [0, 1] into intervals with rational endpoints such that if λ1, λ2 are in the same interval I ∈ I then the points with convex representation λ1 and λ2 are associated with the same sequence of ray functions r1, . . . , rk. Using Lemma 9 we can, for each interval I ∈ I, compute these ray functions in polynomial time. Define the slack function s(λ) = (rk ◦ . . . ◦ r1)(λ) − λ. In fact, this function has the form s(λ) = aλ+bcλ+d − λ for rational numbers a, b, c, d that are also computable in polynomial time (see Corollary 15 in Appendix C). Then it is straightforward to check whether s(λ) ≥ 0 has a solution λ ∈ I.\nNext we show that if such a solution exists, then there exists a rational solution, which, moreover, can be computed in polynomial time. To this end, let λ∗ ∈ I be such that s(λ∗) ≥ 0. If λ∗ is on the boundary of I, then λ∗ ∈ Q. If λ∗ is not on the boundary and is not an isolated solution, then there exists a rational solution in its neighbourhood. Lastly, let λ∗ be an isolated solution not on the boundary. Then, λ∗ is a root of both s and its derivative s′. For every λ ∈ I, we have\n(cλ+ d) · s(λ) = aλ+ b− λ · (cλ+ d).\nTaking the derivative of the above equation with respect to λ, we get\nc · s(λ) + (cλ+ d) · s′(λ) = a− d− 2cλ. (1)\nSince s(λ∗) = s′(λ∗) = 0, from (1) we get 0 = a− d− 2cλ∗. Note that c 6= 0 since otherwise s ≡ 0. Therefore, λ∗ = a−d2c ∈ Q.\nIt follows that the vertex v represented by λ∗ has rational coordinates computable in polynomial time. By computing (ri ◦ . . . ◦ r1)(λ∗) for i ∈ [k], we can compute in polynomial time the convex representation of all vertices of the supporting polygon Qv. Observe, in particular, that all vertices are rational. Hence we have proved Theorem 8.\n5 Restricted NMF Requires Irrationality\nHere we show that the restricted nonnegative ranks over R and Q are, in general, different.\nICALP 2016\nXXX:10 On Restricted Nonnegative Matrix Factorization\nof a 3-dimensional outer polytope P .

This RNMF has been obtained by reducing, according to Proposition 2, an NPP instance, which we now describe.\nFigure 3 shows the outer 3-dimensional polytope P with 6 faces. The polytope P is the intersection of the following half-spaces: y ≥ 0 (blue), z ≥ 0 (brown), x ≥ 0 (pink), −x + 52z + 1 ≥ 0 (yellow), − 1 2x − y + 1 4z + 1 ≥ 0 (green), − 1 4x − y − 7 8z + 1 ≥ 0\nD.

The outer quadrilateral is one of 6 faces of P , the brown face in Figure 3. The points s1, s2, s3 are among the 6 points that span the inner polytope S. The points q∗1 , q∗2 , q∗3 are among the 5 points that span the nested polytope Q. The area around q∗1 is zoomed in on the right-hand side. The picture illustrates that q∗1 cannot be moved left on the x-axis without increasing the number of vertices of the nested polytope: A dotted ray from a point slightly to the left of q∗1 is drawn through s1. Its intersection with the line x = 1 is slightly below q∗2 . Following the algorithm of [1], the dotted ray is continued in a similar fashion, “wrapping around” s2 and s3, and ending on the x-axis at around x ≈ 0.2, far left of the starting point. On the other hand, the dashed line illustrates that q∗1 could be moved right (considering only this face).\n(transparent front). The figure also indicates an interior polytope S spanned by 6 points (black dots): s1 = ( 34 , 1 8 , 0) >, s2 = ( 34 , 1 2 , 0) >, s3 = ( 311 , 17 22 , 0) >, s4 = (2, 0, 12 ) >, s5 = ( 12 , 0, 3 4 ) >, s6 = ( 16 , 0, 7 12 ) >. In the following we discuss possible locations of 5 points q1, q2, q3, q4, q5 that span a nested polytope Q. Since s1, s2, s3 all lie on the (brown) face on the xy-plane, but not on a common line, at least 3 of the qi must lie on the xy-plane. A similar statement holds for s4, s5, s6 and the xz-plane. So at least one qi, say q1, must lie on the x-axis.\nSuppose another qi, say q2, lies on the x-axis. Without loss of generality we can take q1 = (0, 0, 0)> and q2 = (1, 0, 0)>, as all points in P on the x-axis are enclosed by these q1, q2. Figure 4 provides a detailed view of the xy-plane. To enclose s2, some q ∈ {q3, q4, q5} must also lie on the xy-plane and to the right of the line that connects q2 = (1, 0, 0)> and s2. To enclose s3, some q′ ∈ {q3, q4, q5} must also lie on the xy-plane and to the left of the line that connects q1 = (0, 0, 0)> and s3. If q and q′ were identical then they would lie outside P—a contradiction. Hence 4 points (namely, q1, q2, q, q′) are on the xy-plane. This leaves only one point, say q′′, that is not on the xy-plane. To enclose s4 (see Figure 9 in Appendix D), point q′′ must lie on the xz-plane and must lie to the right of the line that connects q2 = (1, 0, 0)> and s4. To enclose s6, point q′′ must lie to the left of the line that connects q1 = (0, 0, 0)> and s6. Hence q′′ lies outside P—a contradiction.\nHence we have shown that only one point, say q1, lies on the x-axis, and two points besides q1, say q2, q3, lie on the xy-plane, and two points besides q1, say q4, q5, lie on the xz-plane. Figure 4 indicates a possible location (q∗1 , q∗2 , q∗3) of q1, q2, q3. The figure illustrates\nICALP 2016\nXXX:12 On Restricted Nonnegative Matrix Factorization\nthat the x-coordinate of q∗1 must be at least 2− √\n2. Figure 5 illustrates how to prove the same fact more formally, using the concept of a slack function (see Section 4): The slack function s(λ) for the interval containing 2− √ 2 has a zero at λ = 2− √ 2, with a sign change from negative to positive. An inspection of the intervals (of the partition I from Section 4) to the “left” of 2− √ 2 reveals that none of the corresponding slack functions s̃ satisfies s̃(λ) ≥ 0 for λ < 2 − √ 2. Similarly, the x-coordinate of q∗1 must be at most 2 − √\n2, as illustrated by Figures 9 and 10 in Appendix D. Hence q∗1 = (2− √ 2, 0, 0)> is necessary. This uniquely (up to permutations) determines q∗2 , q∗3 and similarly the locations q∗4 , q∗5 of q4, q5. With the reduction from Proposition 2 this NPP solution determines the RNMF of M mentioned at the beginning of the proof. Since there is no 4-point solution of the NPP instance, we have rrank+(M) = 5. (Since rank(M) = 4, Lemma 1 implies rank+(M) = 5.) Since there is no 5-point rational solution of the NPP instance, the restricted nonnegative rank of M over Q is 6. J\n6 Conclusion and Future Work\nWe have shown that an optimal restricted nonnegative factorization of a rational matrix may require factors that have irrational entries. An outstanding open problem is whether the same holds for general nonnegative factorizations. An answer to this question will likely shed light on the issue of whether the nonnegative rank can be computed in NP.\nAnother contribution of the paper has been to develop connections between nonnegative matrix factorization and probabilistic automata, thereby answering an old question concerning the latter. Pursuing this connection, and closely related to the above-mentioned open problem, one can ask whether, given a probabilistic automaton with rational transition probabilities, one can always find a minimal equivalent probabilistic automaton that also has rational transition probabilities.\nAcknowledgements.

Hence (A b) ∈ Qn×r has full rank r. Let S = conv{s1, . . . , sm} ⊂ P be a full-dimensional polytope. Define matrix M ∈ Qn×m with M j = Asj + b for j ∈ [m]. We show the correspondences (a) and (b) from the main text.\n(a) Consider an RNMF M = W ·H with inner dimension d. We can assume that W has no zero-columns. We have Col(W ) = Col(M) = Col((A b)): indeed, the first equality holds because the NMF is restricted, and the second equality holds as S is full-dimensional. So there is a matrix C ∈ Rr×d such that W = (A b) · C. For all i ∈ [d] define ĉi ∈ Rr−1 so\nthat Ci = ( ĉi Cr,i ) . Since W is nonnegative, we have Aĉi + Cr,ib ≥ 0. Observe that there is no y ∈ Rr−1 \\ {0} with Ay ≥ 0: indeed, if Ay ≥ 0 for some nonzero y then for any x ∈ P and any t > 0 we have A(x+ ty) + b ≥ Ax+ b ≥ 0, implying that P is unbounded, which is false. We use this observation to show that Cr,i > 0.\nTowards a contradiction, suppose Cr,i = 0. Then Aĉi ≥ 0. Since W has no zerocolumns, we have ĉi 6= 0, contradicting the observation above.\nTowards a contradiction, suppose Cr,i < 0. By dividing the inequality Aĉi + Cr,ib ≥ 0 by −Cr,i we obtain A(−ĉi/Cr,i)− b ≥ 0. Let x ∈ P \\ {ĉi/Cr,i}. Then Ax+ b ≥ 0, and by adding the previous inequality, we obtain A(x − ĉi/Cr,i) ≥ 0. Since x 6= ĉi/Cr,i, this also contradicts the observation above.\nThus we have shown that Cr,i > 0 for all i ∈ [d]. Define a diagonal matrix D ∈ Rd×d such that Di,i = Cri > 0, and define H ′ = D ·H. Then we have:\n(A b) ( s1 s2 · · · sm 1 1 · · · 1 ) = M = W ·H = (A b)C ·H = (A b)CD−1 ·DH\n= (A b) ( ĉ1/Cr,1 ĉ2/Cr,2 · · · ĉd/Cr,d\n1 1 · · · 1\n) H ′.\nSince the columns of (A b) are linearly independent, it follows:\n( s1 s2 · · · sm 1 1 · · · 1 ) = ( ĉ1/Cr,1 ĉ2/Cr,2 · · · ĉd/Cr,d 1 1 · · · 1 ) H ′.\nConsidering the last row, we see that each column of H ′ sums up to 1. Since H ′ is nonnegative, H ′ is column-stochastic. For i ∈ [d] define qi = ĉi/Cr,i. Then for all j ∈ [m] we have sj ∈ conv{q1, · · · , qd}. Hence, defining the polytope Q = conv{q1, · · · , qd} we have S ⊆ Q. For all i ∈ [d] we have Aĉi +Cr,ib ≥ 0, hence Aqi + b ≥ 0. It follows Q ⊆ P . Thus Q is nested between P and S.\n(b) Consider d points q1, . . . , qd ∈ Rr−1 with S ⊆ conv{q1, . . . , qd} ⊆ P . Define a matrix W ∈ Qn×d by W i = Aqi + b for i ∈ [d]. Matrix W is nonnegative, as qi ∈ P . Define a column-stochastic matrix H ∈ Qd×m so that sj = ∑d i=1Hi,jqi for j ∈ [m].

Since S is full-dimensional, we have Col(M) = Col((A b)). As Col(W ) ⊆ Col((A b)) it follows that Col(W ) ⊆ Col(M), hence NMF M = W ·H is restricted.\nB Proofs of Section 3\nB.1 Discussion of Erroneous Claims in [3]\nAs mentioned in the main text, Bancilhon [3, Theorem 13] claims a statement that implies a positive answer to Paz’s Question 4. We have shown that the correct answer to Paz’s question is negative. In the following we track down where the paper [3] goes wrong. The proof of [3, Theorem 13] offered therein relies on another (wrong) claim about cones.\nLet V be a vector space. Let v1, . . . , vn ∈ V. The polyhedral cone generated by v1, . . . , vn is the set{\nn∑ i=1 λivi ∣∣∣∣∣ λ1, . . . , λn ≥ 0 } ⊆ V .\nI Claim 11 ([3, Theorem 2], slightly paraphrased). Let V be a vector space. Let V ′ ⊆ V be a subspace of V. Let C ⊆ V be a polyhedral cone generated by n vectors that also span V. Then C ∩ V ′ is a polyhedral cone generated by at most n vectors.\nClaim 11 is false. For a counterexample, consider the polyhedral cone C generated by the following 6 vectors: 1 0 0 1 0 0  ,  0 0 0 1 0 0  ,  0 1 0 0 1 0  ,  0 0 0 0 1 0  ,  0 0 1 0 0 1  ,  0 0 0 0 0 1  It can be described equivalently by the conjunction of inequalities 0 ≤ x1 ≤ x4 and 0 ≤ x2 ≤ x5 and 0 ≤ x3 ≤ x6. Let V ′ ⊂ R6 be the vector space defined by the equalities x4 = x5 = x6. Then the cone C′ = C ∩V ′ can be described by the inequalities 0 ≤ x1, x2, x3 ≤ x4 = x5 = x6."

The proof offered therein starts with the following claim, which is stated there without further justification:\nI Claim 12 (proof of [3, Theorem 2], slightly paraphrased). A cone C is generated by n vectors if and only if it is limited by n hyperplanes.\nClaim 12 is also false.

Given a nonnegative matrix M ∈ Qn×m+ of rank r, one can compute in polynomial time an LMCM = (m+ 2,Σ, µ) of rank r + 2 such that for all d ∈ N:\n(a) any d-dimensional NMF M = W · H determines an LMC M′ = (d + 2,Σ, µ′) with M′ ≥M and rank(M′) = rank(W ) + 2, and\n(b) any LMCM′ = (d+2,Σ, µ′) withM′ ≥M determines a d-dimensional NMF M = W ·H with rank(M′) = rank(W ) + 2.\nIn particular, for all d ∈ N the inequality rrank+(M) ≤ d holds if and only ifM is covered by some (d+ 2)-state LMCM′ such thatM′ andM have the same rank.\nHere we will write 0 for the column vector with all zeros, whose dimension will be clear from the context.

In particular, if NMF M = W · H is restricted, then rank(M) = rank(M) + 2 = rank(W ) + 2 = rank(M′).\nNow we show in more detail thatM′ ≥M.

Hence,M′ ≥M. Lastly we prove the other direction, (b). Let LMC M′ = (d + 2,Σ, µ′) be such that M′ ≥M. This implies that there exists a row-stochastic matrix A such that A · BackM′ = BackM. Given nonempty subsets I and J of the row and column indices of a matrix C, respectively, we write CI,J for the submatrix (Ci,j)i∈I,j∈J . It is clear from the description of BackM that M has the following (d+ 2)-dimensional nonnegative factorization:\nM> = (BackM)[m],{b1,...,bn} = A[m],{0,1,...,d,d+1} · (BackM ′){0,1,...,d,d+1},{b1,...,bn}. (2)\nAssuming M is a non-zero matrix, there exist i ∈ [m] and j ∈ [n] such that Mj,i > 0. Then,\n1 m Mj,i = (BackM)0,aibj = A0 · (BackM′)aibj = d+1∑ i1=0 A0,i1 · (BackM′)i1,aibj > 0.\nSince A and (BackM′) are nonnegative matrices, there exists i1 ∈ {0, 1, ..., d, d + 1} such that A0,i1 · (BackM′)i1,aibj > 0. Without loss of generality, we may assume that i1 = 0. That is,\nA0,0 · (BackM′)0,aibj > 0. (3)\nMoreover, (BackM)m+1,X = Am+1 · (BackM′)X = 1. The nonnegativity implies that there exists i2 ∈ {0, 1, ..., d, d+ 1} such that Am+1,i2 · (BackM′)i2,X > 0. Note that i2 6= 0 since otherwise we would have that (BackM)m+1,aibj ≥ Am+1,0 · (BackM′)0,aibj > 0 which is a contradiction. We may therefore, without loss of generality, assume that i2 = d+ 1, i.e.,\nAm+1,d+1 · (BackM′)d+1,X > 0. (4)\nI Lemma 13. It holds that M> = A[m],[d] · (BackM′)[d],{b1,...,bn}, where matrix A[m],[d] is row-stochastic.\nICALP 2016\nXXX:20 On Restricted Nonnegative Matrix Factorization\nProof. By (2), it suffices to show that\nA[m],{0,1,...,d,d+1} · (BackM′){0,1,...,d,d+1},{b1,...,bn} = A[m],[d] · (BackM ′)[d],{b1,...,bn}.\nThat is, for any l1 ∈ [m] and l2 ∈ [n] we need to show that\nAl1,{0,1,...,d,d+1} · (BackM ′){0,1,...,d,d+1},bl2 = Al1,[d] · (BackM ′)[d],bl2 .\nTo do this, it suffices to show that Al1,0 · (BackM′)0,bl2 +Al1,d+1 · (BackM ′)d+1,bl2 = 0. In the following, we prove that Al1,0 = 0 and Al1,d+1 = 0. By an analogous argument, it also holds that (BackM′)0,bl2 = 0 and (BackM\n′)d+1,bl2 = 0. If Al1,0 > 0, then from (3) it would follow that\n(BackM)l1,aibj = Al1 · (BackM′)aibj ≥ Al1,0 · (BackM′)0,aibj > 0,\nwhich is a contradiction since (BackM)l1,aibj = 0 for all l1 ∈ [m]. Similarly, if Al1,d+1 > 0 then by (4) we would have that\n(BackM)l1,X = Al1 · (BackM′)X ≥ Al1,d+1 · (BackM′)d+1,X > 0,\nwhich is a contradiction since (BackM)l1,X = 0 for all l1 ∈ [m]. Hence, Al1,0 = Al1,d+1 = 0. We have thus shown that A[m],{0} = A[m],{d+1} = (0, . . . , 0)>. Since A is row stochastic, this implies that A[m],[d] is row-stochastic. J\nFrom Lemma 13 we get a d-dimensional nonnegative factorizaton M = W · H where W = ((BackM′)[d],{b1,...,bn})> and H = (A[m],[d])>.\nSuppose M′ and M have the same rank. Then Row(BackM) = Row(BackM′), as we already knew that Row(BackM) ⊆ Row(BackM′) since A · BackM′ = BackM. Take any v ∈ Col(W ). Since W> = (BackM′)[d],{b1,...,bn}, there exists u ∈ Row(BackM′) such that v> = u{b1,...,bn}. As Row(BackM′) = Row(BackM), from BackM it is clear that v ∈ Col(M). Hence, Col(W ) ⊆ Col(M) and therefore rank(W ) ≤ rank(M). Since M = W ·H, this implies that rank(W ) = rank(M) as required. This completes the proof of Proposition 6.\nC Proofs of Section 4\nFirst we prove Lemma 9 from the main text.\nLemma 9. Consider bounded polygons S ⊆ P ⊆ R2 whose vertices are rational and of bit-length L. Then the ray function associated with a supporting line segment uv has the form r(λ) = aλ+bcλ+d , where coefficients a, b, c, d are rational numbers with bit-length O(L) that can be computed in polynomial time.\nProof. Let vertices u and v lie on edges p1p′1 and p2p′2 of P , respectively. Let s1 be the point where the supporting line segment uv touches the inner polygon S on its left. Let λ1 and λ2 be the convex representations of u and v, respectively. That is, u = (1− λ1)p1 + λ1p′1 and v = (1− λ2)p2 + λ2p′2. By definition of the ray function r we have λ2 = r(λ1).\nLet us first consider the case when lines p1p′1 and p2p′2 are parallel; see Figure 6 for illustration. Let t denote the intersection of lines p1p′1 and s1p2, and let t′ denote the intersection of lines p2p′2 and s1p′1. Since s1 ∈ Q2, we have t = (1 − b) · p1 + b · p′1 and t′ = (1 − d) · p2 + d · p′2 for some b, d ∈ Q. Numbers b, d can be computed from the input vertices p1, p′1, p2, p′2 using a constant number of arithmetic operations and therefore have"

Hence,\nλ2 = d 1− b · λ1 − bd 1− b\nwhere the coefficients d1−b , bd 1−b ∈ Q have bit-length O(L). Let us now consider the second case: when lines p1p′1 and p2p′2 are not parallel. Let t denote their intersection; see Figure 7 for illustration. Note that t ∈ Q2. Without loss of generality, let p′1 be a convex combination of {p1, t} and p2 be a convex combination of {t, p′2}. Then p′1 = (1− a) · p1 + a · t and p2 = (1− b) · t+ b · p′2 for some a, b ∈ [0, 1]. Numbers a, b are rational as they are each the unique solution of a linear system with rational coefficients. Moreover a, b can be computed from the input vertices p1, p′1, p2, p′2 using a constant number of arithmetic operations and therefore have bit-length O(L). Using the above representation of p′1 as a convex combination of {p1, t}, we get\nu = (1− λ1) · p1 + λ1 · ((1− a) · p1 + a · t) = (1− aλ1) · p1 + aλ1 · t\nand therefore u− t = (1− aλ1) · (p1 − t).

Given two rational linear fractional transformations f1(λ) = a1λ+b1c1λ+d1 and f2(λ) = a2λ+b2c2λ+d2 , their composition f2 ◦ f1 is also a rational linear fractional transformation.

We show that restricted NMF is closely related to a question about the nature of minimal probabilistic automata, posed by Paz in his seminal 1971 textbook. We use this connection to answer Paz’s question negatively, thus falsifying a positive answer claimed in 1974. Furthermore, we investigate whether a rational matrix M always has a restricted NMF of minimal inner dimension whose factors W and H are also rational. We show that this holds for matrices M of rank at most 3 and we exhibit a rank-4 matrix for which W and H require irrational entries. 1998 ACM Subject Classification F.1.1 Models of Computation, F.2.1 Numerical Algorithms and Problems",
