      "text" : "Power-law distributions were first studied in economics (Pareto, 1906) in the context of distribution of wealth. Later power-law behavior was observed in various fields such as physics, biology, computer science etc. Barabási & Albert (1999) observed this behavior in the World Wide Web. Goldwater et al. (2011) used these distributions to study language models.\nIn recent years, interest in generalized information measures has increased dramatically, one reason being while maximization of Shannon entropy gives rise to exponential distributions, these measures give power-law distributions. One such generalization is known as nonextensive entropy introduced by Havrda & Charvát (1967), and then studied by Tsallis (1988) in statistical mechanics. The Shannon-Khinchin axioms of Shannon entropy have been generalized to this case (Suyari, 2004), and this entropy functional has been studied in information theory, statistics and many other fields. Tsallis entropy has been used to study power-law behavior in different cases like earthquakes and network traffic (Abe & Suzuki, 2003, 2005).\nIn kernel based machine learning (Scholköpf & Smola, 2002), positive definite kernels are considered as a measure of similarity between points. The choice of kernel is critical to the performance of the learning algorithms, and hence, many kernels have been studied in literature (Cristianini & Shawe-Taylor, 2004). One of the most common kernel used in practical applications is the Gaussian kernel. Nonextensive kernels on probability measures, based on Tsallis divergences, have been proposed by Martins et al. (2009).\nIn this paper, we propose a new kernel based on q-Gaussian, which is a generalization of the Gaussian distribution, obtained\nby maximizing Tsallis entropy under certain moment constraints. The power-law nature of this distribution has been studied by Sato (2010). In fact, the value of q controls the nature of the power-law tails.\nWe prove that the proposed kernel is positive definite over a range of values of q. We demonstrate the effect of this kernel by applying it to various machine learning problems, like SVMs, regression and kernel k-means clustering. We provide results indicating that in some cases, the q-Gaussians may outperform the Gaussian kernel for certain values of q. Further, we also discuss about the RKHS corresponding to this kernel.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Some of the preliminaries regarding q-Gaussian distributions and kernels have been discussed in Section 2. In Section 3, the q-Gaussian kernel is proposed, and its important properties are presented. Section 4 presents numerical evidence regarding the RKHS of the proposed kernel. Some results comparing q-Gaussian kernel with Gaussian kernel for different classification tasks are presented in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 provides the concluding remarks."

      "text" : "A. q-Gaussian distribution\nTsallis entropy can be obtained by generalizing the information of a single event in the definition of Shannon entropy as shown by Tsallis (1988), where logarithm is replaced with q-logarithm defined as lnq x = x 1−q−1 1−q q ∈ R, q > 0, q 6= 1. Tsallis entropy in the continuous case is defined as (Dukkipati et al., 2007)\nHq(p) =\n1− ∫ X [p(x)]qdx\nq − 1 , q ∈ R, q > 0, q 6= 1, (1)\nThis function produces the differential Shannon entropy functional as q → 1. It is called nonextensive because of its pseudo-additive nature (Tsallis, 1988).\nKullback’s minimum discrimination theorem (Kullback, 1959) establishes important connections between statistics and information theory. A special case is Jaynes’ maximum entropy principle (Jaynes, 1957), by which exponential distributions can be obtained by maximizing Shannon entropy functional, subject to some moment constraints. Using the\nar X\niv :1\n20 4.\n18 00\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n9 A\npr 2\n01 2\nsame principle, maximizing Tsallis entropy under the following constraints\nq-mean 〈x〉q :=\n∫ R x[p(x)]qdx∫\nR [p(x)]qdx\n= µ, and (2)\nq-variance 〈x2〉q :=\n∫ R (x− µ)2[p(x)]qdx∫\nR [p(x)]qdx\n= σ2, (3)\nresults in a distribution known as q-Gaussian distribution (Prato & Tsallis, 1999). This is of the form\nGq,β(x) = Λq\nσ √ 3− q expq\n( − (x− µ) 2\n(3− q)σ2\n) , (4)\nwhere the q-exponential, expq(z), is expressed as\nexpq(z) = [ 1 + (1− q)z ] 1 1−q + , (5)\nand Λq is the normalizing constant of the form\nΛq =  √ 1− q√ π Γ ( 5−3q 2(1−q) ) Γ ( 2−q 1−q ) for q < 1, 1√ π for q = 1, and √ q − 1√ π Γ ( 1 q−1 ) Γ (\n3−q 2(1−q)\n) for 1 < q < 3. (6)\nThe condition y+ = max(y, 0) in (5) is called the Tsallis cut-off condition, which ensures the existence of the qexponential. As a special case, Gaussian distribution is a special case of (4) as q → 1."

      "text" : "One of the fundamental problems in machine learning is to obtain a map between an input space X and an output space Y . The objective varies depending on the nature of the problem.\nIn linear methods of learning, the Euclidian distance between data points is used to distinguish them. In other words, the dot product between two vectors is used as a measure of similarity between them. But this approach does not work well when the data is not linearly separable.\nIn such cases, a better method, known as kernel based approach (Scholköpf & Smola, 2002), is to transform the data into a higher dimensional space H through a mapping Φ : X 7→ H, such that the data is linearly separable in H. The similarity between two points in this transformed space, given by a kernel function K : X × X 7→ R defined as\nK(x, y) = Φ(x)TΦ(y) x, y ∈ X . (7)\nBerg et al. (1984) has shown that for any symmetric function K, there exists a mapping Φ such that (7) holds if and only\nif K is positive definite (p.d.), i.e., given any set of points {x1, x2, . . . , xn} ⊂ X , the n × n matrix K, such that Kij = K(xi, xj), is positive semi-definite. This implies that any p.d. kernel can be used in learning theory."

      "heading" : "3. THE PROPOSED KERNEL",
      "text" : "Based on multi-dimensional expression of q-Gaussian (4), proposed by Vignat & Plastino (2007), for a given q ∈ R, we define the q-Gaussian kernel Kq : X × X 7→ R as\nKq(x, y) = expq\n( − ‖x− y‖ 2\n(3− q)σ2\n) for all x, y ∈ X , (8)\nwhere X ⊂ RN , and q, σ ∈ R are two parameters controlling the behavior of the kernel, satisfying the conditions q 6= 1, q 6= 3 and σ 6= 0. For 1 < q < 3, the term inside the bracket is non-negative and hence, the kernel can be written as\nKq(x, y) =\n( 1 +\n(q − 1) (3− q)σ2\n‖x− y‖2 ) 1 1−q . (9)\nDue to the power-law tail of the q-Gaussian, for the above kernel, similarity decreases at a slower rate than the Gaussian kernel with increasing distance. The rate of decrease is controlled by the parameter q, and it leads to better performance in some machine learning tasks, as shown in Section 5.\nWe now show that for certain values of q, the proposed kernel satisfies the property of positive definiteness, which is essential for it to be useful in learning theory."

For 1 < q < 3, the q-Gaussian kernel, as defined in (9), is positive definite.\nWe first state some of the results presented in (Berg et al., 1984), which are required to prove Theorem 3.1.\nLemma 3.2. For a p.d. kernel ϕ : X × X 7→ R, ϕ > 0, the following conditions are equivalent:\n(i) − logϕ is negative definite (n.d.), and (ii) ϕt is p.d. for all t > 0.\nLemma 3.3. If ϕ : X × X 7→ R is n.d. and satisfies ϕ(x, x) > 0 for all x ∈ X , then log(1 + ϕ) is also n.d.\nLemma 3.4. Let ϕ : X × X 7→ R be a n.d. kernel, which is strictly positive, then 1ϕ is p.d.\nProof of Theorem 3.1: It is easy to verify that ‖x− y‖2 is n.d. So,(\n1 + (q − 1)\n(3− q)σ2 ‖x− y‖2\n) is n.d. for all 1 < q < 3. (10)\nAlso, for all x, y ∈ X ,( (q − 1)\n(3− q)σ2 ‖x− y‖2\n) > 0 (11)\nwith equality if and only if x = y. Hence, from Lemma 3.3,\nlog ( 1 +\n(q − 1) (3− q)σ2\n‖x− y‖2 ) is n.d. (12)\nLet φ(x, y) = 1( 1 + (q−1)(3−q)σ2 ‖x− y‖2 ) . It follows from (10) and (11) that( 1\nφ\n) is n.d. and ( 1\nφ\n) > 1.\nHence, by Lemma 3.4, φ is p.d. Also, from (12),\nlog\n( 1\nφ\n) is n.d., i.e.,− log φ is n.d.\nApplying Lemma 3.2 we obtain, φt is p.d. for all t > 0. So, ( 1 + (q − 1)\n(3− q)σ2 ‖x− y‖2\n)k is p.d. for all k < 0.\nThe claim follows as (\n1 1−q\n) < 0 for all 1 < q < 3."

Smola et al. (1998) showed that the significance of RKHS for support vector kernels using Bochner’s theorem (Bochner, 1959), which provides a RKHS in Fourier space for translation invariant kernels. Other approaches also exist which lead to explicit description of the Gaussian kernel (Steinwart et al., 2006). But such an approach does not work for the q-Gaussian case as binomial series expansion of q-Gaussian does not converge for q > 1. So, we follow Bochner’s approach."

      "text" : "We state Bochner’s theorem, and then use the method presented in (Hofmann et al., 2008) to show how it can be used to construct the RKHS for a p.d. kernel.\nDefinition 4.1. A function φ : RN 7→ C is called a positive definite function if ϕ(x, y) = φ(x−y) is a p.d. kernel on RN .\nTheorem 4.2 (Bochner). Let φ be a continuous function on RN . Then, φ is positive definite if and only if there is a finite non-negative Borel measure µ on RN such that\nφ(x) = ∫ RN e−i〈t,x〉dµ(t) (15)\nAssuming that dµ(t) = ρ(t)dt, it immediately follows that ρ(t) is the inverse Fourier transform of φ(x). Then, the RKHS of the kernel ϕ is given by\nHϕ = { f ∈ L2(RN ,dx) ∣∣∣∣ ∫ RN |f̂(t)|2 ρ(t) dt <∞ } (16)\nwith the inner product defined as 〈f, g〉ϕ = ∫ RN f̂(t)ĝ(t) ρ(t) dt, (17)\nwhere f̂(t) is the Fourier transform of f(x) and L2(RN ,dx) is set of all measurable functions over RN .\nClaim 4.3. For a given q ∈ (1, 3), the RKHS of Kq is the set\nHKq =\n{ f ∈ L2(RN ,dx) ∣∣∣∣ ∫ RN |f̂(t)|2dt δq(t) <∞ } with the inner product\n〈f, g〉Kq = ∫ RN f̂(t)ĝ(t) δq(t) dt,\nwhere δq(t) = exp\n( −σ Aq |t|Aq\nB Aq q\n) , Aq and Bq being con-\nstants depending on the value of q.\nThe above claim cannot be proved directly. But we show some numerical results justifying the claim.\nB. Inverse Fourier Transform (Numerical Evidence)\nWe define φq : RN 7→ R such that φq(x − y) = Kq(x, y) for all x, y ∈ X ⊂ RN . From Definition 4.1, φq is a positive definite function, and hence, Theorem 4.2 should hold. But, it is difficult to validate this fact since a closed form expression of the inverse Fourier transform of φ given by\nρq(t) = 1\n2π ∫ RN ei〈t,x〉 ( 1 + (q − 1) (3− q)σ2 ‖x‖2 ) 1 1−q dt (18)\ncannot be computed easily. However, some intuition can be obtained from the Gaussian (q = 1) and the Rational Quadratic (q = 2) cases, where the\nclosed form solutions exist. For simplicity, we consider the one-dimensional case where\nφ1(x) = exp\n( − x 2\n2σ2\n) ⇔ ρ1(t) =\nσ√ 2π exp\n( −σ 2t2\n2 ) and φ2(x) = σ2\nσ2 + x2 ⇔ ρ2(t) =\nσ 2 exp (−σ|t|) .\nFrom the above two cases, we can make the following assumption.\nAssumption 4.4. The inverse Fourier transform of φq is of the form\nρq(t) = σ\n2π Cq exp\n( −σ Aq |t|Aq\nB Aq q\n) , (19)\nwhere Aq, Bq, Cq ∈ R are positive constants.\nIn special cases, for q = 1, A1 = 2, B1 = √\n2 and C1 =√ 2π, whereas for q = 2, A2 = B2 = 1 and C2 = π. Claim 4.3 follows if we assume Assumption 4.4 to hold. Since, the inverse Fourier transform is not explicitly determined, hence, the exact relationship of Aq , Bq and Cq with q could not be found. But, a necessary condition can be obtained using Parseval’s identity, as stated in the following proposition.\nProposition 4.5. If Assumption 4.4 holds, then for a given q ∈ (1, 3), the constants Aq , Bq and Cq should satisfy\n√ 3− q√ q − 1\nΓ (\n5−q 2(q−1) ) Γ (\n2 q−1\n) = 2−1/Aq π3/2 C2qBq Aq Γ\n( 1\nAq\n) (20)\nProof: Parseval’s identity states that\n1\n2π ∫ ∞ −∞ φq(x) 2dx = ∫ ∞ −∞ ρq(t) 2dt. (21)\nThe right hand side in (21) is∫ ∞ −∞ ρq(t) 2dt = σ2C2q 2π2 ∫ ∞ 0 exp ( −2σ Aq tAq B Aq q ) dt,\nwhich can be evaluated by substituting z = 2σ Aq tAq\nB Aq q to obtain∫ ∞ −∞ ρq(t) 2dt = σ 2π2 1 21/Aq C2qBq Aq Γ ( 1 Aq ) . (22)\nConsidering the left hand side in (21), we can see that for 1 < q < 3,\nφq(x) 2 = ( 1 +\n(q′ − 1) (3− q′) x2 (σ′)2\n) 1 1−q′\nwhere q′ = q+12 and σ ′ = σ √ 2−q′ 3−q′ . So, integrating φq(x) 2 leads to the normalizing constant in (6) as∫ ∞ −∞ φq(x) 2dx = σ′ √ 3− q′ 1 Λq′ = σ √ 3− q 2 1 Λ( q+12 ) .\n(23)\nThe claim follows from by equating (22) and (23).\nWe have performed numerical integration to calculate the inverse Fourier transform given in (18) for various values of q. The constants Aq , Bq and Cq are obtained by minimizing the least squares error between the obtained numerical solution and (19) at uniformly sampled data points. The constants obtained are shown in the Table I. Using these constants, we have numerically computed the Fourier transform of (19), and compared the result with φq in Figure 1."

While linear SVMs, using inner product as similarity measure, are quite common, other variants using various kernel functions, mostly Gaussian, are also used in practice. Use of kernels leads to nonlinear separating hyperplanes, which sometimes provide better\nclassification. We formulate a SVM based on the proposed kernel, which would lead to an optimization problem with the following dual form:\nmin α∈Rn n∑ i=1 αi − 1 2 n∑ i,j=1 αiαjyiyj expq ( −‖xi − xj‖ 2 (3− q)σ2 ) s.t. αi > 0, i = 1, 2, . . . , n, and\nn∑ i=1 αiyi = 0,\nwhere, {x1, . . . , xn} ⊂ X are the training data points and {y1, . . . , yn} ⊂ {−1, 1} are the true classes.\nThe following two-dimensional example illustrates the nature of hyperplanes that can be obtained using Gaussian and q-Gaussian kernels. The decision boundaries tends to be more flexible as q increases.\nWe compare the performance of linear, Gaussian and qGaussian kernel SVMs. For each of the data sets, 10% of the samples are used for training, and the rest as test data.\nThe training set is randomly chosen. Table II presents the percentage of correct classification averaged over 20 independent trials. For each data set, we have fixed σ for both Gaussian and q-Gaussian kernels. The data sets with multiple classes have been considered as two class problems by grouping related classes based on data description.\nIt can be observed that the performance of q-Gaussian kernel is close to that of Gaussian kernel, and much better than linear SVM. The optimal values of q (highlighted) varies for different data sets. However, in most of the cases, the performance either steadily increases or decreases, considering the fact the Gaussian corresponds to q = 1. This can be justified by the flexibility of the separating hyperplane required for the given data. It has been noticed that for very high or very low values of σ, Gaussian and q-Gaussian kernels give similar results, which happens because the power-law and the exponential natures cannot be distinguished in these cases."

This method is known as kernel k-means.\nThe q-Gaussian kernels have the ability to produce complex decision boundaries as shown in Figure 2. This can be used in kernel k-means to cluster challenging data sets. We compare the performance of q-Gaussian kernel k-means with Gaussian and ordinary k-means. We use the purity of the clusters as a measure of performance, which is defined as\npurity(Ω, C) = 1\nN m∑ k=1 max j∈{1,..,m} |ωk ∩ cj |,\nwhere, Ω = {ω1, ω2, . . . , ωm} are the output class labels, C = {c1, c2, . . . , cm} are the true classes, N is the number of data\npoints and m is the number of clusters.

But for the other sets, the optimal value of q varies arbitrarily. In some cases, ordinary k-means perform better than kernel k-means. These cases have been marked.

The main motivation comes form the generalization of Gaussian distribution to power-law tailed Gaussians called qGaussians, studied in statistical mechanics. Due to its powerlaw nature, the tails of the q-Gaussian fall at a slower rate than Gaussian. This fact can be used in learning algorithms as distant data points have more similarity when q-Gaussian kernels are used.\nWe showed that the proposed kernel is positive definite for all q ∈ (1, 3). We also gave some results pertaining to the RKHS of q-Gaussian kernel using Bochner’s theorem, and showed that this is a generalization of the RKHS for Gaussian and Rational Quadratic kernels. We also demonstrated the use of the proposed kernel in SVM, regression and k-means clustering.\nThe power-law behavior was recognized long time back in many problems in the context of statistical analysis. Recently power-law distributions have been studied in machine learning communities. The present work further looks in this direction. A possible future work can be to learn the optimal value of q, based on the learning algorithm and the nature of the data."
