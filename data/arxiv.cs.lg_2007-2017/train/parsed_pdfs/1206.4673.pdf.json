      "text" : "The problem of sparse variable selection for highdimensional data arises in a wide spectrum of domains, including signal processing, bioinformatics and computer vision. `1-regularized methods, such as lasso (Tibshirani, 1996), are among the most widely used approaches for variable selection in linear models. Despite the popularity of linear models, a reliance on rigid parametric forms limits their ability to model\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nnonlinear covariate effects. Additive models (Hastie & Tibshirani, 1990), where each additive component is a univariate smooth function of a single covariate, are nonparametric extensions of linear models and can offer a higher degree of flexibility. Variable selection in nonparametric additive models is more challenging as one needs to simultaneously select and fit component functions. While some recent progress has been made on this problem by proposing various functional penalties (Lin & Zhang, 2006; Bach, 2008; Ravikumar et al., 2009), none of these methods is capable of exploiting the structural information among the covariates that may exist as prior knowledge in many applications. The simplest case is a group structure where the covariates are partitioned into disjoint groups, and it is desirable to choose relevant covariates that are sparse at the group level. In the parametric setting, it has been shown that if such a group structure exists and is consistent with the true sparsity pattern of covariates, treating the whole group of covariates as a single unit in variable selection has the potential to increase the accuracy of the estimator (Huang & Zhang, 2010). However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no successful attempts to investigate the benefit of considering the group sparsity in estimating nonparametric additive models. One example of such a situation occurs in biology, where the effects of multiple genes on the phenotype are nonlinear, and the goal is to identify a few genes from the same functional groups that are predictive of the phenotype.\nIn this paper, we fill this gap by presenting a new approach for variable selection in nonparametric additive models that can take advantage of the group structure among the covariates. The proposed method, called GroupSpAM, achieves functional sparsity at the level of groups by integrating the spirit of group lasso (Yuan & Lin, 2006) and the idea of sparse additive models (SpAM) (Ravikumar et al., 2009). Therefore, the GroupSpAM estimate combines the predictive power of SpAM that can model nonlinear covariate effects, with the advantage of group lasso that can incorpo-\nrate group structure to achieve better support recovery accuracy. Our empirical results provide convincing evidence of the expected benefits inherited from both threads of research. Although our main focus here is on regression, the framework can be easily extended to classification setting via generalized additive models.\nIn contrast to the ordinary group lasso, where there has been much confusion regarding orthonormality of covariates within a group, GroupSpAM is highly flexible in that no assumptions are made on the design matrices or on the covariance of component functions in each group. In this sense, GroupSpAM can be viewed as a nonparametric extension of the generalized group lasso (Friedman et al., 2010), which allows non-orthonormal covariates within a group, to additive models. However, while allowing nonlinear covariate effects and arbitrary covariance of component functions within a group gives rise to a new method that enjoys superior flexibility, there are new technical challenges in characterizing and computing the GroupSpAM estimate. To resolve these difficulties, we propose a novel optimization procedure to simultaneously conduct component selection and fitting at the level of groups. Specifically, our major contributions in this work include: (1) generalization of `1/`2 norm to L2 function spaces as the sparsity-inducing penalty in GroupSpAM; (2) a necessary and sufficient condition for identifying functional sparsity at the group level (Theorem 2); (3) an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm tailored to handle the covariance of component functions within a group; (4) extension of GroupSpAM to the case of overlapping groups and a successful application to a real dataset."

Ravikumar et al. (2009) introduced a sparse version of additive models called SpAM by penalizing the sum of the L2(µ) norms of the component functions. While these methods have been shown to be effective in estimating sparse nonparametric models, neither of them is able to take advantage of structural information. Liu et al. (2009a) extended SpAM to the multi-task setting; however, the group structure is imposed on the tasks instead of on the covariates being considered here.\nFinally, it is important to emphasize that our work is substantially different from another line of research\nthat also mixes group lasso and additive models (Bach, 2008; Meier et al., 2009; Huang et al., 2010). These approaches, in which each component function is expanded into a group of basis functions constructed from a single covariate, can only perform variable selection at an individual level. In contrast, in this paper, each group consists of a set of several covariates and our goal is to encourage those variables within a group to be selected jointly.\nNotation Vectors and matrices are denoted by boldface letters, and estimates are denoted with a hat. For a random variable X with distribution µ and a measurable function f of x, ‖f‖ denotes the L2(µ) norm of f : ‖f‖ = √ E[f2(X)].

For a set of random variables X1, . . . , Xp, let Hj = {fj | E[fj(Xj)] = 0, ‖fj‖ < ∞}, j = 1 . . . , p, with inner product on the space defined as 〈fj , gj〉 = E[fj(Xj)gj(Xj)]. Sometimes we also use fj := fj(Xj) for simplicity. We use f̂j ∈ Rn to represent the vector of evaluations of the fitted function f̂j at the n observed values of Xj , i.e., f̂j = [f̂j(x1j), . . . , f̂j(xnj)] T . A group of covariates is a subset g ⊂ {1, . . . , p} and a set of groups is denoted as G. For any group g and any vector v, vg = {vj}j∈g. ‖fg‖ = √∑ j∈g ‖fj‖2. dg = |g| represents the cardinality of group g.

By making the assumption that m(x) = E[Y | X = x] is a smooth function of x, we can estimate m(x) using a class of smoothing estimators called the kernel smoothers\nm̂(x) = n∑ i=1 `i(x)y (i) = `(x)Ty, (2)\nwhere `i(x) ∝ Kh(|x(i)−x|) andKh is a smoothing kernel function with the bandwidth h. Kernel smoothers are examples of linear smoothers because, for each x, the estimator m̂(x) in (2) is a linear combination of y(i). Let ŷ ∈ Rn be a vector of fitted values ŷ(i) at the observed x(i), one consequence of linear smoother is\nŷ = Sy, (3)\nwhere S is the so-called smoother matrix with Sij = `j(x\n(i)), i, j = 1, . . . , n.

The optimization problem of GroupSpAM in the population setting is formulated as\nmin f :fj∈Hj L(f) + λΩgroup(f), (10)\nwhere L(f) is the expected square error as in (5) and Ωgroup(f) is the regularization functional penalty defined as\nΩgroup(f) = ∑ g∈G √ dg‖fg‖ = ∑ g∈G √ dg √∑ j∈g E [ f2j (Xj) ] .\nThe regularization term is the generalization of (scaled) `1/`2 penalty norm used in group lasso to L2 function spaces. As in group lasso, this mixed norm induces sparsity at the level of groups: the whole group of functions fg = {fj}j∈g are encouraged to be set to zero. If each group g is a singleton, this formulation reduces to SpAM (Ravikumar et al., 2009); if each component function fj has a linear parametric form, the optimization problem in (10) is just the population setting of the ordinary group lasso formulation (Yuan & Lin, 2006).\nTo solve the optimization problem (10), a seemingly natural strategy is to employ a block coordinate descent algorithm: we optimize the objective functional in (10) with respect to a particular group of functions fg at a time while all other groups of functions are kept fixed. However, as we allow arbitrary covariance of component functions within a group (see remark below for further discussion), there are two main obstacles for applying such algorithm to our problem: (1) it creates a new difficulty to characterize the thresholding condition for functional sparsity at the group level; (2) unlike the ordinary group lasso and SpAM, there is no longer a closed-form solution to the stationary condition for each group of functions fg, in the form of a soft-thresholding operator. Before describing the details of the algorithm, we first state the stationary condition that characterizes the optimum of fg.\nTheorem 1. Let Rg = Y − ∑ g′ 6=g ∑ j′∈g′ fj′(Xj′) be the partial residual after removing all functions from the group g. The stationary condition of the problem (10) with respect to fg while fixing all other groups {fg′ : g′ 6= g} is\nfj+ ∑\nj′∈g:j′ 6=j\nPjfj′−PjRg+λ √ dgsj = 0,∀j ∈ g, (11)\nwhere sg = {sj ∈ Hj}j∈g is a vector of functions belonging to the subgradient of ‖fg‖:\nsg =\n{ {fj/‖fg‖}j∈g if ‖fg‖ 6= 0,\n{ug : ‖ug‖ ≤ 1} if ‖fg‖ = 0.\nProof. The proof uses the calculus of variations in Hilbert space. See Appendix for details.\nNext, we prove a necessary and sufficient thresholding condition at the group level so that we can set a whole group of functions fg to zeros if (12) holds. Theorem 2. fj = 0 ∀j ∈ g if and only if√∑ j∈g E[(PjRg)2] ≤ λ √ dg. (12)\nProof. Necessity. If fj = 0 ∀j ∈ g, then (11) reduces to PjRg = λ √ dgsj ∀j ∈ g, with ‖sg‖ ≤ 1. Thus√∑\nj∈g E[(PjRg)2] = λ\n√ dg √∑ j∈g E[s2j ] ≤ λ √ dg.\nSufficiency. We prove by contradiction. If there exists an fj 6= 0, j ∈ g hence ‖fg‖ 6= 0, equation (11) becomes\nPjRg = fj + ∑\nj′∈g:j′ 6=j\nPjfj′ + λ √ dg\n‖fg‖ fj ,∀j ∈ g.\nWithout loss of generality, we assume g = {1, · · · , |g|}. The set of equations in (11) can be succinctly written in the following equivalent form:\nQRg = Jfg + λ √ dg\n‖fg‖ fg, (13)\nwhere Q and J are a vector and matrix of conditional expectation operators, respectively, defined as\nQ =  P1 P2 ...\nP|g|\n , J =  I P1 · · · P1 P2 I · · · P2 ... ... . . .\n... P|g| P|g| · · · I  . (14) Hence∑ j∈g E[(PjRg)2] = ‖QRg‖2 = ∥∥∥∥∥Jfg + λ √ dg ‖fg‖ fg ∥∥∥∥∥ 2\n= ‖Jfg‖2 + λ2dg + 2 λ √ dg\n‖fg‖ 〈Jfg, fg〉 .\nBy the fact that 〈Jfg, fg〉 = ∑ j∈g E [ f2j + fj ∑ j′∈g:j′ 6=j Pjfj′ ]\n= ∑ j∈g E [ f2j ] + ∑ j∈g ∑ j′∈g:j′ 6=j E [fjE[fj′ | Xj ]]\n= ∑ j∈g E [ f2j ] + ∑ j∈g ∑ j′∈g:j′ 6=j E [fjfj′ ]\n= E [(∑ j∈g fj )2] ≥ 0,\nwe conclude ∑ j∈g E[(PjRg)2] ≥ λ2dg.\nFollowing the standard additive models, we replace the conditional expectation operator Pj by a linear smoother with smoother matrix Sj in the population conditions (12) and (13) to obtain a sample version of estimation procedure. Specifically, if the sample estimate of norm ω̂g in (15) is below the threshold λ √ dg, the whole group of functions are thresholded to zeros; otherwise, we estimate f̂g by solving the sample version of (13) in equation (16). See Algorithm 1 for details. The full block coordinate descent algorithm of the GroupSpAM procedure is described in Algorithm 2. Performing prediction on new data is essentially the same as in the standard additive models (Hastie & Tibshirani, 1990).\nRemark As we don’t restrict the covariance of component functions, for two distinct functions fj and fj′\nAlgorithm 1 Thresholding\n1: Input: Partial residual R̂g, smoother matrices {Sj : j ∈ g}, and tuning parameter λ. 2: Output: f̂g = {f̂j : j ∈ g}.\n3: Estimate PjRg by smoothing: P̂j = SjR̂g, ∀j ∈ g. 4: Estimate √∑\nj∈g E[(PjRg)2] by\nω̂g =\n√ 1\nn ∑ j∈g ‖P̂j‖2.

By the fact that\nCov(fj , fj′) = E[fjfj′ ] = E[fjE[fj′ | Xj ]],\nPjfj′ = E[fj′ | Xj ] is not restricted to be zero as well. Therefore, no closed-form solution to the stationary condition (11) is available and we solve its sample version by fixed point iteration in (16). On the other hand, if Pjfj′ is assumed to be zero for all distinct j, j′ ∈ g in (11), the solution of f̂g can be directly obtained by applying a soft-thresholding op-\nerator: f̂j =\n[ 1− λ √ dg\nω̂g ] + P̂j , ∀j ∈ g. However, such\nan assumption, though leading to a simple closed-form solution of f̂g, is unrealistic in practice for within-group component functions."

The component functions are drawn from Lin & Zhang (2006) and Ravikumar et al. (2009), and are appropriately scaled so that each group contains a function with relatively low variance.

For each training data, we also generate equal-sized validation data and test data in the same manner.

As expected, as the dimension (p) or the correlation (t) increases, the problem in general becomes more difficult.

Compared to the group lasso, GroupSpAM has significantly improved the predictive power of estimates, and also leads to much better support recovery when t increases. The improvement is mainly in terms of variable selection as compared to SpAM, showing the benefit of considering the group sparsity in estimating additive models. It is particularly interesting to notice that the supports of component functions with relatively low variances, i.e., f3 and f7, are hard to be recovered as individual units by SpAM, but are much easier for GroupSpAM to select when combined with other components in the same group.

The dataset consists of gene expression measurements for 8,141 genes collected from 295 breastcancer tumors (78 metastatic and 217 non-metastatic). We are interested in finding a sparse set of genes that can discriminate the two types of tumors. Instead of considering individual genes independently, a more powerful way is to build a predictive model that takes into account their pathway information. Some genes in a biological pathway are known to perform the same\nfunctionality in the cell, hence are more likely to be involved in the studied phenomenon in a group manner. Furthermore, each gene can participate in multiple pathways, and the studied phenomenon may possibly depend on the behavior of genes in a complex way. The GroupSpAM with overlap provides us with a natural and flexible way to incorporate these prior information into the biological analysis, where each group consists of the set of genes in a pathway and groups are potentially overlapping.\nAmong all 8, 141 genes, we focus on 3, 510 of them that belong to at least one canonical pathway in the Molecular Signatures Database (Subramanian et al., 2005). We further reduce the gene set to top 300 genes most correlated with the type of tumor by applying the sure independence screening (Fan & Lv, 2008). This step, which excludes the most irrelevant genes, is a common practice for analyzing microarray data.\nOverall, we obtain 1, 369 covariates (gene expression levels) in 432 groups after covariate duplication. Since the dataset is heavily unbalanced, we adopt a balanced loss function, where each positive (negative) sample is weighted by the proportion of negative (positive)\nsamples. To get the classification label from the nonparametric regression analysis, we simply take the sign of the predicted responses. Table 3 shows the results of GroupSpAM, SpAM and group lasso with overlap (Jacob et al., 2009) based on the balanced loss function by a 3-fold cross validation2. As we can see\n2When running COSSO, we ran into the same problem as in the simulation. Hence we left the results of COSSO.\nfrom Table 3, compared to SpAM, it achieves similar balanced error rates but with less selected genes and pathways, which could lead to an easier interpretation for genetic functional analysis. As compared to group lasso, GroupSpAM has an improved balanced error rate (P = 0.054), suggesting that a better predictive model can be built by using the more flexible additive model class. The functional relationship of the identified genes and pathways to breast cancer merits further investigation."

Previous works either study the group sparsity in the parametric setting (e.g., group lasso), or address the problem in the nonparametric setting without exploiting the structural information (e.g., sparse additive models). In this paper, we present a new method, called group sparse additive models (GroupSpAM), which can handle group sparsity in additive models. We generalize the `1/`2 norm to Hilbert spaces as the sparsityinducing penalty in GroupSpAM. Moreover, we derive a novel thresholding condition for identifying the functional sparsity at the group level, and propose an efficient block coordinate descent algorithm for constructing the estimate. We demonstrate by simulation that GroupSpAM substantially outperforms the competing methods in terms of support recovery and prediction accuracy in additive models, and also conduct a comparative experiment on a real breast cancer dataset.",
