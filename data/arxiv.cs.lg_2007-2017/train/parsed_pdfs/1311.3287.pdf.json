      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Latent variable models have been used to address various machine learning problems, ranging from modeling temporal dynamics, to text document analysis and to social network analysis (Rabiner & Juang, 1986; Clark, 1990; Hoff et al., 2002; Blei et al., 2003). Recently, there is a surge of interest in designing spectral algorithms for estimating the parameters of latent variable models (Hsu et al., 2009; Parikh et al., 2011; Song et al., 2011; Foster et al., 2012; Anandkumar et al., 2012a,b; Király, 2013). Compared to the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) traditionally used for this task, spectral algorithms are better in terms of their computational efficiency and provable guarantees. Current spectral algorithms are largely restricted to mixture of discrete or Gaussian distributions, e.g. (Anandkumar et al., 2012a; Hsu & Kakade, 2013). When the mixture components are distributions other than these standard distributions, the theoretical guarantees for these algorithms are no longer applicable, and their empirical performance can be very poor.\nIn this paper, we propose a kernel method for estimating the parameters of multi-view latent variable models where the mixture components can be nonparametric. The key idea is to embed the joint distribution of such a model into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and exploit the low rank structure of the embedded distribution (or covariance operators). The key computation involves a kernel singular value decomposition of the two-view covariance operator, followed by a robust tensor power method on the three-view covariance operator. These standard matrix operations makes the algorithm very efficient and easy to deploy.\nThe kernel algorithm proposed in this paper is more general than the previous spectral algorithms which work only for distributions with parametric assumptions (Anandkumar et al., 2012a; Hsu & Kakade, 2013).\n∗Email: lsong@cc.gatech.edu †Email: a.anandkumar@uci.edu ‡Email: bodai@gatech.edu §Email: zixu1986@gmail.com\nar X\niv :1\n31 1.\n32 87\nv2 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n8 D\nec 2\nWhen we use delta kernel, our algorithm reduces to the spectral algorithm for discrete mixture components analyzed in (Anandkumar et al., 2012a). When we use universal kernels, such as Gaussian RBF kernel, our algorithm can recover Gaussian mixture components as well as mixture components with other distributions. In this sense, our work also provides a unifying framework for previous spectral algorithms. We prove sample complexity bounds for the nonparametric tensor power method and establish that the sample complexity is quadratic in the number of latent components, and is a low order polynomial in the other relevant parameters such as the lower bound on mixing weights. Thus, we propose a computational and sample efficient nonparametric approach to learning latent variable models.\nKernel methods have been previously applied to learning latent variable models. However, none of the previous works explicitly recovers the actual parameters of the models Song et al. (2011); Song & Dai (2013); Sgouritsa et al. (2013). Most of them estimate an (unknown) invertible transformation of the latent parameters, and it is not clear how one can recover the actual parameters based on these estimates. Furthermore, these works focused on predictive task: recover the marginal distribution of the observed variables by making use of the low rank structure of the latent variable models. It is significantly more challenging to design kernel algorithms for actual parameter recovery and analyze theoretical properties of these algorithms.\nWe compare our kernel algorithm to the EM algorithm and previous spectral algorithms. We show that when the model assumptions are correct for the EM algorithm and previous spectral algorithms, our algorithm converges in terms of estimation error to these competitors. In the opposite cases when the model assumptions are incorrect, our algorithm is able to adapt to the nonparametric mixture components and beating alternatives by a very large margin."

      "heading" : "2 Notation",
      "text" : "We denote by X a random variable with domain X , and refer to instantiations of X by the lower case character, x. We endow X with some σ-algebra A and denote a distributions (with respect to A ) on X by P(X). We also deal with multiple random variables, X1, X2, . . . , X`, with joint distribution P(X1, X2, . . . , X`). For simplicity of notation, we assume that the domains of all Xt, t ∈ [`] are the same, but the methodology applies to the cases where they have different domains. Furthermore, we denote by H a hidden variable with domain H and distribution P(H).\nA reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) F on X with a kernel k(x, x′) is a Hilbert space of functions f(·) : X 7→ R with inner product 〈·, ·〉F . Its element k(x, ·) satisfies the reproducing property: 〈f(·), k(x, ·)〉F = f(x), and consequently, 〈k(x, ·), k(x′, ·)〉F = k(x, x′), meaning that we can view the evaluation of a function f at any point x ∈ X as an inner product. Alternatively, k(x, ·) can be viewed as an implicit feature map φ(x) where k(x, x′) = 〈φ(x), φ(x′)〉F . Popular kernel functions on Rn include the Gaussian RBF kernel k(x, x′) = exp(−s ‖x− x′‖2) and the Laplace kernel exp(−s‖x−x′‖). Kernel functions have also been defined on graphs, time series, dynamical systems, images and other structured objects Schölkopf et al. (2004). Thus the methodology presented below can be readily generalized to a diverse range of data types as long as kernel functions are defined."

      "text" : "We begin by providing an overview of kernel embeddings of distributions, which are implicit mappings of distributions into potentially infinite dimensional RKHS. The kernel embedding approach represents a distribution by an element in the RKHS associated with a kernel function Smola et al. (2007); Sriperumbudur et al. (2008),\nµX := EX [φ(X)] = ∫ X φ(x)P(dx), (1)\nwhere the distribution is mapped to its expected feature map, i.e., to a point in a potentially infinitedimensional and implicit feature space. The kernel embedding µX has the property that the expectation of\nany RKHS function f can be evaluated as an inner product in F , EX [f(X)] = 〈µX , f〉F , ∀f ∈ F . Kernel embeddings can be readily generalized to joint distributions of two or more variables using tensor product feature maps. For instance, we can embed a joint distribution of two variables X1 and X2 into a tensor product feature space F × F by\nCX1X2 := EX1X2 [φ(X1)⊗ φ(X2)] (2)\n= ∫ X×X φ(x1)⊗ φ(x2)P(dx1 × dx2), (3)\nwhere the reproducing kernel for the tensor product features satisfies 〈φ(x1)⊗ φ(x2), φ(x′1)⊗ φ(x′2)〉F×F = k(x1, x ′ 1) k(x2, x ′ 2). By analogy, we can also define CX1X2X3 := EX1X2X3 [φ(X1)⊗ φ(X2)⊗ φ(X3)].\nKernel embedding of distributions has rich representational power. The mapping is injective for characteristic kernels Sriperumbudur et al. (2008). That is, if two distributions, P(X) and Q(X), are different, they are mapped to two distinct points in the RKHS. For domain Rd, many commonly used kernels are characteristic, such as the Gaussian RBF kernel and Laplace kernel. This injective property of kernel embeddings has been exploited to design state-of-the-art two-sample tests Gretton et al. (2012) and independence tests Gretton et al. (2008)."

      "text" : "The joint embeddings can also be viewed as an uncentered covariance operator CX1X2 : F 7→ F by the standard equivalence between a tensor product feature and a linear map. That is, given two functions f1, f2 ∈ F , their covariance can be computed by EX1X2 [f1(X1)f2(X2)] = 〈f1, CX1X2f2〉F , or equivalently 〈f1 ⊗ f2, CX1X2〉F×F , where in the former we view CXY as an operator while in the latter we view it as an element in tensor product feature space. By analogy, CX1X2X3 can be regarded as a multi-linear operator from F × F × F to R. It will be clear from the context whether we use CXY as an operator between two spaces or as an element from a tensor product feature space. For generic introduction to tensor and tensor notation, please see Kolda & Bader (2009).\nThe operator CX1X2X3 (with shorthand CX1:3) is linear in each argument (mode) when fixing other arguments. Furthermore, the application of the operator to a set of elements {f1, f2, f3 ∈ F} can be defined using the inner product from the tensor product feature space, i.e.,\nCX1:3 ×1 f1 ×2 ×3f3 := 〈CX1:3 , f1 ⊗ f2 ⊗ f3〉F3\n= EX1X2X3 ∏ i∈[3] 〈φ(Xi), fi〉F  , where ×i means applying fi to the i-th argument of CX1:3 . Furthermore, we can define the Hilbert-Schmidt norm ‖·‖ of CX1:3 as\n‖CX1:3‖ 2 = ∞∑ i1=1 ∞∑ i2=1 ∞∑ i3=1 (CX1:3 ×1 ui1 ×2 ui2 ×3 ui3) 2\nusing three collections of orthonormal bases {ui1} ∞ i1=1 , {ui2} ∞ i2=1 , and {ui3} ∞ i3=1\n.

The joint embedding, CX1X2 , is a 2nd order tensor, and we can essentially use notations and operations for matrices. For instance, we can perform singular value decomposition\nCX1X2 = ∞∑ i=1 σi · ui1 ⊗ ui2 ,\nwhere σi ∈ R are singular values ordered in nonincreasing manner, and {ui1} ∞ i1=1 ⊂ F , {ui2} ∞ i2=1\n⊂ F are singular vectors and orthonormal bases. The rank of CX1X2 is the smallest k such that σi = 0 for i > k."

      "text" : "While we rarely have access to the true underlying distribution, P(X), we can readily estimate its embedding using a finite sample average. Given a sample DX = { x1, . . . , xm } of size m drawn i.i.d. from P(X), the empirical kernel embedding is\nµ̂X := 1\nm ∑m i=1 φ(xi). (4)\nThis empirical estimate converges to its population counterpart in RKHS norm, ‖µ̂X − µX‖F , with a rate of Op(m\n− 12 ) Smola et al. (2007). The covariance operator can be estimated similarly using finite sample average. Given m pairs of training\nexamples DXY = { (xi1, x i 2) } i∈[m] drawn i.i.d. from P(X1, X2),\nĈX1X2 = 1\nm m∑ i=1 φ(xi1)⊗ φ(xi2). (5)\nSimilarly, given sample from distribution P(X1, X2, X3), one can estimate ĈX1:3 = 1m ∑m i=1 φ(x i 1)⊗ φ(xi2)⊗ φ(xi3). By virtue of the kernel trick, most of the computation required for subsequent statistical inference using kernel embeddings can be reduced to the Gram matrix manipulation. The entries in the Gram matrix K correspond to the kernel value between data points xi and xj , i.e., Kij = k(x\ni, xj), and therefore its size is determined by the number of data points in the sample. The size of the Gram matrix is in general much smaller than the dimension of the feature spaces (which can be infinite). This enables efficient nonparametric methods using the kernel embedding representation. If the sample size is large, the computation in kernel embedding methods may be expensive. In this case, a popular solution is to use a low-rank approximation of the Gram matrix, such as incomplete Cholesky factorization Fine & Scheinberg (2001), which is known to work very effectively in reducing computational cost of kernel methods, while maintaining the approximation accuracy."

The conditional independent structure of a multi-view latent variable model is illustrated in Figure 1(a), and many complicated graphical models, such as the hidden Markov model in Figure 1(b), can be reduced to a multi-view latent variable model. For simplicity of exposition, we will explain our method using the model with symmetric view. That is the conditional distribution are the same for each view, i.e., P(X|h) = P(X1|h) = P(X2|h) = P(X3|h).

Allman et al. (2009) showed that, under mild conditions, a finite mixture of nonparametric product distributions is identifiable. The multi-view latent variable model in (12) has the same form as a finite mixture of nonparametric product distribution, and therefore we can adapt Allman’s results to the current setting. Proposition 1 (Identifiability) Let P(X1, X2, X3) be a multi-view latent variable model, such that the conditional distributions {P(X|h)}h∈[k] are linearly independent. Then, the set of parameters { πh, µX|h } h∈[k] are identifiable from CX1X2X3 , up to label swapping of the hidden variable H. Example 1. The probability vector of a discrete variable X ∈ [n], and the joint probability table of two discrete variables X1 ∈ [n] and X2 ∈ [n], are both kernel embeddings. To see this, let the kernel be the Kronecker delta kernel k(x, x′) = δ(x, x′) whose feature map φ(x) is the standard basis of ex in Rn. The x-th dimension of ex is 1 and 0 otherwise. Then\nµX = ( P(x = 1) . . .

Suppose we have a k-component mixture of one dimensional spherical Gaussian distributions. The Gaussian components have identical covariance σ2, but their mean values are distinct. Note that this model is not identifiable under the framework of Hsu & Kakade (2013) since the mean values are just scalars and therefore, rank deficient. However, if we embed the density functions using universal kernels such as Gaussian RBF kernel, it can be shown that the mixture model becomes identifiable. This is because we are working with the entire density function which are linearly independent from each other. Thus, under a non-parametric framework, we can incorporate overcomplete mixtures, where the number of components can exceed the observed dimensionality.\nFinally, we remark that the identifiability result in Proposition 1 can be extended to cases where the conditional distributions do not satisfy linear independence, e.g. Kruskal (1977); De Lathauwer et al. (2007); Anandkumar et al. (2013b). However, in general, it is not tractable to learn such models and we do not consider them here."

More specifically, we explored two\nsettings: 1. Gaussian conditional densities with different variances; 2. Mixture of Gaussian and shifted Gamma conditional densities. The shifted Gamma distribution has density\np(x− µ) = (x− µ) (d−1)e−x/θ\nθdΓ(d) , x ≥ µ\nwhere we chose the shape parameter d ≤ 1 such that density is very skewed. Furthermore, we chose the mean and variance parameters of the Gaussian/Gamma density such that component pair-wise overlap is relatively small according to the Fisher ratio (µ1−µ2) 2\nσ21+σ 2 2\n.\nWe also varied the number of samples m from 50 to 10, 000, and experimented with k = 2, 3, 4 or 8 mixture components. The mixture proportion for the h-th component is set to be πh = 2h k(k+1) , ∀h ∈ [k] (unbalanced). It is worth noting that as k becomes larger, it is more difficult to recover parameters. This is because only a small number of data will be generated for the first several clusters. For every n, k in each setting, we randomly generated 10 sets of samples and reported the average results.\nError measure. We measured the performance of algorithms by the following weighted `2 norm difference\nMSE := k∑ h=1 πh √√√√ m′∑ j=1 (p(xj |h)− p̂(xj |h))2,\nwhere {xj}j∈[m] is a set of uniformly-spaced test points. Results. The results are plotted in Figure 2. It is clear that the kernel spectral method converges rapidly with the data increment in all experiment settings. In the mixture of Gaussians setting, the EM algorithm is best since the model is correctly specified. The spectral learning algorithm for spherical Gaussians does not perform well since the assumption of the method\nis too restricted. The performance of our kernel method converges to that of the EM algorithm. In the mixture of Gaussian and Gamma setting, our kernel spectral algorithm achieves superior results compared to other algorithms. These results demonstrate that our algorithm is able to automatically adapt to the shape of the density.\nWe also plotted the actual recovered conditional densities in Figure 3. The kernel spectral algorithm recovers nicely both the Gaussian and Gamma components, while the EM algorithm fails to fit one component.\nWe also note that the performance of EM degrades as the number of components increases, and our method outperforms EM in higher dimensions. This is the key advantage of our method in that it has favorable performance in higher dimensions, which agrees with the theoretical result in Theorem 2 that the sample complexity depends only quadratically in the number of components, when other parameters are held fixed."

Clustering on the FCM data is a difficult task because the distribution of the data is non-Gaussian and heavily skewed.\nWe used the DLBCL Lymphoma dataset collection from Aghaeepour et al. (2013) to compare our kernel algorithm with multi-view mixture of Gaussian model. This collection contains 30 datasets, and each dataset consists of tens of thousands of cell measurements in 5 dimensions. Each dataset is a separate clustering task, and we fit a multi-view model to each dataset separately and use the maximum-a-posteriori assignment for obtaining the cluster labels. All the cell measurements have been manually labeled, therefore we can evaluate the clustering performance using the f-score.\nWe split the 5 dimensional into three views: dimension 1 and 2 as the first view, 3 and 4 the second and 5 the third view. For each dataset, we select the best kernel bandwidth by 5-fold cross validation using log-likelihood. For EM algorithm for mixture of Gaussians (GMM) with diagonal covariances, we use a very generous 20 restarts. Figure 5 presents the results sorted by the number of clusters. Our method (kernel spectral) outperforms EM-GMM in a majority of datasets. However, there are also datasets where kernel spectral algorithm has a large gap in performance compared to GMM. These are the datasets where the multi-view assumptions are heavily violated. Obtaining improved performance in these datasets will be a subject of our future study where we plan to develop even more robust kernel spectral algorithms."

However, current spectral algorithms are largely restricted to mixtures of discrete or Gaussian distributions. In this paper, we propose a kernel method for learning multi-view latent variable models, allowing each mixture component to be nonparametric. The key idea of the method is to embed the joint distribution of a multi-view latent variable into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and then the latent parameters are recovered using a robust tensor power method. We establish that the sample complexity for the proposed method is quadratic in the number of latent components and is a low order polynomial in the other relevant parameters. Thus, our non-parametric tensor approach to learning latent variable models enjoys good sample and computational efficiencies. Moreover, the non-parametric tensor power method compares favorably to EM algorithm and other existing spectral algorithms in our experiments.",
