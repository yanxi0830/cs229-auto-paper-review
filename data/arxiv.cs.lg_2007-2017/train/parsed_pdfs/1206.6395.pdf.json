      "text" : "This work studies differentially-private statistical estimation, and shows upper and lower bounds on the convergence rates of differentially private approximations to statistical estimators. Our results reveal a formal connection between differential privacy and the notion of Gross Error Sensitivity (GES) in robust statistics, by showing that the convergence rate of any differentially private approximation to an estimator that is accurate over a large class of distributions has to grow with the GES of the estimator. We then provide an upper bound on the convergence rate of a differentially private approximation to an estimator with bounded range and bounded GES. We show that the bounded range condition is necessary if we wish to ensure a strict form of differential privacy."

      "text" : "Differential privacy (Dwork et al., 2006b) is a strong, cryptographically-motivated definition of privacy which has gained significant attention in the machine-learning and data-mining communities over the past few years (McSherry & Mironov, 2009;\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nChaudhuri et al., 2011; Friedman & Schuster, 2010; Mohammed et al., 2011). In differentially private solutions, privacy is guaranteed by ensuring that the participation of a single individual in a database does not change the outcome of a private algorithm by much. This is typically achieved by adding some random noise, either to the sensitive input data, or to the output of some function, such as a classifier, computed on the sensitive data. While this guarantees privacy, for most statistical and machine learning tasks, there is a subsequent loss in statistical efficiency, in terms of the number of samples required to estimate a function to a given degree of accuracy. Thus the main challenge in designing differentially private algorithms is to optimize the privacy-accuracy-sample size trade-off, and a body of literature has been devoted to this goal.\nIn this paper, we focus on differentially-private statistical estimation. We ask: what properties should a statistical estimator have, so that it can be approximated accurately with differential privacy? Privately approximating an estimator based on a functional T that performs well when data is drawn from a specific distribution F is easy: ignore the sensitive data, and output T (F ). Thus the challenge is to design differentially private approximations to estimators that are accurate over a wide range of distributions.\nPrevious work (Smith, 2011) on differentially private statistical estimation shows how to construct differentially private approximations to estimators which have asymptotic normality guarantees under fairly mild conditions. In practical situations, however, we must take into account the effect of a finite number of samples. Moreover, it has been empirically observed (e.g., Chaudhuri et al., 2011; Vu & Slavkovic, 2009) that there is often a significant gap in statistical efficiency between a differentially private estimator and its nonprivate counterpart. Thus there is a need to study finite sample convergence rates for differentially private statistical estimators, in order to characterize the\nproperties that make a statistical estimator amenable to differentially-private approximations.\nIn this paper, we provide upper and lower bounds on the finite sample convergence rates of such estimators. Our first finite sample result draws a connection between differentially private statistical estimators and Gross Error Sensitivity, a measure commonly used in the robust statistics literature (Huber, 1981). The Gross Error Sensitivity (GES) of a statistical functional T at a distribution F is the maximum change in the value of T (F ) by an arbitrarily small perturbation of F by any point mass x in the domain. We provide a lower bound on the convergence rate of any differentially private statistical estimator, showing that an estimator that approximates T (Fn) well with differential privacy over a large class of distributions must have its convergence rate grow with the GES of T .\nA natural question to ask next is whether bounded GES is sufficient for the existence of differentially private estimators that are accurate for large classes of distributions. We next show that at least for αdifferential privacy, this is not the case. Any estimator based on a functional T that takes values in a range of length R and guarantees α-differential privacy for a wide class of distributions, has to have a finite sample convergence rate that grows with increasing R.\nWe then show that bounded range and GES are indeed sufficient for differentially private estimation. In particular, given an estimator based on a functional T which takes values in a bounded range, and has bounded GES for all distributions close to the underlying data distribution F , we show how to compute a differentially private approximation to T (F ) based on sensitive data drawn from F . Our approximation preserves (α, δ)-differential privacy, a relaxation of αdifferential privacy, and is based on the smoothed sensitivity method (Nissim et al., 2007). We provide a finite sample upper bound on the convergence rate of this estimator.\nThe statistical estimators in our upper bounds are computationally inefficient in general. We conclude by providing a separate explicit method for privately approximating M-estimators with certain properties. We prove that these differentially-private estimators enjoy similar privacy and statistical guarantees as those based on the smooth-sensitivity method, while being more efficiently computable.\nRelated Work\nDifferential privacy was proposed by (Dwork et al., 2006b), and has been used since in many works on pri-\nvacy (e.g., Blum et al., 2005; Barak et al., 2007; Nissim et al., 2007; McSherry & Mironov, 2009; Chaudhuri et al., 2011). It has been shown to have strong semantic guarantees (Dwork et al., 2006b) and is resistant to many attacks (Ganta et al., 2008) that succeed against some other definitions of privacy.\nDwork & Lei (2009) is the first work to identify a connection between differential privacy and robust statistics; based on robust statistical estimators as a starting point, they provide differentially private algorithms for several common estimation tasks, including interquartile range, trimmed mean and median, and regression.\nIn further work, Smith (2011) shows how to construct a differentially private approximationAT to certain types of statistical estimators T , and establishes asymptotic normality of his estimator provided certain conditions on T hold. We in contrast focus on finite sample bounds, with an aim towards characterizing the statistical properties of estimators that determine how closely they can be approximated with differential privacy. Lei (2011) considers M-estimation, and provides a simple and elegant differentially-private Mestimator which is statistically consistent.\nFinally, work on the sample requirement of differentially private algorithms include bounds on the accuracy of differentially private data release (Hardt & Talwar, 2010), and the sample complexity of differentially private classification (Chaudhuri & Hsu, 2011)."

      "text" : "The goal of this paper is to examine the conditions under which we can find private approximations to estimators. The notion of privacy we use is differential privacy (Dwork et al., 2006b;a).\nDefinition 1. A (randomized) algorithm A taking values in a range S is (α, δ)-differentially private if for all S ⊆ S, and all data sets D and D′ differing in a single entry,\nPrA[A(D) ∈ S] ≤ eαPrA[A(D′) ∈ S] + δ,\nwhere PrA[·] is the distribution on S induced by the output of A given a data set.\nA (randomized) algorithm A is α-differentially private if it is (α, 0)-differentially private.\nHere α > 0 and δ ∈ [0, 1] are privacy parameters, where smaller α and δ imply stricter privacy.\nA general approach to developing differentially private approximations to functions is to add noise, either to the sensitive data, or to the output of a non-private\nfunction computed on the data. This work explores what properties statistical functionals need to have so that they can be accurately approximated with differential privacy.\nLet F denote the space of probability distributions on a domain X . A statistical functional T : F → R is a real-valued function of a distribution F . The plug-in estimator of θ = T (F ) is given by θn := T (Fn), where Fn is the empirical distribution corresponding to an i.i.d. sample of size n drawn from F .\nA common measure of the robustness of a statistical functional is the influence function, which measures how a functional T (F ) responds to small changes to the input F .\nDefinition 2. The influence function IF(x, T, F ) for a functional T and distribution F at x ∈ X is:\nIF(x, T, F ) = lim ρ→0 T ((1− ρ)F + ρδx)− T (F ) ρ\nwhere δx denotes the point mass distribution at x.\nIt is a well-established result in theoretical statistics (see, e.g, Wasserman, 2006) that if T is Hadamarddifferentiable, and if Ex∼F [IF(x, T, F )2] is bounded, then T (Fn) converges to T (F ) as n→∞.\nA related notion is that of gross error sensitivity, which measures the worst-case value of the influence function for any x ∈ X . Definition 3. The gross error sensitivity GES(T, F ) for a functional T and distribution F is:\nGES(T, F ) = sup x∈X |IF(x, T, F )|.\nWe also define the notions of influence function and gross error sensitivity at a fixed scale ρ > 0:\nIFρ(x, T, F ) := T ((1− ρ)F + ρδx)− T (F )\nρ\nGESρ(T, F ) := sup x∈X |IFρ(x, T, F )|.\nIn this work, the data domain X will be a subset of R. We overload notation and use F to denote a distribution as well as its cumulative distribution function. For two distributions F and G, we use dGC(F,G) := supx∈R |F (x) − G(x)| to denote the Glivenko-Cantelli distance between F and G. For a distribution F from a family F and a radius r > 0, let BGC(F, r) denote the set of distributions G ∈ F such that dGC(F,G) ≤ r. Finally,we use dTV(F,G) to denote the total variantion distance between F and G.\nA statistical functional T is B-robust at F if GES(T, F ) is finite. B-robustness has been studied in the robust statistics literature (Hampel et al., 1986; Huber, 1981), and plug-in estimators for B-robust functionals are considered to be resistant to outliers and changes in the input."

      "text" : "We first show a lower bound on the error of any (α, δ)differentially private approximation to T in terms of the gross error sensitivity of T at a distribution F . Theorem 1. Pick any α ∈ (0, ln 22 ) and δ ∈ (0, α 23 ). Let F be the family of all distributions over X , and let A be any (α, δ)-differentially private algorithm. For all n ∈ N and all F ∈ F , there exists a radius ρ = ρ(n) = 1 n ·d ln 2 2α e and a distribution G ∈ F with dTV(F,G) ≤ ρ, such that either\nEFn∼FEA[|A(Fn)− T (F )|] ≥ ρ\n16 GESρ(T, F ), or\nEGn∼GEA[|A(Gn)− T (G)|] ≥ ρ\n16 GESρ(T, F ).\nSeveral remarks are in order. First of all, the form of Theorem 1 is slightly unconventional in the sense that applies not to particular distributions, but to a set of distributions. In particular, the bound states that either the convergence rate of F is high, or the convergence rate of some G close to F is high. Observe that for a fixed distribution F , it is trivial to construct a differentially private approximation to T (F ) that is accurate for F – ignore any sensitive input data, and simply output T (F ). This algorithm provides a perfectly accurate estimate when the input is drawn from F , but performs poorly otherwise; thus any lower bound that applies to all differentially private algorithms will have a similar form. On the other hand, the differentially private estimators in Theorem 1 have few restrictions: they are only expected to be accurate for distributions lying in a small neighborhood of F , and may be extremely inaccurate in general.\nSecond, for fixed n, ρ is a function ρ(n) = 1n · d ln 22α e, which decreases to zero as n → ∞; provided GESρ(T, F ) remains the same as ρ diminishes, the lower bound grows weaker with increasing n. The lower bound thus does not rule out the existence of consistent private estimators.\nFinally, we observe from the proof of Theorem 1 that F need not be the family of all distributions over X ; the theorem will still apply if for every F ∈ F , and for all x ∈ X , (1 − ρ)F + ρδx also lies in the family F ; for example if F is the set of all discrete distributions over X .\nWhile Theorem 1 is very general, we present below an example that illustrates an implication of the theorem.\nExample 1. Let X = [0, a], and let F be the set of all discrete distributions over X . Let T (F ) be the mean of F .\nCosnider a fixed F ∈ F , and a fixed n. Let ρ = ρ(n) as in Theorem 1. For any F , GESρ(T, F ) ≥ a2 . It can be shown that for any G ∈ BTV(F, ρ(n)), Var [G] ≤ Var [F ] + ρ(1 − ρ)a2. Thus, the expected errors of the (non-private) plug-in estimators are bounded as E[|T (Fn)− T (F )|] ≤ O( √ Var [F ] /n) and E[|T (Gn)−\nT (G)|] ≤ O( √ Var [F ] /n+ √ ρ(1− ρ)a2/n) for all G ∈ BTV(F, ρ(n)). On the other hand, Theorem 1 shows that for every differentially private estimator A, at least one of E[|A(Fn)−T (F )|] and E[|A(Gn)−T (G)|] is Ω(ρa); this quantity is higher than the corresponding quantity for the non-private estimator so long as n ≤ O( a 2\nVar[F ]α2 ).\nProof of Theorem 1. Let x∗ be the x ∈ X that maximizes |IFρ(x, T, F )|. Let γ > 0, and let ρ := 1 nd ln 2 2α e, and let G := (1 − ρ)F + ρδx∗ . Observe that dTV(F,G) ≤ ρ and IFρ(x∗, T, F ) = (T (G)− T (F ))/ρ.\nConsider the following procedure for drawing n samples from G. First, draw a random sample Fn of size n from F (we overload the notation Fn to refer to both a random sample and its empirical distribution). Next, for each i = 1, 2, . . . , n, independently toss a biased coin with heads probability ρ; if the coin turns up heads, replace the i-th element of Fn by x\n∗; otherwise, do nothing. This procedure constructs a random sample Gn of size n from G, and in the process constructs a coupling between samples of size n from F and G. In what follows, we will use this coupling to calculate the quantity\nEFn∼FEA[|A(Fn)−T (F )|]+EGn∼GEA[|A(Gn)−T (G)|].\nLet Fn be any randomly drawn sample of size n from F , and let Gn be a corresponding sample from G as drawn from the coupling procedure. Call a pair (Fn, Gn) ρ-close if they differ in at most ρn entries. As the median of Binomial(n, ρ) is ≤ dρne = ρn, the probability that at most ρn of the elements of Fn are converted to x∗ by the coupling process is at least 1/2.\nIn other words,\nPrGn [(Fn, Gn) is ρ-close] ≥ 1/2. (1)\nFor any ρ-close pair (Fn, Gn), we can apply Lemma 3 1 with the parameters t := T (F ), t′ := T (G), γ := 1/4, and\n∆ := ρn ≤ ( 1 + ln 2\n2α\n) ≤ ln 2\nα = ln 12γ α ;\nthe lemma implies, for any ρ-close pair (Fn, Gn),\nEA[|A(Fn)− T (F )|] + EA[|A(Gn)− T (G)|]\n≥ 1 4 |T (F )− T (G)|.\nTherefore, conditioned on Fn, we have\nEA[|A(Fn)− T (F )|] + EGnEA[|A(Gn)− T (G)||Fn]\n≥ 1 8 |T (F )− T (G)|\nby (1). Taking a final expectation over Fn ∼ F ,\nEFn∼FEA[|A(Fn)−T (F )|]+EGn∼GEA[|A(Gn)−T (G)|]\n≥ 1 8 |T (F )− T (G)| = ρ\n8 |IFρ(x∗, T, F )| =\nρ 8 GESρ(T, F ).\nThe theorem follows."

To prove the theorem, let us assume the contrary:\nEF in,A[|A(F i n)− T (F i)|] ≤ r/4 for all i. (2)\nThis, along with a Markov’s inequality on |A(F in) − T (F i)|, implies that PrF in,A[A(F i n) ∈ Ii] ≥ 1/2.

Rearranging, the inequality becomes Γ ≤ 1 + eαn, which is a contradiction since Γ = b(λ′ − λ)/rc > 1 + eαn. Therefore (2) cannot hold, so the theorem follows."

The algorithm in Rubinstein et al. (2009), and one of the algorithms in Chaudhuri et al. (2011) are based on the sensitivity method, while the main algorithm in Chaudhuri et al. (2011) is based on an objective perturbation method. While both algorithms are computationally efficient, both require explicit regularization. This is problematic in practice because determining the regularization parameter privately through differentially-private parameter-tuning requires extra data – for a more detailed discussion of this issue, see Chaudhuri et al. (2011). In contrast, our algorithm is based on the Exponential Mechanism, and does not have an explicit regularization parameter; instead we assume that Ψ′ is smooth, and our guarantees depend on the value of the derivative Ψ′(F, Tψ(F )).\n5.2.

This estimator is derived from the exponential mechanism of McSherry & Talwar (2007), where the “cost” function is taken to be |Ψ(Fn, ·)|/K. In many M - estimators of interest, particularly those involving data lying in a bounded range, a prior knowledge of K is reasonable.\nIf it is known that Tψ(F ) is contained in some interval, then one can take the prior density µ to be uniform over this interval. If no such prior knowledge is available, then µ can be taken to be a density with full support on R such as the standard Cauchy density.\nThe privacy guarantee for Aψ,µ follows easily from known properties of the exponential mechanism (McSherry & Talwar, 2007).\nProposition 3. Aψ,µ is (α, 0)-differentially private.\nThe accuracy guarantee forAψ,µ relies on the following smoothness condition on Ψ at F .\nCondition 4 (Smoothness).

Assume Condition 3 and Condition 4 hold. Let ε1 := min{r1, |Ψ′(F, Tψ(F ))|/(6Λ1)}, ε2 := min{r2/2, |Ψ′(F, Tψ(F ))|/(6Λ2)}, and Γ := K/|Ψ′(F, Tψ(F ))|. Pick any η ∈ (0, 1) and ε ∈ (0, ε2). Suppose\nn ≥ max { ln(2/η)\n2ε21 , Nε2,η\n} , (5)\nand one of the following holds:\n1. the range of Tψ is contained in an interval I of length R, µ is the uniform density on I, and\nn ≥ 8 ln(6R/(εη)) αε · Γ;\n2. µ(θ) = 1π (1 + θ 2)−1 is the standard Cauchy den-\nsity, and n ≥ 8 αε · ln ( π η ( 2(|Tψ(F )|+ ε2)2 + 1 ε/3 + ε 6 )) · Γ.\nWith probability at least 1 − 3η, the estimator Aψ,µ satisfies\n|Aψ,µ(Fn)− Tψ(F )| ≤ |Tψ(Fn)− Tψ(F )|+ ε.\nThe proof of Theorem 4 is in Appendix D. The condition in (5) required by Theorem 4 essentially states that the sample size n should be large enough for Fn and Tψ(Fn) to be in the neighborhoods of F and Tψ(F ), respectively, where Ψ\n′ is locally Lipschitzsmooth.\nIt is straightforward to generalize the results to other prior densities µ. Observe that in the case the range of Tψ is [−R,R] for some unknown R, using the standard Cauchy density as µ yields a similar dependence on R (via log |Tψ(F )| ≤ logR) as what is obtained when µ is uniform over [−R,R]. The more probability mass µ assigns around Tψ(F ), the better the bounds are.\nAlso note that the main scaling factor of Γ = K/|Ψ′(F, Tψ(F ))| in the sample size bound is precisely the bound on GES(Tψ, F ) from (4). A dependence on GES(Tψ, F ) is to be expected as per Theorem 1."

      "text" : "The finite sample analysis reveals a concrete connection between differential privacy and robust statistics, The main results shown here suggest using Brobustness as a criterion for designing differentiallyprivate statistical estimators, and also highlight the obstacles that even robust estimators face when the parameter space is very large or unbounded.\nWhile our lower bounds may seem pessimistic, they apply to estimators that succeed for a wide class of distributions. One way of avoiding our lower bounds would be by using priors that allow an estimator to perform well on some input distributions but not-sowell on others; a future research direction is to investigate how this can help design better differentially private estimators.\nAcknowledgements.

Differentially private solutions enforce privacy by adding random noise to a function computed over the data, and the challenge in designing such algorithms is to control the added noise in order to optimize the privacyaccuracy-sample size tradeoff. This work studies differentially-private statistical estimation, and shows upper and lower bounds on the convergence rates of differentially private approximations to statistical estimators. Our results reveal a formal connection between differential privacy and the notion of Gross Error Sensitivity (GES) in robust statistics, by showing that the convergence rate of any differentially private approximation to an estimator that is accurate over a large class of distributions has to grow with the GES of the estimator. We then provide an upper bound on the convergence rate of a differentially private approximation to an estimator with bounded range and bounded GES. We show that the bounded range condition is necessary if we wish to ensure a strict form of differential privacy.",
