      "text" : "ering using subsampling when clustering large data sets (large data bases).\nIndex Terms— k-means++; consistency; expected value; constant factor approximation; k-means cost function\n1 Introduction\nThe common sense feeling about data mining algorithms is that with increasing sample sizes the tasks should become conceptually easier though more though computationally.\nOne of these areas is surely the cluster analysis. A popular clustering algorithm, k-means, shall be studied in this research with respect to its behaviour ”in the limit”. It essentially strives to minimise the partition quality function (called also ”partition cost function”)\nJ(U,M) = m∑ i=1 k∑ j=1 uij‖xi − µj‖2 (1)\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n06 12\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n0 Fe\nwhere xi, i = 1, . . . ,m are the data points, M is the matrix of cluster centres µj, j = 1, . . . , k, and U is the cluster membership indicator matrix, consisting of entries uij, where uij is equal 1 if among all of cluster centres µj is the closest to xi, and is 0 otherwise.\nk-means comes in various variants, most of them differing by the way how the initial hypothetical cluster centres are found. We will concentrate on the so-called k-means++, where the initialisation is driven by candidate probability of being selected proportional to squared distances to the closest cluster centre candidate selected earlier. This distinguishes it from the basic version, called here k-means-random, where the initial candidates are selected randomly with uniform probability distribution over data set. Both are described in detail in the paper [3] by Arthur and Vassilvitskii.\nIn Figure 1 you see the results of clustering for data from a relatively easy probability distribution of 16 identical clusters arranged uniformly in 4 rows of 4 clusters. In Figure 2 you see the results of clustering for exactly the same data samples. It is immediately visible, that even in simple cases the algorithms, for small samples, do not return clusters identical with those for the ”in the limit” distribution. In particular, k-means-random behaves poorly even for quite large samples (of 33000 data points). k-means++ seems\nto stabilize with sample size, but over multiple repetitions bad cluster split can occur.\nThe behaviour ”in the limit” is of practical relevance, as some researchers, especially in the realm of database mining, propose to cluster ”sufficiently large” samples instead of the whole database content. See for example Bejarano et al. [6] on k-means accelerating via subsampling.\nFor these reasons Pollard [9] investigated already in 1981 the “in the limit” behaviour of k-means, while MacQueen [7] considered it already in 1967.\nThe essential problem consists in the question whether or not we can expect that the cost function value from equation (1), and hence the ”best clustering”, of the population can be approximated by the results of clustering samples (of increasing sizes).\nRegrettably, researchers considered in the past an unrealistic version of k-means, that we shall call here ”k-means-ideal”, that is able to find the minimum of (1) for a sample which is NP -hard. This tells nothing about the real-world algorithms, like k-means-random or k-means++, because they are not guaranteed to approach this optimum in any way. In fact, no results for k-means-random are known even for constant factor approximations to\nsample optimal value. So far, only for k-means++ we have this kind of approximation provided by Arthur and Vassilvitskii [3] .\nThe constant factor approximation for a sample does not guarantee the existence of the constant factor approximation of optimal cost function value for the population as the limit of sample constant factor approximations, because the whole proof of in the limit behaviour of k-means-ideal by Pollard relies on the assumption of the existence of unique optimal solution. No direct transposition is possible to any constant factor approximation because there exist potentially infinite many constant factor approximation hence also as many constant factor approximating partitions.\nSo in this paper we address the issue whether or not it is possible to get a constant factor approximation clustering of the population as a limit of constant factor approximation partitions of the samples with increasing sample sizes.\n2 Previous work\nArthur and Vassilvitskii [3] proved the following property of their k-means++ algorithm.\nTheorem 1. [3] The expected value of the partition cost, computed according to equation (1), is delimited in case of k-means++ algorithm by the inequality\nE(J) ≤ 8(ln k + 2)Jopt (2)\nwhere Jopt denotes the optimal value of the partition cost.\n(For k = 3 this amounts to more than 24). Note that the proof in [3] refers to the initialisation step of the algorithm only so that subsequently we assume that k-means++ clustering consists solely of this initialisation. In the full algorithm E(J) is lower than after initialisation step only.\nThere exist a number of other constant factor approximation algorithms for k-means objective beside [3]. But they either decrease the constant below 8(ln k+2) at the expense of an excessive complexity, still with constant factor above 9 [1], by restricting to well-separated cases [10], or by approximating the cost function of k-means with k+l-means, where l is a quite large number, see e.g. the paper [2]. Still most of them rely on the basic approach of [3]. Other approaches, like that of [5], assume that all the near optimal partitions lie close to the optimal solution without actually proving it.\nAll this research attempts to annihilate the fundamental problem behind the k-means-random, namely, as [3] states: ”It is the speed and simplicity\nof the k-means[-random] method that make it appealing, not its accuracy. Indeed, there are many natural examples for which the algorithm generates arbitrarily bad clusterings (i.e., J\nJopt is unbounded even when m and k are\nfixed).” While the aforementioned research direction attempts to improve samplebased cost function results for k-means, there existed and exists interest in strong consistency results concerning variants of k-means algorithm, aiming at proving properties achieved with increasing sample size. Pollard [9] proved an interesting property of a hypothetical k-means-ideal algorithm that would produce a partition yielding Jopt for finite sample. He demonstrated, under assumption of a unique global optimum, the convergence of k-means-ideal algorithm to proper population clustering with increasing sample size. So one can state that such an algorithm would be strongly consistent. MacQueen [7] considered a k-means-ideal algorithm under the settings where there exists no unique clustering reaching the minimum of the cost function for the population. Hence k-means-ideal may be unstable for the sequence of samples of increasing size. Terada [11] considered a version of k-means called ”reduced” k-means which seeks a lower dimensional subspace in which k-means can be applied. He again assumes that a k-means-ideal version is available when carrying out his investigations. The problem of the k-means-ideal algorithm is that it is NP -hard [9], even in 2D [8]).\nIn summary, in the mentioned works an abstract global optimiser is referred to rather than an actual practically used algorithm.\nTherefore in this research we study the in the limit behaviour of the realistic k-means++ algorithm. Though it is slow compared to k-meansrandom, various accelerations have been proposed, e.g. [4], hence it is with studying.\n3 In the limit behaviour of k-means++\nSo let us investigate whether or not a realistic algorithm, k-means++, featured by reasonable complexity and reasonable expectation of closeness to optimality, is also in some sense strongly consistent.\nIn what follows we extend the results of Pollard.\n3.1 Notation and assumption\nAssume that we are drawing independent samples of size m = k, k + 1, . . . . from some probability distribution P . Assume further, that the number of disjoint balls of radius b for some b > 0 with non-zero P measure is much\nlarger than k. Furthermore let∫ ‖x‖2(k+1)P (dx)\nbe finite. Given a sample consisting of xi, i = 1, . . . ,m, it will be convenient to consider an empirical probability distribution Pm assigning a probability mass of m−1 at each of the sample points xi. Let further M denote any set of up to k points (serving as an arbitrary set of cluster centres).\nLet us introduce the function Jcp(., .), that for any set M of points in Rn and any probability distribution Q over Rn, computes k-means quality function normalised over the probability distribution:\nJcp(M,Q) =\n∫ D(x,M)2Q(dx) (3)\nwhere D(x,M) = minµ∈M ‖x− µ‖. Then Jcp(M,Pm) can be seen as a version of the function J() from equation (1). Note that for any sets M.M ′ such that M ⊂ M ′ we have Jcp(M,Q) ≥ Jcp(M ′, Q).\nNote also that if M has been obtained via the initialisation step of kmeans++, then the elements of M can be considered as ordered, so we could use indexes M[p:q] meaning elements µp, . . . ,µq from this sequence. As the cluster around M[k] will contain at least one element (µk itself), we can be sure that Jcp(M[1:k−1], Pm) > Jcp(M[1:k], Pm) as no element has a chance to be selected twice. Hence also EM(Jcp(M[1:k−1], Pm)) > EM(Jcp(M[1:k], Pm)).\n3.2 Main result\nIf we assume that the distribution P is continuous, then for the expectation over all possible M obtained from initialisation procedure of k-means++, for any j = 2, · · · k the relationship EM(Jcp(M[1:j−1], P )) > EM(Jcp(M[1:j], P )) holds. The reason is as follows: The last point, µk, was selected from a point of non-zero density, so that in ball of radius b > 0 ( b lower than 1/3 of the distance of µj to each µ ∈ M[1:j−1]) around it would be re-clustered to µj diminishing the overall within-cluster variance. As it holds for each set M , so it holds for the expected value too. But our goal here is to show that if we pick the sets M according to kmeans++ (initialization) algorithm, then EM(Jcp(M,Pm))→m→∞ EM(Jcp(M,P )), and, as a consequence, EM(Jcp(M,P )) ≤ 8(ln k + 2)J.,opt.\nWe show this below. Let Tm,k denote the probability distribution for choosing the set M as cluster centres for a sample from Pm using k-means++ algorithm. From the k-means++ algorithm we know that the probability of choosing µj given µ ∈M[1:j−1] have already been picked amounts to Prob(µj|M[1:j−1]) =\nD(µj ,M[1:j−1]) 2∫\nD(x,M[1:j−1])2Pm(dx) . whereas the point µ1 is picked according to the probability distribution Pm. Obviously , the probability of selecting the set M amounts to:\nProb(M) = Prob(µ1) ·Prob(µ2|M[1]) ·Prob(µ3|M[1:2]) · · · · ·Prob(µk|M[1:k−1])\n. So the probability density Tm,k may be expressed as\nPm(µ1) · k∏ j=2 D(µj,M[1:j−1]) 2∫ D(x,M[1:j−1])2Pm(d x)\nFor P we get accordingly the Tk distribution. Now assume we ignore with probability of at most δ > 0 a “distant” part of the potential locations of cluster centres from Tk via a procedure described below. Denote withMδ the subdomain of the set of cluster centres left after ignoring these elements. Instead of expectation of\nEM(Jcp(M,Pm)) = ∫ Jcp(M,Pm)Tm,k(dM)\nwe will be interested in EM,δ(Jcp(M,Pm)) = ∫ M∈Mδ Jcp(M,Pm)Tm,k(dM)\nand respectively for P instead of EM(Jcp(M,P )) = ∫ Jcp(M,P )Tk(dM)\nwe want to consider EM,δ(Jcp(M,P )) = ∫ M∈Mδ Jcp(M,P )Tk(dM)\nEM(Jcp(M,P )) is apparently finite. Let us concentrate on the difference |EM,δ(Jcp(M,P ))−EM,δ(Jcp(M,Pm))| and show that it converges to 0 when m is increased for a fixed δ, that is\nfor any and δ there exists such an mδ, that for any larger m almost surely (a.s.) this difference is lower than . Thus by decreasing δ and we find that the expectation on Pm converges to that on P .\nThe subdomain selection (ignoring δ share of probability mass of Tm) shall proceed as follows. Let R1 be a radius such that ∫ ‖x‖>R1 ‖x‖\n2P (dx) < δ/k. We reject all M such that ‖µ1‖ > R1.\nLet us denote Jm,opt = minM Jcp(M,Pm), J.,opt = minM Jcp(M,P ), where M is a set of cardinality at most k. Let us denote Jm,opt,j = minM Jcp(M,Pm), J.,opt,j = minM Jcp(M,P ), where M be a set of cardinality at most j, j = 1, . . . , k.\nNow observe for l = 2, . . . , k that∫ µ1 · · · ∫ µl l∏ j=2 D(µj,M[1:j−1]) 2∫ D(x,M[1 : j − 1])2P (d x) P (dµl) . . .

Upon repeating this process for l = 2, . . . , k, we will reject at most δ share of potential sets of centres under Tk.\nSo let us consider\n|EM,δ(Jcp(M,P ))− EM,δ(Jcp(M,Pm))| = | ∫ M∈Mδ Jcp(M,Pm)Tm,k(dM)− ∫ M∈Mδ Jcp(M,P )Tk(dM)|\n= | ∫ M∈Mδ Jcp(M,Pm) k∏ j=2 D(µj,M[1:j−1]) 2∫ D(x,M[1:j−1]2Pm(d x) Pm(dµk) . . .

P (dµ1)|\nThe first summand, the product of an opt and a finite quantity, can be set as low as needed by choosing a sufficiently low opt.\nNow following Pollard, we will decrease as much as required the second summand.\nSo select a finite set Tβ of points from Mδ such that each element of Mδ lies within a distance of β from a point of Tβ.\nLet us define the function gM(x) = D(x,M)2 ∏k j=2D(µj,M[1:j−1]) 2.\nLet us introduce also D(x,M) and D(x,M) as follows: M∗ be the set of elements from Tβ such that ‖µj −M∗[j]‖ is less than β . then D(x,M) = D(x,M∗) + β, D(x,M) = max(D(x,M∗)− β, 0). Now define the function\ng M (x) = D(x,M)2 k∏ j=2 D(µj,M[1:j−1]) 2\nand\ngM(x) = D(x,M) 2 k∏ j=2 D(µj,M[1:j−1]) 2\nAs ‖x,M∗[j]‖ − β ≤ ‖x − µj| ≤ ‖x,M∗[j]‖ + β, it is easily seen that D(x,M) ≤ D(x,M) ≤ D(x,M) and hence g\nM (x) ≤ gM(x) ≤ gM(x).\nTherefore\n| ∫ M∈Mδ ∫ x gM(x)P (dx)P (dµk) . . .

P (dµ1)|)\nA sufficient increase on m will make the second summand as small as we like. We will show below that using an argument similar to Pollard, one can show that the first summand can be diminished as much as we like to by appropriate choice of β. Hence the restricted expectation can be shown to converge as claimed.\nFor any R∫ M∈Mδ ∫ x (gM(x)− gM(x))P (dx)P (dµk) . . . P (dµ1\n= ∫ M∈Mδ ∫ ‖x||≤R (gM(x)− gM(x))P (dx)P (dµk) . . .

The first summand can be transformed∫\nM∈Mδ\n∫ ‖x||≤R (gM(x)− gM(x))P (dx)P (dµk) . . . P (dµ1)\n≤ ∫ M∈Mδ ∫ ‖x||≤R σhM(x)P (dx)P (dµk) . . . P (dµ1)\nwhere hM(x) is a function of x and M . As both x and elements of M are of bounded length, hM(x) is limited from above. Hence this summand can be decreased to the desired value by appropriate choice of (small) σ.\nTherefore the whole term can be decreased to a desired value (above zero of course), what we had to prove.\nHence our claim about consistency of k-means++ has been proven.\n4 Conclusions\nWe have shown that the expected value of the realistic k-means++ algorithm for finite sample converges towards the expected value of the realistic k-means++ algorithm for the population, when the sample size increases. Together with Pollard’s results about convergence of k-means-ideal and the properties proved by Arthur and Vassilvitskii for k-means++ on finite samples we know now that k-means++ provides in expectation also with constant factor approximation of the population optimal k-means cost function.\nUnderway we have also shown that the sample based centre group distribution comes close to that of the population distribution so that the partitions of samples yielding constant approximations of k-means cost function come close to partitions yielding constant approximations for the entire population.\nReferences\n[1] In 18th Annual ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry (SoCG’02), June 2002, Barcelona, Spain.\n[2] A simple linear time approximation algorithm for geometric k-means problem in any dimension ,author = A.
