      "text" : "Regularization is a fundamental and incisive method in optimization, its present zeitgeist and its entry into machine learning. Through the introduction of a new component in the objective, regularization techniques overcome ill-conditioning and overfitting, and they yield algorithms that achieve sparsity and parsimony without sacrificing efficiency [2, 5, 8].\nIn the context of online optimization, these features are exemplified in the family of learning algorithms known as “Follow the Regularized Leader” (FoReL) [41]. FoReL represents an important archetype of adaptive behavior for several reasons: it provides optimal min-max regret guarantees (O(t−1/2) in an adversarial setting), it offers significant flexibility with respect to the geometry of the problem at hand, and it captures numerous other dynamics as special cases (hedge, multiplicative weights, gradient descent, etc.) [2, 8, 15]. As such, given that these regret guarantees hold without any further assumptions about how payoffs/costs are determined at each stage, the dynamics of FoReL have been the object of intense scrutiny and study in algorithmic game theory.\nThe standard way of analyzing such no-regret dynamics in games involves a two-step approach. The first step exploits the fact that the empirical frequency of\n∗ Univ. Grenoble Alpes, CNRS, Inria, LIG, F-38000 Grenoble, France. § UC Berkeley. ‡ Singapore University of Technology and Design.

The second involves proving some useful property of the game’s CCE: For instance, leveraging (λ, µ)-robustness [33] implies that the social welfare at a CCE lies within a small constant of the optimum social welfare; as another example, the product of the marginal distributions of CCE in zero-sum games is Nash. In this way, the no-regret properties of FoReL can be turned into convergence guarantees for the players’ empirical frequency of play (that is, in a time-averaged, correlated sense).\nRecently, several papers have moved beyond this “black-box” framework and focused instead on obtaining stronger regret/convergence guarantees for systems of learning algorithms coupled together in games with a specific structure. Along these lines, Daskalakis et al. [9] and Rakhlin and Sridharan [31] developed classes of dynamics that enjoy a O(log t/t) regret minimization rate in two-player zerosum games. Syrgkanis et al. [43] further analyzed a recency biased variant of FoReL in more general multi-player games and showed that it is possible to achieve an O(t−3/4) regret minimization rate. The social welfare converges at a rate of O(t−1), a result which was extended to standard versions of FoReL dynamics in [11].\nWhilst a regret-based analysis provides significant insights about these systems, it does not answer a fundamental behavioral question:\nDoes the system converge to a Nash equilibrium? Does it even stabilize?\nThe dichotomy between a self-stabilizing, convergent system and a system with recurrent cycles is of obvious significance, but a regret-based analysis cannot distinguish between the two. Indeed, convergent, recurrent, and even chaotic [26] systems may exhibit equally strong regret minimization properties in general games, so the question remains: What does the long-run behavior of FoReL look like, really?\nThis question becomes particularly interesting and important under perfect competition (such as zero-sum games and variants thereof). Especially in practice, zero-sum games can capture optimization “duels” [18]: for example, two Internet search engines competing to maximize their market share can be modeled as players in a zero-sum game with a convex strategy space. In [18] it was shown that the time-average of a regret-minimizing class of dynamics converges to an approximate equilibrium of the game. Finally, zero-sum games have also been used quite recently as a model for deep learning optimization techniques in image generation and discrimination [14, 39].\nIn each of the above cases, min-max strategies are typically thought of as the axiomatically correct prediction. The fact that the time average of the marginals of a FoReL procedure converges to such states is considered as further evidence of the correctness of this prediction. However, the long-run behavior of the actual sequence of play (as opposed to its time-averages) seems to be trickier, and a number of natural questions arise:\n- Does optimization-driven learning converge under perfect competition? - Does fast regret minimization necessarily imply (fast) equilibration in this case?\nOur results. We settle these questions with a resounding “no”. Specifically, we show that the behavior of FoReL in zero-sum games with an interior equilibrium\n(e.g. Matching Pennies) is Poincaré recurrent, implying that almost every trajectory revisits any (arbitrarily small) neighborhood of its starting point infinitely often. Importantly, the observed cycling behavior is robust to the agents’ choice of regularization mechanism (each agent could be using a different regularizer), and it applies to any positive affine transformation of zero-sum games (and hence all strictly competitive games [1]) even though these transformations lead to different trajectories of play. Finally, this cycling behavior also persists in the case of networked competition, i.e. for constant-sum polymatrix games [6, 7, 10].\nGiven that the no-regret guarantees of FoReL require a decreasing step-size (or learning rate),1 we focus on a smooth version of FoReL described by a dynamical system in continuous time. The resulting FoReL dynamics enjoy a particularly strong O(t−1) regret minimization rate and they capture as a special case the replicator dynamics [38, 44, 45] and the projection dynamics [12, 24, 36], arguably the most widely studied game dynamics in biology, evolutionary game theory and transportation science [16, 35, 48]. In this way, our analysis unifies and generalizes many prior results on the cycling behavior of evolutionary dynamics [16, 28, 29, 37] and it provides a new interpretation of these results through the lens of optimization and machine learning.\nFrom a technical point of view, our analysis touches on several issues. Our first insight is to focus not on the simplex of the players’ mixed strategies, but on a dual space of payoff differences. The reason for this is that the vector of cumulative payoff differences between two strategies fully determines a player’s mixed strategy under FoReL, and it is precisely these differences that ultimately drive the players’ learning process. Under this transformation, FoReL exhibits a striking property,\n1A standard trick is to decrease step-sizes by a constant factor after a window of “doubling” length [40].\nincompressibility : the flow of the dynamics is volume-preserving, so a ball of initial conditions in this dual space can never collapse to a point.\nThat being said, the evolution of such a ball in the space of payoffs could be transient, implying in particular that the players’ mixed strategies could converge (because the choice map that links payoff differences to strategies is nonlinear). To rule out such behaviors, we show that FoReL in zero-sum games with an interior Nash equilibrium has a further important property: it admits a constant of motion. Specifically, if x∗ = (x∗i )i∈N is an interior equilibrium of the game and yi is an arbitrary point in the payoff space of player i, this constant is given by the coupling function\nG(y) = ∑ i∈N [h∗i (yi)− 〈yi, x∗i 〉],\nwhere h∗i (yi) = maxxi{〈yi, xi〉 − hi(xi)} is the convex conjugate of the regularizer hi that generates the learning process of player i (for the details, see Sections 3 and 4). Coupled with the dynamics’ incompressibility, this invariance can be used to show that FoReL is recurrent : after some finite time, almost every trajectory returns arbitrarily close to its initial state.\nOn the other hand, if the game does not admit an interior equilibrium, the coupling above is no longer a constant of motion. In this case, G decreases over time until the support of the players’ mixed strategies matches that of a Nash equilibrium with maximal support: as this point in time is approached, G essentially becomes a constant. Thus, in general zero-sum games, FoReL wanders perpetually in the smallest face of the game’s strategy space containing all of the game’s equilibria; indeed, the only possibility that FoReL converges is if the game admits a unique Nash equilibrium in pure strategies – a fairly restrictive requirement."

      "heading" : "2. Definitions from game theory",
      "text" : "2.1. Games in normal form. We begin with some basic definitions from game theory. A finite game in normal form consists of a finite set of players N = {1, . . . , N}, each with a finite set of actions (or strategies) Ai. The preferences of player i for one action over another are determined by an associated payoff function ui : A ≡ ∏ iAi → R which assigns a reward ui(αi;α−i) to player i ∈ N under the strategy profile (αi;α−i) of all players’ actions.2 Putting all this together, a game in normal form will be written as a tuple Γ ≡ Γ(N ,A, u) with players, actions and payoffs defined as above.\nPlayers can also use mixed strategies, i.e. mixed probability distributions xi = (xiαi)αi∈Ai ∈ ∆(Ai) over their action sets Ai. The resulting probability vector xi is called a mixed strategy and we write Xi = ∆(Ai) for the mixed strategy space of player i. Aggregating over players, we also write X = ∏ i Xi for the game’s strategy space, i.e. the space of all strategy profiles x = (xi)i∈N . In this context (and in a slight abuse of notation), the expected payoff of the i-th player in the profile x = (x1, . . . , xN ) is\nui(x) = ∑ α1∈A1 · · · ∑ αN∈AN ui(α1, . . . , αN )x1α1 · · ·xNαN . (2.1)\nTo keep track of the payoff of each pure strategy, we also write viαi(x) = ui(αi;x−i) for the payoff of strategy αi ∈ Ai under the profile x ∈ X and vi(x) = (viαi(x))αi∈Ai\n2In the above, we use the standard shorthand (βi;α−i) for the profile (α1, . . . , βi, . . . , αN ).\nfor the resulting payoff vector of player i. We then have ui(x) = 〈vi(x), xi〉 = ∑ αi∈Ai xiαiviαi(x), (2.2)\nwhere 〈v, x〉 ≡ v>x denotes the ordinary pairing between v and x. The most widely used solution concept in game theory is that of a Nash equilibrium (NE), defined here as a mixed strategy profile x∗ ∈ X such that\nui(x ∗ i ;x ∗ −i) ≥ ui(xi;x∗−i) (NE)\nfor every deviation xi ∈ Xi of player i and all i ∈ N . Writing supp(x∗i ) = {αi ∈ Ai : x∗i > 0} for the support of x∗i ∈ Xi, a Nash equilibrium x∗ ∈ X is called pure if supp(x∗i ) = {α∗i } for some α∗i ∈ Ai and all i ∈ N . At the other end of the spectrum, x∗ is said to be interior (or fully mixed) if supp(x∗i ) = Ai for all i ∈ N . Finally, a coarse correlated equilibrium (CCE) is a distribution π over the set of action profiles A ≡ ∏ iAi such that, for every player i ∈ N and every\naction βi ∈ Ai, we have ∑ α∈A vi(α)π(α) ≥ ∑ α−i∈A−i vi(βi, α−i)πi(α−i), where\nπi(α−i) = ∑ αi∈αi π(αi, α−i) is the marginal distribution of π with respect to i.\n2.2. Zero-sum games and zero-sum polymatrix games. Perhaps the most widely studied class of finite games (and certainly the first to be considered) is that of 2- player zero-sum games, i.e. when N = {1, 2} and u1 = −u2. Letting u ≡ u1 = −u2, the value of a 2-player zero-sum game Γ is defined as\nuΓ = max x1∈X1 min x2∈X2 u(x1, x2) = min x2∈X2 max x1∈X1 u(x1, x2), (2.3)\nwith equality following from von Neumann’s celebrated min-max theorem [47]. As is well known, the solutions of this saddle-point problem form a closed, convex set consisting precisely of the game’s Nash equilibria; moreover, the players’ equilibrium payoffs are simply uΓ and −uΓ respectively. As a result, Nash equilibrium is the standard game-theoretic prediction in such games.\nAn important question that arises here is whether the straightforward equilibrium structure of zero-sum games extends to the case of a network of competitors. Following [6, 7, 10], an N -player pairwise zero-/constant-sum polymatrix game consists of an (undirected) interaction graph G ≡ G(N , E) whose set of nodes N represents the competing players, with two nodes i, j ∈ N connected by an edge e = (i, j) in E if and only if the corresponding players compete with each other in a two-player zero-/constant-sum game.\nTo formalize this, we assume that a) every player has a finite set of actions Ai (as before); and b) to each edge e = {i, j} ∈ E is associated a two-player game zero-/constant-sum Γe with player set Ne = {i, j}, action sets Ai and Aj , and payoff functions uij = γ{i,j} − uji : Ai ×Aj → R respectively.3 The space of mixed strategies of player i is again Xi = ∆(Ai), but the player’s payoff is now determined by aggregating over all games involving player i, i.e.\nui(x) = ∑ j∈Ni uij(xi, xj), (2.4)\n3In a zero-sum game, we have γ{i,j} = 0 by default. Since the underlying interaction graph is assumed undirected, we also assume that the labeling of the players’ payoff functions is symmetric. At the expense of concision, our analysis extends to directed graphs, but we stick with the undirected case for clarity.\nwhere Ni = {j ∈ N : {i, j} ∈ E} denotes the set of “neighbors” of player i. In other words, the payoff to player i is simply the the sum of all payoffs in the zero/constant-sum games that player i plays with their neighbors.\nIn what follows, we will also consider games which are payoff-equivalent to positive-affine transformations of pairwise constant-sum polymatrix games. Formally, we will allow for games Γ such that there exists a pairwise constant-sum polymatrix game Γ′ and constants ai > 0 and bi ∈ R for each player i such that uΓi (α) = aiu Γ′ i (α) + bi for each outcome α ∈ A."

      "heading" : "3. No-regret learning via regularization",
      "text" : "Throughout this paper, our focus will be on repeated decision making in lowinformation environments where the players don’t know the rules of the game (perhaps not even that they are playing a game). In this case, even if the game admits a unique Nash equilibrium, it is not reasonable to assume that players are able to pre-compute their component of an equilibrium strategy – let alone assume that all players are fully rational, that there is common knowledge of rationality, etc.\nWith this in mind, we only make the bare-bones assumption that every player seeks to at least minimize their “regret”, i.e. the average payoff difference between a player’s mixed strategy at time t ≥ 0 and the player’s best possible strategy in hindsight. Formally, assuming that play evolves in continuous time, the regret of player i along the sequence of play x(t) is defined as\nRegi(t) = max pi∈Xi\n1\nt ∫ t 0 [ui(pi;x−i(s))− ui(x(s))] ds, (3.1)\nand we say that player i has no regret under x(t) if lim supt→∞Regi(t) ≤ 0. The most widely used scheme to achieve this worst-case guarantee is known as “Follow the Regularized Leader” (FoReL), an exploitation-exploration class of policies that consists of playing a mixed strategy that maximizes the player’s expected cumulative payoff (the exploitation part) minus a regularization term (exploration). In our continuous-time framework, this is described by the learning dynamics\nyi(t) = yi(0) + ∫ t 0 vi(x(s)) ds,\nxi(t) = Qi(yi(t)),\n(FoReL)\nwhere the so-called choice map Qi : RAi → Xi is defined as Qi(yi) = arg max\nxi∈Xi {〈yi, xi〉 − hi(xi)}. (3.2)\nIn the above, the regularizer function hi : Xi → R is a convex penalty term which smoothens the “hard” arg max correspondence yi 7→ arg maxxi∈Xi〈yi, xi〉 that maximizes the player’s cumulative payoff over [0, t]. As a result, the “regularized leader” Qi(yi) = arg maxxi∈Xi{〈yi, xi〉 − hi(xi)} is biased towards the prox-center pi = arg minxi∈Xi hi(xi) of Xi. For most common regularizers, the prox-center is interior (and usually coincides with the barycenter of X ), so the regularization in (3.2) encourages exploration by favoring mixed strategies with full support.\nIn Appendix A, we present in detail two of the prototypical examples of (FoReL): i) the multiplicative weights (MW) dynamics induced by the entropic regularizer function hi(x) = ∑ αi∈Ai xiαi log xiαi (which lead to the replicator dynamics of evolutionary game theory); and ii) the projection dynamics induced by the Euclidean\nregularizer hi(x) = 12‖xi‖ 2. For concreteness, we will assume in what follows that the regularizer of every player i ∈ N satisfies the following minimal requirements: (1) hi is continuous and strictly convex on Xi. (2) hi is smooth on the relative interior of every face of Xi (including Xi itself).\nUnder these basic assumptions, the “regularized leader” Qi(yi) is well-defined in the sense that (3.2) admits a unique solution. More importantly, we have the following no-regret guarantee:\nTheorem 3.1. A player following (FoReL) enjoys an O(1/t) regret bound, no matter what other players do. Specifically, if player i ∈ N follows (FoReL), then, for every continuous trajectory of play x−i(t) of the opponents of player i, we have\nRegi(t) ≤ Ωi t , (3.3)\nwhere Ωi = maxhi −minhi is a positive constant.\nTo streamline our discussion, we relegate the proof of Theorem 3.1 to Appendix C; we also refer to [20] for a similar regret bound for (FoReL) in the context of online convex optimization. Instead of discussing the proof, we close this section by noting that (3.3) represents a striking improvement over the Θ(t−1/2) worst-case bound for FoReL in discrete time [40]. In view of this, the continuous-time framework we consider here can be seen as particularly amenable to learning because it allows players seek to minimize their regret (and thus converge to coarse correlated equilibria) at the fastest possible rate."

      "heading" : "4. Recurrence in adversarial regularized learning",
      "text" : "In this section, our aim is to take a closer look at the ramifications of fast regret minimization under (FoReL) beyond convergence to the set of coarse correlated equilibria. Indeed, as is well known, this set is fairly large and may contain thoroughly non-rationalizable strategies: for instance, Viossat and Zapechelnyuk [46] recently showed that a coarse correlated equilibrium could assign positive selection probability only to strictly dominated strategies. Moreover, the time-averaging that is inherent in the definition of the players’ regret leaves open the possibility of complex day-to-day behavior e.g. periodicity, recurrence, limit cycles or chaos [26, 27, 29, 37]. Motivated by this, we examine the long-run behavior of the (FoReL) in the popular setting of zero-sum games (with or without interior equilibria) and several extensions thereof.\nA key notion in our analysis is that of (Poincaré) recurrence. Intuitively, a dynamical system is recurrent if, after a sufficiently long (but finite) time, almost every state returns arbitrarily close to the system’s initial state.4 More formally, given a dynamical system on X that is defined by means of a semiflow Φ: X × [0,∞)→ X , we have:5\nDefinition 4.1. A point x ∈ X is said to be recurrent under Φ if, for every neighborhood U of x in X , there exists an increasing sequence of times tn ↑ ∞ such that\n4Here, “almost” means that the set of such states has full Lebesgue measure. 5Recall that a continuous map Φ: X×[0,∞)→ X is a semiflow if Φ(x, 0) = x and Φ(x, t+s) = Φ(Φ(x, t), s) for all x ∈ X and all s, t ≥ 0. Heuristically, Φt(x) ≡ Φ(x, t) describes the trajectory of the dynamical system starting at x.\nΦ(x, tn) ∈ U for all n. Moreover, the flow Φ is called (Poincaré) recurrent if, for every measurable subset A of X , the set of recurrent points in A has full measure.\nAn immediate consequence of Definition 4.1 is that, if a point is recurrent, there exists an increasing sequence of times tn ↑ ∞ such that Φ(x, tn) → x. On that account, recurrence can be seen as the flip side of convergence: under the latter, (almost) every initial state of the dynamics eventually reaches some well-defined end-state; instead, under the former, the system’s orbits fill the entire state space and return arbitarily close to their starting points infinitely often (so there is no possibility of convergence beyond trivial cases).\n4.1. Zero-sum games with an interior equilibrium. Our first result is that (FoReL) is recurrent (and hence, non-convergent) in zero-sum games with an interior Nash equilibrium:\nTheorem 4.2. Let Γ be a 2-player zero-sum game that admits an interior Nash equilibrium. Then, almost every solution trajectory of (FoReL) is recurrent; specifically, for (Lebesgue) almost every initial condition x(0) = Q(y(0)) ∈ X , there exists an increasing sequence of times tn ↑ ∞ such that x(tn)→ x(0).\nThe proof of Theorem 4.2 is fairly complicated, so we outline the basic steps below:\n(1) We first show that the dynamics of the score sequence y(t) are incompressible, i.e. the volume of a set of initial conditions remains invariant as the dynamics evolve over time. By Poincaré’s recurrence theorem (cf. Appendix B), if every solution orbit y(t) of (FoReL) remains in a compact set for all t ≥ 0, incompressibility implies recurrence. (2) To counter the possibility of solutions escaping to infinity, we introduce a transformed system based on the differences between scores (as opposed to the scores themselves). To establish boundedness in these dynamics, we consider the “primal-dual” coupling\nG(y) = ∑ i∈N [h∗i (yi)− 〈yi, x∗i 〉], (4.1)\nwhere x∗ is an interior Nash equilibrium and h∗i (yi) = maxxi∈Xi{〈yi, xi〉 − hi(xi)} denotes the convex conjugate of hi.6 The key property of this coupling is that it remains invariant under (FoReL); however, its level sets are not bounded so, again, precompactness of solutions is not guaranteed. (3) Nevertheless, under the score transformation described above, the level sets of G are compact. Since the transformed dynamics are invariant under said transformation, Poincaré’s theorem finally implies recurrence.\nProof of Theorem 4.2. To make the above plan precise, fix some “benchmark” strategy α̂i ∈ Ai for every player i ∈ N and, for all αi ∈ Ai\\{α̂i}, consider the corresponding score differences ziαi = yiαi − yi,α̂i . (4.2) Obviously, ziα̂i = yiα̂i − yiα̂i is identically zero so we can ignore it in the above definition. In so doing, we obtain a linear map Πi : RAi → RAi\\{α̂i} sending yi 7→ zi; aggregating over all players, we also write Π for the product map Π = (Π1, . . . ,ΠN )\n6This coupling is closely related to the so-called Bregman divergence – for the details, see [3, 19, 24, 40].\nsending y 7→ z. For posterity, note that this map is surjective but not injective,7 so it does not allow us to recover the score vector y from the score difference vector z.\nNow, under (FoReL), the score differences (4.2) evolve as\nżiαi = viαi(x(t))− viα̂i(x(t)). (4.3)\nHowever, since the right-hand side (RHS) of (4.3) depends on x = Q(y) and the mapping y 7→ z is not invertible (so y cannot be expressed as a function of z), the above does not a priori constitute an autonomous dynamical system (as required to apply Poincaré’s recurrence theorem). Our first step below is to show that (4.3) does in fact constitute a well-defined dynamical system on z.\nTo do so, consider the reduced choice map Q̂i : RAi\\{α̂i} → Xi defined as\nQ̂i(zi) = Qi(yi) (4.4)\nfor some yi ∈ RAi such that Πi(yi) = zi. That such a yi exists is a consequence of Πi being surjective; furthemore, that Q̂i(zi) is well-defined is a consequence of the fact that Qi is invariant on the fibers of Πi. Indeed, by construction, we have Πi(yi) = Πi(y ′ i) if and only if y′iαi = yiαi + c for some c ∈ R and all αi ∈ Ai. Hence, by the definition of Qi, we get\nQi(y ′ i) = arg max\nxi∈Xi\n{ 〈yi, xi〉+ c ∑ αi∈Ai xiαi − hi(xi) } = arg max\nxi∈Xi {〈yi, xi〉 − hi(xi)} = Qi(yi), (4.5)\nwhere we used the fact that ∑ αi∈Ai xiαi = 1. The above shows thatQi(y ′ i) = Qi(yi) if and only if Πi(yi) = Πi(y′i), so Q̂i is well-defined. Letting Q̂ ≡ (Q̂1, . . . , Q̂N ) denote the aggregation of the players’ individual choice maps Q̂i, it follows immediately that Q(y) = Q̂(Π(y)) = Q̂(z) by construction. Hence, the dynamics (4.3) may be written as\nż = V (z), (4.6)\nwhere Viαi(z) = viαi(Q̂i(z))− viα̂i(Q̂i(z)). (4.7)\nThese dynamics obviously constitute an autonomous system, so our goal will be to use Liouville’s formula and Poincaré’s theorem in order to establish recurrence and then conclude that the induced trajectory of play x(t) is recurrent by leveraging the properties of Q̂.\nAs a first step towards applying Liouville’s formula, we note that the dynamics (4.6) are incompressible. Indeed, we have\n∂Viαi ∂ziαi = ∑ βi∈Ai ∂Viαi ∂xiβi ∂xiβi ∂ziαi = 0, (4.8)\nbecause vi does not depend on xi. We thus obtain divz V (z) = 0, i.e. the dynamics (4.6) are incompressible.\nWe now show that every solution orbit z(t) of (4.6) is precompact, that is, supt≥0‖z(t)‖ < ∞. To that end, note that the coupling G(y) = ∑ i∈N [h ∗ i (yi) −\n7Specifically, Πi(yi) = Πi(y′i) if and only if y ′ iαi = yiαi + c for some c ∈ R and all αi ∈ Ai.\n〈yi, x∗i 〉] defined in (4.1) remains invariant under (FoReL) when Γ is a 2-player zero-sum game. Indeed, by Lemma C.1, we have dG\ndt = ∑ i∈N 〈vi(x), xi − x∗i 〉 = 〈v1(x), x1 − x∗1〉+ 〈v2(x), x2 − x∗2〉\n= u1(x1, x2)− u1(x∗1, x2) + u2(x1, x2)− u2(x1, x∗2) = 0, (4.9)\nwhere we used the fact that Qi = ∇h∗i in the first line (cf. (C.2) above), and the assumption that x∗ is an interior Nash equilibrium of a 2-player zero-sum game in the last one. We conclude that G(y(t)) remains constant under (FoReL), as claimed.\nBy Lemma D.2 in Appendix D, the invariance of G(y(t)) under (FoReL) implies that the score differences ziαi(t) = yiαi(t)−yiα̂i(t) also remain bounded for all t ≥ 0. Hence, by Liouville’s formula and Poincaré’s recurrence theorem, the dynamics (4.6) are recurrent, i.e. for (Lebesgue) almost every initial condition z0 and every neighborhood U of z0, there exists some τU such that z(τU ) ∈ U (cf. Definition 4.1). Thus, taking a shrinking net of balls Bn(z0) = {z : ‖z − z0‖ ≤ 1/n} and iterating the above, it follows that there exists an increasing sequence of times tn ↑ ∞ such that z(tn) → z0. Therefore, to prove the corresponding claim for the induced trajectories of play x(t) = Q(y(t)) = Q̂(z(t)) of (FoReL), fix an initial condition x0 ∈ X ◦ and take some z0 such that x0 = Q̂(z0). By taking tn as above, we have z(tn) → z0 so, by continuity, x(tn) = Q̂(zn) → Q̂(z0) = x0. This shows that any solution orbit x(t) of (FoReL) is recurrent and our proof is complete.\nRemark. We close this section by noting that the invariance of (4.1) under (FoReL) induces a foliation of X , with each individual trajectory of (FoReL) living on a “leaf” of the foliation (a level set of G). Fig. 1 provides a schematic illustration of this foliation/cycling structure.\n4.2. Zero-sum games with no interior equilibria. At first sight, Theorem 4.2 suggests that cycling is ubiquitous in zero-sum games; however, if the game does not admit an interior equilibrium, the behavior of (FoReL) turns out to be qualitatively different. To state our result for such games, it will be convenient to assume that the players’ regularizer functions are strongly convex, i.e. each hi can be bounded from below by a quadratic minorant:\nhi(txi + (1− t)x′i) ≤ thi(xi) + (1− t)hi(x′i)− 12Kit(1− t)‖xi − x ′ i‖ 2 , (4.10)\nfor all xi, x′i ∈ Xi and for all t ∈ [0, 1]. Under this technical assumption, we have:\nTheorem 4.3. Let Γ be a 2-player zero-sum game that does not admit an interior Nash equilibrium. Then, for every initial condition of (FoReL), the induced trajectory of play x(t) converges to the boundary of X . Specifically, if x∗ is a Nash equilibrium of Γ with maximal support, x(t) converges to the relative interior of the face of X spanned by supp(x∗).\nTheorem 4.3 is our most comprehensive result for the behavior of (FoReL) in zero-sum games, so several remarks are in order. First, we note that Theorem 4.3 complements Theorem 4.2 in a very natural way: specifically, if Γ admits an interior Nash equilibrium, Theorem 4.3 suggests that the solutions of (FoReL) will stay within the relative interior X ◦ of X (since an interior equilibrium is supported on\nall actions). Of course, Theorem 4.2 provides a stronger result because it states that, within X ◦, (FoReL) is recurrent. Hence, applying both results in tandem, we obtain the following heuristic for the behavior of (FoReL) in zero-sum games:\nIn the long run, (FoReL) wanders in perpetuity in the smallest face of X containing the equilibrium set of Γ.\nThis leads to two extremes: On the one hand, if Γ admits an interior equilibrium, (FoReL) is recurrent and cycles in the level sets of the coupling function (4.1). At the other end of the spectrum, if Γ admits only a single, pure equilibrium, then (FoReL) converges to it (since it has to wander in a singleton set). In all other “in-between” cases, (FoReL) exhibits a hybrid behavior, converging to the face of X that is spanned by the maximal support equilibrium of Γ, and then cycling in that face in perpetuity.\nThe reason for this behavior is that the coupling (4.1) is no longer a constant of motion of (FoReL) if the game does not admit an interior equilibrium. As we show in Appendix C, the coupling (4.1) is strictly decreasing when the support of x(t) is strictly greater than that of a Nash equilibrium x∗ with maximal support. When the two match, the rate of change of (4.1) drops to zero, and we fall back to a “constrained” version of Theorem 4.2. We make this argument precise in Appendix C (where we present the proof of Theorem 4.3).\n4.3. Zero-sum polymatrix games & positive affine payoff transformations. We close this section by showing that the recurrence properties of (FoReL) are not unique to “vanilla” zero-sum games, but also occur when there is a network of competitors – i.e. in N -player zero-sum polymatrix games. In fact, the recurrence results carry over to any N -player game which is isomorphic to a constant-sum polymatrix game with an interior equilibrium up to a positive-affine payoff transformation (possibly different transformation for each agent). For example, this class of games contains all strictly competitive games [1]. Such transformations do not affect the equilibrium structure of the game, but can affect the geometry of the trajectories; nevertheless, the recurrent behavior persists as shown by the following result:\nTheorem 4.4. Let Γ = (Γe)e∈E be a constant-sum polymatrix game (or a positive affine payoff transformation thereof ). If Γ admits an interior Nash equilibrium, almost every solution trajectory of (FoReL) is recurrent; specifically, for (Lebesgue) almost every initial condition x(0) = Q(y(0)) ∈ X , there exists an increasing sequence of times tn ↑ ∞ such that x(tn)→ x(0).\nWe leave the case of zero-sum polymatrix games with no interior equilibria to future work."

Even though the empirical frequency of play under FoReL converges to the set of coarse correlated equilibria (possibly at an increased rate, depending on the game’s structure), the actual trajectory of play under FoReL is recurrent and exhibits cycles in zero-sum games. We find this property particularly interesting as it suggests that “black box” guarantees are not the be-all/end-all\nof learning in games: the theory of dynamical systems is rife with complex phenomena and notions that arise naturally when examining the behavior of learning algorithms in finer detail."

Liouville’s formula can be applied to any system of autonomous differential equations with a continuously differentiable vector field ξ on an open domain of S ⊂k. The divergence of ξ at x ∈ S is defined as the trace of the corresponding Jacobian at x, i.e., div[ξ(x)] = ∑k i=1 ∂ξi ∂xi\n(x). Since divergence is a continuous function we can compute its integral over measurable sets A ⊂ S. Given any such set A, let A(t) = {Φ(x0, t) : x0 ∈ A} be the image of A under map Φ at time t. A(t) is measurable and is volume is vol[A(t)] = ∫ A(t)\ndx.

The notion of recurrence that we will be using in this paper goes back to Poincaré and specifically to his study of the threebody problem. In 1890, in his celebrated work [30], he proved that whenever a dynamical system preserves volume almost all trajectories return arbitrarily close to their initial position, and they do so an infinite number of times. More precisely, Poincaré established the following:\nPoincaré Recurrence: [4, 30] If a flow preserves volume and has only bounded orbits then for each open set there exist orbits that intersect the set infinitely often."

      "heading" : "Appendix C. Technical proofs",
      "text" : "The first result that we prove in this appendix is a key technical lemma concerning the evolution of the coupling function (4.1):\nLemma C.1. Let pi ∈ Xi and let Gi(yi) = h∗i (yi)−〈yi, pi〉 denote the coupling (4.1) for player i ∈ N . If player i ∈ N follows (FoReL), we have\nd dt Gi(yi(t)) = 〈vi(x(t)), xi(t)− pi〉, (C.1)\nfor every trajectory of play x−i(t) of all players other than i.\nProof. We begin by recalling the “maximizing argument” identity\nQi(yi) = ∇h∗i (yi) (C.2)\nwhich expresses the choice map Qi as a function of the convex conjugate of hi [40, p. 149]. With this at hand, a simple differentiation gives\nd dt Gi(yi(t)) = d dt h∗i (yi(t))− 〈ẏi(t), pi〉\n= 〈ẏi(t),∇h∗i (yi(t))− pi〉 = 〈vi(x(t)), xi(t)− pi〉, (C.3)\nwhere the last step follows from the fact that xi(t) = Qi(yi(t)) = ∇h∗i (yi(t)).\nArmed with this lemma, we proceed to prove the no-regret guarantees of (FoReL):\nProof of Theorem 3.1. Fix some base point pi ∈ Xi and let Li(t) = Gi(yi(t)) = hi(yi(t))− 〈yi(t), pi〉. Then, by Lemma C.1, we have\nL′i(t) = 〈vi(x(t)), xi(t)− pi〉 (C.4)\nand hence, after integrating and rearranging, we get∫ t 0 [ui(pi;x−i(s))−ui(x(s))]ds = ∫ t 0 〈vi(x(s)), pi−xi(s)〉ds = Li(0)−Li(t), (C.5)\nwhere we used the fact that ui(pi;x−i) = 〈vi(x), pi〉 – cf. Eq. (2.2) in Section 2. However, expanding the RHS of (C.5), we get\nLi(0)− Li(t) = h∗i (yi(0))− 〈yi(0), pi〉 − h∗i (yi(t)) + 〈yi(t), pi〉 ≤ h∗i (yi(0))− 〈yi(0), pi〉+ hi(pi) = hi(pi)− hi(Qi(yi(0))) ≤ maxhi −minhi ≡ Ωi, (C.6)\nwhere we used the defining property of convex conjugation in the second and third lines above – i.e. that h∗i (yi) ≥ 〈yi, xi〉 − hi(xi) for all xi ∈ Xi, with equality if and only if xi = Qi(yi). Thus, maximizing (C.5) over pi ∈ Xi, we finally obtain\nRegi(t) = max pi∈Xi\n1\nt ∫ t 0 [ui(pi;x−i(s))− ui(x(s))] ds ≤ Ωi t , (C.7)\nas claimed.\nWe now turn to two-player zero-sum games that do not admit interior equilibria. To describe such equilibria in more detail, we consider below the notion of essential and non-essential strategies:\nDefinition C.2. A strategy αi of agent i ∈ {1, 2} in a zero sum game is called essential if there exists a Nash equilibrium in which player i plays αi with positive probability. A strategy that is not essential is called non-essential.\nAs it turns out, the Nash equilibria of a zero-sum game admit a very useful characterization in terms of essential and non-essential strategies:\nLemma C.3. Let Γ be a 2-player zero-sum game that does not admit an interior Nash equilibrium. Then, there exists a mixed Nash equilibrium (x1, x2) such that a) each agent plays each of their essential strategies with positive probability; and\nb) for each agent deviating to a non-essential strategy results to a strictly worse performance than the value of the game.\nThe key step in proving this characterization is Farkas’ lemma; the version we employ here is due to Gale, Kuhn and Tucker [13]):\nLemma C.4 (Farkas’ lemma). Let P ∈ Rm×n and b ∈ Rm. Then exactly one of the following two statements is true:\n• There exists a x ∈ Rm such that P>x ≥ 0 and b>x < 0. • There exists a y ∈ Rn such that P · y = b and y ≥ 0.\nWith this lemma at hand, we have:\nProof of Lemma C.3. Assume without loss of generality that the value of the zerosum game is zero. and that the first agent is a maximizing agent. Let A be the payoff matrix of the first agent and hence AT = A the payoff matrix of the second/minimizing agent. We will show first that for any non-essential strategy αi of each agent there exists a Nash equilibrium strategy of his opponent such that the expected performance of αi is strictly worse than the value of the game (i.e. zero).\nIt suffices to argue this for the first agent. Let αi be one of his non-essential strategies then by definition there does not exist any Nash equilibrium strategy of that agent that chooses αi with positive probability. This is equivalent to the negation of the following statement:\nThere exists a x ∈ Rm such that P>x ≥ 0 and b>x < 0 where\nP> =\n( A>\nIm×m\n) =  a11 a21 . . . am1 ... ... . . . ... a1n a2n . . . amn 1 0 . . . 0 0 1 . . . 0 ... ... . . . ...\n0 0 . . . 1\n , (C.8)\nand b = −ei = (0, . . . , 0,−1, 0, . . . , 0)T , the standard basis vector of dimension m that “chooses\" the i-th strategy. By Farkas’ lemma, there exists a y ∈ Rm+n such that Py = b and y ≥ 0. It is convenient to express y = (z;w) where z ∈ Rn and w ∈ Rm. Hence, for all j 6= i ∈ {1, 2, . . . ,m} : (Py)j = (Az)j + wj = 0 and thus (Az)j ≤ 0. Finally, for j = i : (Py)i = (Az)i + wi = −1 and thus (Az)i < 0. Hence z is a Nash equilibrium strategy for the second player such that when the first agent chooses the non-essential strategy αi he receives payoff which is strictly worse than his value (zero).\nTo complete the proof, for each essential strategy of the first agent there exists one equilibrium strategy of his that chooses it with positive probability (by definition). Similarly, for each non-essential strategy of the second agent there exists one equilibrium strategy of the first agent such that makes the expected payoff of that non-essential strategy strictly worse than the value of the game. The barycenter of all the above equilibrium strategies is still an equilibrium strategy (by convexity) and has all the desired properties.\nWith all this at hand, we are finally in a position to prove Theorem 4.3: Proof of Theorem 4.3. We first show that the coupling G(y) = ∑ i∈N [h ∗ i (yi) − 〈yi, x∗i 〉] defined in (4.1) given any fully mixed initial condition strictly increases under (FoReL) when Γ is a 2-player zero-sum game that does not have an equilibrium with full support.\nIndeed, by (C.3) there exists a mixed Nash equilibrium (x∗1, x∗2) such that i) both players employ each of their essential strategies with positive probability over time; and ii) every player deviating to a non-essential strategy obtains a payoff lower than the value of the game. As a result, any player playing an interior (fully mixed) strategy against such an equilibrium strategy must receive less utility than their value. In more detail, we have\ndG dt = ∑ i∈N 〈vi(x), xi − x∗i 〉 = 〈v1(x), x1 − x∗1〉+ 〈v2(x), x2 − x∗2〉\n= u1(x1, x2)− u1(x∗1, x2) + u2(x1, x2)− u2(x1, x∗2) = −u1(x∗1, x2)− u2(x1, x∗2) < −u1(x∗1, x∗2)− u2(x∗1, x∗2) = 0, (C.9)\nwhere we used the fact that Qi = ∇h∗i in the first line (cf. Appendix D), and the assumption that x∗ is a Nash equilibrium of a 2-player zero-sum game such that any agent playing an interior (fully mixed) strategy against such an equilibrium strategy must receive less utility than their value (and hence the agent himself receives more utility than the value of the game). We thus conclude that G(y(t)) strictly increases under (FoReL), as claimed.\nLet x∗ = (x∗1, x∗2) be the Nash equilibrium identified in (C.9) and let L(t) = G(y(t)) = ∑ i∈N [h ∗ i (yi(t)) − 〈yi(t), x∗i 〉] denote the primal-dual coupling (4.1) between y(t) and x∗. From (C.9), we have that starting from any fully mixed strategy profile x(0) ∈ ∏ i int(Xi) and for all t ≥ 0, L′(t) = 〈ẏ(t),∇G(y(t))〉 < 0. However,\nG is bounded from below by − ∑ i maxxi∈Xi hi(xi), and since G(y(t)) is strictly decreasing, it must exhibit a finite limit. We begin by noting that x(t) = Q(y(t)) is Lipschitz continuous in t. Indeed, v is Lipschitz continuous on X by linearity; furthermore, since the regularizer functions hi are assumed Ki-strongly convex, it follows that Qi is (1/Ki)-continuous by standard convex analysis arguments [32, Theorem 12.60]. In turn, this implies that the field of motion V (y) ≡ v(Q(y)) of (FoReL) is Lipschitz continuous, so the dynamics are well-posed and y(t) is differentiable. Since ẏ = v and, in addition, v is bounded on X , we conclude that ẏ is bounded so, in particular, y(t) is Lipschitz continuous on [0,∞). We thus conclude that x(t) = Q(y(t)) is Lipschitz continuous as the composition of Lipschitz continuous functions.\nWe now further claim that L′(t) is also Lipschitz continuous in t. Indeed, by (C.1), we have L′(t) = ∑ i∈N 〈vi(x(t)), xi(t) − x∗i 〉; since vi is Lipschitz continuous in x and x(t) is Lipschitz continuous in t, our claim follows trivially. Hence, by Lemma D.3, we conclude that limt→∞ L′(t) = lim→∞ ∑ i∈N 〈vi(x(t), xi(t)−x∗i 〉 = 0.\nBy (C.9), we know that L′(t) < 0 as long as x(t) is interior. Hence, any ω-limit x̂ of x(t) cannot be interior (given that the embedded game does not have any interior Nash equilibria). Moreover, we can repeat this argument for any subspace such that the restriction of the game on that subspace (when ignoring the strategies that are played with probability zero) does not have a fully mixed NE. We thus\nconclude that the support of x̂ must be a subset of the support of x∗. Since Γ does not admit an interior equilibrium, x∗ does not have full support, so every ω-limit of x(t) lies on the boundary of X , as claimed.\nWe close this appendix with the proof of our result on constant-sum polymatrix games (and positive affine transformations thereof):\nProof of Theorem 4.4. Our proof follows closely that of Theorem 4.2; to streamline our presentation, we only highlight here the points that differ due to working with (an positive-affine transformations of) a network of constant-sum games (as opposed to a single 2-player zero-sum game).\nThe first such point is the incompressibility of the “reduced” dynamics (4.6). By definition, we have ui(x) = ∑ j∈Ni uij(xi, xj), so we also have\nviαi(x) = ∑ j∈Ni uij(αi, xj). (C.10)\nSince uij(αi, xj) does not depend on xi, we readily obtain ∂αiviαi(x) = 0 and incompressibility follows as before.\nLet the network game in question be isomorphic to a network of constantsum games after the following positive-affine transformation of utilities, ui(x) ← aiui(x) + bi where ai > 0. The second point of interest is the use of the coupling G(y) = ∑ i∈N ai[h ∗ i (yi) − 〈yi, x∗i 〉] as a constant of motion for (FoReL). Indeed, adapting the derivation of (C.1), we now get\ndG\ndt = 〈ẏ,∇G(y)〉 = ∑ i∈N 〈vi(x), ai(∇h∗i (yi)− x∗i )〉 = ∑ i∈N 〈aivi(x), xi − x∗i 〉\n= ∑ i∈N ∑ j∈Ni 〈aivij(x), xi − x∗i 〉\n= ∑ {i,j}∈E [aiuij(xi, xj) + bi − aiuij(x∗i , xj)− bi + ajuji(xi, xj) + bj − ajuji(xi, x∗j )− bj ]\n= 0, (C.11)\nwhere the third line follows by regrouping the summands in the second line by edge, and the last line follows as in the case of (C.1). This implies that G(y(t)) remains constant along any solution of (FoReL), so the rest of the proof follows as in the case of Theorem 4.2."

      "heading" : "Appendix D. Auxiliary results",
      "text" : "In this appendix, we provide two auxiliary results that are used in the proof of Theorem 4.2. The first one shows that if the score difference between two strategies grows large, the strategy with the lower score becomes extinct:\nLemma D.1. Let A be a finite set and let h be a regularizer on X ≡ ∆(A). If the sequence yn ∈ RA is such that yβ,n − yα,n → ∞ for some α, β ∈ A, then limn→∞Qα(yn) = 0.\nProof. Set xn = Q(yn) and, by descending to a subsequence if necessary, assume there exists some ε > 0 such that xα,n ≥ ε > 0 for all n. Then, by the defining relation Q(y) = arg max{〈y, x〉 − h(x)} of Q, we have:\n〈yn, xn〉 − h(xn) ≥ 〈yn, x′〉 − h(x′) (D.1)\nfor all x′ ∈ ∆. Therefore, taking x′n = xn + ε(eβ − eα), we readily obtain\nε(yα,n − yβ,n) ≥ h(xn)− h(x′n) ≥ minh−maxh (D.2)\nwhich contradicts our original assumption that yα,n − yβ,n → −∞. With ∆ compact, the above shows that x∗α = 0 for any limit point x∗ of xn, i.e. Qα(yn)→ 0.\nA key step of the proof of Theorem 4.2 consists of showing that the level sets of the Fenchel coupling G(p, y) become bounded under the coordinate reduction transformation y 7→ Π(y) = z, so every solution orbit z(t) of (4.6) also remains bounded. We encode this in the following lemma:\nLemma D.2. Let A be a finite set, let h be a regularizer on X ≡ ∆(A), and fix some interior p ∈ X . If the sequence yn ∈ RA is such that supn|h∗(yn) − 〈yn, p〉| < ∞, the differences yβ,n − yα,n also remain bounded for all α, β ∈ A.\nProof. We argue by contradiction. Indeed, assume that the sequence Gn ≡ h∗(yn)− 〈yn, p〉 is bounded but lim supn→∞|yα,n − yβ,n| = ∞ for some α, β ∈ A. Letting y+n = maxα yα,n and y−n = minα∈A yα,n, this implies that lim supn→∞(y+n − y−n ) = ∞. Hence, by descending to a subsequence if necessary, there exist α+, α− ∈ A such that a) y±n = yα±,n for all n; and b) yα+,n − yα−,n →∞ as n→∞.\nBy construction, we have yα−,n = y−n ≤ yα,n ≤ y+n = yα+,n for all α ∈ A. Thus, by descending to a further subsequence if necessary, we may assume that the index set A can be partitioned into two nonempty sets A+ and A− such that\n(1) y+n − yα,n is bounded for all α ∈ A+. (2) y+n − yα,n →∞ for all α ∈ A−.\nIn more detail, consider the quantity\nδα = lim inf n→∞\n(y+n − yα,n), (D.3)\nand construct the required partition {A+,A−} according to the following procedure:\n0: Set A+ ← {α+}, A− = A \\ A+ 1: while δα <∞ for some α ∈ A− do 2: pick α∗ such that δα∗ <∞; 3: set A+ ← A+ ∪ {α∗}, A− ← A−\\{α∗}; 4: descend to a subsequence of yn that realizes δα∗ ; 5: redefine δα for all α ∈ A based on chosen subsequence; 6: end while 7: return A+,A−\nThus, if we let xn = Q(yn) we readily obtain: 〈yn, p− xn〉 = ∑ α∈A yα,n(pα − xα,n) = ∑ α∈A (yα,n − y+n )(pα − xα,n)\n= ∑ α∈A+ (yα,n − y+n )(pα − xα,n) + ∑ α∈A− (yα,n − y+n )(pα − xα,n), (D.4)\nwhere we used the fact that ∑ α∈A pα = ∑ α∈A xα,n = 1 in the first line. The first sum above is bounded by assumption. As for the second one, the fact that yα+,n−yα,n = y+n −yα,n →∞ implies that xα,n → 0 for all α ∈ A− (by Lemma D.1 above). We thus get lim infn(pα − xα,n) > 0 (recall that p ∈ ∆◦), and hence,∑ α∈A−(yα,n − y+n )(pα − xα,n)→ −∞. From the above, we conclude that 〈yn, p − xn〉 → −∞ as n → ∞. However, by construction, we also have\nGn = h ∗(yn)−〈yn, x∗〉 = 〈yn, xn〉−h(xn)−〈yn, x∗〉 = 〈yn, p−xn〉−h(xn). (D.5)\nSince h is finite on x, it follows that Gn → −∞, contradicting our assumption that Gn is bounded. Retracing our steps, this implies that supn|yα,n − yβ,n| < ∞, as claimed.\nThe final result we state here is a technical result regarding the asymptotic behavior of the derivative of functions with a finite limit at infinity:\nLemma D.3. Suppose that L : [0,∞)→ R is differentiable with Lipschitz continuous derivative. If limt→∞ L(t) exists and is finite, we have limt→∞ L′(t) = 0.\nProof. Assume ad absurdum that limt→∞ L′(t) 6= 0. Then, without loss of generality, we may assume there exists some ε > 0 and an increasing sequence tn ↑ ∞ such that L′(tn) ≥ ε for all n ∈ N. Thus, if M denotes the Lipschitz constant of L′ and t ∈ [tn, tn + ε/(2M)], we readily obtain\n|L′(t)− L′(tn)| ≤M |t− tn| ≤M · ε 2M = ε 2 (D.6)\nby the Lipschitz continuity of L′. Since L′(tn) ≥ ε by assumption, we conclude that L′(t) ≥ ε/2 for all t ∈ [tn, tn + ε/(2M)]. Hence, by integrating, we get L(tn + ε/(2M)) ≥ L(tn) + ε/(2M) · (ε/2) = L(tn) + ε2/(4M) for all n ∈ N. Taking n → ∞ and recalling that L∞ ≡ limt→∞ L(t) exists and is finite, we get L∞ = L∞ + ε 2/(4M) > L∞, a contradiction."

A natural question that arises in these settings is how regularized learning algorithms behave when faced against each other. We study a natural formulation of this problem by coupling regularized learning dynamics in zero-sum games. We show that the system’s behavior is Poincaré recurrent, implying that almost every trajectory revisits any (arbitrarily small) neighborhood of its starting point infinitely often. This cycling behavior is robust to the agents’ choice of regularization mechanism (each agent could be using a different regularizer), to positive-affine transformations of the agents’ utilities, and it also persists in the case of networked competition, i.e., for zero-sum polymatrix games.",
