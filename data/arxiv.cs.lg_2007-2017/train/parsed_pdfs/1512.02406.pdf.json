      "text" : "Bayesian networks (Pearl 1988; Koller and Friedman 2009) are often used to model uncertainty and causality, with applications ranging from decision-making systems (Kochenderfer et al. 2012) to medical diagnosis (Lustgarten et al. 2011). Bayesian networks provide an efficient factorization of the joint probability distribution over a set of random variables. It is common to assume that the random variables in a Bayesian network are discrete, since many Bayesian network learning and inference algorithms are unable to efficiently handle continuous variables. In addition, many of the commonly used Bayesian network software packages, such as Netica (Norsys 1992–2009), SMILearn (Druzdzel 1999), and bnlearn (Scutari 2010), are geared towards discrete variables. However, many applications require the use of continuous variables, such as position and velocity in dynamic systems (Kochenderfer et al. 2010).\n∗Electronic address: yichunc@stanford.edu †Electronic address: wheelert@stanford.edu ‡Electronic address: mykel@stanford.edu\nar X\niv :1\n51 2.\n02 40\n6v 2\n[ cs\n.A I]\n1 5\nThere are three common approaches to extending Bayesian networks to continuous variables. The first is to model the conditional probability density of each continuous variable using specific families of parametric distributions, and then to redesign Bayesian network learning and inference algorithms based on the parameterizations. One example of parametric continuous distributions in Bayesian networks is the Gaussian graphical model (Weiss and Freeman 2001).\nThe second approach is to use nonparametric distributions, such as particle representations and Gaussian processes (Ickstadt et al. 2010). Unlike parametric methods, nonparametric methods can often fit any underlying probability distribution given sufficient data. Parametric models have a fixed number of parameters, whereas the number of parameters in a nonparametric model grow with the amount of training data.\nThe third approach is discretization. Automated discretization methods have been studied in machine learning and statistics for many years (Dougherty et al. 1995; Kerber 1992; Holte 1993; Fayyad and Irani 1993), primarily for classification problems. These methods search for the best discretization policy for a continuous attribute by considering its interaction with a class variable. It is common to discretize all continuous variables before learning a Bayesian network structure to avoid having to consider variable interactions, as the interactions and dependencies between variables in Bayesian networks introduce complexity. Prior work exists for discretizing continuous variables in naive Bayesian networks and tree-augmented networks (Friedman et al. 1997), but only a few discretization methods for general Bayesian networks have been proposed (Friedman and Goldszmidt 1996; Kozlov and Koller 1997; Monti and Cooper 1998; Steck and Jaakkola 2004).\nA common discretization method for Bayesian networks is to split continuous variables into uniform-width intervals or by using field-specific expertise. A more principled method is the minimum description length (MDL) principle discretization (Friedman and Goldszmidt 1996). The MDL principle proposed by Rissanen (1978) states that the best model for a dataset is the one that minimizes the amount of information needed to describe it (Grünwald 2007). MDL methods trade off goodness-of-fit against model complexity to reduce generalization error. In the context of Bayesian networks, Friedman and Goldszmidt (1996) applied the MDL principle to determine the optimal number of discretization intervals for continuous variables and the optimal positions of their discretization edges. Their approach selects a discretization policy that minimizes the sum of the description length of the discretized Bayesian network and the information necessary for recovering the continuous values from the discretized data.\nThe optimal discretization policy of a single continuous variable under MDL can be found using dynamic programming in cubic runtime with the number of data instances. For Bayesian networks with multiple continuous variables, MDL discretization can be iteratively applied to each continuous variable. Only one variable is treated as continuous at a time, while all other continuous variables are treated as discretized based on an initial discretization policy or the discretization result from a previous iteration.\nMDL discretization requires that the network structure be known in advance, but\nan iterative approach allows it to be incorporated into the structure learning process. Simultaneous structure learning and discretization alternates between traditional discrete structure learning and optimal discretization. Starting with some preliminary discretization policy, one first applies a structure learning algorithm to identify the locally optimal graph structure. One then refines the discretization policy based on the learned network. The cycle is repeated until convergence.\nResults in this work suggest that the MDL method suffers from low sensitivity to discretization edge locations and returns too few discretization intervals for continuous variables. This is caused by MDL’s use of mutual information to measure the quality of discretization edges. Mutual information, which is composed of empirical probabilities computed using event count ratios, varies less significantly with the positions of discretization edges than the method we suggest in this article.\nMODL (Boullé 2006) is a Bayesian method for discretizing a continuous feature according to a class variable, which selects the model with maximum probability given the data. The MODL method uses dynamic programming to find the optimal discretization policy for a continuous variable given a discrete class variable, and has an O ( n3 + r · n2\n) runtime, where r is the number of class variable instantiations. Lustgarten et al. (2011) suggest several formulations for the prior over models. The asymptotic equivalence between MDL and MODL on the single-variable, single-class problem was examined by Vitányi and Li (2000).\nThis paper describes a new Bayesian discretization method for continuous variables in Bayesian networks, extending prior work on single-variable discretization methods from Boullé (2006) and Lustgarten et al. (2011). The proposed method optimizes the discretization policy relative to the network and takes parents, children, and spouse variables into account. The optimal single-variable discretization method is derived in Section 3, using a prior which reduces the discretization runtime to O ( r · n2 ) without sacrificing optimality. Section 4 covers Bayesian networks with multiple continuous variables and Section 5 covers discretization while simultaneously learning network structure. The paper concludes with a comparison against the existing minimumdescription length (Friedman and Goldszmidt 1996) method on real-world datasets in Section 6."

Four principles for the optimal discretization policy enable the formulation of P (Λ) and P (D−X | Λ), where D−X is the subset of the dataset for all variables but X, and the probability of the data associated with the target variable, P (DX), is already captured\nin P (Λ). The four principles, which can be considered an extension of the priors in MODL and Lustgarten et al. (2011) to Bayesian networks, are:\n1. The prior probability of a discretization edge between two consecutive unique values ui and ui+1 is proportional to their difference:\n1− exp ( −L · ui+1 −ui\num −u1\n) , (3)\nwhere L is the largest number of intervals among discrete variables in X’s Markov blanket. This encourages edges between well-separated values over edges between closely packed samples.\n2. For a given discretization interval, every distribution over the parents of X is equiprobable.\n3. For each pair 〈Ci,Si〉 and a given discretization interval, every distribution over Ci given an instance of Si is equiprobable.\n4. The distributions over X given each child, parent, and spouse instantiation are independent.\nFrom the first principle one obtains the prior over the discretization policy:\nP (Λ) = k−1∏ i=1 [ 1− exp ( −L · xλi+1 −xλi xn −x1 )] k∏ i=1 [ exp ( −L · xλi −xλi−1+1 xn −x1 )] . (4)\nThe Bayesian network graph structure causes the likelihood term P (D−X | Λ) to factor according to X’s Markov blanket:\nP (D−X | Λ) ∝ P ( DpaX | Λ ) · ∏ i P (DCi | Λ, DSi). (5)\nFor example, in Figure 1, P (D−X | Λ) factors according to\nP (DP1,P2,P3 | Λ) · P (DC1 | Λ, DS1) · P (DC2 | Λ, DS2). (6) The concept behind the factorization is also the motivation behind forward sampling in a Bayesian network. The parents of X are independent of the children given X. The parents are not necessarily individually independent, and thus the parental term P (DpaX | Λ) cannot be factored further. The children of X are similarly independent given X and the corresponding spouses, leading to their factored product ∏ i P (DCi | Λ, DSi). Each component in the decomposition can be evaluated given a discretization policy and a dataset.\n3.1.1 Evaluation of P ( DpaX | Λ ) Let JP be the number of instantiations of the parents of X, and let n (P) i,j be the number of instances of X within the ith discretization interval of Λ given the jth parental\ninstantiation.

(7)\nThe two factors on the right hand side come from the second principle: all distributions of values of the parents of X in a given interval are equiprobable. The fourth principle is that the distributions for each interval are independent, so the factors can be multiplied together.\n3.1.2 Evaluation of P (DCj | Λ, DSj )\nLet JCj be the number of instantiations of the jth child of X, let J (j) S be the number of instantiations of the jth spouse set Sj , and let n (j) i,m,` be the number of instances of X in the ith discretization interval of Λ given the mth instantiation of Cj and the `th instantiation of Sj . Let n (j) i,` = ∑Jj m=1 n (j) i,m,`. Note that γi = ∑ ` n (j) i,` for all j.

(8)\nThe two factors on the right hand side come from the third principle: all distribution of values of Cj in a given interval and with a given value of Sj are equiprobable. According to the fourth prior, these distributions are independent from each other, and one can thus take their product. If Sj = ∅, then Equation 8 is equivalent to\nP (DCj | Λ,Sj = ∅) = Principle 4︷︸︸︷ k∏ i=1 Principle 3︷ ︸︸ ︷ 1(γi+JCj−1\nJCj−1 ) 1γi! n (j) i,1,∅! n (j) i,2,∅! ··· n\n(j) i,JCj ,∅!\n, (9)\nwhere n (j) i,m,∅ is the number of instances of X in the ith discretization interval of Λ given the mth instantiation of Cj .

It follows that dynamic programming can be used to solve the optimization problem exactly.\nPrecomputation reduces runtime.

The runtime of Algorithm 1 is also O ( nc · Lns · n2 + Lnp · n2 ) because the runtime of the dynamic programming procedure is less than the runtime for computing h(u, v). As will be discussed in Section 6, the MDL discretization method has a runtime of O ( n3 + (nc · Lns + Lnp) · n2 ) , which\nincludes an extra O ( n3 )\nterm.

      "text" : "The single-variable discretization method can be extended to Bayesian networks with multiple continuous variables by iteratively discretizing individual variables. The discretization process for a single variable requires that all other variables be discrete. The iterative approach uses an initial discretization policy in order to start the process which assigns k equal-width intervals to each continuous variable, where k is the largest number of intervals of initially discrete variables in the network.\nAfter the initial discretization, the one-variable discretization method is iteratively applied over each continuous variable in reverse topoligical order, from the leaves to the root. Reverse topological order has the advantage of relying on fewer initial discretizations of the continuous variables during the first pass. For example, in the network of Figure 2, if S2 is the only discrete variable, then the discretization of P1 involves both P2 and X, whereas the discretization of C1 only involves X.\nThe algorithm is terminated when the number of discretization intervals and their associated edges converge for all variables, and a maximum number of complete passes is enforced to prevent infinite iterations when convergence does not occur. The algorithm typically converges within a few passes when tested on real-world data.\nThe pseudocode for the multi-variable discretization procedure is shown in Algorithm 2.

Three common approaches to Bayesian network structure learning are constraint-based, scorebased, and Bayesian model averaging (see Koller and Friedman 2009, chap. 18).

In practice, one maximizes the log-likelihood, also known as the Bayesian score, lnP (G | D) (Cooper and Herskovits 1992).\nFor a Bayesian network over N discrete and discretized variables X1:N , ri represents the number of instantiations of Xi, and qi represents the number of instantiations of the parents of Xi. If Xi has no parents, then qi = 1. The Bayesian score is:\nlnP (G | D) = lnP (G) + N∑ i=1 qi∑ j=1 ln\n Γ ( α (0) ij ) Γ ( α (0) ij + β (0) ij ) + ri∑ k=1 ln Γ ( α (k) ij + β (k) ij ) Γ ( α (k) ij ) , (12)\nwhere Γ is the gamma function, α (k) ij is a Dirichlet parameter and β (k) ij is the observed sample count for the kth instantiation of Xi and the jth instantiation of paXi . In the equation above,\nα (0) ij = ri∑ k=1 α (k) ij β (0) ij = ri∑ k=1 β (k) ij . (13)\nThe space of acyclic graphs is superexponential in the number of nodes; it is common to rely on heuristic search strategies (Koller and Friedman 2009). The K2 algorithm assumes a given topological ordering of variables and greedily adds parents to nodes to maximally increase the Bayesian score. A fixed ordering ensures acyclicity but does not guarantee a globally optimal network structure. K2 is typically run multiple times with different topological orderings, and the network with the highest likelihood is retained.\nTraditional Bayesian structure learning algorithms require discretized data, whereas the proposed discretization algorithm requires a known network structure. The dis-\ncretization methods can be combined with the K2 structure learning algorithm (Cooper and Herskovits 1992) to simultaneously perform Bayesian structure learning and discretization of continuous variables.\nThe proposed algorithm alternates between K2 structure learning and discretization. The dataset is initially discretized as was described in Section 4, and K2 is run to obtain an initial network structure. The affected continuous variables are rediscretized every time an edge is added by K2. The resulting discretization policies are used to update the discretized dataset, and the next step of the K2 algorithm is executed. This cycle is repeated until the K2 algorithm converges.\nThis procedure is given in Algorithm 3, and takes five inputs: D, a dataset of samples from the joint distribution; X, the set of all continuous variables; order, a permutation of the variables in D; n̂parent, an upper bound on the number of parents per node; and n̂cycle, an upper bound on the number of complete passes. The upper bound on the number of parents is common practice, and is used to prevent computing conditional distributions with excessively large parameter sets. The function g in Algorithm 3 computes a component of the Bayesian score (Equation 12):\ng ( Xi,paXi ) = qi∑ j=1 ln\n Γ ( α (0) ij ) Γ ( α\n(0) ij + β (0) ij\n) + ri∑\nk=1\nln\nΓ ( α (k) ij + β (k) ij ) Γ ( α\n(k) ij\n) .

As such, Algorithm 3 is run multiple times with different variable permutations and the discretized Bayesian network with the highest score is retained."

For a given Bayesian network, the first three terms only depend on the number of discretization intervals |X| and the fourth term is cumulative over the intervals. Hence, if Λ = 〈γ1, γ2, . . . , γk〉 is a MDL optimal discretization policy with k intervals, then Λ′ = 〈γ1, γ2, . . . , γk−1〉 is a MDL optimal discretization policy for the corresponding subproblem with k − 1 intervals.

Therefore, the runtime of the proposed method in this paper is shorter than the MDL discretization method by O ( n3 ) , since the former has a more efficient form of dynamical programming. For faster methods of MDL discretization with suboptimal results, see Friedman and Goldszmidt (1996).\nNote that the preliminary discretization and the discretization order of variables can be arbitrary for the MDL discretization method, as stated in the original work (Friedman and Goldszmidt 1996).

Two examples that MDL produces comparble results to the Bayesian method are given in the Appendix.\nFigure 4 shows the marginal probability density for variables A and C under the Bayesian discretization policy overlaid with the original Auto MPG data. The resulting probability density is a good match to the original data."

Figure 5 shows a learned Bayesian network structure and the corresponding numbers of intervals after discretization for each continuous variable. This result was obtained by running Algorithm 3 fifty times using the Bayesian method and choosing the structure with the highest K2 score (Equation 12).\nFigure 6 compares the Bayesian discretizaton policy for variables A and C in the learned network with the original Auto MPG data. The color of a discretized region indicates the marginal probability density of a sample from P (A,C) being drawn from that region. Although there are fewer discretization edges for A and C in the learned network, the marginal distribution is still captured. The discretization policy will vary as the network structure changes, and it still produces high-quality discretizations."

This structure was obtained by initially discretizing each continuous variable into three uniform-width intervals, where three is the median cardinality of the discrete variables, and then taking the structure with highest likelihood from 1000 runs of K2.\nTable 2 lists the discretization edges and mean log-likelihoods under 10-fold cross validation of the Bayesian network resulting from each discretization method. The Bayesian method outperforms the MDL method in likelihood by a significant margin.\nThe MDL method creates significantly fewer discretization edges. Some discretization edges appear in all three discretization methods, such as 1.42 and 2.35 for variable C and 0.785 for variable L. This indicates sufficiently MDL indeed can find some important discretization edges, but it is not sensitive to find more edges.\nFigure 8 compares the Bayesian and MDL discretizaton policies for variables E and K with the original Wine data. The discretization edges 17.9 for E and 34.6 for K appear in both plots. The MDL method does not use enough intervals for discretization. Relative sensitivities of each method to the input data is discussed in Section 6.4."

A comparison of Figures 9 and 7 show that the Bayesian network learned during the discretization process has more edges than the network learned on the initially discretized data. When a network is learned along with discretization, the algorithm has more freedom to adjust the structure and the discretization policy simultaneously to identify useful correlations and produce a denser structure.\nFigure 10 shows the discretization policy for variables E and K obtained with the Bayesian method. The discretization edge E = 17.9 also appears in both discretization policies from the fixed network (Figure 8). This suggests that discretization edges can be robust against network structure. Furthermore, the discretization edge at E = 23.5 in the fixed-structure case is missing in the learned structure. This is caused by E having twice as many parents in the learned network structure. The more parents\na variable has, the fewer discretization intervals it can to support, as the number of sufficient statistics required to define the resulting distribution increases exponentially with the number of parents."

This naturally leads to clusters of variables with many discretization intervals.\nFigures 15 and 16 show the discretization result for variables in the network shown in Figure 14.

Note that the third term of fMDL had been approximated using H(p) (see Equation 18) in the original work by Friedman and Goldszmidt (1996), but it is written here without that approximation.\nThe penalty terms tend to increase with the number of discretization intervals; the edge position terms vary with the position and number of the discretization edges. A policy with a larger number of discretization edges is only optimal if the edge position term varies enough with respect to the penalty term in order to produce a local minimum of sufficiently low value.\nThe value of the edge position term for MDL is primarily determined by the mutual information, which varies less severely than the corresponding terms in the Bayesian method. The MDL term uses empirical probability distributions based off of ratios of counts, whereas the Bayesian method uses factorial terms, and thus the MDL method varies less. The MDL method is therefore less sensitive to the discretization edges. This sensitivity gives rise to the relative performance of the two methods in the experiments conducted above."

Empirical demonstrations show that the proposed method is superior to the state of the art. In addition, this paper shows how to incorporate existing methods into the structure learning process to discretize all continuous variables and\nsimultaneously learn Bayesian network structures. The proposed method was incorporated and its superior performance was empirically demonstrated. Future work will investigate edge positions at locations other than the midpoints between samples and will extend the approach to cluster categorical variables with very many levels.

    "abstractText" : "Real data often contains a mixture of discrete and continuous variables, but many Bayesian network structure learning and inference algorithms assume all random variables are discrete. Continuous variables are often discretized, but the choice of discretization policy has significant impact on the accuracy, speed, and interpretability of the resulting models. This paper introduces a principled Bayesian discretization method for continuous variables in Bayesian networks with quadratic complexity instead of the cubic complexity of other standard techniques. Empirical demonstrations show that the proposed method is superior to the state of the art. In addition, this paper shows how to incorporate existing methods into the structure learning process to discretize all continuous variables and simultaneously learn Bayesian network structures.",
