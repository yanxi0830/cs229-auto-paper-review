      "text" : "In traditional machine learning paradigm, the classifiers are trained based on the features of training data, and the test is done using the same type of features. However, in real-world applications, there will be additional information that is only available during training but not available during test. For example, for the image categorization problem, we are usually classifying the images from different categories. Take the Caltech101 data set as an example, there are a total number of 101 object categories in the training set, and each of the object category has its associated descriptions, such as the textual descriptions from Wikipedia. The descriptions about each concept can be associated to each training image simply by using its label information, and hence they are only available at the training stage, but not available during the test phase. Another example is the learning from weakly labeled web images. The images in the Web are usually associated with descriptions from tags that are uploaded by the users. The tag information can be collected during training data collection. However, during test we may only have the test images that do not contain any descriptions.\nThe aforementioned two examples fall into the new learning paradigm of the Learning using Privileged Informa-\ntion (LUPI) [Vapnik and Vashist, 2009], in which the additional information is referred to as the privileged information. The Support Vector Machine using Privileged Information (SVM+) [Vapnik and Vashist, 2009] has been proposed for utilizing the privileged information. As the hinge loss is used in [Vapnik and Vashist, 2009], we refer to the formulation in their work as SVM1+ in the following. It has been proved theoretically that the incorporating of the additional privileged information can improve the convergence rate [Pechyony and Vapnik, 2010]. The SVM+ attracts much attention recently [Vapnik and Izmailov, 2015; Lopez-Paz et al., 2015; Lapin et al., 2014], and has been successfully applied to different applications [Niu et al., 2016; Sharmanska et al., 2013; Fouad et al., 2012]. Following this learning scenario, some recent works proposed to utilize the privileged information for the different learning scenarios such as learning to rank [Sharmanska et al., 2013], Gaussian Process classifier [Hernández-Lobato et al., 2014], clustering [Feyereisl and Aickelin, 2012] and distance metric learning [Fouad et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2015].\nHowever, the proposed optimization method for SVM1+ in [Vapnik and Vashist, 2009] is based on its dual form. If there are a total number of n training data, the corresponding dual problem is a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem with 2n variables, which is 2 times larger than the dual form of the standard SVM [Cortes and Vapnik, 1995] with only n variables. Besides, as the constraints in the dual form of SVM+ are different with those in the dual form of the standard SVM, the efficient implementations and the off-the-shelf solvers for SVM such as LibSVM [Chang and Lin, 2001] and SVMLight [Joachims, 1999] can not be readily utilized, and the additional efforts must be spent to design the specific solvers for optimization of SVM1+ [Pechyony et al., 2010].\nTo overcome the aforementioned problem, in this work, we study the optimization of SVM+. Specifically, we propose a new objective function called Support Vector Machine using Privileged Information with Squared Hinge Loss (SVM2+) by simply replacing the hinge loss in SVM1+ with the squared hinge loss. The dual form of SVM2+ is a Quadratic Programming (QP) problem with only n variables, which significantly reduces the training complexity. What’s more, the dual form of SVM2+ shares the same form with the dual of the standard SVM. Therefore, the existing off-theshelf QP solvers for SVM can be readily applied to solve the\nproposed objective function.\nWe apply our proposed approach to the image categorization tasks by leveraging the additional information from web knowledge. We evaluate our algorithms on Caltech101 dataset with the additional textual descriptions for the training data obtained from Wikipedia, as well as the WebQueries dataset with the additional tag information. The extensive empirical results show that our proposed SVM2+ can achieve 110.6 (resp. 92.5) times speedup on Caltech101 (resp.WebQueries) when compared with the solution for SVM1+ as in [Vapnik and Vashist, 2009] yet with comparable classification accuracies. Hence, the experimental evaluation demonstrates both the efficiency and the effectiveness of our proposed SVM2+ algorithm for utilizing the additional web knowledge as privileged information for the task of image categorization.\nIn the following, we firstly introduce the SVM1+ in Section 2. In Section 3, we propose the objective function and the solution for SVM2+. The experimental results are shown in Section 4 and finally the conclusions are given in Section 5."

      "text" : "For the classical machine learning paradigm, we are given a set of n independent and identically distributed (IID) training pairs {(x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn)} with xi ∈ X ⊂ Rd and yi ∈ Y ⊂ R that are generated according to a fixed but unknown probability distribution P (x, y). The target of any machine learning algorithm is therefore to learn a function f(x) that can make the risk functional R(f) = 1 2 ∫\n|y − f(x)|dP (x, y) minimized. Different from the classical learning paradigm, the Learning using Privileged Information (LUPI) paradigm tackles the learning senario where an additional “teacher” is only available in the training phase but not available during the test phase. Specifically, we are given a set of n independent and identically distributed training triplets {(x1, z1, y1), . . . , (xn, zn, yn)} with xi ∈ X ⊂ R\nd, zi ∈ Z ⊂ Rs and yi ∈ Y ⊂ R that are generated according to a fixed but unknown probability distributionP (x, z, y). In the test phase, the aim is the same with that of the classical learning paradigm, i.e., classifying any test samples xi’s, where i = n+ 1, . . . , n+m. The X is referred to as the decision space as the test is done only in X , while Z is referred to as the correcting space [Pechyony and Vapnik, 2010].\nThe support vector machine using privileged information (SVM+) has been proposed in [Vapnik and Vashist, 2009] for utilizing the privileged information. Specifically, f(x) = w′x + b is the decision function based on the main feature x and g(z) = z′v + ρ is the correcting function based on the privileged information z, and the SVM+ with hinge loss (SVM1+) is proposed to optimize the following objective\nfunction [Vapnik and Vashist, 2009]:\nmin w,v,b,ρ,ξi\n1 2 ||w||2 + C\nn ∑\ni=1\nξi + λ\n2 ||v||2\ns.t., z′iv + ρ = ξi,\nyi (w ′xi + b) ≥ 1− ξi, (1)\nξi ≥ 0.\nThe objective function in (1) is solved in its dual form as in [Vapnik and Vashist, 2009; Vapnik and Izmailov, 2015]. Specifically, by introducing the non-negative multipliers α = [α1, . . . , αn]\n′ and β = [β1, . . . , βn]′, the dual form is given as in the following Quadratic Programming (QP) problem:\nmax α,β\nα′1− 1\n2 (α⊙ y)′K(α⊙ y)\n− 1\n2λ (α+ β − C1)′K̃(α+ β − C1)\ns.t., n ∑\ni=1\n(αi + βi − C) = 0, (2)\nn ∑\ni=1\nαiyi = 0,\nαi ≥ 0, βi ≥ 0,\nwhere y = [y1, . . . , yn]′ ∈ Rn is the label vector, 1 = [1, . . . , 1]′ ∈ Rn, ⊙ is the elementwise product between two vectors/matrices, K ∈ Rn×n with Kij = x′ixj is the kernel matrix obtained from the main feature x, while K̃ ∈ Rn×n with K̃ij = z′izj is the kernel matrix constructed using the privileged information z. Although it is linear kernel here, any type of non-linear kernel [Xu et al., 2013] can be readily utilized in (2).\nNote that the dual problem in (2) is a standard 2n × 2n QP problem, and it can be solved by the general QP solver. However, the 2n × 2n problem in (2) takes more memory and requires more training time than the original SVM dual form in a n×n QP problem. Moreover, due to the introduced constraints for the α and β, the existing efficient solvers for the SVM (e.g., LibSVM and SVMLight) cannot be readily applied to solve (2). Therefore, additional efforts are required for the development of the efficient solution and the softwares such as [Pechyony et al., 2010].\nIn the following, we propose the SVM+ with squared hinge loss, and we are interested to see that we can obtain a QP problem in size of n×n that is also in the same form with the standard dual form of SVM and can therefore be solved using any off-the-shelf efficient QP solver developed for SVM."

      "text" : "In order to solve the SVM+ more efficiently and motivated by the using of squared hinge loss for SVM [Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000], we propose the Support Vector Machine using Privileged Information with Squared Hinge Loss (SVM2+). We learn the decision function f(x) = w′x + b as well as the correcting function\ng(z) = v′zi 1 by optimizing the following objective function:\nmin w,v,b,ξi\n1 2 ||w||2 + C 2\nn ∑\ni=1\nξ2i + λ\n2 ||v||2\ns.t., v′zi = ξi, (3)\nyi (w ′xi + b) ≥ 1− ξi,\nwhere C and λ are still the two regularization parameters. In the objective function (3), we just simply replace the original hinge loss (i.e., ∑n\ni=1 ξi) in (1) with the squared hinge loss (i.e., ∑n\ni=1 ξ 2 i ). The improvement looks quite simple and straightforward, but we can observe the significant differences and the benefits in the dual form as shown in the following proposition 1. Proposition 1. The dual form of the optimization problem in (3) is given as in the following form:\nmin α\n1 2 (α⊙ y)′ (K+Qλ ⊙ (yy ′)) (α⊙ y) −α′1,\ns.t. α ≥ 0,α′y = 0, (4)\nwhere y = [y1, . . . , yn]′ ∈ Rn is the label vector, 1 = [1, . . . , 1]′ ∈ Rn, ⊙ is the elementwise product between any two vectors/matrices, α = [α1, . . . , αn]′ ∈ Rn is the vector of the Lagrangian multipliers, K ∈ Rn×n with Kij = x′ixj is the kernel matrix constructed from x, and Qλ ∈ Rn×n is a deformed kernel matrix in the form of\nQλ = 1\nλ\n(\nK̃− K̃\n(\nλ C In + K̃\n) −1\nK̃\n)\n, (5)\nwhere K̃ ∈ Rn×n with K̃ij = z′izj is the kernel matrix constructed from z.\nNote that similarly for SVM1+, we just use the linear kernel as a demonstration, but any type of non-linear kernel can be readily utilized in (4).\nInterestingly, we observe that the optimization problem in (4) is just a n×n Quadratic Programming (QP) problem. We only need to optimize with respect to the n dual variables α rather than the 2n dual variables as in (2). The reduced dual problem can not only save memory for optimization but also reduce the computational complexity. Although there is an additional matrix inversion operation as in (5), it can be done very efficiently when compared with the optimization of the QP problem. We reduce the size of the dual form by utilizing the squared hinge loss instead of the hinge loss.\nMore importantly, the QP problem in (4) also shares the same form with the QP problem of that of the classical SVM [Cortes and Vapnik, 1995]. The difference is the changing of the kernel matrix as in the QP problem. Specifically, we can just replace the kernel matrix K in the original SVM to be K+Qλ ⊙ (yy′). More interestingly, the matrix Qλ is simply a transformation of the kernel matrix K̃ constructed on the privileged information by using (5). The QP problem in (4) can be readily solved by any existing solvers (e.g., LibSVM) specifically developed for the standard SVM.\n1We augment an additional 1 to the feature vector z to incorporate the bias term, and thus z should be replaced with [z; 1] ∈ Rs+1, but we still use z to represent the augmented feature vector for ease of presentation."

The SVM is trained based only on the visual feature extracted from images, and the SVM2K is a two-view learning algorithm that trains two classifiers on the two views simultaneously, and we only use the view from visual feature for prediction. Therefore, the SVM2K, SVM1+ and SVM2+ all utilized the additional privileged information during training. However, only the images are used for the test for all the algorithms as the privileged information is not available in our learning setting. For all the algorithms, we set all the regularization parameters in the range of {10−3, 10−2, . . . , 103}. The best result from each algorithm is reported for performance comparisons."

We can observe that the additional privileged information does help the classification tasks for both the datasets by using the LUPI framework. Therefore, it is beneficial to utilize the web knowledge for the task of image categorization. Besides, the SVM2K is worse than SVM and the other algorithms, which shows that the training of the two-view classifiers is not effective for the LUPI learning paradigm. We observe that the results from SVM2+ on the two datasets are slightly better than the results from SVM1+, which demonstrates that it is more suitable to utilize the squared hinge loss for the SVM+ on these two applications. Besides, the training speed differs significantly as shown later.\nWe compare the training CPU time of the different algorithms with a Lenovo desktop (3.20GHz CPU with 8GB RAM) and Matlab implementation. The parameters with the best classification accuracy for each algorithm are used to report the training time. As the SVM1+ cannot be fit into the standard QP solver for SVM, we utilize the commercial software Mosek4 with academic license to solve the Quadratic Programming problem. For SVM and SVM2+, we all utilize the LibSVM5 solver. The results in Table 3 show the CPU time of each algorithm on the whole Caltech101 and WebQueries datasets.
