The latter requires domain knowledge and is thus henceforth assumed to be set and known in advance to the learner. Surprisingly, even under this assumption, the problem of choosing the optimal k and α is not fully understood and has been studied extensively since the 1950’s under many different regimes. Most of the theoretic work focuses on the asymptotic regime in which the number of samples n goes to infinity Devroye et al. (2013); Samworth et al. (2012); Stone (1977), and ignores the practical regime in which n is finite. More importantly, the vast majority of k-NN studies aim at finding an optimal value of k per dataset, which seems to overlook the specific structure of the dataset and the properties of the data points whose labels we wish to estimate. While kernel based methods such as NadarayaWatson enable an adaptive choice of the weight vector α, theres still remains the question of how to choose the kernel’s bandwidth σ, which could be thought of as the parallel of the number of neighbors k in k-NN. Moreover, there is no principled approach towards choosing the kernel function in practice.\nIn this paper we offer a coherent and principled approach to adaptively choosing the number of neighbors k and the corresponding weight vector α ∈ Rk per decision point. Given a new decision point, we aim to find the best locally weighted predictor, in the sense of minimizing the distance between our prediction and the ground truth. In addition to yielding predictions, our approach enbles us to provide a per decision point guarantee for the confidence of our predictions. Fig. 1 illustrates the importance of choosing k adaptively. In contrast to previous works on non-parametric regression/classification, we do not assume that the data {(xi, yi)}ni=1 arrives from some (unknown) underlying distribution, but rather make a weaker assumption that the labels {yi}ni=1 are independent given the data points {xi}ni=1, allowing the latter to be chosen arbitrarily. Alongside providing a theoretical basis for our approach, we conduct an empirical study that demonstrates its superiority with respect to the state-of-the-art.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce our setting and assumptions, and derive the locally optimal prediction problem. In Section 3 we analyze the solution of the above prediction problem, and introduce a greedy algorithm designed to efficiently find the exact solution. Section 4 presents our experimental study, and Section 5 concludes."

      "text" : "Asymptotic universal consistency is the most widely known theoretical guarantee for k-NN. This powerful guarantee implies that as the number of samples n goes to infinity, and also k →∞, k/n→ 0, then the risk of the k-NN rule converges to the risk of the Bayes classifier for any underlying data distribution. Similar guarantees hold for weighted k-NN rules, with the additional assumptions that ∑k i=1 αi = 1 and maxi≤n αi → 0, Stone (1977); Devroye et al. (2013). In the regime of practical interest where the number of samples n is finite, using k = b √ nc neighbors is a widely mentioned rule of thumb Devroye et al. (2013). Nevertheless, this rule often yields poor results, and in the regime of finite samples it is usually advised to choose k using cross-validation. Similar consistency results apply to kernel based local methods Devroye et al. (1980); Györfi et al. (2006).\nA novel study of k-NN by Samworth, Samworth et al. (2012), derives a closed form expression for the optimal weight vector, and extracts the optimal number of neighbors. However, this result is only optimal under several restrictive assumptions, and only holds for the asymptotic regime where n → ∞. Furthermore, the above optimal number of neighbors/weights do not adapt, but are rather fixed over all decision points given the dataset. In the context of kernel based methods, it is possible to extract an expression for the optimal kernel’s bandwidth σ Györfi et al. (2006); Fan and Gijbels (1996). Nevertheless, this bandwidth is fixed over all decision points, and is only optimal under several restrictive assumptions.\nThere exist several heuristics to adaptively choosing the number of neighbors and weights separately for each decision point. In Wettschereck and Dietterich (1994); Sun and Huang it is suggested to use local cross-validation in order to adapt the value of k to different decision points. Conversely, Ghosh Ghosh (2007) takes a Bayesian approach towards choosing k adaptively. Focusing on the multiclass classification setup, it is suggested in Baoli et al. (2004) to consider different values of k for each class, choosing k proportionally to the class populations. Similarly, there exist several attitudes towards adaptively choosing the kernel’s bandwidth σ, for kernel based methods Abramson (1982); Silverman (1986); Demir and Toktamiş (2010); Aljuhani et al. (2014).\nLearning the distance metric for k-NN was extensively studied throughout the last decade. There are several approaches towards metric learning, which roughly divide into linear/non-linear learning methods. It was found that metric learning may significantly affect the performance of k-NN in numerous applications, including computer vision, text analysis, program analysis and more. A comprehensive survey by Kulis Kulis (2012) provides a review of the metric learning literature. Throughout this work we assume that the distance metric is fixed, and thus the focus is on finding the best (in a sense) values of k and α for each new data point.\nTwo comprehensive monographs, Devroye et al. (2013) and Biau and Devroye (2015), provide an extensive survey of the existing literature regarding k-NN rules, including theoretical guarantees, useful practices, limitations and more."

      "text" : "In this section we present our setting and assumptions, and formulate the locally weighted optimal estimation problem. Recall we seek to find the best local prediction in a sense of minimizing the distance between this prediction and the ground truth. The problem at hand is thus defined as follows: We are given n data points x1, . . . , xn ∈ Rd, and n corresponding labels1 y1, . . . , yn ∈ R. Assume that for any i ∈ {1, . . . , n} = [n] it holds that yi = f(xi) + i, where f(·) and i are such that:\n(1) f(·) is a Lipschitz continuous function: For any x, y ∈ Rd it holds that |f(x)− f(y)| ≤ L · d(x, y), where the distance function d(·, ·) is set and known in advance. This assumption is rather standard when considering nearest\n1Note that our analysis holds for both setups of classification/regression. For brevity we use a classification task terminology, relating to the yi’s as labels. Our analysis extends directly to the regression setup.\nneighbors-based algorithms, and is required in our analysis to bound the socalled bias term (to be later defined). In the binary classification setup we assume that f : Rd 7→ [0, 1], and that given x its label y ∈ {0, 1} is distributed Bernoulli(f(x)).\n(2) i’s are noise terms: For any i ∈ [n] it holds that E [ i|xi] = 0 and | i| ≤ b for some given b > 0. In addition, it is assumed that given the data points {xi}ni=1 then the noise terms { i}ni=1 are independent. This assumption is later used in our analysis to apply Hoeffding’s inequality and bound the so-called variance term (to be later defined). Alternatively, we could assume that E [ 2i |xi] ≤ b (instead of | i| ≤ b), and apply Bernstein inequalities. The results and analysis remain qualitatively similar.\nGiven a new data point x0, our task is to estimate f(x0), where we restrict the estimator f̂(x0) to be of the form f̂(x0) = ∑n i=1 αiyi. That is, the estimator is a weighted average of the given noisy labels. Formally, we aim at minimizing the absolute distance between our prediction and the ground truth f(x0), which translates into\nmin α∈∆n ∣∣∣∣∣ n∑ i=1 αiyi − f(x0) ∣∣∣∣∣ (P1), where we minimize over the simplex, ∆n = {α ∈ Rn| ∑n i=1 αi = 1 and αi ≥ 0, ∀i}. Decomposing the objective of (P1) into a sum of bias and variance terms, we arrive at the following relaxed objective:∣∣∣∣∣ n∑ i=1 αiyi − f(x0) ∣∣∣∣∣ = ∣∣∣∣∣ n∑ i=1 αi (yi − f(xi) + f(xi))− f(x0)\n∣∣∣∣∣ =\n∣∣∣∣∣ n∑ i=1 αi i + n∑ i=1 αi (f(xi)− f(x0)) ∣∣∣∣∣ ≤\n∣∣∣∣∣ n∑ i=1 αi i ∣∣∣∣∣+ ∣∣∣∣∣ n∑ i=1 αi (f(xi)− f(x0)) ∣∣∣∣∣ ≤\n∣∣∣∣∣ n∑ i=1 αi i ∣∣∣∣∣+ L n∑ i=1 αid(xi, x0).\nBy Hoeffding’s inequality (see supplementary material) it follows that | ∑n\ni=1 αi i| ≤ C‖α‖2 for C = b √ 2 log ( 2 δ ) , w.p. at least 1− δ. We thus arrive at a new optimization problem (P2), such that solving it would yield a guarantee for (P1) with high\nprobability:\nmin α∈∆n C‖α‖2 + L n∑ i=1 αid(xi, x0) (P2).\nThe first term in (P2) corresponds to the noise in the labels and is therefore denoted as the variance term, whereas the second term corresponds to the distance between f(x0) and {f(xi)}ni=1 and is thus denoted as the bias term."

      "text" : "In this section we discuss the properties of the optimal solution for (P2), and present a greedy algorithm which is designed in order to efficiently find the exact solution of the latter objective (see Section 3.1). Given a decision point x0, Theorem 3.1 demonstrates that the optimal weight αi of the data point xi is proportional to −d(xi, x0) (closer points are given more weight). Interestingly, this weight decay is quite slow compared to popular weight kernels, which utilize sharper decay schemes, e.g., exponential/inversely-proportional. Theorem 3.1 also implies a cutoff effect, meaning that there exists k∗ ∈ [n], such that only the k∗ nearest neighbors of x0 donate to the prediction of its label. Note that both α and k∗ may adapt from one x0 to another. Also notice that the optimal weights depend on a single parameter L/C, namely the Lipschitz to noise ratio. As L/C grows k∗ tends to be smaller, which is quite intuitive.\nWithout loss of generality, assume that the points are ordered in ascending order according to their distance from x0, i.e., d(x1, x0) ≤ d(x2, x0) ≤ . . . ≤ d(xn, x0). Also, let β ∈ Rn be such that βi = Ld(xi, x0)/C. Then, the following is our main theorem:\nTheorem 3.1. There exists λ > 0 such that the optimal solution of (P2) is of the form\nα∗i = (λ− βi) · 1 {βi < λ}∑n i=1 (λ− βi) · 1 {βi < λ} . (1)\nFurthermore, the value of (P2) at the optimum is Cλ.\nFollowing is a direct corollary of the above Theorem:\nCorollary 3.2. There exists 1 ≤ k∗ ≤ n such that for the optimal solution of (P2) the following applies:\nα∗i > 0; ∀i ≤ k∗ and α∗i = 0; ∀i > k∗.\nProof of Theorem 3.1. Notice that (P2) may be written as follows:\nmin α∈∆n\nC ( ‖α‖2 + α>β ) (P2).\nWe henceforth ignore the parameter C. In order to find the solution of (P2), let us first consider its Lagrangian:\nL(α, λ,θ) = ‖α‖2 + α>β + λ ( 1−\nn∑ i=1 αi\n) −\nn∑ i=1 θiαi,\nwhere λ ∈ R is the multiplier of the equality constraint ∑\ni αi = 1, and θ1, . . . , θn ≥ 0 are the multipliers of the inequality constraints αi ≥ 0, ∀i ∈ [n]. Since (P2) is convex, any solution satisfying the KKT conditions is a global minimum. Deriving the Lagrangian with respect to α, we get that for any i ∈ [n]:\nαi ‖α‖2 = λ− βi + θi.\nDenote by α∗ the optimal solution of (P2). By the KKT conditions, for any α∗i > 0 it follows that θi = 0. Otherwise, for any i such that α ∗ i = 0 it follows that θi ≥ 0, which implies λ ≤ βi. Thus, for any nonzero weight α∗i > 0 the following holds: α∗i ‖α∗‖2 = λ− βi. (2)\nSquaring and summing Equation (2) over all the nonzero entries of α, we arrive at the following equation for λ:\n1 = ∑ α∗i>0 (α∗i ) 2 ‖α∗‖22 = ∑ α∗i>0 (λ− βi)2. (3)\nNext, we show that the value of the objective at the optimum is Cλ. Indeed, note that by Equation (2) and the equality constraint ∑ i α ∗ i = 1, any α ∗ i > 0 satisfies\nα∗i = λ− βi A , where A = ∑ α∗i>0 (λ− βi). (4)\nPlugging the above into the objective of (P2) yields C ( ‖α∗‖2 + α∗>β ) = C\nA √∑ α∗i>0 (λ− βi)2 + C A ∑ α∗i>0 (λ− βi)(βi − λ+ λ)\n= C A − C A ∑ α∗i>0 (λ− βi)2 + Cλ A ∑ α∗i>0 (λ− βi)\n= Cλ,\nwhere in the last equality we used Equation (3), and substituted A = ∑\nα∗i>0 (λ −\nβi).\n3.1 Solving (P2) Efficiently\nNote that (P2) is a convex optimization problem, and it can be therefore (approximately) solved efficiently, e.g., via any first order algorithm. Concretely, given an accuracy > 0, any off-the-shelf convex optimization method would require a running time which is poly(n, 1 ) in order to find an -optimal solution to (P2)2. Note that the calculation of (the unsorted) β requires an additional computational cost of O(nd).\nHere we present an efficient method that computes the exact solution of (P2). In addition to the O(nd) cost for calculating β, our algorithm requires an O(n log n) cost for sorting the entries of β, as well as an additional running time of O(k∗), where k∗ is the number of non-zero elements at the optimum. Thus, the running time of our method is independent of any accuracy , and may be significantly better compared to any off-the-shelf optimization method. Note that in some cases Indyk and Motwani (1998), using advanced data structures may decrease the cost of finding the nearest neighbors (i.e., the sorted β), yielding a running time substantially smaller than O(nd+ n log n).\nOur method is depicted in Algorithm 1. Quite intuitively, the core idea is to greedily add neighbors according to their distance form x0 until a stopping condition is fulfilled (indicating that we have found the optimal solution). Letting CsortNN, be the computational cost of calculating the sorted vector β, the following theorem presents our guarantees.\nTheorem 3.3. Algorithm 1 finds the exact solution of (P2) within k∗ iterations, with an O(k∗ + CsortNN) running time.\nProof of Theorem 3.3. Denote by α∗ the optimal solution of (P2), and by k∗ the corresponding number of nonzero weights. By Corollary 3.2, these k∗ nonzero weights correspond to the k∗ smallest values of β. Thus, we are left to show that (1) the optimal λ is of the form calculated by the algorithm; and (2) the algorithm halts after exactly k∗ iterations and outputs the optimal solution.\n2Note that (P2) is not strongly-convex, and therefore the polynomial dependence on 1/ rather than log(1/ ) for first order methods. Other methods such as the Ellipsoid depend logarithmically on 1/ , but suffer a worse dependence on n compared to first order methods.\nAlgorithm 1 k∗-NN\nInput: vector of ordered distances β ∈ Rn, noisy labels y1, . . . , yn ∈ R Set: λ0 = β1 + 1, k = 0 while λk > βk+1 and k ≤ n− 1 do\nUpdate: k ← k + 1\nCalculate: λk = 1 k (∑k i=1 βi + √ k + (∑k i=1 βi )2 − k ∑k i=1 β 2 i ) end while Return: estimation f̂(x0) = ∑ i αiyi, where α ∈ ∆n is a weight vector such\nαi = (λk−βi)·1{βi<λk}∑n i=1(λk−βi)·1{βi<λk}\nLet us first find the optimal λ. Since the non-zero elements of the optimal solution correspond to the k∗ smallest values of β, then Equation (3) is equivalent to the following quadratic equation in λ:\nk∗λ2 − 2λ k∗∑ i=1 βi + ( k∗∑ i=1 β2i − 1 ) = 0.\nSolving for λ and neglecting the solution that does not agree with αi ≥ 0, ∀i ∈ [n], we get\nλ = 1\nk∗  k∗∑ i=1 βi + √√√√k∗ +( k∗∑ i=1 βi )2 − k∗ k∗∑ i=1 β2i  . (5) The above implies that given k∗, the optimal solution (satisfying KKT) can be directly derived by a calculation of λ according to Equation (5) and computing the αi’s according to Equation (1). Since Algorithm 1 calculates λ and α in the form appearing in Equations (5) and (1) respectively, it is therefore sufficient to show that it halts after exactly k∗ iterations in order to prove its optimality. The latter is a direct consequence of the following conditions:\n(1) Upon reaching iteration k∗ Algorithm 1 necessarily halts.\n(2) For any k ≤ k∗ it holds that λk ∈ R.\n(3) For any k < k∗ Algorithm 1 does not halt.\nNote that the first condition together with the second condition imply that λk is well defined until the algorithm halts (in the sense that the “ > ”operation in the while condition is meaningful). The first condition together with the third condition imply that the algorithm halts after exactly k∗ iterations, which concludes the proof. We are now left to show that the above three conditions hold:\nCondition (1): Note that upon reaching k∗, Algorithm 1 necessarily calculates the optimal λ = λk∗ . Moreover, the entries of α ∗ whose indices are greater than k∗ are necessarily zero, and in particular, α∗k∗+1 = 0. By Equation (1), this implies that λk∗ ≤ βk∗+1, and therefore the algorithm halts upon reaching k∗.\nIn order to establish conditions (2) and (3) we require the following lemma:\nLemma 3.4. Let λk be as calculated by Algorithm 1 at iteration k. Then, for any k ≤ k∗ the following holds:\nλk = min α∈∆(k)n\n( ‖α‖2 + α>β ) , where ∆(k)n = {α ∈ ∆n : αi = 0, ∀i > k}\nThe proof of Lemma 3.4 appears in Appendix B. We are now ready to prove the remaining conditions.\nCondition (2): Lemma 3.4 states that λk is the solution of a convex program over a nonempty set, therefore λk ∈ R.\nCondition (3): By definition ∆ (k) n ⊂ ∆(k+1)n for any k < n. Therefore, Lemma 3.4 implies that λk ≥ λk+1 for any k < k∗ (minimizing the same objective with stricter constraints yields a higher optimal value). Now assume by contradiction that Algorithm 1 halts at some k0 < k\n∗, then the stopping condition of the algorithm implies that λk0 ≤ βk0+1. Combining the latter with λk ≥ λk+1, ∀k ≤ k∗, and using βk ≤ βk+1, ∀k ≤ n, we conclude that:\nλk∗ ≤ λk0+1 ≤ λk0 ≤ βk0+1 ≤ βk∗ .\nThe above implies that αk∗ = 0 (see Equation (1)), which contradicts Corollary 3.2 and the definition of k∗.\nRunning time: Note that the main running time burden of Algorithm 1 is the calculation of λk for any k ≤ k∗. A naive calculation of λk requires an O(k) running time. However, note that λk depends only on ∑k i=1 βi and ∑k i=1 β 2 i . Updating these sums incrementally implies that we require only O(1) running time per iteration, yielding a total running time of O(k∗). The remaining O(CsortNN) running time is required in order to calculate the (sorted) β."

We present here only a high-level description of both cases, and defer the formal details to the full version of the paper.\nThe solution of (P2) is a high probability upper-bound on the true prediction error | ∑n i=1 αiyi − f(x0)|. Two interesting cases to consider in this context are βi = 0 for all i ∈ [n], and β1 = . . . = βn = β > 0. In the first case, our algorithm includes all labels in the computation of λ, thus yielding a confidence bound of 2Cλ = 2b √\n(2/n) log (2/δ) for the prediction error (with probability 1−δ). Not surprisingly, this bound coincides with the standard Hoeffding bound for the task of estimating the mean value of a given distribution based on noisy observations drawn from this distribution. Since the latter is known to be tight (in general), so is the confidence bound obtained by our algorithm. In the second case as well, our algorithm will use all data points to arrive at the confidence bound 2Cλ = 2Ld + 2b √ (2/n) log (2/δ), where we denote d(x1, x0) = . . . = d(xn, x0) = d.

(2014). Learning the distance metric for k-NN was extensively studied throughout the last decade. There are several approaches towards metric learning, which roughly divide into linear/non-linear learning methods. It was found that metric learning may significantly affect the performance of k-NN in numerous applications, including computer vision, text analysis, program analysis and more. A comprehensive survey by Kulis Kulis (2012) provides a review of the metric learning literature.

The question of setting the optimal number of neighbors as well as the optimal weights has received much attention throughout the years, nevertheless this problem seems to have remained unsettled. In this paper we offer a simple approach to locally weighted regression/classification, where we make the biasvariance tradeoff explicit. Our formulation enables us to phrase a notion of optimal weights, and to efficiently find these weights as well as the optimal number of neighbors efficiently and adaptively, for each data point whose value we wish to estimate. The applicability of our approach is demonstrated on several datasets, showing superior performance over standard locally weighted methods.",
