      "text" : "In a variety of large-scale streaming data problems, ranging from motion imagery formation to network analysis, dynamical models of the environment play a key role in performance. Classical stochastic filtering methods such as Kalman or particle filters or Bayesian updates (Bain & Crisan, 2009) readily exploit dynamical models for effective prediction and tracking performance. However, classical methods are also limited in\nProceedings of the 30 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Atlanta, Georgia, USA, 2013. JMLR: W&CP volume 28. Copyright 2013 by the author(s).\ntheir applicability because (a) they typically assume an accurate, fully known dynamical model and (b) they rely on strong assumptions regarding a generative model of the observations. Some techniques have been proposed to learn the dynamics (Xie et al., 1994; Theodor & Shaked, 1996), but the underlying model still places heavy restrictions on the nature of the data. Performance analysis of these methods usually does not address the impact of “model mismatch”, where the generative models are incorrectly specified.\nA contrasting class of prediction methods is based on an “individual sequence” or “universal prediction” (Merhav & Feder, 1998) perspective; these strive to perform provably well on any individual observation sequence. In particular, online convex programming methods (Nemirovsky & Yudin, 1983; Beck & Teboulle, 2003; Zinkevich, 2003; Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi, 2006) rely on the gradient of the instantaneous loss of a predictor to update the prediction for the next data point. The aim of these methods is to ensure that the per-round performance approaches that of the best offline method with access to the entire data sequence. This approach allows one to sidestep challenging issues associated with statistically dependent or nonstochastic observations, misspecified generative models, and corrupted observations. This framework is limited as well, however, because performance bounds are typically relative to either static or piecewise constant comparators and do not adequately reflect adaptivity to a dynamic environment.\nThis paper describes a novel framework for prediction in the individual sequence setting which incorporates dynamical models – effectively a novel combination of state updating from stochastic filter theory and online convex optimization from universal prediction. We establish tracking regret bounds for our proposed algorithm, Dynamic Mirror Descent (DMD), which scale with the deviation of a comparator sequence from a sequence evolving with a known dynamic. These bounds simplify to previously shown bounds, when there are\nar X\niv :1\n30 1.\n12 54\nv1 [\nst at\n.M L\n] 7\nJ an\n2 01\n3\nno dynamics. We further establish tracking regret bounds for another algorithm, Dynamic Fixed Share (DFS), which scale with the deviation of a comparator sequence from a sequence evolving with the best sequence of dynamical models. While our methods and theory apply in a broad range of settings, we are particularly interested in the setting where the dimensionality of the parameter to be estimated is very high relative to the data volume. In this regime, the incorporation of both dynamical models and sparsity regularization plays a key role. With this in mind, we focus on a class of methods which incorporate regularization as well as dynamical modeling. The role of regularization, particularly sparsity regularization, is increasingly well understood in batch settings and has resulted in significant gains in ill-posed and data-starved settings (Banerjee et al., 2008; Ravikumar et al., 2010; Candès et al., 2006; Belkin & Niyogi, 2003).\nIn our experiments, we consider reconstructing motion imagery from sequential observations collected with a compressive camera and estimating the dynamic social network underlying over 200 years of U.S. Senate rollcall data. There has been significant recent interest in using models of temporal structure to improve time series estimation from compressed sensing observations (Angelosante et al., 2009; Vaswani & Lu, 2010) or for time-varying networks (Snijders, 2001; Kolar et al., 2010); the associated algorithms, however, are typically batch methods poorly suited to large quantities of streaming data. This paper strives to bridge that gap."

      "text" : "Let X denote the domain of our observations, and let Θ denote a convex feasible set. Given sequentially arriving observations x ∈ X∞, we wish to construct a sequence of predictions θ̂ = (θ̂1, θ̂2, . . .) ∈ Θ∞, where θ̂t may depend only on the currently available observations xt−1 = (x1, . . . , xt−1). We pose our problem as a dynamic game between a Forecaster and the Environment. At time t, the Forecaster computes a prediction, θ̂t and the Environment generates the observation xt. The Forecaster then experiences the loss `t(θ̂t), defined as follows. Let F and R denote families of convex functions, and let ft(·),f(·, xt) ∈ F be a cost function measuring the accuracy of the prediction θ̂t with respect to the datum xt. Similarly, let r(·) ∈ R be a regularization term which does not change over time; for instance, r might promote sparsity or other low-dimensional structure in the potentially high-dimensional space Θ. The loss at time t\nis `t(·),ft(·) + r(·)\nwhere\n`t ∈ L,{` = f + r : f ∈ F , r ∈ R}.\nThe task facing the Forecaster is to create a new prediction θ̂t+1 based on the previous prediction and the new observation, with the goal of minimizing loss at the next time step. We characterize the efficacy of θ̂T,(θ̂1, θ̂2, . . . , θ̂T ) ∈ ΘT relative to a comparator sequence θT,(θ1, θ2, . . . , θT ) ∈ ΘT as follows: Definition 1 (Regret). The regret of θ̂T with respect to a comparator θT ∈ ΘT is\nRT (θT ), T∑ t=1 `t(θ̂t)− T∑ t=1 `t(θt).\nPrevious work proposed algorithms which yielded regret of O( √ T ) for static comparators, where θt = θ for all t. Our goal is to develop an online convex optimization algorithm with low regret relative to a broad family of time-varying comparator sequences. In particular, our main result is an algorithm which incorporates a dynamical model, denoted Φt, which admits a regret bound of the form O( √ T [1+ ∑ t ‖θt+1−Φt(θt)‖]). This bound scales with the compartor sequence’s deviation from the dynamical model Φt – a stark contrast to previous tracking regret bounds which are only sublinear for comparators which change slowly with time or at a small number of distinct time instances."

      "text" : "In much of the online learning literature, the comparator sequence is constrained to be static or timeinvariant. In this paper we refer to the regret with respect to a static comparator as static regret:\nDefinition 2 (Static regret). The static regret of θ̂T is\nRT, T∑ t=1 `t(θ̂t)−min θ∈Θ T∑ t=1 `t(θ).\nStatic regret bounds are useful in characterizing how well an online algorithm performs relative to, say, a loss-minimizing batch algorithm with access to all the data simultaneously. More generally, static regret bounds compare the performance of the algorithm against a static point, θ∗, which can be chosen with full knowledge of the data.\nHowever, this form of analysis fails to illuminate the performance of online algorithms in dynamic settings\nwhere a static comparator is inappropriate. Performance relative to a temporally-varying or dynamic comparator sequence has been studied previously in the literature in the context of tracking regret, shifting regret (Herbster & Warmuth, 2001; Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2012), and the closely-related concept of adaptive regret (Littlestone & Warmuth, 1994; Hazan & Seshadhri, 2009).\nIn particular, tracking regret compares the output of the online algorithm to a sequence of points θ∗1 , θ ∗ 2 , ..., θ ∗ T which can be chosen collectively with full knowledge of the data. This is a fair comparison for a batch algorithm that detects and fits to drift in the data, instead of fitting a single point. Frequently, in order to bound tracking regret there needs to be a measure of the complexity of the sequence θ∗1 , θ ∗ 2 , ..., θ ∗ T+1. Typically, this complexity is characterized via a measure of the temporal variability of the sequence, such as\nV (θT ), T∑ t=1 ‖θt+1 − θt‖.\nIf this complexity is allowed to be very high, we could imagine that the comparator series would fit the series of losses closely and hence generalize poorly. Conversely if this complexity is restricted to be 0, the tracking regret becomes equivalent to static regret. Tracking and shifting regret are the same concept, although the term shifting regret is used more in the “experts” setting, while tracking regret tends to be a more generic term.\nAdaptive regret is a related concept to tracking regret. Instead of measuring accumulated regret over the entire series, however, adaptive regret measures accumulated loss over an arbitrary time interval of length τ , and measures performance against a static comparator chosen optimally on this interval:\nRτ, max [r,s]⊂[1,T ];s+1−r≤τ [ s∑ t=r `t(θ̂t)−min θ∈Θ s∑ t=r `t(θ) ]\nThis is a valuable metric as it assures that a process will have low loss not just globally, but also at any given moment. Intuitively we can see that an algorithm with low adaptive regret on any interval should also have low tracking regret and vice versa. The relationship between the two has been formally shown (Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2012).\nIn this paper, we present tracking/shifting regret bounds which rely on a much more general notion of the complexity of a comparator sequence. In particular, we could measure the complexity of a sequence in terms of how much it deviates from a given dynamical\nmodel, denoted Φt:\nVΦ(θT ), T∑ t=1 ‖θt+1 − Φt(θt)‖. (1)\nUltimately, we consider a family of dynamical models, and we measure the complexity of a comparator in terms of how much it deviates from the best sequence of dynamical models in this family. (These concepts will be formalized and detailed in the next two sections.)\nIt is intuitively satisfying that this measure appears in the bound. Firstly, if the comparator actually follows the dynamics, we would imagine this complexity to be very small, leading to low tracking regret. This fact holds whether Φt is part of the generative model for the observations or not. Secondly, we can get a dynamic analog of static regret, where we enforce VΦ(θT ) = 0. This is equivalent to saying that the batch comparator is fitting the best single trajectory using Φt instead of the best single point. Using this, we would recover a bound analogous to a static regret bound in a stationary setting.\nConcurrent related work considers online algorithms where the data sequence is described by a “predictable process” (Rakhlin & Sridharan, 2012). By knowing a good estimate for the underlying process, they can create a prediction sequence that follows accordingly, reducing overall loss. However, they express their results in terms of a static regret bound (i.e., regret with respect to a static comparator) with a variation term that expresses the deviation of the input data from the underlying process. In contrast, we make no assumptions about the data itself, but instead on the comparator series, and form tracking regret bounds."

      "text" : "One common approach to forming the predictions θ̂t, Mirror Descent (MD) (Nemirovsky & Yudin, 1983; Beck & Teboulle, 2003), consists of solving the following optimization problem:\nθ̂t+1 =arg min θ∈Θ\nηt〈∇`t(θ̂t), θ〉+D(θ‖θ̂t), (2)\nwhere ∇`t(θ) denotes an arbitrary subgradient of `t at θ, D(θ‖θ̂t) is the Bregman divergence between θ and θ̂, and ηt ≥ 0 is a step size parameter. Let ψ denote a continuously differentiable function that is σ-strongly convex with respect to a norm ‖ · ‖ on the set Θ for some σ > 0; the Bregman divergence associated with\nψ is defined as\nD(θ1‖θ2) =Dψ(θ1‖θ2) (3a) ,ψ(θ1)− ψ(θ2)− 〈∇ψ(θ2), θ1 − θ2〉 (3b) ≡D(θ3‖θ2) +D(θ1‖θ3)\n+ 〈∇ψ(θ2)−∇ψ(θ3), θ3 − θ1〉 (3c)\nfor all θ1, θ2, θ3 ∈ Θ, and the strong convexity of ψ implies\nD(θ1‖θ2) ≥ σ\n2 ‖θ1 − θ2‖2.\nThe MD approach is a generalization of online learning algorithms such as online gradient descent (Zinkevich, 2003) and weighted majority (Littlestone & Warmuth, 1994). Several recently proposed methods consider the data-fit term separately from the regularization term (Duchi et al., 2010; Xiao, 2010; Langford et al., 2009). For instance, consider Composite Objective Mirror Descent (COMD) (Duchi et al., 2010):\nθ̂t+1 =arg min θ∈Θ\nηt〈∇ft(θ̂t), θ〉+ ηtr(θ) +D(θ‖θ̂t). (4)\nThis formulation is helpful when the regularization function r(θ) promotes sparsity in θ, and helps en-\nsure that the individual θ̂t are indeed sparse, rather than approximately sparse as are the solutions to the MD formulation. The regret of this approach has previously been characterized as follows:\nTheorem 3 (Static regret for COMID (Duchi et al., 2010)). Let Gf,maxθ∈Θ,f∈F ‖∇f(θ)‖, Dmax = maxθ1,θ2∈ΘD(θ1‖θ2) and assume that θ,θ1 = θ2 = · · · = θT . If r(θ̂1) = 0 and ηt = (2σDmax) 1/2/(Gf √ T ), then\nRT (θT ) ≤ Gf (2TDmax/σ)1/2."

      "text" : "Unlike the bound in Theorem 3, tracking or shifting regret (Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi, 2006; Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2012) bounds typically consider piecewise constant comparators, where θt − θt−1 = 0 for all but m values of t, where m is a constant, or yield regret bounds which scale with ∑ t ‖θt − θt−1‖. In this paper, we develop tracking regret bounds which are small for much broader classes of dynamic comparator sequences.\nIn particular, we propose the following alternative to (2) and (4), which we call Dynamic Mirror Descent\n(DMD). Let Φt : Θ 7→ Θ denote a predetermined dynamical model, and set\nθ̃t+1 =arg min θ∈Θ\nηt〈∇ft(θ̂t), θ〉+ ηtr(θ) +D(θ‖θ̂t)\n(5a)\nθ̂t+1 = Φt(θ̃t+1) (5b)\nBy including Φt in the process, we effectively search for a predictor which (a) attempts to minimize the loss\nand (b) which is close to θ̃t under the transformation of Φt. This is similar to a stochastic filter which alternates between using a dynamical model to update the “state”, and then uses this state to perform the filtering action. A key distinction of our approach, however, is that we make no assumptions about Φt’s relationship to the observed data.\nOur approach effectively includes dynamics into the COMID approach. Indeed, for a case with no dynamics, so that Φt(θ) ≡ θ for all θ and t, our method is equivalent to COMID. Rather than considering COMID, we might have used other online optimization algorithms, such as the Regularized Dual Averaging (RDA) method (Xiao, 2010), which has been shown to achieve similar performance with more regularized solutions. However, to the best of our knowledge, no tracking or shifting regret bounds have been derived for dual averaging methods (regularized or otherwise). Recent results on the equivalence of COMID and RDA (McMahan, 2011) suggest that the bounds derived here might also hold for a variant of RDA, but proving this remains an open problem.\nOur main result uses the following definitions:\nG`, max θ∈Θ,`∈L ‖∇`(θ)‖\nM, 1\n2 max θ∈Θ ‖∇ψ(θ)‖\nDmax, max θ,θ′∈Θ\nD(θ′‖θ),\nand ∆Φt, max θ,θ′∈Θ\nD(Φθ‖Φθ′)−D(θ‖θ′),\nTheorem 4. Let Φt be a dynamical model such that ∆Φt ≤ 0. Let the sequence θ̂T be as in (5b), and let θT be an arbitrary sequence in Θ\nT . Then the Dynamic Mirror Descent (DMD) algorithm using a nonincreasing series ηt+1 ≤ ηt gives\nRT (θT ) ≤ Dmax ηT+1 + 4M ηT VΦt(θT ) + G2` 2σ T∑ t=1 ηt (6)\nwith VΦt(θT ), T∑ t=1 ‖θt+1 − Φt(θt)‖ (7)\nwhere VΦt(θT ) measures variations or deviations of the comparator sequence θT from the dynamical model Φt.\nNote that when Φt corresponds to an identity operator, the bound in Theorem 4 corresponds to existing tracking or shifting regret bounds (Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi, 2006; Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2012). The condition that ∆Φt ≤ 0 is similar to requiring that Φt be a contraction mapping. This restriction is important; without it, any poor prediction made at one time step could be magnified by repeated application of the dynamics. Additive models and matrix multiplications with all eigenvalues less than or equal to unity satisfy this restriction. Notice also that if Φt = I for all t, the theorem gives a novel tracking regret bound for COMID. To prove Theorem 4, we employ the following lemma, which is proven in Section 9.\nLemma 5. Let the sequence θ̂T be as in (5b), and let θT be an arbitrary sequence in Θ T ; then\n`t(θ̂t)− `t(θt) ≤ 1\nηt\n[ D(θt‖θ̂t)−D(θt+1‖θ̂t+1) ] +\n∆Φt ηt + 4M ηt ‖θt+1 − Φt(θt)‖+ ηt 2σ G2` .\nProof of Theorem 4: The proof is a matter of summing the bounds of Lemma 5 over time. For simplicity denote Dt,D(θt‖θ̂t) and Vt,‖θt+1 − Φt(θt)‖. Then\nRT (θT ) ≤ T∑ t=1 ( Dt ηt − Dt+1 ηt+1 ) + G2` 2σ T∑ t=1 ηt\n+Dmax T∑ t=1 ( 1 ηt+1 − 1 ηt ) + T∑ t=1 4M ηt Vt\n≤Dmax ηT+1 + 4M ηT VΦt(θT ) + G2` 2σ T∑ t=1 ηt.\nWe set ηt using the doubling trick (Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi, 2006) whereby time is divided into increasingly longer segments, and on each interval a temporary time horizon is fixed, known, and used to determine an optimal step size (generally proportional to the inverse of the square root of the time horizon). This approach yields the regret bound:\nR(θT ) = O( √ T [1 + VΦt(θT )])\nThis proof shares some ideas with the tracking regret bounds of (Zinkevich, 2003), but uses properties of the Bregman Divergence to eliminate some terms, while additionally incorporating dynamics."

      "text" : "DMD in the previous section uses a single dynamical model. In practice, however, we do not know the best dynamical model to use, or the best model may change over time in nonstationary environments.\nTo address this challenge, we assume a finite set of candidate dynamical models {Φ(1)t ,Φ (2) t , . . .Φ (N) t }, and describe a procedure which uses this collection to adapt to nonstationarities in the environment. In particular, we establish tracking regret bounds for a comparator class with different dynamical models on different time intervals. This class, Θm, can be described as all predictors defined on m+1 segments [ti, ti+1−1] with time points 1 = t1 < · · · < tm+2 = T + 1. For a given θT ∈ Θm and k = 1, . . . ,m+ 1, let\nV (m+1)(θT ),\nmin t2,...,tm+1 m+1∑ k=1 min ik∈{1,...,N} tk+1−1∑ t=tk ‖θt+1 − Φ(ik)t (θt)‖\ndenote the deviation of the sequence θT from the best series of m+ 1 dynamical models.\nLet θ̂ (i) t denote the output of the DMD algorithm of Section 5 using dynamical model Φ (i) t . Then tracking regret can be expressed as:\nRT (Θm) = T∑ t=1 `t(θ̂t)− min i1,...,iT T∑ t=1 `t ( θ̂ (it) t ) ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nT1\n+ min i1,...,iT T∑ t=1 `t ( θ̂ (it) t ) − min θ∈Θm T∑ t=1\n`t(θt)︸ ︷︷ ︸ T2 (8)\nwhere the minimization in the second term of T1 and first term of T2 is with respect to sequences of dynamical models with at most m switches, such that∑T t=1 1[it 6=it+1] ≤ m. In (8), T1 corresponds to the tracking regret of our algorithm relative to the best sequence of dynamical models within the DMD framework, and T2 is the regret of that sequence relative to the best comparator in the class Θm.\nWe choose θ̂t by using the Fixed Share (FS) forecaster on the DMD estimates of (5), θ̂ (i) t . In FS, each expert (here, each candidate dynamical model) is assigned a weight that is inversely proportional to its cumulative loss at that point yet with some weight shared amongst all the experts, so that an expert with very small weight can quickly regain weight to become the\nleader (Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi, 2006). Our estimate is:\nw̃i,t =wi,t−1 exp(−ηr`t(θ̂(i)t )) (9) wi,t =(λ/N) ∑N j=1 w̃j,t + (1− λ)w̃i,t (10)\nθ̂t = N∑ i=1 wi,tθ̂ (i) t / N∑ i=1 wi,t.

Here λ is usually chosen to be mT where m is an upper bound on the number of switches, independent of T . Again, if T is not known in advance the doubling trick can be used. Note that V (m+1)(θT ) ≤ V\nΦ (i) t (θT ) for any fixed i ∈ {1, . . . , N}, thus this approach generally yields lower regret than using a fixed dynamical model. However, we incur some loss by not knowing the optimal number of switches m or when the switching times are; these are accounted for in T1.\nWe use the Fixed Share algorithm as a means to amalgamate estimates with different dynamics, however other methods could be used with various tradeoffs. The Fixed Share algorithm, for instance, has linear complexity with low regret, but with respect to a comparator class with fixed number of switches. Other algorithms can accommodate larger classes of experts, or not assume knowledge of the number of switches, but come at the price of higher regret or complexity as explained in (Gyorgy et al., 2012)."

Notice that John Kerry (DMA) has generally low loss, spikes around 2006, and then drops again before a reelection campaign in 2008.\nLooking at the network estimates of DFS across time (as in Figure 5) we can see tight factions forming in the mid- to late-1800s (post Civil War), followed by a time when the factions dissipate in the mid-1900s during the Civil Rights Movement. Finally, we see factions again forming in more recent times. The seats are sorted separately for each matrix to emphasize groupings, which align with known political factions."

      "text" : "In this paper we have proposed a novel online optimization method, called Dynamic Mirror Descent (DMD), which incorporates dynamical model state updates. There is no assumption that there is a “true” known underlying dynamical model, or that the best dynamical model is unchanging with time. The proposed Dynamic Fixed Share (DFS) algorithm adaptively selects the most promising dynamical model from a family of candidates at each time step. Recent work on shifting or tracking regret bounds for online convex optimization further suggest that the techniques developed in this paper may also be useful for bounding adaptive regret or developing methods for automatically tuning step-size parameters (Cesa-\nBianchi et al., 2012). In experiments with real and simulated data, DMD shows strong tracking behavior even when underlying dynamical models are switching."

    "abstractText" : "This paper describes a new online convex optimization method which incorporates a family of candidate dynamical models and establishes novel tracking regret bounds that scale with the comparator’s deviation from the best dynamical model in this family. Previous online optimization methods are designed to have a total accumulated loss comparable to that of the best comparator sequence, and existing tracking or shifting regret bounds scale with the overall variation of the comparator sequence. In many practical scenarios, however, the environment is nonstationary and comparator sequences with small variation are quite weak, resulting in large losses. The proposed Dynamic Mirror Descent method, in contrast, can yield low regret relative to highly variable comparator sequences by both tracking the best dynamical model and forming predictions based on that model. This concept is demonstrated empirically in the context of sequential compressive observations of a dynamic scene and tracking a dynamic social network.",
