      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "When a user submits a query, search engines return organic search results as a list of ranked URLs. Sometimes URLs linked to landing pages of ads (sponsored search results) are also displayed along with the organic search results. Sponsored search URLs displayed above the organic search results are called mainline ads, while those displayed on the side are called sidebar ads. Search engines generate revenue when users click on ads. In this paper we are interested in modeling how users interact with and click on sponsored search results. In particular, we focus on mainline ads since a majority of user clicks and hence revenue can be attributed to these ads.\nMining click-through logs is an important component of the never ending quest of commercial search engines to surface the most relevant (sponsored) search results in response to an user query. To understand this, consider the following scenario: Suppose documents d and d′ are displayed in response to a query q. If the number of clicks that d receives is disproportionately high compared to d′, one can reasonably conclude that d is more relevant than d′ for q. While this approach of learning from the “wisdom of the crowd” is cheaper than employing a human labeler, it is not without its fair share of difficulties. For instance, it is well known that user clicks display a position bias, that is, documents at higher ranked positions are more likely to be clicked than lower ranked documents. There is a rich body of research which tries to infer an unbiased estimate of the document relevance from click-through logs by explicitly modeling user behavior using click models.\nAlmost all existing click models are designed for organic search, and make the simplifying assumption that users interact with the search results sequentially [12, 13]. In other words, they assume that a user examines an URL at position i + 1 only after examining the URLs at positions 1, . . . , i. Furthermore, since an overwhelming majority of user sessions end after one click, many models focus exclusively on this scenario. However, based on the analysis of the click logs of a commercial search engine, we observed that user interaction with sponsored search results do not confirm to these assumptions. Approximately 10% of the user sessions with clicks contain more than one click. Furthermore, in approximately 30% of multi-click sessions at least one pair of clicks is in reverse order (e.g., a click at position 3 followed by a click at position 1). This situation is depicted graphically in Figure 1.\nWe conjecture that users scan all the sponsored search results before they begin clicking. This is because sponsored search results are shown in a small block at the beginning of the page and usually occupy only 4 to 8 lines. Perhaps, eye tracking studies [9] which are often used to support the linear scan assumption in organic search may not apply to sponsored search1. Therefore, meaningful click models for sponsored search need to model reverse clicks.\nUnlike organic search, where short snippets of the landing page of a search result is displayed, sponsored search results are designed to grab attention. Towards this end, they employ titles that are short, catchy, and some words (which match query terms) are displayed in bold font. An sponsored search result might look very attractive to an user, but after clicking on it she might realize that the landing page does not contain the information that she wants. In other words, not only the attractiveness but also the postclick relevance of a sponsored search result are important factors for user satisfaction in sponsored search.\nSomewhat surprisingly, most existing click models either do not distinguish between attractiveness and post-click relevance or use very simple methods of estimating attractiveness. However, consider the following: the presence of the words “bonded and insured” in the title can make a sponsored search result more attractive for the query “plumber”. If we can share such information across all sponsored search results displayed in response to the query “plumber”, we can accurately estimate attractiveness.\n1Validating our conjecture using carefully designed user studies is an interesting research direction in its own right, but is unfortunately beyond the scope of the current work\nIn this paper, we present a novel statistical click model which models reverse clicks, and incorporates a new method for estimating attractiveness. Like in previous work [15, 16, 5] we also assume a separable model, that is, the user propensity for clicking on a search result is a product of the probability of examining that position and the attractiveness of the document displayed at that position. However, our key insight is that the examination probability of a position as well as the attractiveness of a position changes over time and depends on the user’s past click experience.\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows: We propose a new click model for user interaction with sponsored search results. Our model can handle multiple click sessions as well as user sessions where the order of clicks is reversed. Furthermore, we present a new method for estimating attractiveness which shares information across multiple sponsored search results displayed in response to a user query. Our model is flexible and can easily incorporate user fatigue, pre-click and post-click relevance of an ad, and externalities. We derive an efficient one-pass inference mechanism for estimating parameters. Finally, we show that our model comprehensively outperforms existing click models in large scale empirical evaluation using real-life data from a large commercial search engine."

      "heading" : "2. CLICK MODELS: A BRIEF REVIEW",
      "text" : "In what follows we will use the terms documents, ads, urls, and sponsored search results interchangeably. Almost all click prediction models make the following separability assumptions: (1) A document is clicked if and only if it is examined (or viewed); (2) The probability that a document is clicked is independent of its position given that it was viewed; (3) The probability that a document is viewed is independent of the document given the position, and is independent of the other ads presented.\nExamination Hypothesis. Let Ei (resp. Ci) be a random variable which is equal to 1 if a document di at position i was examined (resp. clicked). Based on the above assumptions one can write:\nP (Ci = 1 | di) = P (Ci = 1 ∩ Ei = 1 | di)\n= P (Ci = 1 | di, Ei = 1) ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nrelevance\nP (Ei = 1) ︸ ︷︷ ︸ position bias . (1)\nIn other words, the probability of a document being clicked can be factored into the product of the relevance of the document and the position bias. This is the so-called examination hypothesis [15] or separability assumption [1].\nCascade Model and Extensions. The cascade model [6] assumes that users scan the documents from top to bottom without skipping, that is, users examine the ads sequentially:\nP (Ei = 1|Ei−1 = 1) = 1 and P (Ei = 1|Ei−1 = 0) = 0. (2)\nThe cascade model [6] further assumes that users examine documents until they find an appropriate one, and then abandon the search after the first click:\nP (Ei = 1|Ei−1 = 1, Ci−1) = 1−Ci−1. (3)\nThe basic cascade model can only deal with query sessions with a single click. The dependent click model (DCM) [11] extends this to multi-click sessions, by modifying (3) to\nP (Ei = 1|Ei−1 = 1, Ci−1) = (λi−1) Ci−1 . (4)\nHere λi is estimated from the empirical probability that a browsing session did not end after a click at position i.\nThe user browsing model (UBM) [7] extends the DCM by assuming that the examination probability depends on the last clicked position in the same query session. In other words\nP (Ei = 1 |C1, . . . , Ci) = βri , (5)\nwhere ri denotes the position of the previous click, that is, ri := argmaxj I (Cj = 1). The Bayesian browsing model (BBM) [14] models relevance P (Ci = 1 | di, Ei = 1) as a random variable, and uses a Bayesian approach to estimate its value.\nDynamic Bayesian Network Model. The dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) [4] model differs from the above click models in two important ways. First, it distinguishes between attractiveness (also called perceived relevance or pre-click relevance in literature [16]) and post-click relevance. Second, it incorporates user fatigue. This leads to\nP (Ci−1 = 1|di−1, Ei−1 = 1) = θdi−1 (6)\nP (Ei = 1|Ei−1 = 1, Ci−1) = λi−1 ( 1− ρdi−1 )Ci−1 . (7)\nHere, ρdi−1 (resp. θdi−1) denotes the post-click satisfaction (resp. attractiveness) of document di−1 displayed at position i − 1. For simplicity, one can set λi−1 = λ for all i [4], or like in the DCM estimate λi−1 from empirical probabilities. Similarly, θdi−1 is estimated (essentially) by counting the number of times a document was displayed and the number of times it was clicked. As we will see later in the paper, estimating the attractiveness by using a naive-Bayes like model leads to information sharing and hence better estimates for the attractiveness.\nRecently [3] extended the DBN by learning a per-query fatigue parameter and adding a variable to indicate if the user is likely to interact with sponsored search results or directly skip over them. A related model to DBN is the click chain model (CCM) [10].\nTemporal Hidden Click Model. Some recent work [18] has focused on incorporating revisiting behaviors into click models. However, the temporal hidden click model (THCM) proposed by the authors of [18] does not distinguish between attractiveness and post-click relevance. Furthermore, THCM allows for only two kinds of transitions namely\nP (Ei = 1|Ei−1 = 1) = α (8)\nP (Ei−2 = 1|Ei−1 = 1) = γ, (9)\nwith α+γ ≤ 1. Note that the transition probabilities do not depend on the location i − 1. Furthermore, the probability of examining a position decays exponentially with distance from the current location.\nEffect of Externalities. Externalities [8] refer to the observation that the click on a document also depends on the quality of other documents presented on the same search result page. That is, the examination event will be affected not only by the documents shown above a certain position, but also by the documents below a certain position.\nMuch of the early work on click models considers the displayed documents as being independent of each other. Some recent work has tried to take externalities into account. For instance, [17] proposed a conditional random fields based model to click prediction to consider the externalities., [19] considers externalities but restrict their attention to sessions with just two ads. On the other hand, [16] showed that the relevance of a document at a position is not constant and it is affected by the clicks in other positions. In the context of news recommendation, [2] extended the basic DBN model to take into account a sub-modular information gain score, which affects the relevance of a document. Although a similar extension is also possible in our setting, for the sake of brevity we will omit discussing this for our model."

      "heading" : "3.1 Notation",
      "text" : "Since we have to deal with reverse clicks, our notation is non-standard. Given a query q, we assume that the user is presented with a ranked list of n documents or sponsored search results D = {d1, . . . , dn}, and she might choose to click on 0 ≤ n̂ ≤ n documents. We consider this as a query session. Let ci ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n} be a multinomial random variable; ci for 1 ≤ i ≤ n̂ denotes the position of the i-th click, and we let both c0 and cn̂+1 to be equal to 0. Let c1:i = (c1, c2, · · · , ci), and c be a shorthand for c1:n̂+1.\nThe user browsing behavior in sponsored search can be ex-\nplained by Figure 2. After clicking on a document, the user has two choices: she can abandon the session or she can choose to return and click on any other document that has not been clicked so far. Users abandon a session for one of two reasons:\n• In the abandon with satisfaction case, the user found the information she was looking for in the sponsored search results. We capture this behavior via a Bernoulli random variable si, which takes on a value of 1 when the user is satisfied after clicking the document dci−1 at position ci−1. This, in turn, depends on the post-click relevance of the clicked document, which we denote as ρdci−1 . In other words,\nP (si = 1 | ci−1,D) = ρdci−1 . (10)\nBy default, we will set P (si = 1 | c0,D) = 0.\n• In the abandon without satisfaction case, the user may choose to skip ahead to the organic search results or close the browsing session. This behavior is captured via another Bernoulli random variable ti, which depends upon the perseverance of the user. We will let\nP (ti = 1 | si = 0, ci−1) = ηi, (11)\nwhere ηi denotes the probability that user will abandon the session after i clicks.\nAs one can expect, the perseverance of the user decreases as the number of clicks increase. This allows our model to capture the effect of externalities in the following natural way: The user fatigue parameter multiplied by the pre-click relevance gives the instantaneous pre-click relevance of a document. If an ad appears alongside other highly relevant ads which have already received clicks, then its instantaneous pre-click relevance reduces. In other words, the number of previous clicks observed is a direct measure of externalities (relevance of other documents). On the other hand, when the user decides to continue, then two factors influence the position of the next click:\n• She will choose a position based on attractiveness of the documents presented. We denote the attractiveness of the document at position ci by aci , and assume that the attractiveness of the documents at different positions is independent of each other. Furthermore, let a denote the n-dimensional vector of ai and\nP (aci = 1 | D) = θdci . (12)\n• The position of the previous click influences the position of the next click, the so-called position bias effect. This is captured using vi a n dimensional random vector, whose distribution is given by γci−1\nP (vi,j = 1 | c1:i−1) = γci−1,j . (13)\nHere γci−1,j denotes the probability that the user transitions to position j after the previous click at position ci−1. We allow for non-zero γci−1,j even if j < ci−1. This is different from existing click models which assume that users scan the list linearly, that is ci > ci−1."

For infrequent queries (search volume less than 50 in a one week window) we let Dq be the entire training corpus, while for frequent queries (which occur with frequency greater than 50) we restrict Dq to the documents displayed in response to q.

The advantage of our method is that we share information across documents in the collection Dq . For instance, if a word w occurs frequently in documents which are clicked in response to a query, then it is very likely to be a relevant word for that query and our method gives it a high weight. Another advantage of our method is that we are able to address the cold start problem; we can estimate the attractiveness of a new sponsored search result based on the words that appear in the ad copy."

      "text" : "In the first part of our experimental evaluation we are mainly interested in understanding how well our algorithm is able to infer post-click relevance. After all, this is the main motivation behind studying click models. Since other models do not distinguish between attractiveness and post-click relevance, we will only compare our algorithm with the dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) model of [4]. Details of this experiment can be found in Section 4.3.\nFor our second set of experiments (Sections 4.4 to 4.8) we focus on verifying that our model is able to predict the sequence of user clicks accurately. Click models are usually evaluated by computing average perplexity, or the closely related log-likelihood on the test set. Recall that the perplexity for a single user session is computed as\np = 2− 1 n ∑n i=1 Ci log qi+(1−Ci) log(1−qi), (19)\nwhere qi is the probability of observing a click at position i as predicted by the model and Ci indicates if an actual user click was observed at that position.\nHowever, we believe that perplexity alone does not tell the full story. For instance, the perplexity scores of our model (1.1932) and DBN (1.1984) are very similar, but they differ vastly in terms of how well they predict a sequence of user clicks. Similarly, a model which simply predicts qi as the empirical click-through rate, especially for high decile queries, achieves very low perplexity but is unable to explain a sequence of user clicks (also see the results for the AM below). Therefore, we adapt a stronger evaluation criterion which is designed to answer the following natural questions:\n• How well does the model predict the first click position?\n• How well does the model predict two, three, and all four click sequences? This is a very stringent evaluation criterion for multiple click models, and the model wins only if it predicts all clicks in the sequence correctly.\n• Even if the model makes mistakes in predicting the actual click sequence, we want to understand whether the actual click sequence ranks high in terms of loglikelihood.\n• Does the model predict the top two and three clicks correctly? In other words, the predicted click sequence need not be in the same order as the actual click sequence but the model needs to accurately predict whic h ads were clicked. For instance, if the actual click sequence was {1, 2} and the model predicts {2, 1} then this is considered to be a correct prediction as per this metric. Note that predicting the top four clicks in a four click session will always be 100% accurate.\n• How does the model fare in terms of predicting and ranking of sessions with reverse clicks?\nIntuitively, predicting well on higher decile queries is easier than lower decile queries. In order to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various model, for all the above cases we report their performance across different query deciles."

The documents are ranked based on the computed score, and we measure precision vs recall. The results for our model and DBN are plotted in Figure 4. Clearly our proposed model outperforms DBN consistently across recalls. In particular note that our model has high precision at low recall and is therefore able to rank relevant documents higher on the list as compared to DBN.

The model accuracies are comparable when predicting four click sequences, which are only a very small fraction of the data.\nAlthough AM is very competitive when predicting the first click, it is unable to predict longer click sequences accurately. This is because users do not decide to click on an ad solely based on its attractiveness, position bias and past click experience also plays an important role and needs to be taken into account.\nFigure 6 shows the accuracy of the models for two, three and four click prediction across different query deciles. Note that we consistently outperform other models across all query deciles in two click sequence prediction.

(26)\nκ′d counts the number of sessions which ended after clicking on the document d, while κd is the number of sessions which did not end after a click on document d.\nAs a consequence of using the Beta prior, we can estimate\nηj = β′j + α η j\nβ′j + α η j + βj + β η j\nand ρd = κ′d\nκ′d + κd (27)\nFurthermore, since γi ∼ Dir(α γ i ), we can estimate:\nγi,j = δi,j + α\nγ i,j\n∑\nj(δi,j + α γ i,j)\n. (28)\nA.1 Time Complexity In order to perform the updates (27) and (28) we need to compute the quantities defined in (21) – (26). However, all these quantities involve simple counts, which can be computed by using one-pass through the click logs. Therefore, we can conclude that inference in our model is extremely salable."

However, existing click models are lacking in two aspects. First, they do not share information across search results when computing attractiveness. Second, they assume that users interact with the search results sequentially. Based on our analysis of the click logs of a commercial search engine, we observe that the sequential scan assumption does not always hold, especially for sponsored search results. To overcome the above two limitations, we propose a new click model. Our key insight is that sharing information across search results helps in identifying important words or key-phrases which can then be used to accurately compute attractiveness of a search result. Furthermore, we argue that the click probability of a position as well as its attractiveness changes during a user session and depends on the user’s past click experience. Our model seamlessly incorporates the effect of externalities (quality of other search results displayed in response to a user query), user fatigue, as well as pre and post-click relevance of a sponsored search result. We propose an efficient one-pass inference scheme and empirically evaluate the performance of our model via extensive experiments using the click logs of a large commercial search engine.",
