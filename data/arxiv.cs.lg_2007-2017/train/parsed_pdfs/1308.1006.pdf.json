      "text" : "In this paper, we address minimization and maximization problems of the following form:\nProblem 1: min X∈C f(X), Problem 2: max X∈C f(X)\nwhere f : 2V → R is a discrete set function on subsets of a ground set V = {1, 2, · · · , n}, and C ⊆ 2V is a family of feasible solution sets. The set C could express, for example, that solutions must be an independent set in a matroid, a limited budget knapsack, or a cut (or spanning tree, path, or matching) in a graph. Without making any further assumptions about f , the above problems are trivially worst-case exponential time and moreover inapproximable.\nIf we assume that f is submodular, however, then in many cases the above problems can be approximated and in some cases solved exactly in polynomial time. A function f : 2V → R is said to be submodular [9] if for all subsets S, T ⊆ V , it holds that f(S) + f(T ) ≥ f(S ∪ T ) + f(S ∩ T ). Defining f(j|S) , f(S ∪ j)− f(S) as the gain of j ∈ V with respect to S ⊆ V , then f is submodular if and only if f(j|S) ≥ f(j|T ) for all S ⊆ T and j /∈ T . Traditionally, submodularity has been a key structural property for problems in combinatorial optimization, and for applications in econometrics, circuit and game theory, and operations research. More recently, submodularity’s popularity in machine learning has been on the rise.\nOn the other hand, a potential stumbling block is that machine learning problems are often large (e.g., “big data”) and are getting larger. For general unconstrained submodular minimization, the computational\n∗A shorter version of this appeared in Proc.

These algorithms are designed to solve the most general case and the worst-case instances are often contrived and unrealistic. Typical-case instances are much more benign, so simpler algorithms (e.g., graph-cut) might suffice. In the constrained case, however, the problems often become NP-complete. Algorithms for submodular maximization are very different in nature from their submodular minimization cohorts, and their complexity too varies depending on the problem. In any case, there is an urgent need for efficient, practical, and scalable algorithms for the aforementioned problems if submodularity is to have a lasting impact on the field of machine learning.\nIn this paper, we address the issue of scalability and simultaneously draw connections across the apparent gap between minimization and maximization problems. We demonstrate that many algorithms for submodular maximization may be viewed as special cases of a generic minorize-maximize framework that relies on discrete semidifferentials. This framework encompasses state-of-the-art greedy and local search techniques, and provides a rich class of very practical algorithms. In addition, we show that any approximate submodular maximization algorithm can be seen as an instance of our framework.\nWe also present a complementary majorize-minimize framework for submodular minimization that makes two contributions. For unconstrained minimization, we obtain new nontrivial bounds on the lattice of minimizers, thereby reducing the possible space of candidate minimizers. This method easily integrates into any other exact minimization algorithm as a preprocessing step to reduce running time. In the constrained case, we obtain practical algorithms with bounded approximation factors. We observe these algorithms to be empirically competitive to more complicated ones.\nAs a whole, the semidifferential framework offers a new unifying perspective and basis for treating submodular minimization and maximization problems in both the constrained and unconstrained case. While it has long been known [9] that submodular functions have tight subdifferentials, our results rely on a recently discovered property [18, 22] showing that submodular functions also have superdifferentials. Furthermore, our approach is entirely combinatorial, thus complementing (and sometimes obviating) related relaxation methods."

      "heading" : "2 Motivation and Background",
      "text" : "Submodularity’s escalating popularity in machine learning is due to its natural applicability. Indeed, instances of Problems 1 and 2 are seen in many forms, to wit:\nMAP inference/Image segmentation: Markov Random Fields with pairwise attractive potentials are important in computer vision, where MAP inference is identical to unconstrained submodular minimization solved via minimum cut [3]. A richer higher-order model can be induced for which MAP inference corresponds to Problem 1 where V is a set of edges in a graph, and C is a set of cuts in this graph — this was shown to significantly improve many image segmentation results [22]. Moreover, [6] efficiently solve MAP inference in a sparse higher-order graphical model by restating the problem as a submodular vertex cover, i.e., Problem 1 where C is the set of all vertex covers in a graph.\nClustering: Variants of submodular minimization have been successfully applied to clustering problems [38, 36].\nLimited Vocabulary Speech Corpora: The problem of finding a maximum size speech corpus with bounded vocabulary [32] can be posed as submodular function minimization subject to a size constraint. Alternatively, cardinality can be treated as a penalty, reducing the problem to unconstrained submodular minimization [23].\nSize constraints: The densest k-subgraph and size-constrained graph cut problems correspond to submodular minimization with cardinality constraints, problems that are very hard [44]. Specialized algorithms for cardinality and related constraints were proposed e.g. in [44, 35].\nMinimum Power Assignment: In wireless networks, one seeks a connectivity structure that maintains connectivity at a minimum energy consumption. This problem is equivalent to finding a suitable structure (e.g., a spanning tree) minimizing a submodular cost function [45].\nTransportation: Costs in real-world transportation problems are often non-additive. For example, it may be cheaper to take a longer route owned by one carrier rather than a shorter route that switches carriers. Such economies of scale, or “right of usage” properties are captured in the “Categorized Bottleneck Path Problem” – a shortest path problem with submodular costs [1]. Similar costs have been considered for spanning tree and matching problems.\nSummarization/Sensor placement: Submodular maximization also arises in many subset extraction problems. Sensor placement [25], document summarization [31] and speech data subset selection [29], for example, are instances of submodular maximization.\nDeterminantal Point Processes: The Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) which have found numerous applications in machine learning [26] are known to be log-submodular distributions. In particular, the MAP inference problem is a form of non-monotone submodular maximization.\nIndeed, there is strong motivation for solving Problems 1 and 2 but, as mentioned above, these problems come not without computational difficulties. Much work has therefore been devoted to developing optimal or near optimal algorithms. Among the several algorithms [33] for the unconstrained variant of Problem 1, where C = 2V , the best complexity to date is O(n5γ + n6) [40] (γ is the cost of evaluating f). This has motivated studies on faster, possibly special case or approximate, methods [42, 23]. Constrained minimization problems, even for simple constraints such as a cardinality lower bound, are mostly NP-hard, and not approximable to within better than a polynomial factor. Approximation algorithms for these problems with various techniques have been studied in [44, 16, 12, 21]. Unlike submodular minimization, all forms of submodular maximization are NP-hard. Most such problems, however, admit constant-factor approximations, which are attained via very simple combinatorial algorithms [39, 4].\nMajorization-minimization (MM)1 algorithms are known to be useful in machine learning [15]. Notable examples include the EM algorithm [34] and the convex-concave procedure [46]. Discrete instances have been used to minimize the difference between submodular functions [37, 17], but these algorithms generally lack theoretical guarantees. This paper shows, by contrast, that for submodular optimization, MM algorithms have strong theoretical properties and empirically work very well."

      "text" : "We first briefly introduce submodular semidifferentials. Throughout this paper, we assume normalized submodular functions (i.e., f(∅) = 0). The subdifferential ∂f (Y ) of a submodular set function f : 2V → R for a set Y ⊆ V is defined [9] analogously to the subdifferential of a continuous convex function:\n∂f (Y ) = {y ∈ Rn : (1) f(X)− y(X) ≥ f(Y )− y(Y ) for all X ⊆ V }\nFor a vector x ∈ RV and X ⊆ V , we write x(X) = ∑ j∈X x(j) — in such case, we say that x is a normalized modular function. We shall denote a subgradient at Y by hY ∈ ∂f (Y ). The extreme points of ∂f (Y ) may be computed via a greedy algorithm: Let σ be a permutation of V that assigns the elements in Y to the first |Y | positions (σ(i) ∈ Y if and only if i ≤ |Y |). Each such permutation defines a chain with elements Sσ0 = ∅,\n1MM also refers to minorization-maximization here.\nSσi = {σ(1), σ(2), . . . , σ(i)} and Sσ|Y | = Y . This chain defines an extreme point h σ Y of ∂f (Y ) with entries\nhσY (σ(i)) = f(S σ i )− f(Sσi−1). (2)\nSurprisingly, we can also define superdifferentials ∂f (Y ) of a submodular function [22, 18] at Y :\n∂f (Y ) = {y ∈ Rn : (3) f(X)− y(X) ≤ f(Y )− y(Y ); for all X ⊆ V }\nWe denote a generic supergradient at Y by gY . It is easy to show that the polyhedron ∂ f is non-empty. We define three special supergradients ĝY (“grow”), ǧY (“shrink”) and ḡY as follows [18]:\nĝY (j) = f(j | V \\ {j}) ĝY (j) = f(j | Y ) ǧY (j) = f(j | Y \\ {j}) ǧY (j) = f(j | ∅) ḡY (j) = f(j | V \\ {j})︸ ︷︷ ︸ ḡY (j) = f(j | ∅)︸ ︷︷ ︸\nfor j ∈ Y for j /∈ Y.\nFor a monotone submodular function, i.e., a function satisfying f(A) ≤ f(B) for all A ⊆ B ⊆ V , the suband supergradients defined here are nonnegative."

For minimization, we use an upper bound\nmgY (X) = f(Y ) + gY (X)− gY (Y ) ≥ f(X), (4)\nand for maximization a lower bound\nmhY (X) = f(Y ) + hY (X)− hY (Y ) ≤ f(X). (5)\nBoth these bounds are tight at the current solution, satisfying mgY (Y ) = mhY (Y ) = f(Y ). In almost all cases, optimizing the modular approximation is much faster than optimizing the original cost function f .\nAlgorithm 1 shows our discrete MM scheme for maximization (MMax) [and minimization (MMin)] , and for both constrained and unconstrained settings. Since we are minimizing a tight upper bound, or maximizing a tight lower bound, the algorithm must make progress.\nLemma 4.1.

By definition, it holds that f(Xt+1) ≤ mgXt (Xt+1). Since Xt+1 minimizes mgXt , it follows that\nf(Xt+1) ≤ mgXt (Xt+1) ≤ mgXt (Xt) = f(Xt). (6)\nThe observation that Algorithm 1 monotonically increases the objective of maximization problems follows analogously.\nContrary to standard continuous subgradient descent schemes, Algorithm 1 produces a feasible solution at each iteration, thereby circumventing any rounding or projection steps that might be challenging under certain types of constraints. In addition, it is known that for relaxed instances of our problems, subgradient descent methods can suffer from slow convergence [2]. Nevertheless, Algorithm 1 still relies on the choice of the semigradients defining the bounds. Therefore, we next analyze the effect of certain choices of semigradients."

      "text" : "We begin with unconstrained minimization, where C = 2V in Problem 1. Each of the three supergradients yields a different variant of Algorithm 1, and we will call the resulting algorithms MMin-I, II and III, respectively. We make one more assumption: of the minimizing arguments in Step 4 of Algorithm 1, we always choose a set of minimum cardinality.\nMMin-I is very similar to the algorithms proposed in [23]. Those authors, however, decompose f and explicitly represent graph-representable parts of the function f . We do not require or consider such a restriction here.\nLet us define the sets A = {j : f(j|∅) < 0} and B = {j : f(j|V \\ {j}) ≤ 0}. Submodularity implies that A ⊆ B, and this allows us to define a lattice2 L = [A,B] whose least element is the set A and whose greatest element is the set is B. This sublattice L of [∅, V ] retains all minimizers X∗ (i.e., A ⊆ X∗ ⊆ B for all X∗):\nLemma 5.1. [9] Let L∗ be the lattice of the global minimizers of a submodular function f . Then L∗ ⊆ L, where we use ⊆ to denote a sublattice.\nLemma 5.1 has been used to prune down the search space of the minimum norm point algorithm from the power set of V to a smaller lattice [2, 10]. Indeed, A and B may be obtained by using MMin-III:\nLemma 5.2. With X0 = ∅ and X0 = V , MMin-III returns the sets A and B, respectively. Initialized by an arbitrary X0, MMin-III converges to (X0 ∩B) ∪A.\n2This lattice contains all sets S satisfying A ⊆ S ⊆ B\nProof. When using X0 = ∅, we obtain X1 = argminX f(∅) + ∑ j∈X f(j) = A. Since A ⊆ B, the algorithm will converge to X1 = A. At this point, no more elements will be added, since for all i /∈ A we have ḡX1(i) = f(i | ∅) > 0. Moreover, the algorithm will not remove any elements: for all i ∈ A, it holds that ḡX1(i) = f(i | V \\ i) ≤ f(i) ≤ 0. By a similar argumentation, the initialization X0 = V will lead to X1 = B, where the algorithm terminates. If we start with any arbitrary X0, MMin-III will remove the elements j with f(j|V \\ j) > 0 and add the element j with f(j|∅) < 0. Hence it will add the elements in A that are not in X0 and remove those element from X0 that are not in B. Let the resulting set be X1. As before, for all i ∈ A, it holds that ḡX1(i) = f(i | V \\ i) ≤ f(i) ≤ 0, so these elements will not be removed in any possible subsequent iteration. The elements i ∈ X1 \\A were not removed, so f(i | V \\ i) ≤ 0. Hence, no more elements will be removed after the first iteration. Similarly, no elements will be added since for all i /∈ X1, it holds that f(i | ∅) ≥ f(i | V \\ i) > 0.\nLemma 5.2 implies that MMin-III effectively provides a contraction of the initial lattice to L, and, if X0 is not in L, it returns a set in L. Henceforth, we therefore assume that we start with a set X0 ∈ L.\nWhile the known lattice L has proven useful for warm-starts, MMin-I and II enable us to prune L even further. Let A+ be the set obtained by starting MMin-I at X\n0 = ∅, and B+ be the set obtained by starting MMin-II at X0 = V . This yields a new, smaller sublattice L+ = [A+, B+] that retains all minimizers:\nTheorem 5.3. For any minimizer X∗ ∈ L, it holds that A ⊆ A+ ⊆ X∗ ⊆ B+ ⊆ B. Hence L∗ ⊆ L+ ⊆ L. Furthermore, when initialized with X0 = ∅ and X0 = V , respectively, both MMin-I and II converge in O(n) iterations to a local minimum of f .\nBy a local minimum, we mean a set X that satisfies f(X) ≤ f(Y ) for any set Y that differs from X by a single element. We point out that Theorem 5.3 generalizes part of Lemma 3 in [23]. For the proof, we build on the following Lemma:\nLemma 5.4. Every iteration of MMin-I can be written as Xt+1 = Xt ∪ {j : f(j|Xt) < 0}. Similarly, every iteration of MMin-II can be expressed as Xt+1 = Xt\\{j : f(j|Xt \\ j) > 0}.\nProof. (Lemma 5.4) Throughout this paper, we assume that we select only the minimal minimizer of the modular function at every step. In other words, we do not choose the elements that have zero marginal cost. We observe that in iteration t+ 1 of MMin-I, we add the elements i with ĝXt(i) < 0, i.e., X\nt+1 = Xt ∪ {j : f(j|Xt) < 0}. No element will ever be removed, since ĝXt(i) = f(i | V \\ i) ≤ f(i | Xt−1) ≤ 0. If we start with X0 = ∅, then after the first iteration, it holds that X1 = argminX f(∅) + ∑ j∈X f(j). Hence X\n1 = A. MMin-I terminates when reaching a set A+, where f(j|A+) ≥ 0, for all j /∈ A+.\nThe analysis of MMin-II is analogous. In iteration t+ 1, we remove the elements i with ǧXt(i) > 0, i.e., Xt+1 = Xt\\{j : f(j|Xt − j) > 0}. Similarly to the argumentation above, MMin-II never adds any elements. If we begin with X0 = V , then X1 = arg minXf(V )+ ∑ j∈V \\X f(j|V −{j}), and therefore X1 = B. MMin-II terminates with a set B+.\nNow we can prove Theorem 5.3.\nProof. (Thm. 5.3) Since, by Lemma 5.4, MMin-I only adds elements and MMin-II only removes elements, at least one in each iteration, both algorithms terminate after O(n) iterations.\nLet us now turn to the relation of X∗ to A and B. Since f(i) < 0 for all i ∈ A, the set X1 = A found in the first iteration of MMin-I must be a subset of X∗. Consider any subset Xt ⊆ X∗. Any element j for which f(j | Xt) < 0 must be in X∗ as well, because by submodularity, f(j | X∗) ≤ f(j | Xt) < 0. This means f(X∗ ∪ j) < f(X∗), which would otherwise contradict the optimality of X∗. The set of such j is exactly Xt+1, and therefore Xt+1 ⊆ X∗. This induction shows that MMin-I, whose first solution is A ⊆ X∗, always returns a subset of X∗. Analogously, B ⊇ X∗, and MMin-II only removes elements j /∈ X∗.\nFinally, we argue that A+ is a local minimum; the proof for B+ is analogous. Algorithm MMin-I generates a chain ∅ = X0 ⊆ X1 ⊆ X2 · · · ⊆ A+ = XT . For any t ≤ T , consider j ∈ Xt \\Xt−1. Submodularity implies that f(j|A+ \\ j) ≤ f(j|Xt−1) < 0. The last inequality follows from the fact that j was added in iteration t. Therefore, removing any j ∈ A+ will increase the cost. Regarding the elements i /∈ A+, we observe that MMin-I has terminated, which implies that f(i | A+) ≥ 0. Hence, adding i to A+ will not improve the solution, and A+ is a local minimum.\nTheorem 5.3 has a number of nice implications. First, it provides a tighter bound on the lattice of minimizers of the submodular function f that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been used or mentioned before. The sets A+ and B+ obtained above are guaranteed to be supersets and subsets of A and B, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 2. This means we can start any algorithm for submodular minimization from the lattice L+ instead of the initial lattice 2V or L. When using an algorithm whose running time is a high-order polynomial of |V |, any reduction of the ground set V is beneficial. Second, each iteration of MMin takes linear time. Therefore, its total running time is O(n2). Third, Theorem 5.3 states that both MMin-I and II converge to a local minimum. This may be counter-intuitive if one considers that each algorithm either only adds or only removes elements. In consequence, a local minimum of a submodular function can be obtained in O(n2), a fact that is of independent interest and that does not hold for local maximizers [8].\nThe following example illustrates that L+ can be a strict subset of L and therefore provides non-trivial pruning. Let w1, w2 ∈ RV , w1 ≥ 0 be two vectors, each defining a linear (modular) function. Then the function f(X) = √ w1(X) + w2(X) is submodular. Specifically, let w1 = [3, 9, 17, 14, 14, 10, 16, 4, 13, 2] and w2 = [−9, 4, 6,−1, 10,−4,−6,−1, 2,−8]. Then we obtain L defined by A = [1, 6, 7, 10] and B = [1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10]. The tightened sublattice contains exactly the minimizer: A+ = B+ = X\n∗ = [1, 6, 7, 8, 10]. As a refinement to Theorem 5.3, we can show that MMin-I and MMin-II converge to the local minima of\nlowest and highest cardinality, respectively.\nLemma 5.5. The set A+ is the smallest local minimum of f (by cardinality), and B+ is the largest. Moreover, every local minimum Z is in L+: Z ∈ L+ for every local minimum Z.\nProof. The proof proceeds analogously to the proof of Theorem 5.3. Let Ys be the local minimum of smallest-cardinality, and Y` the largest one. First, we note that X\n0 = ∅ ⊆ Ys. For induction, assume that Xt ⊆ Ys. For contradiction, assume there is an element j ∈ Xt+1 that is not in Ys. Since j ∈ Xt+1 \\Xt, it holds by construction that f(j | Ys) ≤ f(j | Xt) < 0, implying that f(Ys ∪ j) < f(Ys). This contradicts the local optimality of Ys, and therefore it must hold that X\nt+1 ⊆ Ys. Consequently, A+ ⊆ Ys. But A+ is itself a local minimum, and hence equality holds. The result for B+ follows analogously.\nBy the same argumentation as above for Ys and Y`, we conclude that each local minimum Z satisfies A+ ⊆ Z ⊆ B+, and therefore Z ∈ L+ ⊆ L.\nAs a corollary, Lemma 5.5 implies that if a submodular function has a unique local minimum, MMin-I and II must find this minimum, which is a global one.\nIn the following we consider two extensions of MMin-I and II. First, we analyze an algorithm that alternates between MMin-I and MMin-II. While such an algorithm does not provide much benefit when started at X0 = ∅ or X0 = V , we see that with a random initialization X0 = R, the alternation ensures convergence to a local minimum. Second, we address the question of which supergradients to select in general.\nIn particular, we show that the supergradients ĝ and ǧ subsume alternativee supergradients and provide the tightest results with MMin. Hence, our results are the tight.\nAlternating MMin-I and II and arbitrary initializations. Instead of running only one of MMin-I and II, we can run one until it stops and then switch to the other. Assume we initialize both algorithms with a random set X0 = R ∈ L+. By Theorem 5.3, we know that MMin-I will return a subset R1 ⊃ R (no element will be removed because all removable elements are not in B, and R ⊂ B by assumption). When MMin-I terminates, it holds that ĝR1(j) = f(j|R1) ≥ 0 for all j /∈ R1, and therefore R1 cannot be increased using ĝR1 . We will call such a set an I-minimum. Similarly, MMin-II returns a set R1 ⊆ R from which, considering that ǧR1(j) = f(j|R1 \\ j) ≤ 0 for all j ∈ R1, no elements can be removed. We call such a non-decreasable set a D-minimum. Every local minimum is both an I-minimum and a D-minimum.\nWe can apply MMin-II to the I-minimum R1 returned by MMin-I. Let us call the resulting set R2. Analogously, applying MMin-I to R1 yields R2 ⊇ R1.\nLemma 5.6. The sets R2 and R 2 are local optima. Furthermore, R1 ⊆ R2 ⊆ R2 ⊆ R1.\nProof. It is easy to see that A ⊆ R1 ⊆ B, and A ⊆ R1 ⊆ B. By Lemma 5.4, MMin-I applied to R1 will only add elements, and MMin-II on R1 will only remove elements. Since R1 is an I-minimum, adding an element j ∈ V \\R1 to any set X ⊂ R1 never helps, and therefore R1 contains all of R1, R2 and R2. Similarly, R1 is contained in R2, R 2 and R1. In consequence, it suffices to look at the contracted lattice [R1, R 1], and any local minimum in this sublattice is a local minimum on [∅, V ]. Theorem 5.3 applied to the sublattice [R1, R1] (and the submodular function restricted to the sublattice) yields the inclusion R2 ⊆ R2, so R1 ⊆ R2 ⊆ R2 ⊆ R1, and both R2 and R 2 are local minima.\nThe following lemma provides a more general view.\nLemma 5.7. Let S1 ⊆ S1 be such that S1 is an I-minimum and S1 is a D-minimum. Then there exist local minima S2 ⊆ S2 in [S1, S1] such that initializing with any X0 ∈ [S1, S1], an alternation of MMin-I and II converges to a local minimum in [S2, S 2], and\nmin X∈[S1,S1] f(X) = min X∈[S2,S2] f(X). (7)\nProof. Let S2, S 2 be the smallest and largest local minima within [S1, S 1]. By the same argumentation as for Lemma 5.6, using X0 ∈ [S1, S1] leads to a local minimum within [S2, S2]. Since by definition all local optima in [S1, S 1] are within [S2, S 2], the global minimum within [S1, S 1] will also be in [S2, S 2].\nThe above lemmas have a number of implications for minimization algorithms. First, many of the properties for initializing with V or the empty set can be transferred to arbitrary initializations. In particular, the succession of MMin-I and II will terminate in O(n2) iterations, regardless of what X0 is. Second, Lemmas 5.6 and 5.7 provide useful pruning opportunities: we can prune down the initial lattice to [R2, R\n2] or [S2, S 2], respectively. In particular, if any global optimizer of f is contained in [S1, S 1], it will also be contained in [S2, S 2].\nChoice of supergradients. We close this section with a remark about the choice of supergradients. The following Lemma states how ĝX and ǧX subsume alternative choices of supergradients and MMin-I and II lead to the tightest results possible.\nLemma 5.8. Initialized with X0 = ∅, Algorithm 1 will converge to a subset of A+ with any choice of supergradients. Initialized with X0 = V , the algorithm will converge to a superset of B+ with any choice of supergradients. If X0 is a local minimum, then the algorithm will not move with any supergradient.\nThe proof of Lemma 5.8 is very similar to the proof of Theorem 5.3."

To prove Theorem 5.9, we use the following result shown in [20]:\nf(X̂) ≤ g(X ∗)/f(i)\n1 + (1− κf )(g(X∗)/f(i)− 1) f(X∗) (9)\nfor any i ∈ V . We now transfer this result to curvature. To do so, we use i′ ∈ arg maxi∈V f(i), so that g(X∗) = ∑ j∈X∗ f(j) ≤ |X∗|f(i′). Observing that the function p(x) = x 1+(1−κf )(x−1) is increasing in x yields that\nf(X̂) ≤ |X ∗|\n1 + (1− κf )(|X∗| − 1) f(X∗). (10)\nFor problems where κf < 1, Theorem 5.9 yields a constant approximation factor and refines bounds for constrained minimization that are given in [12, 44]. To our knowledge, this is the first curvature dependent bound for this general class of minimization problems.\nA class of functions with κf = 1 are matroid rank functions, implying that these functions are difficult instances the MMin algorithms. But several classes of functions occurring in applications have more benign curvature. For example, concave over modular functions were used in [31, 22]. These comprise, for instance, functions of the form f(X) = (w(X))a, for some a ∈ [0, 1] and a nonnegative weight vector w, whose curvature is κf ≈ 1− a(minj w(j)w(V ) )\n1−a > 0. A special case is f(X) = |X|a, with curvature κf = 1− ana−1, or f(X) = log(1 + w(X)) satisfying κf ≈ 1− minj w(j)w(V ) .\nThe bounds of Theorem 5.9 hold after the first iteration. Nevertheless, empirically we often found that for problem instances that are not worst-case, subsequent iterations can improve the solution substantially. Using Theorem 5.9, we can bound the number of iterations the algorithm will take. To do so, we assume an η-approximate version, where we proceed only if f(Xt+1) ≤ (1− η)f(Xt) for some η > 0. In practice, the algorithm usually terminates after 5 to 10 iterations for an arbitrarily small η.\nLemma 5.10. MMin-I runs in O( 1ηT log n 1+(n−1)(1−κf ) ) time, where T is the time for minimizing a modular function subject to X ∈ C.\nProof. At the end of the first iteration, we obtain a set X1 such that f(X1) ≤ n1+(n−1)(1−κf )f(X ∗). The η-approximate assumption implies that f(Xt+1) ≤ (1−η)f(Xt) ≤ (1−η)tf(X1). Using that log(1−η) ≤ η−1 and Theorem 5.9, we see that the algorithm terminates after at most O( 1η log n 1+(n−1)(1−κf ) ) iterations."

We implement and compare algorithms using Matlab and the SFO toolbox [24].\nUnconstrained minimization We first study the results in Section 5.1 for contracting the lattice of possible minimizers. We measure the size of the new lattices relative to the ground set. Applying MMin-I and II (lattice L+) to Iwata’s test function [10], we observe an average reduction of 99.5% in the lattice. MMin-III (lattice L) obtains only about 60% reduction. Averages are taken for n between 20 and 120.\nIn addition, we use concave over modular functions √ w1(X) + λw2(V \\X) with randomly chosen vectors w1, w2 in [0, 1] n and n = 50. We also consider the application of selecting limited vocabulary speech corpora.\n[32, 23] use functions of the form √ w1(Γ(X)) + w2(V \\X), where Γ(X) is the neighborhood function of a bipartite graph. Here, we choose n = 100 and random vectors w1 and w2. For both function classes, we vary λ such that the optimal solution X∗ moves from X∗ = ∅ to X∗ = V . The results are shown in Figure 3. In both cases, we observe a significant reduction of the search space. When used as a preprocessing step for the minimum norm point algorithm (MN) [10], this pruned lattice speeds up the MN algorithm accordingly, in particular for the speech data. The dotted lines represent the relative time of MN including the respective preprocessing, taken with respect to MN without preprocessing. Figure 3 also shows the average results over 10 random choices of weights in both cases. In order to obtain accurate estimates of the timings, we run each experiment 5 times and take the minimum of these timing valuess.\nConstrained minimization. For constrained minimization, we compare MMin-I to two methods: a simple algorithm (MU) that minimizes the upper bound g(X) = ∑ i∈X f(i) [12] (this is identical to the first iteration of MMin-I), and a more complex algorithm (EA) that computes an approximation to the submodular polyhedron [13] and in many cases yields a theoretically optimal approximation. MU has the theoretical bounds of Theorem 5.9, while EA achieves a worst-case approximation factor of O( √ n log n). We show two experiments: the theoretical worst-case and average-case instances. Figure 4 illustrates the results.\nWorst case. We use a very hard cost function [13]\nf(X) = min{|X|, |X ∩ R̄|+ β, α}, (11)\nwhere α = n1/2+ and β = n2 , and R is a random set such that |R| = α. This function is the theoretical worst case. Figure 4 shows results for cardinality lower bound constraints; the results for other, more complex constraints are similar. As shrinks, the problem becomes harder. In this case, EA and MMin-I achieve about the same empirical approximation factors, which matches the theoretical guarantee of n1/2− .\nAverage case. We next compare the algorithms on more realistic functions that occur in applications. Figure 4 shows the empirical approximation factors for minimum submodular-cost spanning tree, bipartite matching, and shortest path. We use four classes of randomized test functions: (1) concave (square\nroot or log) over modular (CM), (2) clustered CM (CCM) of the form f(X) = ∑k i=1 √ w(X ∩ Ck) for clusters C1, · · · , Ck, (3) Best Set (BS) functions where the optimal feasible set R is chosen randomly (f(X) = I(|X ∩ R| ≥ 1) + ∑ j∈R\\X wj) and (4) worst case-like functions (WC) similar to equation (11). Functions of type (1) and (2) have been used in speech and computer vision [31, 22, 17] and have reduced curvature (κf < 1). Functions of type (3) and (4) have κf = 1. In all four cases, we consider both sparse and dense graphs, with random weight vectors w. The plots show averages over 20 instances of these graphs. For sparse graphs, we consider grid like graphs in the form of square grids, grids with diagonals and cubic grids. For dense graphs, we sparsely connect a few dense cluster subgraphs. For matchings, we restrict ourselves to bipartite graphs, and consider both sparse and dense variants of these.\nFirst, we observe that in many cases, MMin clearly outperforms MU. This suggests the practical utility of more than one iteration. Second, despite its simplicity, MMin performs comparably to EA, and sometimes even better. In summary, the experiments suggest that the complex EA only gains on a few worst-case instances, whereas in many (average) cases, MMin yields near-optimal results (factor 1–2). In terms of running time, MMin is definitely preferable: on small instances (for example n = 40), our Matlab implementation of MMin takes 0.2 seconds, while EA needs about 58 seconds. On larger instances (n = 500), the running times differ on the order of seconds versus hours."

We will only select subgradients that are vertices of the subdifferential, i.e., each subgradient corresponds to a permutation of V . For any of those choices, MMax converges quickly. To bound the running time, we assume that we proceed only if we make sufficient progress, i.e., if f(Xt+1) ≥ (1 + η)f(Xt).\nLemma 6.1. MMax with X0 = argmaxj f(j) runs in time O(T log1+η n), where T is the time for maximizing a modular function subject to X ∈ C.\nProof.

Therefore, we have reached the maximum function value after at most (log n)/ log(1 + η) iterations.\nIn practice, we observe that MMax terminates within 3-10 iterations. We next consider specific subgradients and their theoretical implications. For unconstrained problems, we assume the submodular function to be non-monotone (the results trivially hold for monotone functions too); for constrained problems, we assume the function f to be monotone nondecreasing.

Making further iterations (RA) only improves the solution.\nLemma 6.2. When running Algorithm RP with X0 = ∅, it holds after one iteration that E(f(X1)) ≥ 14f(X ∗) if f is a general non-negative submodular function, and E(f(X1)) ≥ 12f(X ∗) if f is symmetric.\nProof.

[8] shows that ES(f(S)) ≥ 14f(X\n∗). For symmetric submodular functions, the factor is 12 .\nRandomized local search (RLS). Instead of using a completely random subgradient as in RA, we fix the positions of two elements: the permutation must satisfy that σt(|Xt| + 1) ∈ argmaxj f(j|Xt) and σt(|Xt| − 1) ∈ argminj f(j|Xt\\j). The remaining positions are assigned randomly. An η-approximate version of MMax with such subgradients returns an η-approximate local maximum that achieves an improved approximation factor of 1/3− η in O(n 2 logn η ) iterations.\nLemma 6.3. Algorithm RLS returns a local maximum X that satisfies max{f(X), f(V \\X)} ≥ ( 13 − η)f(X ∗) in O(n 2 logn η ) iterations.\nProof. At termination (t = T ), it holds that maxj f(j|XT ) ≤ 0 and minj f(j|XT \\ j) ≥ 0; this implies that the set Xt is local optimum.\nTo show local optimality, recall that the subgradient hσ T XT satisfies h σT XT (X T ) = f(XT ), and hσ T XT (Y ) ≥ hσ T\nXT (X T ) for all Y ⊆ V . Therefore, it must hold that maxj /∈XT f(j|XT ) = maxj /∈XT hσ\nT\nXT (j) ≤ 0, and minj∈XT f(j|XT \\j) = hσ T XT (j) ≥ 0, which implies that the set X T is a local maximum.\nWe now use a result by [8] showing that if a set X is a local optimum, then f(X) ≥ 13f(X ∗) if f is a general non-negative submodular set function and f(X) ≥ 12f(X ∗) if f is a symmetric submodular function. If the set is an η-approximate local optimum, we obtain a 13 − η approximation [8]. A complexity analysis similar to Theorem 6.1 reveals that the worst case complexity of this algorithm is O(n\n2 logn η ).\nNote that even finding an exact local maximum is hard for submodular functions [8], and therefore it is necessary to resort to an η-approximate version, which converges to an η-approximate local maximum.\nDeterministic local search (DLS). A completely deterministic variant of RLS defines the permutation by an entirely greedy ordering. We define permutation σt used in iteration t via the chain ∅ = Sσt0 ⊂ Sσ t\n1 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Sσtn it will generate. The initial permutation is σ0(j) = argmaxk/∈Sσ0j−1 f(k|S σ0 j−1) for j = 1, 2, . . .. In\nsubsequent iterations t, the permutation σt is\nσt(j) =  σt−1(j) if t even, j ∈ Xt−1 argmaxk f(k|Sσ t j−1) if t even, j /∈ Xt−1 argmink f(k|Sσ t j+1\\k) if t odd, j ∈ Xt−1\nσt−1(j) if t odd, j /∈ Xt−1.\nThis schedule is equivalent to the deterministic local search (DLS) algorithm by [8], and therefore achieves an approximation factor of 1/3− η.\nBi-directional greedy (BG). The procedures above indicate that greedy and local search algorithms implicitly define specific chains and thereby subgradients. Likewise, the deterministic bi-directional greedy algorithm by [4] induces a distinct permutation of the ground set. It is therefore equivalent to MMax with the corresponding subgradients and achieves an approximation factor of 1/3. This factor improves that of the local search techniques by removing η. Moreover, unlike for local search, the 1/3 approximation holds already after the first iteration.\nLemma 6.4. The set X1 obtained by Algorithm 1 with the subgradient equivalent to BG satisfies that f(X) ≥ 13f(X ∗).\nProof. Given an initial ordering τ , the bi-directional greedy algorithm by [4] generates a chain of sets. Let στ denote the permutation defined by this chain, obtainable by mimicking the algorithm. We run MMax with the corresponding subgradient. By construction, the set Sτ returned by the bi-directional greedy algorithm is contained in the chain. Therefore, it holds that\nf(X1) ≥ max X⊆V\nhσ τ\n∅ (X) (22)\n≥ max k\nf(Sσ τ\nk ) (23)\n≥ f(Sτ ) (24)\n≥ 1 3 f(X∗). (25)\nThe first inequality follows since the subgradient is tight for all sets in the chain. For the second inequality, we used that Sτ belongs to the chain, and hence Sτ = Sσ τ\nj for some j. The last inequality follows from the approximation factor satisfied by Sτ [4]. We can continue the algorithm, using any one of the adaptive schedules above to get a locally optimal solution. This can only improve the solution.\nRandomized bi-directional greedy (RG). Like its deterministic variant, the randomized bi-directional greedy algorithm by [4] can be shown to run MMax with a specific subgradient. Starting from ∅ and V , it implicitly defines a random chain of subsets and thereby (random) subgradients. A simple analysis shows that this subgradient leads to the best possible approximation factor of 1/2 in expectation.\nLike its deterministic counterpart, the Randomized bi-directional Greedy algorithm (RG) by [4] induces a (random) permutation στ based on an initial ordering τ .\nLemma 6.5. If the subgradient in MMax is determined by στ , then the set X1 after the first iteration satisfies E(f(X1)) ≥ 12f(X ∗), where the expectation is taken over the randomness in στ .\nProof. The permutation στ is obtained by a randomized algorithm, but once στ is fixed, the remainder of\nMMax is deterministic. By an argumentation similar to that in the proof of Lemma 6.4, it holds that\nE(f(X)) ≥ E(max X\nhσ τ\n∅ (X)) (26)\n≥ E(max k\nf(Sσ τ\nk )) (27)\n≥ E(f(Sσ τ )) (28)\n≥ 1 2 f(X∗) (29)\nThe last inequality follows from a result in [4]."

In particular, define a permutation as:\nσg(i) ∈ argmax j /∈Sσgi−1,c(Sσ g i−1∪{j})≤B\nf(j|Sσgi−1) c(j) . (35)\nThe following result then follows from [30, 43].\nLemma 6.7. Using σg in MMax under the budget constraints yields:\nmax{ max i:c(i)≤B\nf(i), f(X1)} ≥ (1− 1/ √ e)f(X∗).

Table 1 lists results for monotone submodular maximization under different constraints.\nIt would be interesting if some of the constrained variants of non-monotone submodular maximization could be naturally subsumed in our framework too. In particular, some recent algorithms [27, 28] propose local search based techniques to obtain constant factor approximations for non-monotone submodular maximization under knapsack and matroid constraints. Unfortunately, these algorithms require swap operations along with inserting and deleting elements. We do not currently know how to phrase these swap operations via our framework and leave this relation as an open problem.\nWhile a number of algorithms cannot be naturally seen as an instance of our framework, we show in the following section that any polynomial time approximation algorithm for unconstrained or constrained variants of submodular optimization can be ultimately seen as an instance of our algorithm, via a polynomial-time computable subgradient."

Any submodular function f satisfies\nmax X∈C f(X) = max X∈C,h∈Pf h(X) = max X∈C,σ∈Σ\nhσ∅ (X). (38)\nLemma 6.9 implies that there exists a permutation (and equivalent subgradient) with which MMax finds the optimal solution in the first iteration. Known hardness results [7] imply that this permutation may not be obtainable in polynomial time.\nProof. (Lemma 6.9) The first equality in Lemma 6.9 follows from the fact that any submodular function f can be written as\nf(X) = max h∈Pf h(X).

Let τ be an arbitrary permutation that places the elements in Y in the first |Y | positions. The subgradient hτ defined by τ is a subgradient both for ∅ and for Y .

(40)\nThe equality follows from the fact that Y belongs to the chain of τ .\nWhile the above theorem shows the optimality of MMax in the unconstrained setting, a similar result holds for the constrained case:\nCorollary 6.10. Let C be any constraint such that a linear function can be exactly maximized over C. For any polynomial-time algorithm for submodular maximization over C that achieves an approximation factor α, there exists a schedule of subgradients (obtainable in polynomial time) that, if used within MMax, leads to a solution with the same approximation factor α.\nThe proof of Corollary 6.10 follows directly from the Theorem 6.8. Lastly, we pose the question of selecting the optimal subgradient in each iteration. An optimal subgradient h would lead to a function mh whose maximization yields the largest improvement. Unfortunately, obtaining such an “optimal” subgradient is impossible:\nTheorem 6.11. The problem of finding the optimal subgradient σOPT = argmaxσ,X⊆V h σ Xt(X) in Step 4 of Algorithm 1 is NP-hard even when C = 2V . Given such an oracle, however, MMax using subgradient σOPT returns a global optimizer.\nProof. Lemma 6.9 implies that an optimal subgradient at X0 = ∅ or X0 = V is a subgradient at an optimal solution. An argumentation as in Equation (40) shows that using this subgradient in MM leads to an optimal solution. Since this would solve submodular maximization (which is NP-hard), it must be NP-hard to find such a subgradient.\nTo show that this holds for arbitrary Xt (and correspondingly at every iteration), we use that the submodular subdifferential can be expressed as a direct product between a submodular polyhedron and an anti-submodular polyhedron [9]. Any problem involving an optimization over the sub-differential, can then be expressed as an optimization over a submodular polyhedron (which is a subdifferential at the empty set) and an anti-submodular polyhedron (which is a subdifferential at V ) [9]. Correspondingly, Equation (38) can be expressed as the sum of two submodular maximization problems."

This framework is akin to the class of algorithms for minimizing the difference between submodular functions [37, 17]. In addition, it may be viewed as a special case of a proximal minimization algorithm that uses Bregman\ndivergences derived from submodular functions [19]. To our knowledge this is the first generic and unifying framework of combinatorial algorithms for submodular optimization.\nAn alternative framework relies on relaxing the discrete optimization problem by using a continuous extension (the Lovász extension for minimization and multilinear extension for maximization). Relaxations have been applied to some constrained [16] and unconstrained [2] minimization problems as well as maximization problems [4]. Such relaxations, however, rely on a final rounding step that can be challenging — the combinatorial framework obviates this step.

The resulting algorithms, which repeatedly compute and then efficiently optimize submodular semigradients, offer new and generalize many old methods for submodular optimization. Our approach, moreover, takes steps towards providing a unifying paradigm applicable to both submodular minimization and maximization, problems that historically have been treated quite distinctly. The practicality of our algorithms is important since interest in submodularity, owing to its natural and wide applicability, has recently been in ascendance within machine learning. We analyze theoretical properties of our algorithms for minimization and maximization, and show that many state-of-the-art maximization algorithms are special cases. Lastly, we complement our theoretical analyses with supporting empirical experiments.",
