      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nWord embedding representing words into vector space has been a hot topic in the area of Natural Language Processing(NLP). By using learned word representations, a number of NLP tasks can be dealt with in other effective ways. For example, we can simply average the vectors of all tokens in a document and utilize some classifiers to do text classification [1]. In addition, word embedding are also used for information retrieval [2], sentiment analysis [3], etc. There are many classic word embedding methods including the Semantic Extraction using a Neural Network Architecture (SENNA) [4], Continuous Bag-of-Word (CBOW), Skip-gram [5], Global Vector (Glove) [6], etc. These models by learning semantic information from context, however, still have some weaknesses. All models mentioned before are actually wordlevel methods which ignore some internal structure of word. Try to improve the ability of word embedding models, a lot of strategy are proposed which can be divided into two main branches. The first is lexicon-based methods. These methods adjust the locations of word embeddings in vector space based on lexica like WordNet [7]. The next is inner structure-based methods. The basic idea of these methods is that the internal structure like Chinese character have some positive effects on the improvement of word embedding. For example, Chen [8] proposed a character-enhanced Chinese word embedding model by incorporating the character information of a single word into the input layer of CBOW.\nRecently, some researchers utilize the morpheme information to improve English language word embedding. In Luong’s paper [9], a word is divided into the morpheme part and the basic part. Both of them are added into the firstly layer of their recursive neural network. Incorporating the morpheme information into word embedding is meaningful because every morpheme has its own meaning. For example, words starting with prefix “a or an” will have meaning of “not, without” like “asexual” and “anarchy”. In addition, words ending with suffix “able or ible” will have the meaning of “capable” like “edible” and “visible”. However, these morpheme-enhanced word embedding methods only care about morphemes themselves rather than their meanings. For example, in their models, word “asexual” is divided into prefix “a”, basic part “sexu” and suffix “al”. The meaning “without” of prefix and the meaning “related to” of suffix are ignored. Although these models have some positive effect, they are still ambiguous. In vector space, morpheme-similar words will have a tendency to stay together, which can benefits the syntactic parsing. However, the long distances between these words and their morphemes’ meanings are still remained. We illustrate the basic idea of these models in the left part of Figure 1.\nIn this paper, we propose three more refined word embedding models based on the meanings of word morphemes rather than morphemes themselves. According to the nature of morphemes, they are divided into 3 parts including prefix, root and suffix. By using our models, morpheme-similar word in\nar X\niv :1\n70 1.\n02 48\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.C L\n] 1\n0 Ja\nn 20\n17\nvector space will not only have a tendency to gather together but also tend to locate close to their morphemes’ meanings. For comparison, our models together with the comparative models are tested on the tasks of word similarity and syntactic analogy. More details are shown in the right part of Figure 1. The contribution of this paper are summarized as follows. • We implicitly incorporate the morpheme information into\nword embedding. Rather than the morphemes themselves, we utilize the morphemes’ meanings. • Based on parameter analysis, our models can increase the semantic information in the corpus, which means our models are of great advantages to deal with some morpheme-rich and corpus-limited languages. The performances of our models are similar to the performance of CBOW on the corpus which is five times ours.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. Some related work is given in Section 2. We introduce our models in Section 3. Experimental settings are described in the following section which includes corpus introduction, comparative baselines introduction and etc. In Section 5, we analyze the results of experiments and do parameter analysis. Conclusion is given in the last section."

      "text" : "By representing words into low dimension vector space, word embedding models can extract the semantic information from context words, which has been a hot topic in the area of NLP. For its effectiveness in dealing with some tasks like text classification and sentiment analysis, a lot of word embedding models are proposed. Some of them are based on neural network while the others are based on matrix factorization. Among all of word embedding models, CBOW and Skipgram[5] are the most widely used and get some state-of-theart performances. CBOW utilizes the context to predict the target word while Skip-gram predicts the context by using the target word. Both of them suffer from the limitation of computational ability until Mikolov proposed two efficient solution, hierarchical softmax and negative sampling [10], to solve this problem. In order to combine the advantage of distributional word representation with the advantage of matrix factorization, Pennington proposed another famous word embedding model named Glove [6], which is reported to outperform the word2vec on some tasks.\nBased on the internal structure of word like Chinese character and English morpheme, a lot of enhanced models are proposed to improve the ability of word embedding. Chen proposed a character-enhanced Chinese word embedding model [8]. He modified the input layer of CBOW and added the character information in it. The basic idea of his model is that every Chinese character has its own meanings and these meanings will have a positive effect on improving the ability of word embedding. Based on recursive neural network, Luong split a word into morpheme part and basic part [9]. When computing the representation of a word on the input layer of his model, he weighed the two parts and utilized the sum of them to indicate the word. Recently, Kim has proposed a\ncharacter-level language model [11]. Their model is composed of several neural work layers and every character information of an English word is convoluted on the input layer and the result is sent to the highway network. It is reported this model has a great advantage to deal with the morphemerich language. However, with a huge size architecture, it is proven to be a time-consuming model. Besides, the structure of highway network is hard to determined. In his paper, he exploited three structures of highway network and two of them failed. No theoretical explanation is given."

      "heading" : "A. CBOW with Negative Sampling",
      "text" : "In the anterior section, the basic idea of CBOW has been discussed. With a slide window, CBOW utilizes the context words in the window to predict the target words. Given a sequence of tokens T = {t1, t2, · · · , tn}, the objective of CBOW is to maximize the following average log probability equation.\nL = 1\nn n∑ i=1 log p(ti|context(ti)), (1)\nwhere context(ti) means the context words of ti in the slide window. Based on softmax, p(ti|context(ti)) is defined as follows.\nexp(vec ′ (ti) T ∑ −k≤j≤k,j 6=0 vec(ti+j))∑V\nx=1 exp(vec ′(tx)T ∑ −k≤j≤k,j 6=0 vec(ti+j)) , (2)\nwhere vec(t) and vec ′ (t) are the “input” and “output” vector representation of token t. k means the slide window size and V means the vocabulary size. Due to huge size of English vocabulary, however, Equation 2 can not be calculated in a tolerable time. Therefore, negative sampling and hierarchical softmax are proposed to solve this problem. Due to the efficiency of negative sampling, all related models are trained based on it. In terms of negative sampling, every item whose form is like log p(tO|tI) is defined as follows.\nlog δ(vec ′ (tO)\nT vec(tI))+ m∑ i=1 log[1− δ(vec ′ (ti) T vec(tI))], (3)\nwhere m indicates the number of negative samples. δ(·) is the sigmoid function. The first item is the probability of target word when given its context. The second item denotes the probability that negative samples don’t have the same context as the target word."

      "text" : "In this model, we assume that all morphemes’ meanings of token ti have equal contribution to ti. Given a sequence of tokens T = {t1, t2, · · · , tn}, we assume that the morpheme’s meaning set of ti, (i ∈ [1, n]) is Mi. Mi can be divided into three part Pi, Ri and Si which indicate the prefix meaning set, root meaning set and suffix meaning set of ti, respectively. Hence, when ti is the context word of tj , the modified embedding of ti can be defined as follows.\nv̂ti = 1\n2 (vti +\n1\nNi ∑ w∈Mi vw), (4)\nwhere vti is the original word embedding of ti, Ni denotes the length of Mi and vw indicates the vector of w. In this paper, we assume the original word embedding and the sum of its morphemes’ meanings embedding have equal weight which is 1 2 . More details can be found in Figure 2.\nC. Morpheme-Enhanced Word Embedding-Similarity (MWES)\nWe observe that a lot of words have more than one morpheme’s meanings. For word “anthropologist”, its morpheme’s meaning set is {man,human,who,which}. Obviously, “man” and “human” are closer to “anthropologist”. Motivated by this observation, we assume that different morphemes have different contributions. In this paper, we firstly train a part of word embedding based on the source code of word2vec1. Then, based on the pre-trained word embedding, the different contributions can be measured by calculating the cosine distances between target word and its morphemes’ meanings. We illustrate the main idea of this model in Figure 3. We reuse the notation in MWE-A to describe MWE-S. Mathematical formation is given in Equation 5.\nv̂ti = 1\n2 (vti + ∑ w∈Mi sim(vti , vw) vw), (5)\n1https://github.com/dav/word2vec\nwhere vti is the original vector of ti. sim(vti , vw) is the function used to denote the similarity between ti and its morphemes’ meanings. We define function cos(vi, vj) to denote the cosine distance between vi, vj . sim(vti , vw) is normalized as follows.\nsim(vti , vw) = cos(vti , vw)∑\nw∈Mi cos(vti , vw) , w ∈Mi, (6)"

      "text" : "From the collections of morphemes and their meanings, we find that except for multiple meanings of a morpheme, the corresponding meanings of a token’s prefix, root and suffix are usually different. However, some meanings are not close to the target word. To achieve better improvement of the target word’s representation, we only exploit the morpheme’s meaning whose distance to target word is the max. In Figure 4, the suffix’s meaning of “anthropologist” is “who” and “which”. According to our description, the word “which” in red will not be applied for its shorter distance to “anthropologist”. More details are shown in Figure 4. For clarity, we also utilize the notation in MWE-A. For a single token ti, the new morphemes’ meanings set is defined as M imax = {P imax, Rimax, Simax} where P imax, Rimax, Simax are defined as follows.\nP imax = argmax w cos(vti , vw), w ∈ Pi, Rimax = argmax w cos(vti , vw), w ∈ Ri, (7) Simax = argmax w cos(vti , vw), w ∈ Si,\nwhere cos(·) stands for cosine distance. Hence, MWE-M is defined mathematically as follows.\nv̂ti = 1\n2 (vti + ∑ w∈Mimax sim(vti , vw) vw), (8)\nwhere sim(·) indicates the similarity between two words and needs to be normalized like Equation 6 shows."

      "heading" : "E. Strategy to Match the Morpheme",
      "text" : "Now, we need to discuss the way to find the morphemes in a single token. Firstly, it is obvious that a number of words contain more than one prefix, root and suffix. For example, “anthropologist” has the prefix “a, an, anthrop”. The first question is which one should be used. Secondly, some words’ morphemes’ meanings have nothing to do with the word. For example, although “apple” has the prefix “a”, it doesn’t have the meanings of “without, not”. To solve these problems, some rules are defined as follows. • When matching the morphemes of word ti, the longest\ncharacter sequence will be viewed as the morpheme. For example, the prefix of word “anthropologist” is “anthrop” not “a or an”. • We define a threshold λ. If the cosine distance between word ti and its morpheme mi, (mi ∈Mi) is larger than λ, mi will be remained or abandoned otherwise."

Both of the models can be solved via negative sampling and hierarchical softmax [10]. CBOW and Skipgram acts as the baselines in a number of papers [12]. Different from CBOW and Skip-gram, Glove combines not only the context information but also the advantage of global matrix factorization. It is reported that Glove outperforms CBOW and Skip-gram in some NLP tasks [6]. In this paper, we utilize the source code of word2vec to train CBOW and Skip-gram. Glove is trained based on the code4.

It is reported that the number of negative samples in the range 5-20 is useful for small corpus. If huge-sized corpus is used, the number of negative samples should be chosen from 2 to 5 [10]. According to the corpus we used, the number of negative samples is set as 20 in this paper. The dimension of word embedding is set as 200 like that in [12].

Each dataset is divided into three column. The first two columns stand for word pairs and the last column is human score. On the task, we need to solve two problems. One is how to calculate the distance between two words. The other is how to evaluate the similarity between our results and human scores. For the first problem, we utilize the cosine distance to measure the distance between two words. This strategy is used in many papers [10], [6]. The second problem is solved via Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient (ρ). Higher ρ means better performance. For English word similarity, there are two golden standard datasets including Wordsim-353 [13] and RG-65 [14]. To avoid occasionality, however, we utilize some other widely-used datasets including\n3https://msu.edu/ defores1/gre/roots/gre rts afx1.htm 4http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/\nRare-Word [9], SCWS [15], Men-3k [16] and WS-353-Related [17]. More details of these datasets are shown in Table 1.\n2) Syntactic Analogy: Based on the learned word embedding, the core task of syntactic analogy is to answer the analogy questions “a is to b as c is to ”. In this paper, we utilize the Microsoft Research Syntactic Analogies dataset. This dataset with size of 8000 is created by Mikolov [18]. In this experiment, we also utilize the cosine distance to measure the distance between two words. To answer the syntactic analogy questions “a is to b as c is to d” where d is unknown, we assume the word representations of a, b, c, d are va, vb, vc, vd, respectively. To get d, we firstly calculate v̂d = vb−va+vc. Then, we find the word d̂ whose cosine distance to v̂d is the largest. Finally, we set d as d̂. For clarity, we describe it as following equation. In this experiments, accuracy on the whole dataset will be reported.\nd = argmax w vwv̂d ‖ vw ‖‖ v̂d ‖ , w ∈ vocabulary (9)"

It is remarkable that our models approximately outperform CBOW which is the base model of ours for 5 percent and 7 percent on the golden standard Wordsim-353 and RG-65, respectively. On WS-353-REL, the difference between CBOW and MEW-S even reaches to 8 percent. The advantage of our models indicates the validity and effectiveness of our methods. We give some empirical explanations of the huge promotion. Based on our strategy, more information will be captured in corpus. Like the example in Figure 2, the semantic information captured by CBOW only stems from sequence “he is a good anthropologist”. In our model, however, not only the semantic information in the original sequence but also the information in sequence “he is a good human” and “he is a good man” will be captured. Obviously, more semantic information means better performance. Specially, because of medium-size corpus and experimental settings, Glove doesn’t perform as well as it in other papers [6]."

In Mikolov’s dataset, we observe that the suffix of “b” usually is the same as the suffix of “d” when answering question “a is to b as c is to d”. Based on our strategy, morpheme-similar words will not only gather together but also have a tend to group near the morpheme’s meanings, which makes our embeddings have the advantage to deal with the syntactic analogy problems. However, it is abnormal that all results are lower than the state-of-the-art results in [18]. We give some empirical explanations of this problem. Firstly, we utilize different corpus which is the key factor of word embedding’s quality. Secondly, different parameter settings can affect the performance of word embeddings which can be seen in the following sections. However, this experiment is also meaningful.

The sizes of corpora used in this analysis are the 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, 4/5 and 5/5 of the corpus mentioned before, respectively. We utilize the result of word similarity on Wordsim-353 as the evaluation criterion. From Figure 5, we observe several phenomenons. Firstly, the performance of CBOW is sensitive to the token size. However, our models’ performances seem more stable than CBOW. Like what we said in word similarity analysis, our methods can increase the semantic information of the corpus, which is a great property for dealing with some corpus-limited languages. It is worth noting that our performances on the\nsmallest corpus are even better than CBOW’s performance on the largest corpus. Secondly, the performances of our models are all better than CBOW which indicates the effectiveness and validity of our methods.\nIn the analysis of window size, we observe that the performances of all word embeddings have a tend to ascend with the increasing of window size in Figure 6. Like the result in Figure 5, our models outperform CBOW under all pre-set conditions. Our worst performances are approximately equal to the best performance of CBOW, which may stem from the increasing semantic information property of our methods.\nTo further demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of our method, the dimension of word embedding is reduced from 200 to 2 with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We randomly select several words from the embedding of MWEA and illustrate them in Figure 7. Different colors stand for words with different morphemes. It is apparent that words with similar morpheme have a tend to group together."

Based on the different strategy to\nadd the morphemes’ meanings, three models named MWEA, MWE-S and MWE-M were built. To test performance of our embeddings, we utilized three comparative baselines and tested them on the word similarity and syntactic analogy tasks. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of models. Our models beat the baselines on five word similarity datasets. On the golden standard Wordsim-353 and RG-65, our models even approximately outperform CBOW for 5 percent and 7 percent, respectively. On syntactic analogy task, our models also beat the baselines to a great extent. Compare with CBOW, MWE-A approximately outperforms it for 7 percent. Last but not the least, our models seem to have great advantages to train some corpus-limited languages according to the observation of token size analysis. The conspicuous advantages demonstrate the effectiveness of our models. In this paper, all word embeddings are trained based on medium-size corpus. In future work, we will conduct all experiments on huge-size corpus and test our models’ ability to deal with some morpheme-rich languages like Germany and French."

To test the performances of our models, we conduct the word similarity and syntactic analogy. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods. Our models beat the comparative baselines on both tasks to a great extent. On the golden standard Wordsim-353 and RG-65, our models approximately outperform CBOW for 5 and 7 percent, respectively. In addition, 7 percent advantage is also achieved by our models on syntactic analysis. According to parameter analysis, our models can increase the semantic information in the corpus and our performances on the smallest corpus are similar to the performance of CBOW on the corpus which is five times ours. This property of our methods may have some positive effects on NLP researches about the corpus-limited languages.",
