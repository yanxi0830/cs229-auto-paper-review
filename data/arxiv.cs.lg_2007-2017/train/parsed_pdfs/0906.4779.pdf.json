      "text" : "Learning in probabilistic models is often severely hampered by the general intractability of the normalization factor and its derivatives. Here we propose a new learning technique that obviates the need to compute an intractable normalization factor or sample from the equilibrium distribution of the model. This is achieved by establishing dynamics that would transform the observed data distribution into the model distribution, and then setting as the objective the minimization of the initial flow of probability away from the data distribution. Score matching, minimum velocity learning, and certain forms of contrastive divergence are shown to be special cases of this learning technique. We demonstrate the application of minimum probability flow learning to parameter estimation in Ising models, deep belief networks, multivariate Gaussian distributions and a continuous model with a highly general energy function defined as a power series. In the Ising model case, minimum probability flow learning outperforms current state of the art techniques by approximately two orders of magnitude in learning time, with comparable error in the recovered parameters. It is our hope that this technique will alleviate existing restrictions on the classes of probabilistic models that are practical for use."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Estimating parameters for probabilistic models is a fundamental problem in many scientific and engineering disciplines. Unfortunately, most probabilistic learning algorithms require calculating the normalization factor, or partition function, of the probabilistic model in question, or at least calculating its gradient. For the overwhelming majority of models there are no known analytic solutions, confining us to the highly restrictive subset of probabilistic models that can be analytically solved, or those that can be made tractable using known approximate learning techniques. Thus, development of new techniques for parameter estimation in currently intractable probabilistic models has the potential to be of great benefit, lifting near ubiquitous restrictions on how we are able to model the world.\nMany approaches exist for approximate learning, including mean field theory and its expansions, variational Bayes techniques and a plethora of sampling or numerical integration based methods [21, 10, 9, 5]. Of particular interest are contrastive divergence (CD), developed by Welling, Hinton and Carreira-Perpiñán [22, 4], Hyvärinen’s score matching (SM) [7], and the minimum velocity learning framework proposed by Movellan [12, 11, 13].\nContrastive divergence [22, 4, 23] is a variation on steepest gradient descent of the maximum (log) likelihood (ML) objective function. The gradient of the log likelihood for observed data under a model can be calculated by comparing a gradient averaged over the data distribution, to a gradient\nar X\niv :0\n90 6.\n47 79\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 5\nJu n\naveraged over the model distribution1. Everywhere the model has higher probability than the data, the model term dominates and the probability assigned under the model is reduced. Everywhere the data distribution has greater probability than the model distribution, the data term dominates and the probability under the model is increased. The term averaged over the model is commonly approximated by sampling. Unfortunately, sampling can be extremely expensive, costing in general an amount of time exponential in the dimensionality of the system.\nUnder contrastive divergence [22, 4], averaging over the model is performed using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [14] sampling algorithm, initialized at the data distribution. Rather than running to equilibrium however, the Markov Chain is terminated after only one (or a few) steps, avoiding exponential sampling time. The intuition behind this early termination is that, since the sampling algorithm is initialized at the data, any divergence of the sampled distribution from the data distribution will tend to be in the direction of the model distribution. Contrasting the samples to the data distribution will thus tend to pull the model in the correct direction even before the Markov Chain has reached equilibrium.\nScore matching, developed by Aapo Hyvärinen [7], is a method that learns parameters in a probabilistic model using only derivatives of the energy function evaluated over the data distribution (see Equation (12)). This obviates the need to explicitly sample or integrate over the model distribution. In score matching one minimizes the expected square distance of the score function with respect to spatial coordinates given by the data distribution from the similar score function given by the model distribution. It can be seen as an integration of the contrastive divergence gradient for infinitesimal Langevin dynamics [8], as the limit of approximating the model distribution by patching together cutouts of the model distribution around each data point [20] and finally as equivalent to minimum velocity learning [12].\nMinimum velocity learning is an approach recently proposed by Movellan [12] that recasts a number of the ideas behind CD, treating the minimization of the initial dynamics away from the data distribution as the goal itself rather than a surrogate for it.\nFrequently when performing learning, one begins at the data distribution, and then evolves it into the model distribution via some sampling dynamics that have the model as their equilibrium distribution. Movellan’s proposal is that rather than directly minimize the difference between the data and the model, one introduces system dynamics leading to the equilibrium distribution and minimizes the initial flow of probability away from the data under those dynamics. If the model already looks exactly like the data there will be no initial flow of probability. This can be thought of as an analogy for how we learn in the world. As Movellan has pointed out [12], a child learning to ride a bike does not need to fall repeatedly all the way to the ground to learn how to keep her balance, she just needs to feel the bike starting to deviate from its expected position to update her model for how it responds.\nMovellan applies this intuition to a specific class of distributions and a single choice of system dynamics. Namely that of distributions over continuous state spaces evolving via diffusion dynamics. The velocity in minimum velocity learning is the difference in average drift velocities between particles diffusing under the model distribution and particles diffusing under the data distribution.\nHere we provide a framework, applicable to any parametric model, of which minimum velocity, certain forms of CD, and SM are all special cases, and which is in many situations more powerful than any of these algorithms. This framework extends the ideas behind minimum velocity learning to arbitrary state spaces and a far broader class of dynamics. We show that learning under this framework is effective and fast in a number of cases: Ising models, deep belief networks (DBN),\n1 Specifically, a gradient in terms of the energy function. The update step for model parameters θ is proportional to the gradient of the log likelihood of the data distribution\n∆θ ∝ ∂\nhP i p (0) i log p (∞) i (θ) i ∂θ = − X\ni\n∂Ei (θ)\n∂θ p (0) i + X i ∂Ei (θ) ∂θ p (∞) i (θ) ,\nwhere p(0) and p(∞) (θ) represent the data distribution and model distribution, respectively, E (θ) is the energy function associated with the model distribution and i indexes the states of the system (see Section 2.1). The second term in this gradient can be extremely difficult to compute.\nmultidimensional Gaussian distributions, and a complicated two-dimensional continuous distribution."

To accomplish this, we observe that diffusion dynamics are a special case of dynamics governed by a master equation that enforces conservation of probability [15]:\nṗ (t) i =\n∑ j 6=i Γij(θ) p (t) j − ∑ j 6=i Γji(θ) p (t) i , (3)\nwhere ṗ(t)i = ∂p\n(t) i\n∂t is the rate of change of probability with time. Transition rates Γij(θ) give the rate at which probability will flow from a state j into a state i. The first term of Equation (3) represents flow of probability out of other states j into the state i, and the second represents flow out of i into other states j. The dependence on θ results from the requirement that the dynamics we choose cause p(t) to flow to the equilibrium distribution p(∞)(θ). For readability, explicit dependence on θ will be dropped except where specifically relevant. If we choose the diagonal of Γ to obey Γii = − ∑ j 6=i Γji, then we can write the dynamics as\nṗ(t) = Γp(t) (4) (see Figure 1). The unique solution for p(t) is2\np(t) = exp (Γt) p(0). (5)"

One way to guarantee this is by choosing Γ such that it satisfies detailed balance for the model distribution p(∞), and such that there is a path through Γ allowing mixing between any two states. Note that there is no need to restrict the dynamics defined by Γ to those of any real physical process, such as diffusion. Detailed balance requires that at equilibrium the probability flow from state i into state j equals the probability flow from j into i,\nΓjip (∞) i (θ) = Γijp (∞) j (θ) , (6)\nwhich can be rewritten as Γij Γji = p (∞) i (θ)\np (∞) j (θ)\n= exp [Ej (θ)− Ei (θ)] .

(8)\nThe choice Γij = Γji = 0 also satisfies Equation (6), allowing a sparse population of Γ for purposes of computational tractability. Theoretically, to guarantee convergence to the model distribution, the non-zero elements of Γ must be chosen such that, given sufficient time, probability can flow between any pair of states. In practice, we will only need to consider a small fraction of the non-zero elements in Γ (see Section 2.5)."

Naı̈vely, this would seem to prohibit evaluation and minimization of the objective function. Fortunately, all the elements in p(0) not corresponding to observations are zero. Since our objective function is only evaluated at time t = 0 this allows us to ignore all those Γij for which no data point exists at state j. Additionally, there is a great deal of flexibility as far as which elements of Γ can be set to zero. By populating Γ so as to connect each state to a fixed number of additional states, the cost of the algorithm in both memory and time is O(M), where M is the number of observed data points, and does not depend on the number of system states."

The flow matrix Γ and distribution vectors p(t) transition from being very large to being infinite in size. Γ can still be chosen to connect each state to a small, finite, number of additional states however, and only outgoing probability flow from states with data contributes to the objective function, so the cost of learning remains largely unchanged.\nIn addition, for a particular pattern of connectivity in Γ this objective function, like Movellan’s [12], reduces to score matching [7] (other connectivity patterns reduce to alternate forms). Taking the limit of connections between all states within a small distance of each other, and then Taylor expanding in , one can show that, up to an overall constant and scaling factor\nK ≈ KSM = ∑\ni∈{samples}\n[ 1 2 ∇E(xi) · ∇E(xi)−∇2E(xi) ] .

Training was performed on 20, 000 samples so as to match the number of samples used in section III.A. of Broderick et al. Note that given sufficient samples, the minimum probability flow algorithm would converge exactly to the right answer. On an 8 core 2.33 GHz Intel Zeon, the learning converges in about 15 seconds. Broderick et al. perform a similar learning task on a 100-CPU grid computing cluster, with a convergence time of approximately 200 seconds.\nSimilar learning was performed for 100, 000 samples from a 100 unit, fully connected, Ising model. A coupling matrix was chosen with elements randomly drawn from a Gaussian with mean 0 and variance 0.04. Using the minimum probability flow learning technique, learning took approximately 1 minute, compared to roughly 12 hours for a 100 unit nearest neighbor coupling model of retinal data [18] (personal communication, J.

Here we propose a new learning technique that obviates the need to compute an intractable normalization factor or sample from the equilibrium distribution of the model. This is achieved by establishing dynamics that would transform the observed data distribution into the model distribution, and then setting as the objective the minimization of the initial flow of probability away from the data distribution. Score matching, minimum velocity learning, and certain forms of contrastive divergence are shown to be special cases of this learning technique. We demonstrate the application of minimum probability flow learning to parameter estimation in Ising models, deep belief networks, multivariate Gaussian distributions and a continuous model with a highly general energy function defined as a power series. In the Ising model case, minimum probability flow learning outperforms current state of the art techniques by approximately two orders of magnitude in learning time, with comparable error in the recovered parameters. It is our hope that this technique will alleviate existing restrictions on the classes of probabilistic models that are practical for use.",
