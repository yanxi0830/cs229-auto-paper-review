      "text" : "The Nyström method is a kind of low-rank matrix approximation approach mainly used for speeding up kernel methods. The Nyström method can approximate any given positive semidefinite matrix using only a subset of its columns, so it alleviates the computation and storage problems when the kernel matrix is large in size. The Nyström method has been extensively used in the machine learning community. For example, the Nyström method has been applied to Gaussian process Williams and Seeger (2001), kernel SVM (Kumar et al., 2012, Zhang et al., 2008), spectral clustering (Fowlkes et al., 2004), and kernel PCA (Talwalkar et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2008, ?).\nWilliams and Seeger (2001) are the first to use the Nyström method for low-rank matrix approximation. The uniform column selection proposed by Williams and Seeger (2001) is\nthe simplest but the most widely used in practice (Fowlkes et al., 2004, Talwalkar et al., 2008, Gittens and Mahoney, 2013). Following the work of Williams and Seeger (2001), many uniform and non-uniform sampling techniques are proposed and analyzed (Drineas and Mahoney, 2005, Zhang et al., 2008, Belabbas and Wolfe, 2009, Kumar et al., 2009b,a, Cortes et al., 2010, Li et al., 2010, Talwalkar and Rostamizadeh, 2010, Gittens, 2011, Jin et al., 2011, Mackey et al., 2011, Kumar et al., 2012, Gittens and Mahoney, 2013).\nMuch work has been done on the upper bounds of the sampling techniques for the Nyström method. Most of the work, e.g., (Drineas and Mahoney, 2005, Li et al., 2010, Kumar et al., 2009a, Jin et al., 2011, Kumar et al., 2012), studied the additive-error bound. By further making assumptions on matrix coherence, better additive bounds were obtained by Talwalkar and Rostamizadeh (2010), Jin et al. (2011), Mackey et al. (2011). However, as was argued in the review paper (Mahoney, 2011), additive-error bounds are less convincing than the relative-error bounds. The recent work of Gittens (2011) provided the relative-error bounds for the first time, and then the bounds were sharpened by Gittens and Mahoney (2013). Furthermore, a method called the ensemble Nyström method was proposed by Kumar et al. (2009a, 2012) to improve the standard Nyström method by combining a collection of sampled columns. The ensemble Nyström method demonstrated significant empirical improvement over the standard Nyström method.\nHowever, the lower error bounds of the Nyström method were largely unknown. To our knowledge, the only known lower bound was established in (Jin et al., 2011, Theorem 4) on the additive-error in spectral norm. However, this lower bound is not quite informative because it lower bounds the additive-error on a matrix with potentially very large norm. We will give technical analyses of this lower bound in Section 4.1.\nThe Nyström method is closely related to the column selection problem and can benefit from the column selection techniques (Kumar et al., 2012, Gittens and Mahoney, 2013). Column selection has been very widely studied in the literature (Frieze et al., 2004, Deshpande et al., 2006, Drineas et al., 2008, Deshpande and Rademacher, 2010, Boutsidis et al., 2011b, Guruswami and Sinop, 2012). The most advanced relative-error columns selection techniques include the adaptive sampling algorithm in (Deshpande et al., 2006), the nearoptimal algorithm in (Boutsidis et al., 2011b), and the optimal algorithm in (Guruswami and Sinop, 2012) whose upper bound matches the lower bound of column selection problem (Boutsidis et al., 2011a).\nThe Nyström method is also related to the CUR matrix decomposition which selects both columns and rows to form a low-rank approximation. As well as the Nyström method, CUR is also widely studied in the literature (Goreinov et al., 1997a,b, Stewart, 1999, Tyrtyshnikov, 2000, Drineas, 2003, Drineas et al., 2006, 2008, Mahoney and Drineas, 2009, Bien et al., 2010, Wang and Zhang, 2012). The CUR problem is actually an extension of the Nyström method to a general matrix. We will show in Section 4.3 that the lower error bound of the Nyström method is even worse than the upper bound of the state-of-the-art CUR algorithm in (Wang and Zhang, 2012)."

When A is positive semidefinite, the SVD is identical to the eigenvalue decomposition and UA = VA.\nWe define the matrix norms as follows. Let ‖A‖1 = ∑ i,j |aij | be the ℓ1-norm, ‖A‖F = ( ∑\ni,j a 2 ij) 1/2 = ∑ i σ 2 A,i be the Frobenius norm, ‖A‖2 = max‖x‖2=1 ‖Ax‖2 = σA,1 be the\nspectral norm, and ‖A‖∗ = ∑\ni σA,i be the nuclear norm.

Given matrices A ∈ Rm×n, X ∈ Rm×p, and Y ∈ Rq×n, XX†A = UXU T X A ∈ Rm×n is the projection of A onto the column space of X, and AY†Y = AVYV T Y ∈ Rm×n is the projection of A onto the row space of Y."

We can see from the figures that A−C(i)W(i)†C(i)T can be partitioned to three kinds of blocks. Some blocks are all-zero; some are all-(α−η); the rest are all-(α−η) except for the diagonal entries: the diagonal entries are all-(1 − η).\nBased on the properties of the matrix A − C(i)W(i)†C(i)T , we study the value of the entries of A− Ãenst,c . By expressing it as\nA− Ãenst,c = A− 1\nt\nt ∑\ni=1\nC(i)W(i) † C(i) T = 1\nt\nt ∑\ni=1\n( A−C(i)W†C(i)T ) ,\na discreet examination reveals that A − Ãenst,c can be partitioned into four kinds of regions as illustrated in Figure 2. We annotate the regions in the figure and summarize the values of entries in each region in the table below. (Region 1 and 4 are further partitioned into diagonal entries and off-diagonal entries.)\nRegion 1 (diag) 1 (off-diag) 2 3 4 (diag) 4 (off-diag)\n# Entries tc tc2 − tc (tc)2 − tc2 2tc(m− tc) m− tc (m− tc)2 − (m− tc) Value t−1\nt (1− η) t−1 t (α− η) t−2 t (α− η) t−1 t (α− η) 1− η α− η\nNow we do a summation over the entries of A− Ãenst,c to compute its squared Frobenius norm:\n‖A− Ãenst,c ‖2F = tc [ t− 1\nt (1− η)\n]2 + · · ·+ [ (m− tc)2 − (m− tc) ] (α− η)2\n= (1− α)(1 + α− 2η)(m − 2c+ c t ) + (α− η)2 ( 4c2 − 4cm+m2 + 2cm− 3c 2 t ) = (1− α)2 (\nm− 2c+ c t ) + (1− α)2 (c+ 1−αα ) 2 [ (m− 2c+ c t ) ( 2 α − 2 +m ) + c(m− c) t ]\n≥ (1− α)2 ( m− 2c+ c t )( 1 + m+ 2α − 2 (c+ 1−αα ) 2 ) ,\nwhere the last inequality follows from c(m−c)t ≥ 0."

Much work has been done on the upper bounds of the sampling techniques for the Nyström method. Most of the work, e.g., (Drineas and Mahoney, 2005, Li et al., 2010, Kumar et al., 2009a, Jin et al., 2011, Kumar et al., 2012), studied the additive-error bound. By further making assumptions on matrix coherence, better additive bounds were obtained by Talwalkar and Rostamizadeh (2010), Jin et al. (2011), Mackey et al. (2011). However, as was argued in the review paper (Mahoney, 2011), additive-error bounds are less convincing than the relative-error bounds. The recent work of Gittens (2011) provided the relative-error bounds for the first time, and then the bounds were sharpened by Gittens and Mahoney (2013).",

Much work has been done on the sampling techniques for the Nyström method, and many were guaranteed with upper error bounds. However, the lower bounds, especially the relative error bounds, were largely unknown. We explore in this paper the lower bounds of the Nyström method to show how bad the Nyström method can perform. We establish both additive and relative error lower bounds for the Nyström method. Interestingly, some of the relative-error lower bounds we established can be attained by some algorithms, which indicates some lower bounds we establish are tight! However, some lower bounds reveal the downside of the Nyström method that they are much worse than the column selection problem and the CUR problem. Sadly, we also show that some bounds cannot be improved by the ensemble Nyström method.",
