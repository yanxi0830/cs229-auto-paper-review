Lastly, this neural network is used to detect the set of support vectors which determines the maximally-separating region between the binary classes.\nI. INTRODUCTION AND RELATED WORKS\nInherent in traditional support vector detection is the assumption that the data are separable into two distinct classes, with the data points in each class being labeled distinctly, while minimizing mislabeling instances. In the case of linear support vector detection, a single hyperplane is sought, whereby the single hyperplane can be optimally shifted along its normal vector and its reflection. The shifted hyperplane and its reflection across the original, single hyperplane defines an optimal intermediate region, along with two distinctly labeled classes.\nAssume the existence of a training set with known labels derived from a set of two distinct values. Since the weight vector for the single hyperplane defines its normal vector, then the problem reduces to finding a single weight vector such that its squared norm is minimized, subject to the constraint that the individually labeled training examples lie to one side of the original hyperplane, along with others sharing the same label. After which, by combining both the squared norm term and the equation for the original hyperplane, the constrained optimization problem is converted to an unconstrained optimization problem and solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers. The reader is referred to [1, pp. 311− 314] for mathematical formalities on linear support vector machines.\nIn case the data are not linearly separable, the aforementioned algorithm will not work, as stated. Slack variables have to be introduced, which has the effect of reducing the area of the intermediate region, resulting in the constraint being modified. Furthermore, in the unconstrained problem, the slack\nvariables are taken into account by adding a penalty term as something on the order of the number of misclassifications encountered, where misclassifications take one of two forms. Either some data points are counted as unclassified, because they cannot be separated from the intermediate region, or they are misclassified, because they are incorrectly seen as training examples which belong to the class containing data points with a different label. The reader is referred to [1, pp. 315− 318] for mathematical formalities on non-linear support vector machines.\nFor data sets which are extremely large, relative to its number of attributes, Mangasarian, et.al. showed in [55] that a linear support vector machine suffices when separating the data into two distinct sets with small error. Yet, in other kinds of problems, where the data are not linearly separable, or where a linear support vector machine gives rise to a significant number of misclassifications or an intermediate region with a high number of unclassified data points, the requirement for a nonlinear support vector machine can be too expensive, both in time complexity and memory usage [17].\nThe prevailing methods for dealing with the expense associated with solving the non-linear optimization problem are variations of the decomposition algorithm, [40], [42], [45], [63], whereby the data are projected to a lower dimensional subspace, whose basis vectors are chosen such that the projected data are linearly separable. By linear separability of the data, the unconstrained, non-linear problem can be solved in the subspace via a linear support vector machine, resulting in a sequence of solvable sub-problems in each projected subspace. Influenced by Keerthi, et.al [44], Chung, et.al. [17] propose the use of specific seed values for the set of Lagrange multipliers of the linear support vector machines in each subspace such that faster convergence to the solution of the non-linear optimization problem is achieved. Likewise, the chunking method of Vapnik [75] makes use of the fact that the rows and columns of the matrix in the quadratic constraint, which correspond to Lagrange multipliers with a zero value, can be removed, while retaining the same solution through each iteration of a sub-problem.\nMotivated to produce a method of solution which does not require iterative solutions of quadratic programs and does not require checking of certain conditions to ensure convergence to a solution, a method is provided such that the data are projected into a two dimensional space, whereby the projected data are either linearly separable or the data forms one contiguous class. When the data are separable, linear separation is achieved by forming a linear regression hyperplane through one of the classes and shifting it an appropriate amount in order to achieve separation of the classes. The associated shift\ncorresponds to the identification of the set of support vectors by measuring distances to the regression hyperplane from data points in the set which is in the complement of the set of data points used to form the regression hyperplane.\nSuppose infinitely many copies of a bounded structure are used to partition R2 and let B ⊂ R2 be a bounded subset containing finitely many copies of the bounded structure. Further suppose that structures in the partition are neighbors, if their respective boundaries have non-empty intersection and infinitely many of the bounded structures in the partition are individually occupied by exactly one point at the center of the structure, independently of all other structures. In [32] and [33], it is shown that, if the probability of neighboring structures each containing related points is greater than some critical value, then with probability 1, a path can be traced from any starting occupied bounded structure to any ending occupied bounded structure, with the path in between the start and the end consisting entirely of neighboring occupied structures. From this statement, the contrapositive statement is obtained such that, if the probability of neighboring structures each containing related points is less than or equal to the same critical value, then with probability 1, no such path exists for any two bounded structures. Hence, all points are either related to no other points or only related to finitely many points in neighboring bounded structures. It is this contrapositive condition that is of interest and great use during K-means classification, as classes are formed by groupings of interrelated data points.\nRarely does inter-related, real-world data conform to a predefined, rigid partition, as described above. As such, after removing the rigid partition of R2, suppose that the data are modeled by a node process which randomly generates points within B according to some predetermined probability distribution. Points in B are inter-related, if they are within a certain distance of one another or some common point, such as the average of a set of previously-grouped, inter-related points. In [57], it is shown that, with probability 1, there is a path of inter-related points between any two points in B, if the number of points relative to the area of B is beyond a certain critical number or, if the maximum distance between inter-related points is larger than a certain critical number.\nIn [60], it is proven in cor. (7.4.39) that an ordered set of data, which is assumed to be spatially uniformly distributed, will form clusters, i.e. classes, if the measured distances between data points (or some common data point in each class) are below a certain threshold, which is computed as a function of the number of data points sampled from the total population of data. Now, most datasets would be too computationally expensive to order. So, we can get around this limitation by making certain assumptions.\nWe can make the assumption that the node process generates points according to the normal distribution by making use of a theorem from [38] in probability called the Central Limit Theorem. In essence, this theorem states that any set of randomly distributed data with finite mean and variance will tend to be normally distributed as the sample size grows large. This accounts for the ubiquity of the normal distribution in nature and why it’s safe to make an assumption of normality in most cases. As such, the node process is allowed to run until J = M2 points are generated, as represented by a sequence\nof independent, identically distributed random variables, X1, X2, ... , XJ , each with mean 0 and variance 1. An order statistic is applied to the these random variables so that Xk1 < Xk2 < ... < XkJ , where σ(i) = ki for i ∈ {1, 2, ..., J} is a permutation resulting in the ordering of {Xi}Ji=1. Note that, by default, {Xki} J i=1 is a sequence of dependent random variables since for each i ∈ {2, 3, ..., J}, the random variable Xki depends upon Xkj for all j < i. Now, {Xki} J i=1 is a (less computationally expensive) ordering of a set of points generated by the node process. The edge space of the higher dimensional data is then embedded within the 2-dimensional plane in order to aid in the calculation of a threshold on the distance measure.\nTo make the assumption of uniformity of the ordered set of points and to perform clustering therein, it is first noted that the Beta distribution is the probability distribution of an order statistic of normally distributed random variables [54]. The Beta distribution shape parameters are then defined to be, α = 1 = β, since the data points are injectively generated into exactly 1 structure of the uniformly partitioned, 2-dimensional, bounded region. Hence, the ordering of the sample can be assumed to be approximately uniform.\nFinally, with the defined partition, it is shown that under certain conditions, no approximation of probabilities in the continuum is required to prove the existence of a path of any order, as in [57]. Instead, the probability of a long range path in the continuum is equivalent to the probability of a long range path, over the same set of points, in the presence of the defined posterior partition when the maximum radial distance between connected points falls within a certain bounded interval. On this bounded interval, the probability of the existence of a long range path rises sharply when points connect at distances within the bounded interval. Lastly, the probability measure in question is found to be a unique random cluster measure which realizes a set of conditional probability measures. As such, the node process samples from the collection of conditional probability measures to form classes, when points connect at a distance less than or equal to the critical length.\nIn [13], Cai, et.al. investigate the problem of partial connectivity of randomly distributed points in a bounded region by making the assumption that, relative to the size of the bounded region, the number of points to be generated is relatively small. As such, a Poisson-distributed node process generates an independent set of points in the designated region. Copies of a hexagon of some fixed, immutable size, which is not dependent upon distances between generated points, are used to partition the bounded region. Points in the region are deemed to connect to form an open edge, if after the region is partitioned, the points lie within the same hexagon or neighboring hexagons, where hexagons are neighbors, if their respective boundaries have non-empty intersection. Otherwise, the edge between two points is closed. Likewise, they define the logical points at the centers of two neighboring hexagons to connect to form an open edge, if each neighboring hexagon independently contains at least one of the generated points. In [13], Cai, et.al. compute probabilities as a function of the density of hexagons which are occupied by at least one point. They showed that if the number of hexagons in the fixed partition is unbounded and the number of points generated within the continuum of the bounded region is below (or at) a critical threshold, then the\nprobability of a majority of the occupied hexagons (and points contained therein) in the bounded region being connected in a contiguous path will tend to zero. On the other hand, if the density of occupied hexagons is within a short interval around the critical threshold, then a connecting path of hexagons or points, from any start to any end, occurs with probability that rises sharply from some small positive value to a value close to 1 for densities that fall within the range of the short interval.\n[31, Thm. (1.1)] gives an estimate of the length of the short interval. If the area of the bounded region is assumed to be one, without loss of generality, then the estimate of the length of the short interval can never be any better than\nΘ\n(\nlog1/4(n) √\nlog (n) n\n)\n, where n is the number of points\ngenerated within the bounded region by the node process.\nThis work uses the distance notion of connectivity without the presence of a partition, the same as in [13]. However, it markedly differs in that the prototypical hexagon used in the defined posterior partition of the bounded region is allowed to change in size, if the node process is stopped and started again after a partition has already been defined. Since the prototypical hexagon is allowed to change in size so that the logical centers are closer to (or further away from) each other and point density is inversely proportional to the maximum connection length, therein lies an added advantage when calculating the probability of a connected path of hexagons or points. Moreover, if the prototypical hexagon always shrinks as the node process generates more points, then it should be expected that the critical threshold and the length of the short interval around the critical threshold are intertwined. It is shown that this is, in fact, the case.\nThe rest of this work is organized as follows. In section (II), we formulate the notion of connectivity of randomlygenerated data points in the continuum using random geometric graphs and prove certain continuity results of the probability measure of a class of graph properties. We use the continuity results to show the existence of a critical connectivity radius (equivalent density of data points) and prove that the length of the sharp threshold interval containing the critical radius is of a certain size, depending upon the number of data points and the length of the critical radius.\nIn section (III), we uniformly partition the bounded region into shapes of the same size and formulate the notion of connectivity of randomly-generated data points using the random cluster model. The continuity results of section (II) still hold true and are used to show the existence of a critical connectivity radius, with the associated sharp threshold interval length being of a certain size, depending upon the number of data points and the length of the critical radius. In addition, relationships between the graph properties and probabilities of the graph properties are proven, along with a result about the relationship between the critical radii. These results, as well as other results from the random cluster model, are used to give a practical estimate of the length of the sharp threshold interval and a lower bound estimate of the change in the probability of the class of graph properties. Finally, it is shown that under certain conditions which are best for K-means classification, the probabilities of the graph properties are equivalent and the critical radii are of the same length under both formulations.\nIn section (IV ), given a fixed, ordered sample from an unknown group of multi-modal normal distributions, we estimate the mean number of clusters to form in a typical K-means classification. Likewise, we also estimate the length of the sharp threshold interval as a function of the expected number of classes and an estimate of the size of the critical connectivity radius is given as a function of the number of data points in the sample and the expected number of classes to form.\nIn section (V ), using the setup and results from section (IV ), we define the regularized cluster and the set of anomalies, then prove that the regularized cluster and the set of anomalies are linearly separable and show that the linear regression hyperplane defined by the regularized cluster can be shifted by a certain distance along its normal vector to separate the regularized cluster from the set of anomalies.\nFinally, in section (V I), we show that the set of anomalies is a superset for the set of support vectors defining the shifted hyperplane which delineates the maximally separating region between the binary classes and that the resulting neural network detects all of the support vectors."

On the left half of the interval, it is more likely that classes will form, with each containing less than half of all points so that no one class contains the majority of data points. No one class containing the majority of data points is important since, in this event, no one class will contain all data points with probability 1, which is guaranteed by [57] in the continuum and [33] in the partitioned continuum.\nAs an integral step in estimating the length of the interval of radii, continuity in r and ρ of P (Ar[n,ρ]) will be shown.

Furthermore, by continuity and the increasing nature of P (Ar[n,ρ]) in r, there exists r0 = r0(n, ρ, ǫ) such that P (Ar0[n,ρ]) = 1/2. This particular radius of connectivity demarcates the point, beyond which, the generated set of points will transition from a set of disjoint classes to one giant, interrelated class of points, almost surely.

By properties of probabilities measures, P (Ar[n,ρ]) ∈ [0, 1] and by prop. (76), it is true that P (A r [n,ρ]) is non-decreasing as a function of increasing r > 0. By thm. (7), it is true that P (Ar[n,ρ]) increases from ǫ > 0 to 1− ǫ > 0 for fixed ǫ ∈ (0, 12 ). Then, by continuity, there exists r0 > 0 such that P (Ar0[n,ρ]) = 1/2. If I is any continuum of radii and P (AI[n,ρ]) is defined to be the set {P (A r [n,ρ]) : r ∈ I}, then it is easily seen that r0 is in the interior of any compact interval of radii Iǫ such that P (A Iǫ [n,ρ]) = [ǫ, 1− ǫ]. Seeking a contradiction, suppose r0 is in the boundary of Iǫ. Since Iǫ is compact and P (Ar[n,ρ]) is continuous in r, then P (A r0 [n,ρ]) = ǫ or P (Ar0[n,ρ]) = 1 − ǫ. Therefore, P (A r0 [n,ρ]) = 1/2 implies ǫ = 1/2. This is a contradiction since ǫ ∈ (0, 12 ). Thus, r0 is in the interior of Iǫ. Q.E.D.\nNow, if it can be shown that r0 is independent of ǫ, then r0 ∈ Iǫ for all ǫ ∈ (0, 12 ). Note that r0 ∈ I = ⋂\nk Iǫk for any sequence ǫk → 1/2. Clearly I is compact so that r0 is in the interior of I . Therefore, either I is an interval or I = {r0}. Suppose I is an interval of radii. Since r0 is in the interior of I , then there exists r′0 < r0 ∈ I . Now, since ǫk → 1/2, then P (A\nr′0 [n,ρ]) = 1/2 and r ′ 0 < r0 = inf{r > 0 : P (A r [n,ρ]) = 1 2}. This is a contradiction. Therefore, I = {r0} so that r0 is unique. Q.E.D.\nContinuity of P (Ar) in r is proven in [57] and can be used for proving continuity of P (Ar[n,ρ]) in r as follows. Let ∂B denote the boundary of B and define ArB = {0̂ ↔ ∂B} to be the property that there is an r-connected cluster containing 0̂ and a point in ∂B. By arguments in [57], continuity of P (Ar) in r is equivalent to continuity of P (ArB) in r for all bounded regions B containing 0̂. Clearly, P (ArB) = P (A r B − Ar[n,ρ]) + P (A r B ∩ A r [n,ρ]) so that continuity of P (A r B) in r implies continuity of P (ArB ∩ A r [n,ρ]) in r. Now, there exists r′0 > 0 such that P (A r B) = 1 for all r ≥ r ′ 0. Then, it follows that P (Ar[n,ρ]) = P (A r B ∩A r [n,ρ]) is continuous when r ≥ r′0. In particular, P (A r [n,ρ]) is continuous at r ′ 0. So, there is δ > 0 such that P (Ar[n,ρ]) is continuous upon [r ′ 0−δ, r ′ 0+δ].

If 0 < r ≤ R and η is a random variable taking the value r with probability 1 such that ηk ⇒ η as k → ∞. Then, P (Aηk) → P (Aη) as k → ∞.\nProof: This is just a restatement of [57, Thm. (3.8)] for the special case of random variables ηk and η such that P (ηk = rk) = 1 = P (η = r) for all k ≥ 1.\nCorollary 12: (to Theorem 11) P (Ar[n,ρ]) is a continuous function of r.\nProof: Continuity of P (Ar) in r follows from thm. (11). Therefore, the result follows by the discussion preceding the\nstatement of thm. (11).\nTheorem 13: r = r(n, ρ, ǫ) is a continuous function of ǫ if and only if P (Ar[n,ρ]) is a continuous function of r.\nProof: Suppose r(n, ρ, ǫ) is a continuous function of ǫ and let {ǫk ∈ (0, 12 )}k≥1 be a sequence of positive real numbers such that ǫk → ǫ0 as k → ∞. Let {X(e)}e∈G(Xn;r) be a finite sequence of uniformly distributed random variables with values in [0, 1] and define a sequence of random variables {ηk}k≥1 by ηk(e) = r(n, ρ, ǫk) ≡ rk when X(e) < 1 and 0 otherwise. Clearly, ηk = rk with probability 1 for all k ≥ 1. Likewise, define a random variable η0 by η0(e) = r(n, ρ, ǫ0) ≡ r0 when X(e) < 1 and 0 otherwise so that η0 = r0 with probability 1. Since r(n, ρ, ǫ) is continuous in ǫ, then rk → r0 as k → ∞ so that ηk ⇒ η0 as k → ∞. Now, define R = 2 ∗ max{d(x, y) : x, y ∈ Xn}. By lemma (82), 0 < ηk ≤ R for all k ≥ 0. Therefore, P (A ηk [n,ρ]) → P (A η0 [n,ρ]) as k → ∞ by cor. (12) since rk → r0 as k → ∞. Thus, P (Ar[n,ρ]) is a continuous function of r. Conversely, suppose P (Ar[n,ρ]) is a continuous function of r and let {ǫk ∈ (0, 12 )}k≥1 be any convergent sequence such that ǫk → ǫ0. Define rk = r(n, ρ, ǫk) and r0 = r(n, ρ, ǫ0). Given ξ > 0, it is true that Ξ ≡ {k ≥ 1 : |P (Ark[n,ρ]) − P (A r0 [n,ρ])| ≥ ξ} is a set of measure zero by the continuity assumption. Therefore, rk → r0 as k → ∞ by prop. (83). Thus, suppose that Ξ 6= ∅. Then, Ξ is at most countable so that Ξ = ∅ a.s. Hence, rk → r0 as k → ∞ by prop. (83) so that r(n, ρ, ǫ) is a continuous function of ǫ."

Then, the particular r0, which meets the requirements of thm. (14), is the exact radius, such that, it is equally probable that more than half of all points are connected contiguously, in which case, only one such cluster exists, with all other clusters being disjoint and sparsely connected throughout B, or all connected clusters disjointly contain half (or less than half) of all available points, in which case, more than one such cluster can exist. As such, r0 demarcates the radial connection length at which the property Ar[n,ρ] undergoes a phase transition such that the graph G(Xn; r) is likely to be sparsely connected and form disjoint connected classes of points [57, Thms. (3.3, 3.6)], almost surely, when r ∈ [0, r0],\nwhile G(Xn; r) is more likely to be fully connected and form one connected class of points [57, Thms. (3.3, 3.6)], almost surely, when r ∈ (r0, 1].\nLemma 15: r0 = r0(n, ρ, ǫ) is independent of ǫ.\nProof: Let ǫ1, ǫ2 ∈ (0, 12 ) and suppose r0,1 = r0(n, ρ, ǫ1), r0,2 = r0(n, ρ, ǫ2) such that\nP (A r0,1 [n,ρ]) =\n1 2 = P (A r0,2 [n,ρ]). (7)\nIt has to be shown that r0,1 = r0,2. Let {ǫk}k≥1 be a sequence such that ǫk = ǫ1 for all k ≥ 1 and define r0,k = r0(n, ρ, ǫk). Then, for arbitrary ξ > 0, it is true that\nΞ ≡ {k ≥ 1 : |P (A r0,k [n,ρ])− P (A r0,2 [n,ρ])| ≥ ξ} = ∅ (8)\nsince r0,k = r0,1 for all k ≥ 1. Hence, by prop. (83), r0,k → r0,2 as k → ∞. But, r0,k = r0,1 for all k ≥ 1 so that r0,1 = r0,2. Thus, r0 = r0(n, ρ), independent of ǫ.\nRemark 16: As a result of thm. (15), r(ǫ) is independent of ǫ > 0, since r(n, ρ, ǫ) → r(ǫ) as E[n] → ∞. As such, ∆(ǫ) = o(1) so that Ar has a sharp threshold, by definition (6).\nCorollary 17: The critical radius, associated with the property Ar, is unique.\nProof: r(ǫ) is the limit of r(n, ρ, ǫ) as E[n] → ∞. As such, r0 is the constant limit of r0(n, ρ) as E[n] → ∞.\nCorollary 18: Given r > 0, there exists a density of points λ0 = λ(n0) such that\nP (Ar[n0,ρ]) = 1\n2 .\nProof: By lemma (15), let n0 = n0(r, ρ) be the minimum of all positive (real) solutions to r = r0(n, ρ) for some fixed r > 0. The result follows.\nSince n is inversely proportional to connection distance r (requiring that n ∈ [1,∞)), then the particular n0, which meets the requirements of cor. (18), is the exact number of points, such that, it is equally probable that more than half of all points are connected contiguously. In this case, only one such cluster exists, with all other clusters being disjoint and sparsely connected throughout B. Otherwise, all connected clusters disjointly contain half (or less than half) of all available points, in which case, more than one such cluster can exist. As such, n0 demarcates the number of points at which the property Ar[n,ρ] undergoes a phase transition such that the graph G(Xn; r) is likely to be sparsely connected and form disjoint connected classes of points [57, Thms. (3.3, 3.6)], almost surely, when n ∈ [1, n0]. Alternatively, G(Xn; r) is more likely to be fully connected and form one connected class of points [57, Thms. (3.3, 3.6)], almost surely, when n ∈ (n0,∞)."

With Dr[n,ρ] defined as such, the original problem of estimating the length of the sharp threshold for the property Ar[n,ρ] in the continuum is now recast as a site percolation problem on a hexagonal lattice. As will be defined later, a site in the lattice will be deemed open if the corresponding hexagon is occupied by at least one of the points from Xn and it will be deemed closed otherwise. Likewise, two sites are connected and belong to the same connected cluster if both sites are open and their hamming distance is less than or equal to one. Later, a torus on the lattice will be formed by defining a countable collection of permutations of the hexagons in the partition so that the length of the sharp threshold for the property Dr[n,ρ] can be approximated by the length for another property D̂r[n,ρ] on the torus. In this way, boundary connection issues for sites in the partition of B are mitigated and the length of the sharp threshold interval for the property D̂r[n,ρ] approximates the length for Dr[n,ρ], which approximates the length for A Hr [n,ρ], which finally approximates the length for Ar[n,ρ], the original property in the continuum.\nTheorem 35: There is a constant c > 0, independent of M , such that\nP (Dr[n,ρ]) ≤ 1\n2 M−c(r\n∗ 0−r)\nfor all r ≤ r∗0 . Similarly, for some fixed small δ > 0 and for all ǫ1 > 0, there is an M0(δ, ǫ1) such that for all M > M0(δ, ǫ1)\nP (Dr[n,ρ−δ]) ≥ 1− ( 1\n2 + ǫ1)M\n−c(r−r∗0)\nfor all r ≥ r∗0 .\nAn important part of the proof of thm. (35) relies upon the sharp threshold inequality results of [12] and [26]. In order to apply these results, connectivity in the hexagon lattice structure should be extended to the case of a torus, whereby any boundary connectivity issues are mitigated. As such, make HB(r) into a torus by identifying hi,j ∈ HB(r) with an element hi′,j′ in a copy of HB(r), if i′ = i mod M and j′ = j mod M . For every k, l ∈ Z, the mapping τk,l : hi,j → hi+k,j+l defines a shift translation. In this way, a subgroup of automorphisms τ = {τk,l : k, l ∈ Z} with the transitivity property is formed. Thus, any hexagon hi,j can be shifted to any other hexagon hi′,j′ with the translation, τi′−i,j′−j . Now, hexagons in the 1st row (column) are allowed to be joined in a connected cluster with hexagons in the Mth row (column), provided that all hexagons in question are occupied.\nProposition 36: Define τ(HB(r)) to be the torus created by translations of hexagons in HB(r) under the action of permutations in τ and define D̂r[n,ρ] = {HC ⊆ τ(HB(r)) : E[ ρn(C) ] ≥ ρ}. Then, Dr[n,ρ] ⊂ D̂ r [n,ρ] and D r [n,ρ] 6= D̂ r [n,ρ].\nProof: Since D̂r[n,ρ] contains all of the connected hexagons from Dr[n,ρ] and any connections between the 1st and Mth rows (columns) while Dr[n,ρ] contains no connection between the 1st and Mth rows (columns), then the result follows.\nDefinition 37: To each hexagon in the partition of B, associate a site i ∈ {1, 2, ...,M2} as the center of the hexagon. For sites i ∈ {1, 2, ...,M2}, define si ∈ {0, 1} to be the state on site i. A site i is said to be open if si = 1 and closed otherwise. There exists an edge e{i,j} between sites i, j ∈ {1, 2, ...,M2} if and only if there exists a hexagon hri,j ∋ i, j or there exists neighboring hexagons h r i ∋ i and hrj ∋ j in the partition of B. Define e{i,j} to be open if and only if si = 1 = sj and closed otherwise.\nDefinition 38: The conditional influence of i on the property D̂r[n,ρ] is defined to be\nI(i) = P (D̂r[n,ρ] | si = 1)− P (D̂ r [n,ρ] | si = 0)\nand it is a measure of the change in the probability of D̂r[n,ρ] due to a state change from si = 0 to si = 1 at site, i.\nFor completeness, [13, Lemma (4.1.1)] is stated without proof, which gives an upper bound on the change in P (D̂r[n,ρ]) as a function of the point density λ. Utilizing the chain rule for derivatives, a lower bound on the change in P (D̂r[n,ρ]) as a function of r is found and the resulting inequality relationship is used to estimate upper and lower bounds on P (D̂r[n,ρ]), which will approximate the inequality results of thm. (35).\nLemma 39: [13, Lemma (4.1.1)] There is a constant z > 0, independent of M and λ, such that\nd\ndλ P (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≤ z ∗(λ)min{P (D̂r[n,ρ]), 1− P (D̂ r [n,ρ])} logM\nwhere Ahr is the area of the prototypical hexagon hr and z∗(λ) = −zAhre−Ah rλ.\nLemma 40: There is a constant c > 0, independent of M and λ, such that\nd\ndr P (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≥ c ∗(λ)min{P (D̂r[n,ρ]), 1− P (D̂ r [n,ρ])} logM\nwhere Ahr is the area of the prototypical hexagon hr and c∗(λ) = c(λ)Ahre\n−Ahrλ, with c(λ) = −cg(λ) for some function g(λ).\nProof: As in cor. (18), let n∗ be the inverse of r∗ and seeking a contradiction, suppose dr/dλ = 0. Let ǫ ∈ (0, 12 ). By lemma (39), dP/dλ exists. Now, the existence of dP/dr will be shown by proving a Lipschitz condition on the probability distribution P (D̂r[n,ρ]) as a function of r. Assume area(B) = 1. Without loss of generality, it can be assumed that r ∈ [0, 1]. Without further loss of generality, let r∗1 , r ∗ 2 ∈ [0, 1] such that r∗0 is the midpoint of [r ∗ 1 , r ∗ 2 ], i.e. r ∗ 0 = (r ∗ 2 − r ∗ 1)/2. Then, by thm. (32),\n|P (D̂ r∗2 [n,ρ])− P (D̂ r∗1 [n,ρ])| ≤ 1 = (∆ ∗(n, ρ))−1|r∗2 − r ∗ 1 |.\nTherefore, P (D̂r[n,ρ]) is Lipschitz continuous with respect to r. Hence, dP/dr exists. Now, since dP/dλ, dP/dr and dr/dλ all exist, then the Chain Rule for derivatives yields,\nd\ndλ P (D̂r[n,ρ]) =\nd\ndr P (D̂r[n,ρ])×\ndr dλ .\nNote that the existence of dP/dr requires that |dP/dr| < ∞. Therefore, since dr/dλ = 0, then\nd\ndλ P (D̂r[n,ρ]) =\nd\ndr P (D̂r[n,ρ])× 0 = 0.\nAs a result, P (D̂r[n,ρ]) is constant as a function of λ. So, suppose that 0 < n < n∗. Then, P (D̂r[n,ρ]) = 0, which implies that P (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≡ 0. This is a contradiction, since P (D̂ r [n,ρ]) is a probability distribution. Hence, dr/dλ 6= 0. Now, by [33, Thm. (2.28)], there is a constant c > 0, independent of M and λ, such that\nI(i) ≥ cmin{P (D̂r[n,ρ]), 1− P (D̂ r [n,ρ])}\nlogM\nM2 .\nUnder the action of τ , each hexagon in the bounded region B is translated to another hexagon in a copy of B. Therefore, D̂r[n,ρ] and P (D̂ r [n,ρ]) are invariant under the action of τ . Hence, I(i) = I(j) whenever, τ(i) = j, where τ(i) is defined to be the translation of the hexagon hri ∋ i to the hexagon h r j ∋ j in the copy of the partition of B. From [13], in the proof of thm. (39), the following identity holds, with p = p(λ) = 1−e−Ahrλ defined above,\nd\ndλ P (D̂r[n,ρ]) =\nd\ndp P (D̂r[n,ρ])×\ndp\ndλ\n= −Ahre −Ahrλ\nM2 ∑\ni=1\nI(i). (24)\nFor γ > 0, r > 0 and k > 0, any Hr-connected component in Xn containing at least γ(n + k)/2 points will inherently contain an Hr-connected component of size at least γn/2. Hence, AHr[γ(n+k),ρ] ⊆ A Hr [γn,ρ]. It follows that P (AHr[γ(n+k),ρ]) ≤ P (A Hr [γn,ρ]). Therefore, r ∗(γn, ρ, ǫ) ∈ {r > 0 : P (AHr[γ(n+k),ρ]) ≥ ǫ}, which implies r ∗(γ(n + k), ρ, ǫ) ≤ r∗(γn, ρ, ǫ) for k > 0. Hence,\nr∗(γ(n+ k), ρ, ǫ)− r∗(γn, ρ, ǫ) ≤ 0. (25)\nSince point density λ is proportional to point count n for any bounded region B, then using ineq. (25) yields\ndr dλ = lim k→0\nr∗(γ(n+ k), ρ, ǫ)− r∗(γn, ρ, ǫ)\nγk ≤ 0,\nfor some γ > 0. Since dr/dλ 6= 0, it follows that\ndr dλ < 0.\nSince dr/dλ exists, then |dr/dλ| < ∞. Thus, by substituting\nI(i) ≥ cmin{P (D̂r[n,ρ]), 1 − P (D̂ r [n,ρ])}\nlogM\nM2\ninto (24), it follows that\nd\ndλ P (D̂r[n,ρ]) = −Ahre\n−Ahrλ M2 ∑\ni=1\nI(i)\n≤ −cAhre −Ahrλ × M2 ∑\ni=1\nmin{P (D̂r[n,ρ]), 1− P (D̂ r [n,ρ])}\nlogM\nM2\n= −cAhre −Ahrλ × min{P (D̂r[n,ρ]), 1− P (D̂ r [n,ρ])} logM.\nTherefore,\nd\ndλ P (D̂r[n,ρ]) =\nd\ndr P (D̂r[n,ρ])×\ndr\ndλ ≤ −cAhre −Ahrλ (26) × min{P (D̂r[n,ρ]), 1− P (D̂ r [n,ρ])} (27) × logM (28)\nso that\nd\ndr P (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≥ −cAhre −Ahrλ\n(\ndr\ndλ\n)−1\n(29)\n× min{P (D̂r[n,ρ]), 1− P (D̂ r [n,ρ])} (30) × logM. (31)\nDefining g(λ) = (dr/dλ)−1, the result follows.\nRemark 41: Let ǫ > 0 be given. At the risk of ambiguity, denote n = E[n] and define λ∗(n, ρ, ǫ) = inf {\nn > 0 | P (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≥ ǫ } . Inequality (26) implies that\nP (D̂r[n,ρ]) is increasing as a function of decreasing node density λ = λ∗(n, ρ, ǫ) such that the event {\nP (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≥ ǫ }\nfirst occurs. Likewise, since the maximum distance between connected points is inversely proportional to node density, then ineq. (29) implies that P (D̂r[n,ρ]) is decreasing as a function of increasing maximum distance r = r∗(n, ρ, ǫ) between connected points such that the event {\nP (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≥ ǫ }\nfirst occurs.\nLemma 42: Let c > 0 be as in thm. (40). Then, there exists r∗0 , independent of M , such that\nP (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≤ 1\n2 M−c(r\n∗ 0−r)\nfor all r ≤ r∗0 and\nP (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≥ 1− 1\n2 M−c(r−r\n∗ 0)\nfor all r ≥ r∗0 .\nProof: Arguing as in the proof to thm. (14), there exists r∗0 such that P (D̂ r∗0 [n,ρ]) = 1/2. Arguing similarly to cor. (12), P (D̂r[n,ρ]) is continuous in r. Therefore, P (D̂ r [n,ρ]) ≤ 1 − P (D̂r[n,ρ]) for r ≤ r ∗ 0 and P (D̂ r [n,ρ]) ≥ 1 − P (D̂ r [n,ρ]) for r ≥ r∗0 . Thus, the result of lemma (40) takes the form\nd\ndr P (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≥ c ∗(λ)P (D̂r[n,ρ]) logM\nfor r ≤ r∗0 and\nd\ndr P (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≥ c ∗(λ)(1 − P (D̂r[n,ρ])) logM\nfor r ≥ r∗0 . The last two inequalities can be written\nd\ndr logP (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≥ c ∗(λ) logM\nfor r ≤ r∗0 and\nd\ndr log (1− P (D̂r[n,ρ])) ≤ −c ∗(λ) logM\nfor r ≥ r∗0 , respectively. Consider r ≤ r ∗ 0 . Both sides of\nd\ndr logP (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≥ c ∗(λ) logM\nare integrated in the direction of increasing point density since P (D̂r[n,ρ]) decreases as a function of point density λ by the proof to lemma (40). It was also shown that dr/dλ < 0, i.e. r is decreasing as a function of point density. Therefore, the integration limits for the interval [r, r∗0 ] are from r ∗ 0 to r. Noting that the inequality is reversed for backward integration, the following is obtained for c > 0 and some K1(λ) ≥ 0,\nlogP (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≤ K1(λ) logM c(r−r∗0)\nwhich can be rewritten as\nlogP (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≤ K1(λ) logM −c(r∗0−r).\nThis implies\nP (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≤ K2(λ)M −c(r∗0−r)\nfor some K2(λ) ≥ 0. Therefore, using the initial condition P (D̂\nr∗0 [n,ρ]) = 1/2 yields K2(λ) = 1/2. Thus,\nP (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≤ 1\n2 M−c(r\n∗ 0−r).\nNow, consider r ≥ r∗0 . Similary, both sides of\nd\ndr log (1− P (D̂r[n,ρ])) ≤ −c ∗(λ) logM\nare integrated in the direction of increasing connection radii on [r∗0 , r] since P (D̂ r [n,ρ]) increases as a function of connection radii r by the proof to lemma (40). Therefore, the integration limits are from r∗0 to r. The following is obtained for c > 0 and some K3(λ) ≥ 0,\nlog (1− P (D̂r[n,ρ])) ≤ −K3(λ) logM c(r−r∗0)\nwhich can be rewritten as\nlog (1− P (D̂r[n,ρ])) ≤ −K3(λ) logM −c(r∗0−r)\n= K3(λ) logM −c(r−r∗0).\nThis implies\n1− P (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≤ K4(λ)M −c(r−r∗0)\nfor some K4(λ) ≥ 0. Therefore, using the initial condition P (D̂\nr∗0 [n,ρ]) = 1/2 yields K4(λ) = 1/2. Hence,\nP (D̂r[n,ρ]) ≥ 1− 1\n2 M−c(r−r\n∗ 0).\nBy prop. (36), there are cases when Dr[n,ρ] ⊂ D̂ r [n,ρ], but\nDr[n,ρ] 6= D̂ r [n,ρ] so that the occurrence of D̂ r [n,ρ] does not imply the occurrence of Dr[n,ρ]. To exclude these possibilities, the arguments of [13] are followed whereby a slightly larger property Dr[n,ρ−δ] is considered for some small δ > 0 such that the occurrence of D̂r[n,ρ] implies the occurrence of D r [n,ρ−δ].\nAs in [13], let φ(M) be any M -dependent integer such that φ(M) → ∞ as M → ∞ and\nφ(M) = o(c(r − r∗0) logM).\nChoose a coordinate system so that B has its lower left corner at the origin.

The rest of the proof follows [13] with the edge probability as a function of point density p(λ0) replaced by r∗(n, ρ, ǫ) and the critical probability for the occurrence of an infinite cluster of occupied hexagons pc replaced by r∗0 .\nProof: (Theorem 35) By prop.

Following [13], the occurrence of F implies that there is a connected path of hexagons which encloses the sub-lattice given by HB(r) − ⋃4 i=1 Hi. Because the points in Xn are uniformly distributed, then there is a connected cluster of hexagons within the original lattice totaling at least ρM2 − (2Mφ(M) + 2φ(M)(M − 2φ(M))) hexagons, where ρM2 is a lower bound on the number of occupied hexagons in the largest connected cluster and 2Mφ(M) + 2φ(M)(M − 2φ(M)) is the total number of hexagons in the strips, Hi, i = 1, 2, 3, 4. Let δ1 = (2Mφ(M)+ 2φ(M)(M − 2φ(M)))/M2. It follows that F ⊂ Dr[n,ρ−δ1], since F occurs in those hexagons of B that are not near the boundary of B by a simple translation τ of hexagons h ∈\n⋃4 i=1 Hi to hexagons h ∈ HB(r)− ⋃4 i=1 Hi. Thus, if M is large enough so that δ1 < δ, then F ⊂ Dr[n,ρ−δ1] ⊂ D r [n,ρ−δ].\nProof: (Theorem 33) Consider r ≤ r∗0 . Since\nP (AHr[n,ρ+δ]) = P (A Hr [n,ρ+δ],D r [n,ρ]) + P (A Hr [n,ρ+δ] −D r [n,ρ])\nthen\nP (AHr[n,ρ+δ]) ≤ P (D r [n,ρ]) + P (A Hr [n,ρ+δ] −D r [n,ρ]).\nIt will be shown that P (AHr[n,ρ+δ] − D r [n,ρ]) = o(M −c(r∗0−r)). Let x be a configuration of states across hexagons in HB(r) and let C(x) = {C1, ..., CK} be the set of clusters in x. For i = 1, ...,K , let NCi be the number of points in the cluster, Ci. Then, {NCi | C(x), n} ∼ B(n, |HCi |\nM2 ). Suppose Ci0 ∈ C(x) is any cluster such that ρn(Ci0 ) ≥ ρ + δ. Since the occurrence of the property (\nDr[n,ρ]\n)c\nimplies |HCi0 |\nM2 < ρ, then\nAHr[n,ρ+δ] −D r [n,ρ] ⊂\n{\nρn(Ci0 ) ≥ ρ+ δ, |HCi0 |\nM2 < ρ\n}\n.\nBy arguments in [23] and [13], there is an α = α(ρ, δ) > 0 such that\nP\n(\nρn(Ci0 ) ≥ ρ+ δ\n∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ { |HCi0 |\nM2 < ρ\n}\n, C(x), n\n)\n≤ e−α(ρ,δ)n.\nIt follows that P (AHr[n,ρ+δ] − D r [n,ρ]) ≤ P ( {ρn(Ci0 ) ≥ ρ+ δ}, { |HCi0 | M2 < ρ }) ≤ P ( ρn(Ci0 ) ≥ ρ+ δ ∣ ∣ ∣ |HCi0 | M2 < ρ ) × P ( |HCi0 | M2 < ρ ) ≤ P ( ρn(Ci0 ) ≥ ρ+ δ ∣ ∣ ∣ |HCi0 | M2 < ρ ) = E [ P ( ρn(Ci0 ) ≥ ρ+ δ ∣ ∣ ∣ { |HCi0 | M2 < ρ } , C(x), n )] ≤ E[e−αn] = exp {−n(1− e−α)}.\nNow, since n(1 − e−α) > d logM implies exp {−n(1− e−α)} < M−d, then for any d > 0 and every fixed δ > 0, it follows that P (AHr[n,ρ+δ] −D r [n,ρ]) decays to zero at a rate faster than M−d for n large enough. The case of r ≥ r∗0 is proven with similar arguments.\nTheorem 44: P (AHr[n,ρ]) is a continuous function of ρ.\nProof: Let σ = 1− ρ in eq. (13). Then, AHr[n,σ] is an increasing property in σ for increasing ρ ∈ (12 , 1). Therefore, by [33, Thm. (2.48)], it is true that AHr[n,σ] has a sharp threshold in σ, and hence, in ρ. Thus, by [33, Ineq. (2.49)], P (AHr[n,ρ]) is differentiable in ρ, which implies that P (AHr[n,ρ]) is continuous as a function of ρ.\nRemark 45: By thm. (44), for small δ > 0,\nP (AHr[n,ρ−δ]) ≈ P (A Hr [n,ρ]) ≈ P (A Hr [n,ρ+δ]).\nIn this light, thm. (33) asserts that if r∗1 < r ∗ 0 < r ∗ 2 and for some ǫ ∈ (0, 12 ), it is true that P (A Hr∗ 1 [n,ρ]) = ǫ and P (A Hr∗ 2\n[n,ρ]) = 1−ǫ, then r∗2−r ∗ 1 is an estimate of the sharp threshold interval length for the property, AHr[n,ρ].\nProof: (Theorem 20) Since P (Ar[n,ρ]) and P (A Hr [n,ρ]) are continuous functions of r, then by thm. (33) and lemma (31), for every r ∈ [0, r0] there exists r′ ≤ r such that\nP (Ar ′ [n,ρ+δ]) ≤ P (A Hr [n,ρ+δ]) (32)\n≤ ( 1\n2 + ǫ1)M\n−c(r∗0−r)\n≤ ( 1\n2 + ǫ1)M\n−c(r0−r). (33)\nConsider r0 ∈ [0, r0]. Then, continuity of P (Ar[n,ρ]) in r and the non-decreasing property of P (Ar[n,ρ]) in r implies ineq. (33) for all r ∈ [0, r′]. It is claimed that r′ = r0. Seeking a contradiction if r′ < r0, suppose P (Ar[n,ρ]) ≤ (12 + ǫ1)M\n−c(r0−r) for all r ∈ [0, r′] and P (Ar[n,ρ]) > (12 + ǫ1)M −c(r0−r) for all r > r′. By hypothesis, r0 > r′ so that when r = r0, it follows that P (A r0 [n,ρ+δ]) > 1/2. Now, since for any connected cluster < C >r such that ρn(C) ≥ ρ+δ for δ > 0, the statement ρn(C) ≥ ρ is implied, then Ar[n,ρ+δ] ⊆ A r [n,ρ] for all r ∈ [0, r0]. Hence, r\n′ < r0 leads to\nP (Ar0[n,ρ]) ≥ lim sup δ→0+ P (Ar0[n,ρ+δ]) ≥ P (A r0 [n,ρ+δ]) >\n1 2 . (34)\nIn particular, ineq. (34) gives P (Ar0[n,ρ]) > 1/2. This is a contradiction since P (Ar0[n,ρ]) = 1/2 by thm. (14). It follows\nthat r′ = r0 and\nP (Ar[n,ρ]) ≤ ( 1\n2 + ǫ1)M\n−c(r0−r)\nfor r ≤ r0. A similar argument is used to prove\nP (Ar[n,ρ−δ]) ≥ 1− ( 1\n2 + ǫ1)M\n−c(r−r0)\nfor r ≥ r0.\nThe implication of the proof to thm. (20) is that P (Ar[n,ρ]) = P (A Hr [n,ρ]) for r ∈ [0, r0]. By [33, Thm. (1.16)], the random cluster measure gives rise to a collection of conditional probability measures of connection events in the identified classes during K-means classification. Therefore, the node process X samples from each element of the collection.\nTheorem 46: P (Ar[n,ρ]) = P (A Hr [n,ρ]) for r ∈ [0, r0].\nProof: By continuity in ρ of P (AHr[n,ρ]) as given by thm. (44), it is true that\nlim δ→0+\nP (AHr[n,ρ+δ]) = P (A Hr [n,ρ]).\nSuppose δ1 > δ2 such that ρ + δ1, ρ + δ2 ∈ (12 , 1) and let < C >r ∈ Ar[n,ρ+δ1]. Then, ρn(C) ≥ ρ + δ1 > ρ + δ2 so that < C >r ∈ Ar[n,ρ+δ2]. Hence, A r [n,ρ+δ1]\n⊆ Ar[n,ρ+δ2]. By properties of probability measures, P (Ar[n,ρ]) is monotone non-decreasing as a function of decreasing ρ. By ineq. (32), it follows that for some fixed r ∈ [0, r0], there exists r′ ∈ [0, r0] such that P (Ar ′\n[n,ρ+δ]) ≤ P (A Hr [n,ρ+δ]) for all r ′′ ∈ [0, r′] so that\nlim sup δ→0+\nP (Ar ′′\n[n,ρ+δ]) ≤ lim sup δ→0+\nP (AHr[n,ρ+δ]) = P (A Hr [n,ρ]). (35)\nFrom the proof of thm. (20), it was shown that r′ = r0. Therefore, by continuity of P (AHr[n,ρ]) in r, ineq. (35) holds for all r ∈ [0, r0], with r′′ replaced by r. The Monotone Convergence Theorem [67] applied to E[1Ar\n[n,ρ+δ] ] and E[1Ar [n,ρ] ] guarantees\nthat P (Ar[n,ρ+δ]) → P (A r [n,ρ]) as δ → 0 +. Therefore, ineq. (35) becomes\nP (Ar[n,ρ]) = lim sup δ→0+ P (Ar[n,ρ+δ]) ≤ P (A Hr [n,ρ]). (36)\nIn particular, P (Ar[n,ρ]) ≤ P (A Hr [n,ρ]) so that with the result of lemma (30), namely P (AHr[n,ρ]) ≤ P (A r [n,ρ]), the theorem follows.\nCorollary 47: P (Ar) = P (AHr ) for r ∈ [0, r0].\nProof: By thm. (46), it is true that P (Ar[n,ρ]) = P (A Hr [n,ρ]) for all r ∈ [0, r0] and all n ≥ 1. By prop. (77), it follows that P (AHr ) ≤ P (AHr[n,ρ]) = P (A r [n,ρ]). In particular, P (A\nHr ) ≤ P (Ar[n,ρ]). Without loss of generality, assume that area(B) = 1. From [13], differentiability of P (Ar[n,ρ]) in point density λ = λ(n) = E[n] implies continuity of P (Ar[n,ρ]) in λ so that the following holds\nlim E[n]→∞\nP (Ar[n,ρ]) = P (A r). (37)\nTherefore, P (AHr ) ≤ P (Ar[n,ρ]) and eq. (37) implies P (AHr ) ≤ P (Ar). Similarly, P (Ar) ≤ P (AHr ) so that the corollary follows.\nCorollary 48: r0 = r∗0 .\nProof: By thm. (46), it is true that 1/2 = P (Ar0[n,ρ]) =\nP (A Hr0 [n,ρ]). In particular, 1/2 = P (A Hr0 [n,ρ]). Since P (A Hr∗0 [n,ρ]) = 1/2 = P (A Hr0 [n,ρ]), by the discussion preceding thm. (32) and by thm. (14), then the uniqueness of r∗0 and r0 guarantees that r∗0 = r0.\nProof: (Theorem 21) Follows directly from thms. (44) and (46).\nBy thm. (46) and cor. (48), the problem of estimating the probabilities and length of the sharp threshold interval in the continuum can be re-cast as problems of estimation in the presence of a hexagonal partition of the bounded region. As such, tools from percolation [32] and the random cluster model [33] can readily be employed. This fact will be of paramount importance in applications to K-means classification where a data set consisting of multi-dimensional points is partitioned into disjoint, connected subsets. As it is advantageous to not have one connected cluster containing at least 100ρ% of all points, since otherwise there may exist a single cluster containing almost all points by lemma (72), the connection radius for points in the continuum must be in the sub-critical range r ∈ [0, r0] when classifying data into more than 2 classes. Since P (Ar[n,ρ]) = P (A Hr [n,ρ]) for r ∈ [0, r0], disjoint clusters of points in the continuum are equivalent to disjoint clusters of occupied hexagons in the hexagonal partition of the bounded region containing all points. As such, multidimensional points in the continuum can be thought to belong to the same class if they are within a certain Euclidean distance of one another. As a result, the multi-dimensional points will have representatives belonging to occupied, connected hexagons in the 2-dimensional, bounded, partitioned region. All representatives in connected clusters of hexagons form the members of a class."

      "text" : "For ease of computation, and at the risk of ambiguity, suppose n = M2. The idea is to partition B into M2 hexagons and find K = N2 contiguous clusters of hexagons such that each of the clusters are mutually disjoint. Into one and only one hexagon of a given cluster will each data point be mapped to form a point in the connected cluster. As such, the connected clusters of hexagons will be the K = N2 classes containing a representative point associated to one and only one data point.\nTheorem 49: Assume that there are M2 points and N2 classifications for the points. The minimum number of hexagons required to partition the unit square into N2 disjoint regions such that M2 is the sum total of all hexagons in the disjoint regions is given by\nS(M,N) = M2 + 2M(N − 1)2.\nProof: Since M2 >> N2 by hypothesis, then the total number of hexagons required to partition B into disjoint regions of contiguous hexagons is O(M2). Label the disjoint regions A1, A2, ..., AN2 and let k be any integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ N2. Since the total number of hexagons partitioning B is O(M2), then the number of hexagons in Ak is proportional to\nM2. Likewise, the total number of hexagons in boundary(Ak) is proportional to area(Ak). Since area(Ak) is proportional to M2, then the number of hexagons in boundary(Ak) is proportional to M2. Note that each Ak shares a portion of its separating boundary with each of its neighboring clusters of hexagons. Let Aj be a neighboring cluster of Ak such that j 6= k and 1 ≤ j ≤ N2. Since this portion of the separating boundary is proportional to both area(Ak) and area(Aj), then it is proportional to a common area of size area(Akj). Repeating this same logic for all integers k and j such that 1 ≤ k ≤ N2 and 1 ≤ j ≤ N2, the total number of hexagons in the entire separating boundaries is proportional to a common area of size area(A). Since minimizing the total number of hexagons in B is tantamount to minimizing the area(A), then making an application of the law of large numbers, each of the N2 disjoint clusters of connected hexagons is the same size and must be a square sub-region of B containing M2/N2 hexagons. The minimum number of hexagons that are required to enclose N2 sub-regions of B containing M2/N2 hexagons is exactly 2M(N − 1)2. Therefore, the minimum number of hexagons required to partition B into N2 disjoint regions such that M2 is the sum total of all hexagons in the disjoint regions is given by\nS(M,N) = M2 + 2M(N − 1)2. (38)\nThe idea is to use the result of the theorem to calculate, as a function of M and N = N(M), the exact size of a prototypical hexagon which will be used to partition B into hexagons of equal size. As K = N2 is fixed as the number of classes of data points, M2 is fixed for the initial calculation of S(M,N) and the subsequent classification of the first M2 data points. In [32], it is stated and proven that there is a critical probability of connection between hexagons containing a point of a network such that it is no longer possible to have disjoint clusters of points when this critical probability of connection is exceeded. Hence, all points will be connected into one cluster, which is not what we intend to model, in this case. Since the size of B is fixed, then to decrease the probability of connection while maintaining K = N2 disjoint contiguous clusters of points, the size of each hexagon must decrease while increasing the number of hexagons in the boundaries of the disjoint regions. In this way, the ratio of the total number of occupied hexagons to the total number of hexagons will be less than this critical probability of connection. Note that we used uniformity of the points throughout B so that the approximate number of points in a cluster of hexagons is proportional to the ratio of the number of hexagons in the cluster divided by the number of hexagons in the entire region, B. Also, note that the minimum number of hexagons required for separation is given by thm. (49), so that the common radius of the circle that can circumscribe any one of these hexagons is of size\nR(M,N) = 1\n2 √ S(M,N) , (39)\nthereby necessarily indicating that\nB(M,N) = 2 ∗R(M,N)\nis the diameter of the circumscribing circle. R(M,N) is decreasing for increasing M and N as a direct result of eqs. (38) and (39).\nLemma 50: R(M,N) is decreasing for increasing M and N .\nProof: By eq. (38), S(M,N) is increasing for increasing M and N . Consequently, by eq. (39), R(M,N) is decreasing for increasing M and N .\nTheorem 51: Suppose that the node process X generates infinitely many points in R2. An infinite connected cluster exists across hexagons in R2 with probability 1 if and only if the probability that any two points connect exceeds pc, where pc is the critical probability of connection. Otherwise, all connected clusters are disjoint with probability 1.\nTheorem (51) is a restatement of [33, Thm. (1.11)]. A direct result of thm. (51) is that, given any bounded region B, all points generated within B are almost surely connected into one cluster. Therefore, in order to not exceed the critical probability of connection, which means maintaining the N2 classes of M2 data points, the radial length of each hexagon’s circumscribing circle must be less than or equal to R(M,N). By [32, Thm. (1.11)], the clusters will be disjoint with probability 1. Hence, the following corollary to thm. (49) follows from these statements and lemma (53).\nCorollary 52: Let hr be a hexagon of size such that it can be inscribed into a circle of radius r = r(M,N) > 0 where\n0 < r ≤ R(M,N).\nIf B is partitioned into copies of hr, then with probability 1, N2 is the mean number of disjoint clusters of contiguous hexagons in the region B that are occupied by the M2 points.\nWith r0 given by cor. (52), the size of the prototypical hexagon can be calculated for repartitioning B. Furthermore, cor. (52) guarantees that the classes will remain distinct, with probability 1, through each new classification. By cor. (52), the expected value of the number of classes to form can be calculated.\nLemma 53: For M2 uniformly distributed data points in B and for any ρ ∈ (0, pc], with pc = 1− 2 sin (π/18),\nM2\nS(M,N) =\nM2\nM2 + 2M(N − 1)2 = ρ (40)\ndetermines the expected number K = N2 of disjoint classes to form such that M2 is the total of all occupied hexagons across all classes.\nProof: At the risk of ambiguity, let N2 denote both the random variable and the expectation of the random variable which takes the number of formed classes as its value. Because B is partitioned by hexagons, it is shown in [33, Chapter 3] that pc = 1−2 sin (π/18). By uniformity, the mean number of data points in each class is M2/N2. By thm. (51), each class will be disjoint and each hexagon in B will be as large as possible if B is partitioned into S(M,N) hexagons of equal size. Also, by thm. (51), the probability of any of the M2 hexagons being populated with a data point has to be less than or equal to pc in order that the expected classes form with probability 1, resulting in eq. (40). For any ρ ∈ (0, pc], K = N2 is found by solving eq. (40) to obtain K = N2 as the least integer which is not less than the integer part of a non-negative solution to eq. (40), for fixed, positive M2.\nLemma 54: For fixed ρ ∈ (12 , 1) and r > 0 there exists δ = δ(ρ) ∈ (0, 12 ), such that\n{\n| < C >Hr |\nS(M,N) <\n1\n2\n}\n= (\nAHr[S(M,N),ρ−δ]\n)c\nupto sets of P -measure zero.\nProof: By definition, (\nAHr[S(M,N),ρ−δ]\n)c\n= {\n|<C>Hr | S(M,N) < ρ− δ\n}\n. Take δ = ρ− 12 .\nBy choosing δ as in lemma (54), continuity in r > 0\nand the non-decreasing property of P (\nAHr[S(M,N),ρ−δ]\n)\nfor\nincreasing r > 0 granted by cor. (12) and prop. (76), respectively, then by ineq. (10), it follows that\nR(M,N) < r∗0 = r ∗ 0(M,N)\nfor the property (\nAHr[S(M,N),ρ−δ]\n)c\n, since\nP (( A HR(M,N) [S(M,N),ρ−δ]\n)c)\n= 1\n> 1\n2\n= P\n(\n(\nA Hr∗0 [S(M,N),ρ−δ]\n)c )\nand the probability of (\nAHr[S(M,N),ρ−δ]\n)c\nis non-decreasing for decreasing r ≤ r∗0 , a reversal.\nLet ǫ ∈ (0, 12 ) be given and let r ∗ 1 > 0 and r ∗ 2 > 0, guaran-\nteed by cor.

(12), it follows that\nR(M,N) < r∗1 < r ∗ 0 = r ∗ 0(M,N) < r ∗ 2 .\nBy symmetry, it follows that\nR(M,N) < r∗1 < r ∗ 0 = r ∗ 0(M,N) < r ∗ 2 < 2r ∗ 0 − R(M,N). (41)\nNote that by cor. (52) and by symmetry,\nP ((\nAHr[S(M,N),ρ−δ]\n)c)\n= 0\nwhen r ≥ 2r∗0 − R(M,N). Therefore, if ( AHr[S(M,N),ρ−δ]\n)c\noccurs with probability 0, then the property { M2\nS(M,N) < 1 2\n}\noccurs with probability 0. Otherwise, (\nAHr[S(M,N),ρ−δ]\n)c\nwould\noccur with positive probability, since { M2\nS(M,N) < 1 2\n}\n⊆ {\n|<C>Hr | S(M,N) < 1 2\n} = (\nAHr[S(M,N),ρ−δ]\n)c\n, upto sets of P -\nmeasure zero, by lemma (54). Hence, { M2\nS(M,N) ≥ 1 2\n}\noccurs with probability 1. As a result,\nM2\nM2 + 2M(N − 1)2 ≥\n1 2 (42)\nwith probability 1. Therefore, with probability 1 for M , it follows that N is a solution to M2+2M(N−1)2−2M2 = 0.\nLemma 55: If r ≥ 1/(2N), then\nP ((\nAHr[S(M,N),ρ−δ]\n)c)\n= 0.\nProof: Without loss of generality, suppose area(B) = 1 and further suppose that B is divided into squares with sides of length 2r = 1/N . By hypothesis, B contains M2 data points and it is to be divided into N2 regions. Clearly then, there are no boundary hexagons separating each of the N2 regions since the sides of B have length 2rN = 1 which gives B an area of 1. Let each square be inscribed by a circle of radius r, which itself is inscribed by a hexagon. By hypothesis, each of the N2 regions in B contains at least one of the M2 data points. Hence, each of the N2 (occupied) regions is connected in a cluster to every other region in B so that P (\nAHr[S(M,N),ρ−δ]\n) = 1. Since P (\nAHr[S(M,N),ρ−δ]\n)\n= 1 for\nr = 1/(2N), then P (\nAHr[S(M,N),ρ−δ]\n)\n= 1 for r ≥ 1/(2N)\nby prop. (76).\nAs a result of lemma (55) and by using ineq. (41), a conservative estimate for r∗0 is given by a solution to\n2r∗0 −R(M,N) ≥ 1\n2N (43)\nthat maximizes 1/(2N) as a function of M . The value of N satisfies ineq. (42) and a maximal solution is found when equality holds. As such, for ǫ ∈ (0, 12 ), since (r ∗ 1 , r ∗ 2) ⊂ ( R(M,N), 2r∗0 −R(M,N) ), then by ineq. (43),\nr∗2 − r ∗ 1 ≈ 2r ∗ 0 − 2R(M,N)\n= 1\n2N −R(M,N) (44)\nis an estimate of the length of the sharp threshold interval r∗2 − r ∗ 1 about r ∗ 0 .\nUsing the value of r∗0 given by eq. (43) and by using the estimate for the length of the sharp threshold interval about r∗0 given by eq. (44), an estimate for the value of r ∗ 1 can be obtained. Thus, when r ≤ r∗1 , the property ( AHr[S(M,N),ρ−δ] )c occurs with probability at least 1 − ǫ and falls sharply to a probability of occurrence of ǫ as r → r∗2 .\nBy cor. (48) and thm. (46), the left half of the sharp threshold interval about r0 is given by [r∗1 , r0]. Using lemma (30), there exists r2 ≤ r∗2 such that [r0, r2] is the right half of the sharp threshold interval for ǫ > 0 given. Thus, when r ≤ r∗1 , the property ( Ar[S(M,N),ρ−δ] )c\noccurs with probability at least 1 − ǫ and falls sharply to a probability of occurrence of (no greater than) ǫ as r → r∗2 . As such, the sharp threshold interval for classifying M2 data points into N2 classes, in the mean continuum case, is of length (no greater than) r∗2 − r ∗ 1 .\nTheorem 56: Let ∆∗(M,N) denote the sharp threshold interval length for the event of classifying M2 random data points into N2 classes. Then,\n∆∗(M,N) = O(N−1).\nProof: Follows directly from eq. (44), eq. (39) and thm. (49)."

As such, once the actual number of classes to form, N20 , is known, then given M2 << T 2, for classifications of the ordered data set, it follows that R(M,N0) constitutes the actual upper bound on the distance that any class member is allowed to differ from the center of its respective class. As such, any anomalies, which by definition lie outside of any regularized class, will be at a distance greater than R(M,N0) from the regression hyperplane formed from the union of the regularized classes. This distance is measured as the length of the projection of an anomaly onto the normal vector of the regression hyperplane. By normality, the center of the union of regularized classes is the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the union, which defines the best linear estimate, given the data. Thus, the regression hyperplane necessarily passes through the center of the union formed after the K-means clustering process.\nSince the initial classification of the ordered set was done with R(M,N) as the upper bound, then class members are candidate anomalies when they fall outside the new upper bound R(M,N0) in distance from the regression hyperplane. Furthermore, the same restriction is applied to the class centers, whereby, given that the regression hyperplane is the linear average of the data points used in its definition, then anomalous classes, those sparsely populated clusters of points which lie outside of the union of the regularized classes, are those with centers that deviate from the regression hyperplane by more than a distance of R(M,N0)."

Seeking a contradiction, suppose X(h)[M,N0] = ∅. Then, for every x ∈ Ch, it is true that d(x,Hθ[M,N0]) < R(M,N0). Therefore, the contradiction is obtained and the theorem is proven, if it can be shown that there exists x ∈ Ch such that d(x(h), Hθ[M,N0]) ≤ d(x,Hθ[M,N0]), which implies d(x(h), H θ [M,N0]\n) < R(M,N0), the sought contradiction to class Ch being anomalous. Thus, if |Ch| = 1, then x(h) = x ∈ Ch. Otherwise, suppose that |Ch| > 1 and assume that d(x(h), Hθ[M,N0]) > d(x,H θ [M,N0] ) for all x ∈ Ch.

The idea is to shift Hθ[M,N0] by a certain length along the vector normal to H θ [M,N0] which passes through x(h).

      "text" : "It was shown that by mapping (possibly) higher dimensional data into a partitioned 2-dimensional space, a critical radius of connectivity could be found such that when radii are less than the critical value, then clusters of data points form. Furthermore, with the critical value defined as a function of the number of data points and the expected number of classes to form, the union of sets of regularized data points could be linearly segregated away from all other data points and that the normal vector to the shifted linear hyperplane defines weights of a 2-class discriminating neural network, which determines the support vectors of the formed binary classes. As such, the process of separating regularized data from all other (anomalous) data amounts to finding a critical radius, which is estimated in section (IV ). After formation of the regularized classes by using the critical radius as the upper bound on the distance measure, we are able to formulate three estimates of the distribution of the regularized data.\nThe regression hyperplane of the union amounts to a global, stationary estimate of the non-stationary mixture. Furthermore, by formulating a regression hyperplane for each individual class of the mixture distribution, we can estimate the nonstationary distribution of the union as a sequence of piecewise linear (stationary) estimates, one for each class. Lastly, a piecewise, non-linear (non-stationary) estimate of the mixture is determined by the mode of each class.\nFinally, by finding the x ∈ X[M,N0] which provides the necessary shift for some γ ∈ (0, 1), the task of segregating the union of regularized classes from the set of anomalies is completed, without the need of numerical techniques for estimation of a synaptic weight vector, since the original regression hyperplane Hθ[M,N0] is an analytic least squares solution, as determined by the union of the regularized classes. As the neural network detects the complete set of support vectors providing for a maximal-distance region between the union of regularized classes and the set of anomalies, no techniques such as Lagrange multipliers are required in order to determine the set of support vectors.\nAPPENDIX"

Since ρn(C) ≥ ρ > 1/2, then all other connected components are of order strictly less than half of all points. Therefore, |Ar[n,ρ]| = 1.\nProposition 73: Ar[n,ρ] is an increasing property in r.\nProof: Suppose < C >r ∈ Ar[n,ρ] and fix arbitrary r ′ > r. Then, d(x, y) ≤ r < r′ for all x, y ∈ < C >r. Thus, < C >r ⊆ < C >r′ implies N = | < C >r | ≤ | < C >r′ |. Hence, < C >r ∈ Ar[n,ρ] implies < C >r′ ∈ A r [n,ρ]. Since r\n′ > r is arbitrary, then Ar[n,ρ] is an increasing property in r.\nProposition 74: Ar[n,ρ] is a decreasing property in n.\nProof: Suppose < C >r ∈ Ar[n,ρ]. If n ′ < n, then | < C >r |/n′ > | < C >r |/n ≥ ρ so that < C >r∈ Ar[n′,ρ]. Hence, Ar[n,ρ] ⊆ A r [n′,ρ]. Since n\n′ < n, then Ar[n,ρ] is decreasing in n."

Then, S mutually determines an element ωS ∈ Ω = {−1, 1}Xn so that S is P -measureable.

Since P (Ar[n,ρ]) is non-decreasing in r by prop. (76), then P (Ar1[n,ρ]) ≥ P (A r2 [n,ρ]) ≥ ǫ2 ≥ ǫ1. Hence, r2 ∈ {r > 0 : P (Ar[n,ρ]) ≥ ǫ1} and r2 < r1 = inf{r > 0 : P (A r [n,ρ]) ≥ ǫ1}. Contradiction. Thus, r1 ≤ r2 so that r(n, ρ, ǫ) is nondecreasing in ǫ.\nLemma 79: If R = 2 ∗ max{d(x, y) : x, y ∈ Xn}, then Xn = {x ∈ Xn : d(x, y) ≤ R} for all fixed y ∈ Xn.\nProof: Clearly, {x ∈ Xn : d(x, y) ≤ R} ⊆ Xn. Conversely, fix any y ∈ Xn. For every x ∈ Xn, it is true that d(x, y) ≤ 2 ∗ max{d(x, y) : x, y ∈ Xn} = R. Hence, Xn ⊆ {x ∈ Xn : d(x, y) ≤ R} for all fixed y ∈ Xn. Thus, Xn = {x ∈ Xn : d(x, y) ≤ R} for all fixed y ∈ Xn.\nCorollary 80: If R = 2 ∗max{d(x, y) : x, y ∈ Xn}, then < Cy >R ∈ AR[n,ρ] for all y ∈ Xn and n ≥ 1.\nProof: Fix an arbitrary y ∈ Xn. By lemma (79), if < Cy >R = {x ∈ Xn : d(x, y) ≤ R}, then < Cy >R = Xn so that | < Cy >R | = |Xn| = n. Therefore, since y ∈ Xn is arbitrary, then < Cy >R ∈ AR[n,ρ] for all y ∈ Xn and n ≥ 1.\nCorollary 81: If R = 2 ∗max{d(x, y) : x, y ∈ Xn}, then P (AR[n,ρ]) = 1 for all n ≥ 1.\nProof: By lemma (79) and cor. (80), it is true that Xn ∈ AR[n,ρ] for all n ≥ 1 and ρ ∈ ( 1 2 , 1). Thus, A R [n,ρ] 6= ∅ for all n ≥ 1 and ρ ∈ (12 , 1). Hence, P (A R [n,ρ]) = 1 for all n ≥ 1.\nLemma 82: If R = 2 ∗ max{d(x, y) : x, y ∈ Xn}, then 0 < r(n, ρ, ǫ) ≤ R for all ǫ ∈ (0, 12 ).\nProof: By lemma (79), it is true that Xn = {x ∈ Xn : d(x, y) ≤ R} for all fixed y ∈ Xn. Therefore, P (AR[n,ρ]) = 1 ≥ ǫ for all ǫ ∈ (0, 12 ). Suppose that ǫ0 ∈ (0, 1 2 ) exists such that r0 = r(n, ρ, ǫ0) > R. Thus, AR[n,ρ] ⊆ A r0 [n,ρ] so that\n1 = P (AR[n,ρ]) ≤ P (A r0 [n,ρ])\nsince P (Ar[n,ρ]) is non-increasing in n by prop. (80), nondecreasing in r by prop.

Therefore, 0 < r(n, ρ, ǫ) ≤ R for all ǫ ∈ (0, 12 ).\nProposition 83: Suppose {ǫk ∈ (0, 12 )}k≥1 is any convergent sequence such that ǫk → ǫ0. Define rk = r(n, ρ, ǫk) and r0 = r(n, ρ, ǫ0). For arbitrary ξ > 0, if {k ≥ 1 : |P (Ark[n,ρ]) − P (A r0 [n,ρ])| ≥ ξ} is a set of measure zero, then rk → r0 as k → ∞.\nProof: If ξ > 0 is arbitrary and {k ≥ 1 : |P (Ark[n,ρ]) − P (Ar0[n,ρ])| ≥ ξ} is a set of measure zero, then\nP (Ark[n,ρ]) = P (A r0 [n,ρ]) ≥ ǫ0\nfor all k ≥ 1. Hence, rk ∈ {r > 0 : P (Ar[n,ρ]) ≥ ǫ0} for all k ≥ 1.

    "abstractText" : "We use random geometric graphs to describe clusters of higher dimensional data points which are bijectively mapped to a (possibly) lower dimensional space where an equivalent random cluster model is used to calculate the expected number of modes to be found when separating the data of a multimodal data set into distinct clusters. Furthermore, as a function of the expected number of modes and the number of data points in the sample, an upper bound on a given distance measure is found such that data points have the greatest correlation if their mutual distances from a common center is less than or equal to the calculated bound. Anomalies are exposed, which lie outside of the union of all regularized clusters of data points. Similar to finding a hyperplane which can be shifted along its normal to expose the maximal distance between binary classes, it is shown that the union of regularized clusters can be used to define a hyperplane which can be shifted by a certain amount to separate the data into binary classes and that the shifted hyperplane defines the activation function for a two-class discriminating neural network. Lastly, this neural network is used to detect the set of support vectors which determines the maximally-separating region between the binary classes.",
