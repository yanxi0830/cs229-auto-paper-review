      "heading" : "1. Introduction",
      "text" : "Pattern learning is the crux of many natural language processing (NLP) problems. It is usually solved as grammar induction for these problems. For parsing, we learn a statistical grammar with respect to certain linguistic formalism, such as Context Free Grammar (CFG), Dependency Grammar (DG), Tree Substitution Grammar (TSG), Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG), and Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) etc. For machine translation (MT), we learn a bilingual grammar that transfer a string or tree structure in a source language into a corresponding string or tree structure in a target language.\nWhat is embarrassing is that many of the grammar induction algorithms that provide stateof-the-art performance are usually regarded as less principled in the aspect of statistical modeling. Johnson (2002); Prescher et al. (2004) showed the Bod (1992)’s data oriented parsing (DOP) algorithm is biased and inconsistent. In the MT field, almost all the statistical MT models proposed in recent years rely on similar heuristic methods to extract translation grammars, such as Koehn et al. (2003); Och and Ney (2004); Chiang (2005); Quirk et al. (2005); Galley et al. (2006); Shen et al. (2008); Carreras and Collins (2009), to name a few of them. Similar heuristic methods have also been used in many other pattern learning tasks, for example, like semantic parsing as in Zettlemoyer and Collins (2005) and chunking as in Daumé III and Marcu (2005) in an implicit way.\nIn all these heuristic algorithms, one needs to extract overlapping structures from training data in an exhaustive way. Therefore, in the article, we call them exhaustive pattern learning (EPL) methods. The use of EPL methods is intended to cope with the uncertainty of building blocks used in statistical models. As far as MT is concerned, Koehn et al. (2003) found that it was better to define a translation model on phrases than on words, but there was no obvious way to define what phrases\nwere. DeNero et al. (2006) observed that exhaustive pattern learning outperforms generative models with fixed building blocks.\nIn EPL algorithms, one needs to collect statistics of overlapping structures from training data, so that they are not valid generative models. Thus, the EPL algorithms for grammar induction were viewed as heuristic methods DeNero et al. (2006); Daumé III (2008). Recently, DeNero et al. (2008); Blunsom et al. (2009); Cohn and Blunsom (2009); Cohn et al. (2009); Post and Gildea (2009) investigated various sampling methods for grammar induction, which were believed to be more principled than EPL. However, there was no convincing empirical evidence showing that these new methods provided better performance on large-scale data sets.\nIn this article, we will show that there exists a mathematically sound explanation for the EPL approach. We will first introduce a likelihood function based on ensemble learning, which marginalizes all possible building block segmentations on the training data. Then, we will show that the probability given by an EPL grammar is constant-factor approximation of an ensemble method that integrates exponential number of models. Therefore, with an EPL grammar induction algorithm, we learn a model with much more diversity from the training data. This may explain why EPL methods provide state-of-the-art performance in many NLP pattern learning problems.\nThe rest of the article is organized as follows. We will first formalize EPL in Section 2. In Section 3, we introduce the ensemble method, and then show the approximation theorem and its corollaries. We discuss a few important problems in Section 4, and conclude our work in Section 5."

      "text" : "Monotonic translation is defined as follows. The input x ∈ X is a string of words x1x2...xi in the source language. The monotonic translation of x is y ∈ Y , a string of words, y1y2...yi, of the same length in the target language, where yj is the translation of xj , 1 ≤ j ≤ i.\nIn short, monotonic translation is a simplified version of machine translation. There is no word reordering, insertion or deletion. In this way, we ignore the impact of word level alignment, so as to focus our effort on the study of building blocks. We leave the incorporation of alignments for future work. In fact, we can simply view alignments as constraints on building blocks. Monotonic translation is already general enough to model many NLP tasks such as labelling and chunking."

      "text" : "Without losing generality, we assume that the training data D contains a single pair of word strings, xD and yD, which could be very long. Let xD = x1x2...xn, and yD = y1y2...yn. Source word xi is aligned to target word yi. Let the length of the word strings be |D| = n. Figure 1 shows a simple example of training data. Here |D| = 4.\nWe assume that there exists a hidden segmentation on the training data, which segments xD and yD into tokens. A token consists of a string of words, either on source or target, and it contains\nat least one word. As for monotonic translation, the source side and the target side share the same topology of segmentation. Tokens are the building blocks of the statistical model to be presented, which means that the parameters for the model are defined on tokens instead of words.\nA segmentation sD of D, or s for short, is represented as a vector of n − 1 Boolean values, s1s2...sn−1. si = 0 if and only if xi and xi+1 belong to the same token. s applies onto both the source and the target in the same way, which means xi and xi+1 belong to the same token if and only if yi and yi+1 belong to the same token.\nIf we segment D with s, we obtain a tokenized training set Ds. Ds contains a pair of token strings 〈us,vs〉. us = u1u2...u|Ds|, and vs = v1v2...v|Ds|, where |Ds| is the total number of tokens in us or vs. Figure 2 shows an example of segmentation on training data. Here, s2 = 0, so that we have a token pair that spans two words, (u2, v2) = (LEFT FOR, went to).\nGiven training data D and a segmentation s on D, there is a unique joint probabilistic model obtained by the MLE on Ds. Each parameter of this model contains a source token and target token. Since each token represents a string of words, we call this model a string-to-string grammar GDs. Specifically, for any pair of tokens (u, v), we have\nPr(u, v|GDs) = #s(u, v)\n|Ds| , (1)\nwhere #s(u, v) is the number of times that this token pair appears in the segmented data Ds. As for the example segmentation s in Figure 2, its MLE grammar is simply as follows.\nPr(SOPHIE, sophia |GDs) = 1/3\nPr(LEFT FOR, went to |GDs) = 1/3\nPr(PHILLY, philadelphia |GDs) = 1/3\nHowever, for any given training data, its segmentation is unknown to us. One way to cope with this problem is to consider all possible segmentations. String distribution on the training data will lead us to a good estimation of the hidden segmentation and tokens. In Section 3, we will introduce an ensemble method to incorporate MLE grammars obtained from all possible segmentations. Segmentations are generated with certain prior distribution."

      "text" : "Now we present an EPL solution. We follow the widely-used heuristic method to generate a grammar by applying various segmentations at the same time. We build a heuristic grammar GD,d out of the training data D by counting all possible token pairs (u, v) with at most d words on each side, where d ≪ |D| is a given parameter\nPr(u, v|GD,d) = #(u, v)\nZd ,\nwhere #(u, v) is the number of times that the string pair encoded in (u, v) appears in D,1 and\nZd = ∑\n(u′,v′)\n#(u′, v′) = ∑\ni=1...d\n(|D| − i+ 1) = (1− d− 1\n2|D| )d|D|.\nTherefore,\nPr(u, v|GD,d) = #(u, v)\n(1− d−12|D|)d|D| (2)\nFor example, the heuristic grammar for the training data in Figure 1 is as follows if we set d = 2.\nPr(SOPHIE, sophia |GD,2) = 1/7\nPr(LEFT, went |GD,2) = 1/7\nPr(FOR, to |GD,2) = 1/7\nPr(PHILLY, philadelphia |GD,2) = 1/7\nPr(SOPHIE LEFT, sophia went |GD,2) = 1/7\nPr(LEFT FOR, went to |GD,2) = 1/7\nPr(FOR PHILLY, to philadelphia |GD,2) = 1/7\nA desirable translation rule ‘LEFT FOR ⇒ went to’ is in this heuristic grammar, although its weight is diluted by noise. The hope is that, good translation rules will appear more often in the training data, so that they can be distinguished from noisy rules.\nIn the decoding phase, we use grammar GD,d as if it is a regular MLE grammar. Let x = x1x2...xi be an input source string. For any segmentation a on the test sentence x, let ua = u1u2...uk be the resultant string of source tokens. The length of the string is |x| = i, and the length of the token string is |ua| = k. The translation that we are looking for is given by the target token vector v̂, such that\n〈v̂, â〉 = argmax 〈v,a〉 Pr(ua,v|GD,d), where\nPr(ua,v|GD,d) = ∏\nj=1...|ua|\nPr(uj, vj |GD,d) (3)\n= ∏\nj=1...|ua|\nmj\n(1− d−12|D|)d|D|\n1. For the sake of convenience, in the rest of this article, we no longer distinguish a token and the string contained in this token unless necessary. We use symbols u and v to represent both. The meaning is clear in context.\nwhere mj = #(uj , vj). As in previous work of structure-based MT, we do not calculate the marginal probability that sums up all possible target tokens generating the same word string, due to the concern of computational complexity.\nObviously, with GD,d, we can take advantage of larger context of up to d words. However, a common criticism against the EPL approach is that a grammar like GD,d is not mathematically sound. The probabilities are simply heuristics, and there is no clear statistical explanation. In the next section, we will show that GD,d is mathematically sound."

Given D and s, we can obtain a model/grammar GDs with maximum likelihood estimation. Thus, we can calculate joint probability of (uj , vj) given grammar GDs, Pr(uj, vj |GDs).\nThere are potentially exponential number of distinct segmentations for D. Here, we use an ensemble method to sum over all possible segmentations. This method would provide desirable coverage and diversity of translation rules to be learned from the training data. For each segmentation s, we have a fixed prior probability Pr(s) which we will shown in Section 3.2. Thus, we define the ensemble probability L(uj, vj) as follows.\nL(uj, vj) = ∑\ns\nPr(uj, vj |GDs)Pr(s). (4)\nPrior segmentation probabilities Pr(s) serve as model probabilities in (4). Having the model probabilities fixed in this way could avoid over-fitting of the training data DeNero et al.

Therefore, Pr(ua,v|GD,d) is constant-factor approximation of L(ua,v). Using GD,d is, to some extent, equivalent to using all possible MLE grammars at the same time via an ensemble method."

Let mj = #(uj , vj), the number of times that string pair (uj , vj) appears in the training data D, 1 ≤ j ≤ k. Let mj,s = #s(uj , vj), the number of times that this token pair appears in the segmented data Ds. In order to prove Theorem 2, we assume that the following two assumptions are true for any pair of tokens (uj , vj).\nAssumption 1 Any two of the mj appearances in D are neither overlapping nor consecutive.\nThis assumption is necessary for the calculation of E[mj,s], 1 ≤ j ≤ k. Based on Lemma 1, the number of times that (uj , vj) is exactly tokenized as in this way with segmentation s is in a binomial distribution B(mj, q|uj |−1(1− q)2), so that\nE[mj,s] = mjq |uj |−1(1− q)2,\nwhere |uj | is the number of words in uj . In addition, since there is no overlap, these appearances cover a total of |uj |mj source words.\nAssumption 2 Let ηj = (|uj |+1)mj\n|D| . We have lim|D|→∞ ηj = 0.\nIn fact, as we will see it in Section 4.1, we do not have to rely on Assumption 2 to bound the ratio of Pr(ua,v|GD,d) and Lq(ua,v). We know that ηj is a very small positive number, and we can build the upper and lower bounds of the ratio based on ηj . However, with this assumption, it will be much easier to see the big picture, so we assume that it is true in the rest of this section.\nTheorem 2 Suppose Assumptions 1 and 2 hold for a given pair of tokens (uj , vj), then we have\nlim |D|→∞\nLq(uj , vj)\nPr(uj , vj |GD,d) = q|uj |,\nwhere q = d/(d+ 1).\nLater in the section, we will show Theorem 2 with Lemmas 4 and 5. Theorem 3 immediately follows Theorem 2.\nTheorem 3 Suppose Assumptions 1 and 2 hold for any j, then we have\nlim |D|→∞\nLq(ua,v)\nPr(ua,v|GD,d) = q|x|,\nwhere q = d/(d+ 1).\nHere, |x| is a constant for hypotheses of the same input. An interesting observation is that the prior segmentation model to fit into this theorem tends to generate longer tokens, if we have a larger value for d.\nWe will show Theorem 2 by bounding it from above and below via Lemmas 4 and 5 respectively. Now, we introduce the notations to be use the proofs of Lemmas 4 and 5 in Appendixes A and B respectively.\nFirst, we combine (1) and (4), and obtain\nLq(uj , vj) = Es( mj,s |Ds| ). (5)\nWith Assumption 1, we know the value of E[mj,s]. However, |Ds| depends on mj,s, and this prevents us from computing the expected value on each individual item.\nWe solve it by bounding |Ds| with values independent of mj,s, or the separating variables related to the mj appearances in D. We divide D into two parts, H and I , based on the mj appearances of (uj , vj) pairs. H is the part that contains and only contains all mj appearances, and I is the rest of D, so that the internal separating variables of I are independent of mj,s. An example is shown in Figure 3. Black boxes represent the mj appearances.\nWe concatenate fragments in I and keep the I-internal separating variables as in s. There are two variants of the segmentation for I , depending on how we define the separating variables between the fragments. So we have the following two segmented sub-sets.\n• I s0(I): inter-fragment separating variable = 0.\n• I s1(I): inter-fragment separating variable = 1.\nHere, s0(I) and s1(I) represent the two segmentation vectors on I respectively, each of which has |I| − mj − 1 changeable separating variables, where |I| is the number words contained in I . The number of changeable variables that set to 1 follows a binomial distribution B(|I|−mj − 1, 1− q). In Figure 3, fixed inter-fragment separating variables are represented in the bold italic font.\nIf there are s changeable variables set to 1 in I s0(I), the number of tokens in Is0(I) is |Is0(I)| = s+ 1. Similarly, if there are s changeable variables set to 1 in I s1(I), the number of tokens in Is1(I) is |I s1(I)| = s+mj + 1.\nIn addition, it is easy to verify that\n|I s0(I)| ≤ |Ds| (6)\n|Ds| ≤ |Is1(I)|+ |uj |mj (7)\nCombining (5), (6) and the two assumptions, we have the upper bound in Lemma 4.\nLemma 4 If Assumptions 1 and 2 hold,\nlim |D|→∞\nLq(uj , vj)\nPr(uj , vj |GD,d) ≤ q|uj |,\nwhere q = d/(d+ 1).\nSimilarly, combining (5), (7) and the two assumptions, we obtain the lower bound in Lemma 5.\nLemma 5 If Assumptions 1 and 2 hold,\nlim |D|→∞\nLq(uj , vj)\nPr(uj , vj |GD,d) ≥ q|uj |,\nwhere q = d/(d+ 1).\nThe proofs of Lemmas 4 and 5 are given in the Appendixes A and B respectively.

Starting from Theorem 2, we can easily obtain the following corollaries for conditional probabilities.\nCorollary 6 Suppose Assumptions 1 and 2 hold for a given pair of tokens (uj , vj), then we have\nlim |D|→∞ Pr(uj |vj , GD,d)/ Lq(uj , vj)∑ u Lq(u, vj) = 1,\nwhere q = d/(d+ 1).\nProof According to the definition, Pr(u, vj |GD,d) = 0 and Lq(u, vj) = 0, if |u| 6= |vj |. Therefore, we only need to consider all pairs of (u, vj), such that |u| = |vj | = |uj |. The number of distinct u is a finite number, since source vocabulary is a finite set.

Therefore, conditional probabilities in EPL are reasonable approximation of the conditional ensemble probability functions.\nThe proofs for the conditional probabilities depend on a special property of monotonic translation; the length of uj is the same as the length of vj . However, this is not true in real application of phrase-based translation. The source and the target sides may have different segmentations. We leave the modeling of real phrase-based translation for future work."

Thus, it would be similar to the string-to-tree model in Section 3.5. Joint probability of (uj , vj) stands for unigram probability Pr(treelet).\nHowever, the original DOP estimator (DOP1) is quite different from our monotonic translation model.

In this article, we first formalize EPL, and then show that the probability given by an EPL model is constant-factor approximation of the probability given by an ensemble method that integrates exponential number of models obtained with various segmentations of the training data. This work for the first time provides theoretical justification for the widely used EPL algorithm in NLP, which was previously viewed as a flawed heuristic method. Better understanding of EPL may lead to improved pattern learning algorithms in future.",
