However, training deep networks online, in order to capture previously unseen object classes from one or few examples,\n∗Equal first authorship.\nis challenging. This problem emerges naturally in applications such as visual object tracking, where the goal is to re-detect an object over a video with the sole supervision of a bounding box at the beginning of the sequence. The main challenge is the lack of a-priori knowledge of the target object, which can be of any class.\nThe simplest approach is to disregard the lack of a-priori knowledge and adapt a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to the target, for example by using stochastic gradient descent (SGD), the workhorse of deep network optimization [32, 26, 36]. The extremely limited training data and large number of parameters make this a difficult learning problem. Furthermore, SGD is quite expensive for online adaptation [32, 26].\nA possible answer to these shortcomings is to have no online adaptation of the network. Recent works have focused on learning deep embeddings that can be used as universal object descriptors [3, 13, 29, 18, 5]. These methods use a Siamese CNN, trained offline to discriminate whether two image patches contain the same object or not. The idea is that a powerful embedding will allow the detection (and thus tracking) of objects via similarity, bypassing the online learning problem. However, using a fixed metric to compare appearance prevents the learning algorithm from exploiting any video-specific cues that could be helpful for discrimination.\nAn alternative strategy is to use instead an online learn-\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n06 03\n6v 1\n[ cs\ning method such as the Correlation Filter (CF). The CF is an efficient algorithm that learns to discriminate an image patch from the surrounding patches by solving a large ridge regression problem extremely efficiently [4, 14]. It has proved to be highly successful in object tracking (e.g. [6, 19, 23, 2]), where its efficiency enables a tracker to adapt its internal model of the object on the fly at every frame. It owes its speed to a Fourier domain formulation, which allows the ridge regression problem to be solved with only a few applications of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and cheap element-wise operations. Such a solution is, by design, much more efficient than an iterative solver like SGD, and still allows the discriminator to be tailored to a specific video, contrary to the embedding methods.\nThe challenge, then, is to combine the online learning efficiency of the CF with the discriminative power of CNN features trained offline. This has been done in several works (e.g. [22, 7, 9, 32]), which have shown that CNNs and CFs are complementary and their combination results in improved performance.\nHowever, in the aforementioned works, the CF is simply applied on top of pre-trained CNN features, without any deep integration of the two methods. End-to-end training of deep architectures is generally preferable to training individual components separately. The reason is that in this manner the free parameters in all components can co-adapt and cooperate to achieve a single objective. Thus it is natural to ask whether a CNN-CF combination can also be trained end-to-end with similar benefits.\nThe key step in achieving such integration is to interpret the CF as a differentiable CNN layer, so that errors can be propagated through the CF back to the CNN features. This is challenging, because the CF itself is the solution of a learning problem. Hence, this requires to differentiate the solution of a large linear system of equations. This paper provides a closed-form expression for the derivative of the Correlation Filter. Moreover, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach in training CNN architectures endto-end.\nWe present an extensive investigation into the effect of incorporating the CF into the fully-convolutional Siamese framework of Bertinetto et al. [3]. We find that the CF does not improve results for networks that are sufficiently deep. However, our method enables ultra-lightweight networks of a few thousand parameters to achieve state-of-theart performance on multiple benchmarks while running at high framerates.\nCode and results are available online 1.\n1www.robots.ox.ac.uk/˜luca/cfnet.html"

      "text" : "Since the seminal work of Bolme et al. [4], the Correlation Filter has enjoyed great popularity within the tracking community. Notable efforts have been devoted to its improvement, for example by mitigating the effect of periodic boundaries [10, 16, 8], incorporating multi-resolution feature maps [22, 9] and augmenting the objective with a more robust loss [27]. For the sake of simplicity, in this work we adopt the basic formulation of the Correlation Filter.\nRecently, several methods based on Siamese networks have been introduced [29, 13, 3], raising interest in the tracking community for their simplicity and competitive performance. For our method, we prefer to build upon the fully-convolutional Siamese architecture [3], as it enforces the prior that the appearance similarity function should commute with translation.\nAt its core, the Correlation Filter layer that we introduce amounts to computing the solution to a regularized deconvolution problem, not to be confused with upsampling convolution layers that are sometimes referred to as “deconvolution layers” [21]. Before it became apparent that algorithms such as SGD are sufficient for training deep networks, Zeiler et al. [35] introduced a deep architecture in which each layer solves a convolutional sparse coding problem. In contrast, our problem has a closed-form solution since the Correlation Filter employs quadratic regularization rather than 1-norm regularization.\nThe idea of back-propagating gradients through the solution to an optimization problem during training has been previously investigated. Ionescu et al. [15] and Murray [25] have presented back-propagation forms for the SVD and Cholesky decomposition respectively, enabling gradient descent to be applied to a network that computes the solution to either a system of linear equations or an eigenvalue problem. Our work can be understood as an efficient backpropagation procedure through the solution to a system of linear equations, where the matrix has circulant structure.\nWhen the solution to the optimization problem is obtained iteratively, an alternative is to treat the iterations as a Recurrent Neural Network, and to explicitly unroll a fixed number of iterations [37]. Maclaurin et al. [24] go further and back-propagate gradients through an entire SGD learning procedure, although this is computationally demanding and requires judicious bookkeeping. Gould et al. [11] have recently considered differentiating the solution to general argmin problems without restricting themselves to iterative procedures. However, these methods are unnecessary in the case of the Correlation Filter, as it has a closed-form solution.\nBack-propagating through a learning algorithm invites a comparison to meta-learning. Recent works [31, 1] have proposed feed-forward architectures that can be interpreted as learning algorithms, enabling optimization by gradient\ndescent. Rather than adopt an abstract definition of learning, this paper propagates gradients through a conventional learning problem that is already widely used."

The fullyconvolutional Siamese framework considers pairs (x′, z′) comprising a training image x′ and a test image z′2. The image x′ represents the object of interest (e.g. an image patch centered on the target object in the first video frame), while z′ is typically larger and represents the search area (e.g. the next video frame).\nBoth inputs are processed by a CNN fρ with learnable parameters ρ. This yields two feature maps, which are then cross-correlated:\ngρ(x ′, z′) = fρ(x ′) ? fρ(z ′) . (1)\nEq. 1 amounts to performing an exhaustive search of the pattern x′ over the test image z′. The goal is for the maximum value of the response map (left-hand side of eq. 1) to correspond to the target location.\nTo achieve this goal, the network is trained offline with millions of random pairs (x′i, z ′ i) taken from a collection of videos. Each example has a spatial map of labels ci with values in {−1, 1}, with the true object location belonging to the positive class and all others to the negative class.

Similar\n2Note that this differs from [3], in which the target object and search area were instead denoted z and x respectively.\nto [3], we employ a simplistic tracking algorithm to assess the utility of the similarity function.\nOnline tracking is performed by simply evaluating the network in forward-mode. The feature representation of the target object is compared to that of the search region, which is obtained in each new frame by extracting a window centred at the previously estimated position, with an area that is four times the size of the object. The new position of the object is taken to be the location with the highest score.\nThe original fully-convolutional Siamese network simply compared every frame to the initial appearance of the object. In contrast, we compute a new template in each frame and then combine this with the previous template in a moving average."

      "text" : "We propose to modify the baseline Siamese network of eq. 1 with a Correlation Filter block between x and the cross-correlation operator. The resulting architecture is illustrated in Figure 1. This change can be formalized as:\nhρ,s,b(x ′, z′) = s ω (fρ(x ′)) ? fρ(z ′) + b (3)\nThe CF block w = ω(x) computes a standard CF template w from the training feature map x = fρ(x′) by solving a ridge regression problem in the Fourier domain [14]. Its effect can be understood as crafting a discriminative template that is robust against translations. It is necessary to introduce scalar parameters s and b (scale and bias) to make the score range suitable for logistic regression. Offline training is then performed in the same way as for a Siamese network (Section 3.1), replacing g with h in eq. 2.\nWe found that it was important to provide the Correlation Filter with a large region of context in the training image, which is consistent with the findings of Danelljan et al. [8] and Kiani et al. [16]. To reduce the effect of circular boundaries, the feature map x is pre-multiplied by a cosine window [4] and the final template is cropped [30].\nNotice that the forward pass of the architecture in Figure 1 corresponds exactly to the operation of a standard CF tracker [14, 6, 23, 3] with CNN features, as proposed in previous work [22, 7]. However, these earlier networks were not trained end-to-end. The novelty is to compute the derivative of the CF template with respect to its input so that a network incorporating a CF can be trained end-to-end."

      "text" : "We now show how to back-propagate gradients through the Correlation Filter solution efficiently and in closed form via the Fourier domain.\nFormulation. Given a scalar-valued image x ∈ Rm×m, the Correlation Filter is the template w ∈ Rm×m whose inner product with each circular shift of the image x ∗ δ−u is\nas close as possible to a desired response y[u] [14], minimizing∑\nu∈U (〈x ∗ δ−u, w〉 − y[u])2 = ‖w ? x− y‖2 . (4)\nHere, U = {0, . . . ,m − 1}2 is the domain of the image, y ∈ Rm×m is a signal whose u-th element is y[u], and δτ is the translated Dirac delta function δτ [t] = δ[t − τ ]. In this section, we use ∗ to denote circular convolution and ? to denote circular cross-correlation. Recall that convolution with the translated δ function is equivalent to translation (x ∗ δτ )[t] = x[t− τ mod m]. Incorporating quadratic regularization to prevent overfitting, the problem is to find\nargmin w\n1 2n ‖w ? x− y‖2 + λ 2 ‖w‖2 (5)\nwhere n = |U| is the effective number of examples. The optimal template w must satisfy the system of equations (obtained via the Lagrangian dual, see Appendix C, supplementary material) k = 1n (x ? x) + λδ\nk ∗ α = 1ny w = α ? x\n(6)\nwhere k can be interpreted as the signal that defines a circulant linear kernel matrix, and α is a signal comprised of the Lagrange multipliers of a constrained optimization problem that is equivalent to eq. 5. The solution to eq. 6 can be computed efficiently in the Fourier domain [14], k̂ = 1n (x̂ ∗ ◦ x̂) + λ1 α̂ = 1n k̂ −1 ◦ ŷ\nŵ = α̂∗ ◦ x̂\n(7a)\n(7b) (7c)\nwhere we use x̂ = Fx to denote the Discrete Fourier Transform of a variable, x∗ to denote the complex conjugate, ◦ to denote element-wise multiplication and 1 to denote a signal of ones. The inverse of element-wise multiplication is element-wise scalar inversion. Notice that the operations in eq. 7 are more efficiently computed in the Fourier domain, since they involve element-wise operations instead of more expensive convolutions or matrix operators (eq. 6). Moreover, the inverse convolution problem (to find α such that k ∗ α = 1ny) is the solution to a diagonal system of equations in the Fourier domain (eq. 7b).\nBack-propagation. We adopt the notation that if x ∈ X = Rn is a variable in a computational graph that computes a final scalar loss ` ∈ R, then ∇x` ∈ X denotes the vector of partial derivatives (∇x`)i = ∂`/∂xi. If y ∈ Y = Rm is another variable in the graph, which is\ncomputed directly from x according to y = f(x), then the so-called back-propagation map for the function f is a linear map from∇y` ∈ Y to∇x` ∈ X .\nAppendix D gives a tutorial review of the mathematical background. In short, the back-propagation map is the linear map which is the adjoint of the differential. This property was used by Ionescu et al. [15] to compute backpropagation maps using matrix differential calculus. While they used the matrix inner product 〈X,Y 〉 = tr(XTY ) to find the adjoint, we use Parseval’s theorem, which states that the Fourier transform is unitary (except for a scale factor) and therefore preserves inner products 〈x, y〉 ∝ 〈x̂, ŷ〉.\nTo find the linear map for back-propagation through the Correlation Filter, we first take the differentials of the system of equations in eq. 6 that defines the template w dk = 1n (dx ? x+ x ? dx)\ndk ∗ α+ k ∗ dα = 1ndy dw = dα ? x+ α ? dx\n(8)\nand then take the Fourier transform of each equation and rearrange to give the differential of each dependent variable in Figure 2 as a linear function (in the Fourier domain) of the differentials of its input variables d̂k = 1n (d̂x ∗ ◦ x̂+ x̂∗ ◦ d̂x) d̂α = k̂−1 ◦ [ 1 n d̂y − d̂k ◦ α̂ ] d̂w = d̂α ∗ ◦ x̂+ α̂∗ ◦ d̂x . (9a) (9b) (9c)\nNote that while these are complex equations, that is simply because they are the Fourier transforms of real equations. The derivatives themselves are all computed with respect to real variables.\nThe adjoints of these linear maps define the overall backpropagation map from ∇w` to ∇x` and ∇y`. We defer the derivation to Appendix B and present here the final result, ∇̂α` = x̂ ◦ (∇̂w`)∗ ∇̂y` = 1n k̂ −∗ ◦ ∇̂α` ∇̂k` = −k̂−∗ ◦ α̂∗ ◦ ∇̂α`\n∇̂x` = α̂ ◦ ∇̂w`+ 2n x̂ ◦ Re{∇̂k`} .\n(10)\nIt is necessary to compute forward Fourier transforms at the start and inverse transforms at the end. The extension to multi-channel images is trivial and given in Appendix E (supplementary material).\nAs an interesting aside, we remark that, since we have the gradient of the loss with respect to the “desired” response y, it is actually possible to optimize for this parameter rather than specify it manually. However, in practice we did not find learning this parameter to improve the tracking accuracy compared to the conventional choice of a fixed Gaussian response [4, 14]."

However, in order to avoid overfitting to the test set in design choices and hyperparameter selection, we consider OTB-2013, OTB-50 and OTB-100 as our test set and 129 videos from VOT2014, VOT-2016 and Temple-Color [20] as our validation set, excluding any videos which were already assigned to the test set. We perform all of our tracking experiments in Sections 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 on the validation set with the same set of “natural” hyperparameters, which are reasonable for all methods and not tuned for any particular method.\nAs in the OTB benchmark [33, 34], we quantify the performance of the tracker on a sequence in terms of the average overlap (intersection over union) of the predicted and ground truth rectangles in all frames. The success rate of a tracker at a given threshold τ corresponds to the fraction of frames in which the overlap with the ground truth is at least τ . This is computed for a uniform range of 100 thresholds between 0 and 1, effectively constructing the cumulative distribution function. Trackers are compared using the area under this curve.\nMimicking the TRE (Temporal Robustness Evaluation) mode of OTB, we choose three equispaced points per sequence and run the tracker from each until the end. Differently from the OTB evaluation, when the target is lost (i.e. the overlap with the ground truth becomes zero) the tracker is terminated and an overlap of zero is reported for all remaining frames.\nDespite the large number of videos, we still find that the performance of similarity networks varies considerably as training progresses. To mitigate this effect, we average the final tracking results that are obtained using the parameters of the network at epochs 55, 60, . . . , 95, 100 (the final epoch) to reduce the variance. These ten results are used to estimate the standard deviation of the distribution of results, providing error bars for most figures in this section. While it would be preferable to train all networks to convergence multiple times with different random seeds, this would require significantly more resources."

The feature extraction network of depth n is terminated after the n-th linear layer, including the following ReLU but not the following pooling layer (if any).\nOur baseline diverges slightly from [3] in two ways. Firstly, we reduce the total stride of the network from 8 to 4 (2 at conv1, 2 at pool1) to avoid training Correlation Filters with small feature maps. Secondly, we always restrict the final layer to 32 output channels in order to preserve the high speed of the method with larger feature maps. These changes did not have a negative effect on the tracking performance of SiamFC.\nThe results show that CFNet is significantly better than the baseline when shallow networks are used to compute features. Specifically, it brings a relative improvement of 31% and 13% for networks of depth one and two respectively. At depths three, four and five, the difference is much less meaningful. CFNet is relatively unaffected by the depth of the network, whereas the performance of the baseline increases steadily and significantly with depth. It seems that the ability of the Correlation Filter to adapt the distance\nmetric to the content of the training image is less important given a sufficiently expressive embedding function.\nThe CF layer can be understood to encode prior knowledge of the test-time procedure. This prior may become redundant or even overly restrictive when enough model capacity and data are available. We believe this explains the saturation of CFNet performance when more than two convolutional layers are used.\nFigure 4 additionally shows that updating the template is always helpful, for both Baseline and CFNet architectures, at any depth."

Results show that taking the CF into account during offline training is critical at depth one and two. However, it seems redundant when more convolutional layers are added, since using features from the Baseline in conjunction with the CF achieves similar performance.\nThe ImageNet+CF variant employs features taken from a network trained to solve the ImageNet classification challenge [28]. The results show that these features, which are often the first choice for combining CFs with CNNs [7, 9, 22, 26, 32, 36], are significantly worse than those learned by CFNet and the Baseline experiment. The particularly poor performance of these features at deeper layers is somewhat unsurprising, since these layers are expected to have greater invariance to position when trained for classification."

(22)\nThe final solution can be obtained from the dual variable\nw = 1λXυ (23)\nand the solution to the dual problem is\nυ = λnK −1y (24)\nwhere K = 1nX TX + λI is the regularized kernel matrix. It is standard to introduce a scaled dual variable α = 1λv that defines w as a weighted combination of examples\nw = Xα = n∑ i=1 αixi with α = 1 n K−1y . (25)\nThe kernel matrix is n × n and therefore the dual solution is more efficient than the primal solution, which requires inversion of a d × d matrix, when the number of features d exceeds the number of examples n.\nC.2. Single-channel Correlation Filter\nGiven a scalar-valued example signal x with domain U and corresponding target signal y, the Correlation Filter w is the scalar-valued signal\nargmin w\n1 2n ‖w ? x− y‖2 + λ 2 ‖w‖2 (26)\nwhere signals are treated as vectors in RU and the circular cross-correlation of two signals w ? x is defined\n(w ? x)[u] = ∑ t∈U w[t]x[u+ t mod m] ∀u ∈ U . (27)\nThe solution from the previous section can then be used by defining X to be the matrix in RU×U such that XTw = w ? x. It follows that the kernel matrix K belongs to RU×U and the dual variable α is a signal in RU .\nThe key to the correlation filter is that the circulant structure of X enables the solution to be computed efficiently in the Fourier domain. The matrix X has elements X[u, t] = x[u+ t mod m]. Since the matrix X is symmetric, the template w is obtained as cross-correlation\nw = Xα = α ? x . (28)\nThe linear map defined by the kernel matrixK is equivalent to convolution with a signal k\nKz = k ∗ z ∀z (29)\nwhich is defined k = 1nx ? x+ λδ, since\n∀z : FXTXz = F ((z ? x) ? x) = ẑ ◦ x̂∗ ◦ x̂ = F (z ∗ (x ? x)) . (30)\nTherefore the solution is defined by the equations k = 1nx ? x+ λδ\nk ∗ α = 1ny w = α ? x\n(31)\nand the template can be computed efficiently in the Fourier domain  k̂ = 1n x̂ ∗ ◦ x̂+ λ1 α̂ = 1n k̂ −1 ◦ ŷ\nŵ = α̂∗ ◦ x̂ . (32)\nC.3. Multi-channel Correlation Filter\nThere is little advantage to the dual solution when training a single-channel Correlation Filter from the circular shifts of a single base example. However, the dual formulation is much more efficient in the multi-channel case [14].\nFor signals with k channels, each multi-channel signal is a collection of scalar-valued signals x = (x1, . . . , xk), and the data term becomes\n‖ ∑ p wp ? xp − y‖ 2 = ‖ ∑ pX T p wp − y‖2 (33)\nand each channel of the template is obtained from the dual variables\nwp = Xpα = α ? xp (34)\nThe solution to the dual problem is still α = 1nK −1y, however the kernel matrix is now given\nK = 1n ∑ pX T p Xp + λI (35)\nand the linear map defined by this matrix is equivalent to convolution with the signal\nk = 1n ∑ p xp ? xp + λδ . (36)\nTherefore the solution is defined by the equations k = 1n ∑ p xp ? xp + λδ\nk ∗ α = 1ny wp = α ? xp ∀p\n(37)\nand the template can be computed efficiently in the Fourier domain  k̂ = 1n ∑ p x̂ ∗ p ◦ x̂p + λ1 α̂ = 1n k̂ −1 ◦ ŷ\nŵp = α̂ ∗ ◦ x̂p ∀p .\n(38)\nIt is critical that the computation scales only linearly with the number of channels."

Back-propagation computes the gradient with respect to the input∇x` ∈ X from the gradient with respect to the output∇y` ∈ Y .\nThe derivative ∂f(x)/∂x is a matrix in Rn×m whose ijth element is the partial derivative ∂fi(x)/∂xj . This matrix relates the gradients according to\n(∇x`)T = ∂` ∂x = ∂` ∂y ∂y ∂x = (∇y`)T ∂f(x) ∂x (39)\nFrom this it is evident that the back-propagation map is the linear map which is the adjoint of that defined by the derivative. That is, if the derivative defines the linear map\nJ(u) = ∂f(x)\n∂x u (40)\nthen the back-propagation map is the unique linear map J∗ that satisfies\n〈J∗(v), u〉 = 〈v, J(u)〉 ∀u ∈ X , v ∈ Y (41)\nand the gradient with respect to the input is obtained∇x` = J∗(∇y`). This is the core of reverse-mode differentiation [12].\nAn alternative way to obtain the linear map defined by the derivative is to use differential calculus. Whereas the\nderivative represents this linear map as a matrix with respect to the standard bases, the differential represents the linear map as an expression df(x; dx). This is valuable for working with variables that possess more interesting structure than simple vectors. This technique has previously been used for matrix structured back-propagation [15]. In this paper, we use it for circulant structured back-propagation."

      "heading" : "F. Hyperparameter optimization",
      "text" : "The hyperparameters that define the simplistic tracking algorithm have a significant impact on the tracking accuracy. These include parameters such as the penalty for changes in scale and position and the learning rate of the template average. Choosing hyperparameters is a difficult optimization problem: we cannot use gradient descent because the function is highly discontinuous, and each function evaluation is expensive because it involves running a tracker on every sequence from multiple starting points.\nFor the experiments of the main paper, where we sought to make a fair comparison of different architectures, we therefore used a natural choice of hyperparameters that were not optimized for any particular architecture. Ideally, we would use the optimal hyperparameters for each variant, except it would have been computationally prohibitive to perform this optimization for every point in every graph in the main paper (multiple times for the points with error bars).\nTo achieve results that are competitive with the state-ofthe-art, however, it is necessary to optimize the parameters of the tracking algorithm (on a held-out validation set).\nTo find optimal hyperparameters, we use random search with a uniform distribution on a reasonable range for each parameter. Specifically, we sample 300 random vectors of hyperparameters and run the evaluation described in Section 4.1 on the 129 videos of our validation set. Each method is then evaluated once on the test sets (OTB-2013, OTB-50 and OTB-100) using the hyperparameter vector which gave the best results on the validation set (specified in Table 2). We emphasize that, even though the ground-truth labels are available for the videos in the benchmarks, we do not choose hyperparameters to optimize the results on the\nbenchmarks, as this would not give a meaningful estimate of the generalization ability of the method.\nNote that this random search is performed after training and is only used to choose parameters for the online tracking algorithm. The same network is used for all random samples. The training epoch with the best tracking results on the validation set (with natural tracking parameters) is chosen.\nFigure 8 shows, for each method, the empirical distribution of results (in terms of average overlap) that is induced by the distribution of tracking parameters in random search."

    "abstractText" : "The Correlation Filter is an algorithm that trains a linear template to discriminate between images and their translations. It is well suited to object tracking because its formulation in the Fourier domain provides a fast solution, enabling the detector to be re-trained once per frame. Previous works that use the Correlation Filter, however, have adopted features that were either manually designed or trained for a different task. This work is the first to overcome this limitation by interpreting the Correlation Filter learner, which has a closed-form solution, as a differentiable layer in a deep neural network. This enables learning deep features that are tightly coupled to the Correlation Filter. Experiments illustrate that our method has the important practical benefit of allowing lightweight architectures to achieve state-of-the-art performance at high framerates.",
