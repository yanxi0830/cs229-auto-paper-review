      "text" : "Large scale multi-label classification is an important learning problem with several applications to real-world problems such as image and video annotation Carneiro et al. (2007); Wang et al. (2009) and query/keyword suggestions Agrawal et al. (2013). The goal in multi-label classification is to accurately predict a label vector y ∈ {0, 1}L for a given data point x ∈ Rd. This problem has been studied extensively in the domain of structured output learning, where the number of labels is assumed to be small and the main focus is thus, on modeling inter-label correlations and using them to accurately predict the label vector Hariharan et al. (2010).\nDue to several motivating real-life applications, recent research on multi-label classification has largely shifted its focus to the other end of the spectrum where the number of labels is assumed to be extremely large, with the key challenge being the design of scalable algorithms that offer real-time predictions and have a small memory footprint. In such situations, simple methods such as 1-vs-all or Binary Relevance (BR), that treat each label as a separate binary classification problem fail miserably. For a problem with (say) 104 labels and 106 features, which is common in several applications, these methods have a memory footprint of around 100 Gigabytes and offer slow predictions.\nar X\niv :1\n30 7.\n51 01\nv3 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 5\nN ov\nA common technique that has been used to handle the label proliferation problem in several recent works is “label space reduction”. The key idea in this technique is to reduce the dimensionality of the label-space by using either random projections or canonical correlation analysis (CCA) based projections Chen & Lin (2012); Hsu et al. (2009); Tai & Lin (2012); Kapoor et al. (2012). Subsequently. these methods perform prediction on the smaller dimensional label-space and then recover the original labels by projecting back onto the high dimensional label-space. In particular, Chen & Lin (2012) recently showed that by using a CCA type method with appropriate orthogonality constraints, one can design an efficient algorithm with both label-space as well as feature-space compression. However, this method is relatively rigid and cannot handle several important issues inherent to multi-label problems; see Section 2.1 for more details.\nIn this paper we take a more direct approach by formulating the problem as that of learning a low-rank linear model Z ∈ Rd×L s.t. ypred = ZTx. We cast this learning problem in the standard ERM framework that allows us to use a variety of loss functions and regularizations for Z. This framework unifies several existing dimension reduction approaches. In particular, we show that if the loss function is chosen to be the squared-L2 loss, then our proposed formulation has a closed form solution, and surprisingly, the conditional principal label space transformation (CPLST) method of Chen & Lin (2012) can be derived as a special case. However, the flexibility of the framework allows us to use other loss functions and regularizers that are useful for preventing overfitting and increasing scalability.\nMoreover, we can extend our formulation to handle missing labels; in contrast, most dimension reduction formulations (including CPLST) cannot accommodate missing labels. The ability to learn in the presence of missing labels is crucial as for most real-world applications, one cannot expect to accurately obtain (either through manual or automated labeling) all the labels for a given data point. For example, in image annotation, human labelers tag only prominent labels and typically miss out on several objects present in the image. Similarly, in online collections such as Wikipedia, where articles get tagged with categories, human labelers usually tag only with categories they know about. Moreover, there might be considerable noise/disagreement in the labeling.\nIn order to solve for the low-rank linear model that results from our formulation, we use the popular alternating minimization algorithm that works well despite the non-convexity of the rank constraint. For general loss functions and trace-norm regularization, we exploit subtle structures present in the problem to design a fast conjugate gradient based method. For the special case of squared-L2 loss and trace-norm regularization, we further exploit the structure of the loss function to provide a more efficient and scalable algorithm. As compared to direct computation, our algorithm is O(d̄) faster, where d̄ is the average number of nonzero features in an instance.\nOn the theoretical side, we perform an excess risk analysis for the trace-norm regularized ERM formulation with missing labels, assuming labels are observed uniformly at random. Our proofs do not follow from existing results due to missing labels and require a careful analysis involving results from random matrix theory. Our results show that while in general the low-rank promoting trace-norm regularization does not provide better bounds than learning a full-rank matrix (e.g. using Frobenius norm regularization), for several interesting data distributions, trace-norm regularization does indeed give significantly better bounds. More specifically, for isotropic data distributions, we show that trace-norm based methods have excess risk of O( 1√\nnL ) while full-rank learning can only guarantee O( 1√ n ) excess risk, where n is the number of training\npoints and L is the number of labels. Finally, we provide an extensive empirical evaluation of our method on a variety of benchmark datasets. In particular, we compare our method against three recent label compression based methods: CPLST Chen & Lin (2012), Bayesian-CS Kapoor et al. (2012), and WSABIE Weston et al. (2010). On almost all benchmark datasets, our method significantly outperforms these methods, both in the presence and absence of missing\nlabels. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of our method by applying it to a recently curated Wikipedia dataset Agrawal et al. (2013), that has 881,805 training samples and 213,707 labels. The results show that our method not only provides reasonably accurate solutions for such large-scale problems, but that the training time required is orders of magnitude shorter than several existing methods.\nRelated Work. Typically, Binary Relevance (BR), which treats each label as an independent binary classification problem, is quite accurate for multi-label classification. However, for large number of labels, this method becomes infeasible due to increased model size and prediction time. Recently, techniques have been developed that either reduce the dimensionality of the labels, such as the Compressed Sensing Approach (CS) Hsu et al. (2009), PLST Tai & Lin (2012), CPLST Chen & Lin (2012), and Bayesian CS Kapoor et al. (2012), or reduce the feature dimensionality, such as Sun et al. (2011), or both, such as WSABIE Weston et al. (2010). Most of these existing techniques are tied to a specific loss function (e.g., CPLST and BCS cater only to the squared-L2 loss, and WSABIE works with the weighted approximate ranking loss) and/or cannot accommodate missing labels.\nOur framework models multi-label classification as a general ERM problem with a low-rank constraint, which not only generalizes both label and feature dimensionality reduction but also brings in the ability to support various loss functions and allows for rigorous generalization error analysis. We show that our formulation not only retrieves CPLST, which has been shown to be fairly accurate, as a special case, but in fact substantially enhances it by use of regularization, other loss functions, allowing missing labels etc.\nPaper Organization. We start by studying the generic low-rank empirical risk minimization framework for multi-label learning in Section 2. Next, we propose efficient algorithms for the framework in Section 3 and analyze the generalization performance for the trace-norm regularized ERM in Section 4. We present empirical results in Section 5, and our conclusions in Section 6."

      "text" : "In this section we present a generic ERM-style framework for multi-label classification. For each training point, we shall receive a feature vector xi ∈ Rd and a corresponding label vector yi ∈ {0, 1}L with L labels. For any j ∈ [L], yji = 1 will denote that the lth label is “present” or “on” whereas y j i = 0 will denote that the label is “absent” or “off”. Note that although we focus mostly on the binary classification setting in this paper, our methods easily extend to the multi-class setting where yji ∈ {1, 2, . . . , C}.\nOur predictions for the label vector shall be parametrized as f(x;Z) = ZTx, where Z ∈ Rd×L. Although we have adopted a linear parametrization here, our results can easily be extended for non-linear kernels as well. Let `(y, f(x;Z)) ∈ R be the loss function that computes the discrepancy between the “true” label vector and the prediction. We assume that the loss function is decomposable, i.e., `(y, f(x;Z)) =∑L\nj=1 `(y j , f j(x;Z)).\nThe motivation for our framework comes from the observation that although the number of labels in a multi-label classification problem might be large, there typically exist significant label correlations, thus reducing the effective number of parameters required to model them to much less than d × L. We capture this intuition by restricting the matrix Z to learn only a small number of “latent” factors. This constrains Z to be a low rank matrix which not only controls overfitting but also gives computational benefits.\nGiven n training points our training set will be (X,Y ) whereX = [x1, . . . ,xn]T and Y = [y1 y2 . . . yn]T . Using the loss function `, we propose to learn the parameters Z by using the canonical regularized empirical\nrisk minimization (ERM) method, i.e.,\nẐ = arg min Z J(Z) = n∑ i=1 L∑ j=1 `(Yij , f j(xi;Z)) + λ · r(Z),\ns.t. rank(Z) ≤ k, (1)\nwhere r(Z) : Rd×L → R is a regularization function. In the presence of missing labels, we compute the loss only over the known labels, i.e.,\nẐ = arg min Z JΩ(Z) = ∑ (i,j)∈Ω `(Yij , f j(xi;Z)) + λ · r(Z),\ns.t. rank(Z) ≤ k, (2)\nwhere Ω ⊆ [n] × [L] is the index set that represents “known” labels. Note that in this work, we assume the standard missing value setting, where each label can be either on, off (i.e., Yij = 1 or 0), or missing (Yij =?); several other works have considered another setting where only positive labels are known and are given as 1 in the label matrix, while negative or missing values are all denoted by 0 Agrawal et al. (2013); Bucak et al. (2011).\nNote that although the above formulation is NP-hard in general due to the non-convex rank constraint, for convex loss functions, one can still utilize the standard alternating minimization method. Moreover, for the special case of L2 loss, we can derive closed form solutions for the full-label case (1) and show connections to several existing methods.\nWe would like to note that while the ERM framework is well known and standard, most existing multilabel methods for large number of labels motivate their work in a relatively ad-hoc manner. By studying this formal framework, we can show that existing methods like CPLST Chen & Lin (2012) are in fact a special case of this generic framework (see next section). Furthermore, having this framework also helps us in studying generalization error bounds for our methods and identifying situations where the methods can be expected to succeed (see Section 4).\n2.1 Special Case: Squared-L2 loss\nIn this section, we study (1) and (2) for the special case of squared L2 loss function, i.e., `(y, f(x;Z)) = ‖y − f(x;Z)‖22. We show that in the absence of missing labels, the formulation in (1) can be solved optimally for the squared L2 loss using SVD. Furthermore, by selecting an appropriate regularizer r(Z) and λ, our solution for L2 loss is exactly the same as that of CPLST Chen & Lin (2012).\nWe first show that the unregularized form of (1) with `(y, f(x;Z)) = ‖y − ZTx‖22 has a closed form solution.\nClaim 1. If `(y, f(x;Z)) = ‖y − ZTx‖22 and λ = 0, then\nVXΣ −1 X Mk = arg min Z:rank(Z)≤k ‖Y −XZ‖2F , (3)\nwhere X = UXΣXV TX is the thin SVD decomposition of X , and Mk is the rank-k truncated SVD of M ≡ UTXY .\nProof of Claim 1. Let X = UXΣXV TX be the thin SVD decomposition of X , and Mk be the rank-k truncated SVD approximation of UTXY . We have\narg min Z:rank(Z)≤k\n‖Y −XZ‖F\n= arg min Z:rank(Z)≤k\n‖(UXUTX)(Y −XZ) + (I − UXUTX)(Y −XZ)‖F\n= arg min Z:rank(Z)≤k\n‖UXUTX(Y −XZ)‖F + ‖(I − UXUTX)(Y −XZ)‖F\n= arg min Z:rank(Z)≤k\n‖UTX(Y −XZ)‖F\n= arg min Z:rank(Z)≤k\n‖UTXY − ΣXV TXZ)‖F\n=VXΣ −1 X Mk\nWe now show that this is exactly the solution obtained by Chen & Lin (2012) for their CPLST formulation.\nClaim 2. The solution to Equation 3 is equivalent to ZCPLST = WCPLSTHTCPLST which is the closed form solution for the CPLST scheme Chen & Lin (2012), i.e.,\n(WCPLST , HCPLST )\n= arg min W∈Rd×k H∈RL×k\n‖XW − Y H‖2F + ‖Y − Y HHT ‖2F ,\ns.t. HTH = Ik. (4)\nProof of Claim 2. Let Uk[A]Σk[A]Vk[A] be the rank-k truncated SVD approximation of a matrix A. In Chen & Lin (2012), the authors show that the closed form solution to (4) is\nHC = Vk[Y TXX†Y ], WC = X †Y HC ,\nwhere X† is the pseudo inverse of X . It follows from X† = VXΣ−1X U T X that Y TXX†Y = Y TUXU T XY = MTM and Vk[Y TXX†Y ] = Vk[M ]. Thus, we have\nZCPLST = WCH T C\n= X†Y HCH T C = V TXΣ −1 X U T XY Vk[M ]Vk[M ] T = V TXΣ −1 X MVk[M ]Vk[M ] T = V TXΣ −1 X Mk\nNote that Chen & Lin (2012) derive their method by relaxing a Hamming loss problem and dropping constraints in the canonical correlation analysis in a relatively ad-hoc manner. The above results, on the other hand, show that the same model can be derived in a more principled manner. This helps us in extending the method for several other problem settings in a principled manner and also helps in providing excess risk bounds:\n• As shown empirically, CPLST tends to overfit significantly whenever d is large. However, we can handle this issue by setting the regularization parameter appropriately. • The closed form solution in Chen & Lin (2012) cannot directly handle missing labels as it requires\nSVD on fully observed Y . In contrast, our framework can itself handle missing labels without any modifications. • The formulation in Chen & Lin (2012) is tied to the L2 loss function. In contrast, we can easily handle\nother loss functions; although, the optimization problem might become more difficult to solve."

      "text" : "In this section, we apply the alternating minimization technique for optimizing (1) and (2). For a matrix Z with a known low rank k, it is inefficient to represent it using d × L entries, especially when d and L are large. Hence we consider a low-rank decomposition of the form Z = WHT , where W ∈ Rd×k and H ∈ RL×k. We further assume that r(Z) can be decomposed into r1(W )+r2(H). In the following sections, we present results with the trace norm regularization, i.e., r(Z) = ‖Z‖tr, which can be decomposed as ‖Z‖tr = 12 ( ‖W‖2F + ‖H‖2F ) . Thus, minZ JΩ(Z) under the rank constraint is equivalent to minimizing over W,H:\nJΩ(W,H) = ∑\n(i,j)∈Ω\n`(Yij ,x T i Whj) +\nλ\n2\n( ‖W‖2F + ‖H‖2F ) (5)\nwhere hTj is the j-th row ofH . Note that when either ofW orH is fixed, JΩ(W,H) becomes a convex function. This allows us to apply alternating minimization, a standard technique for optimizing functions with such a property, to (5). For a general loss function, after proper initialization, a sequence { ( W (t), H(t) ) } is generated by\nH(t) ← arg min H JΩ(W (t−1), H), W (t) ← arg min W JΩ(W,H (t)).\nFor a convex loss function, (W (t), H(t)) is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point when the minimum for both minH JΩ ( W (t−1), H ) and minW JΩ ( W,H(t) ) are uniquely defined (see Bertsekas, 1999, Proposition 2.7.1). In fact, when the squared loss is used and Y is fully observed, the case considered in Section 3.2, we can prove that (W (t), H(t)) converges to the global minimum of (5) when either λ = 0 or X is orthogonal.\nOnce W is fixed, updating H is easy as each row hj of H can be independently updated as follows:\nhj ← arg min h∈Rk ∑ i:(i,j)∈Ω `(Yij ,x T i Wh) + 1 2 λ · ‖h‖22, (6)\nwhich is easy to solve as k is small in general. Based on the choice of the loss function, (6) is essentially a linear classification or regression problem over k variables with |{i : (i, j) ∈ Ω}| instances.\nIf H is fixed, updating W ∈ Rd×k is more involved as all variables are mixed up due to the premultiplication withX . Let x̃ij = hj⊗xi. It is not hard to see that updatingW is equivalent to a regularized linear classification/regression problem with |Ω| data points {(Yij , x̃ij) : (i, j) ∈ Ω}. Thus if W ∗ =\nAlgorithm 1 General Loss with Missing Labels To compute∇g(w): 1. A← XW , where vec (W ) = w. 2. Dij ← `′(Yij ,aTi hj), ∀(i, j) ∈ Ω. 3.

(7)\nTaking the squared loss as an example, the above is equivalent to a regularized least squares problem with dk variables. When d is large, say 1M, the closed form solution, which requires inverting a dk× dk matrix, can hardly be regarded as feasible. As a result, updating W efficiently turns out to be the main challenge for alternating minimization.\nIn large-scale settings where both dk and |Ω| are large, iterative methods such as Conjugate Gradient (CG), which perform cheap updates and offer a good approximate solution within a few iterations, are more appropriate to solve (7). Several linear classification/regression packages such as LIBLINEAR Fan et al. (2008) can handle such problems if {x̃ij : (i, j) ∈ Ω} are available. The main operation in such iterative methods is a gradient calculation (∇g(w)) or a multiplication of the Hessian matrix and a vector (∇2g(w)s). Let X̃ = [· · · x̃ij · · · ]T(i,j)∈Ω and d̄ = ∑n i=1 ‖x‖0/n. Then these operations require at least nnz(X̃) = O(|Ω|d̄k) time to compute in general. However, as we show below, we can exploit the structure in X̃ to develop efficient techniques such that both the operations mentioned above can be done in O ((|Ω|+ nnz(X) + d+ L)× k) time. As a result, iterative methods, such as CG, can achieve O(d̄) speedup. See Appendix A.1 for a detailed CG procedure for (7) with the squared loss. Our techniques, thus, make the alternating minimization method efficient enough to handle large-scale problems."

      "text" : "For the situation where labels are fully observed, solving (1) efficiently in the large-scale setting remains a challenge. The closed form solution from (3) is not ideal for two reasons: firstly since it involves the SVD of both X and UTXY , the solution becomes infeasible when rank of X is large. Secondly, since it is an unregularized solution, it might overfit. Indeed CPLST has similar scalability and overfitting issues due to absence of regularization and requirement of pseudo inverse calculations for X . When Y is fully observed, Algorithm 1, which aims to handle missing labels with a general loss function, is also not scalable as |Ω| = nL imposing a O (nLk + nnz(X)k) cost per operation which is prohibitive when n and L are large.\nAlthough, for a general loss, an O(nLk) cost seems to be inevitable, for the L2 loss, we propose fast procedures such that the cost of each operation only depends on nnz(Y ) instead of |Ω|. In most realworld multi-label problems, nnz(Y ) nL = |Ω|. As a result, for the squared loss, our technique allows alternating minimization to be performed efficiently even when |Ω| = nL.\nIf the squared loss is used, the matrix D in Eq. (10) is D = XWHT − Y when Y is fully observed, where W is the d× k matrix such that vec (W ) = w. Then, we have\n∇g(w) = vec ( XTXWHTH −XTY H ) + λw. (12)\nSimilarly, U in Eq. (11) is U = XSHT which gives us\n∇2g(w)s = vec ( XTXSHTH ) + λs.

As we can see, matrix multiplication acts as a crucial subroutine in both Algorithms 1 and 2. Thus, with a highly-optimized parallel BLAS library (such as ATLAS or Intel MKL), our algorithms can easily enjoy speedup brought by the parallel matrix operations provided in the library without any extra efforts. Figure 3 in Appendix D shows that both algorithms do indeed enjoy impressive speedups as the number of cores increases.\nRemark on kernel extension. Given a kernel function K(·, ·), let f j ∈ HK be the minimizer of the empirical loss defined in Eq. (2). Then by the Representer Theorem (for example, Schölkopf et al., 2001), f j admits a representation of the form: f j(·; zj) = ∑n t=1 zjtK(·,xt), where zj ∈ Rn. Let the vector function k(x) : Rd → Rn for K be defined as k(x) = [· · · ,K(x,xt), · · · ]T . Then f(x;Z) can be written as f(x;Z) = ZTk(x), where Z is an n×L matrix with zj as the j-th column. Once again, we can impose the same trace norm regularization r(Z) and the low rank constraint in Eq. (5). As a result, Z = WHT and f j(xi, zj) = kT (xi)Whj . If K is the kernel Gram matrix for the training set {xi : i = 1, . . . , n} and Ki is its ith column, then the loss in (5) can be replaced by l(Yij ,KTi Whj). Thus, the proposed alternating minimization can be applied to solve Equations (1) and (2) with the kernel extension as well."

      "text" : "In this section we analyze excess risk bounds for our learning model with trace norm regularization. Our analysis demonstrates the superiority of our trace norm regularization-based technique over BR and Frobe-\nnius norm regularization. We require a more careful analysis for our setting since standard results do not apply because of the presence of missing labels.\nOur multi-label learning model is characterized by a distribution D on the space of data points and labels X × {0, 1}L where X ⊆ Rd and a distribution that decides the pattern of missing labels. We receive n training points (x1,y1), . . . , (xn,yn) sampled i.i.d from the distribution D, where yi ∈ {0, 1}L are the ground truth label vectors. However we shall only be able to observe the ground truth label vectors yi at s random locations. More specifically, for each i we only observe yi at locations l1i , . . . , l s i ∈ [L] where the locations are chosen uniformly from the set [L] and the choices are independent of (xi,yi). Given this training data, we learn a predictor Ẑ by performing empirical risk minimization over a constrained set of predictors as follows:\nẐ = arg inf r(Z)≤λ L̂(Z) = 1 n n∑ i=1 s∑ j=1 `(y lji i , f lji (xi;Z)),\nwhere L̂(Z) is the empirical risk of a predictor Z. Note that although the method in Equation 2 uses a regularized formulation that is rank-constrained, we analyze just the regularized version without the rank constraints for simplicity.

Interestingly, we can show that our analysis, obtained via uniform convergence bounds, is tight and cannot be improved in general. We refer the reader to Appendix C.1 for the tightness argument. However, it turns out that Frobenius norm regularization is also able to offer the same excess risk bounds and thus, this result does not reveal any advantage for trace norm regularization. Nevertheless, we can still get improved bounds for a general class of distributions over (x,y):\nTheorem 4. Let the data distribution satisfy the following conditions: 1) The top singular value of the covariance matrix X = E\nx∼D\nq xx> y is ‖X‖2 = σ1, 2) tr (X) = Σ and 3) the distribution on X is sub-\nGaussian i.e. for some η > 0, for all v ∈ Rd, E q exp ( x>v )y ≤ exp ( ‖v‖22 η2/2 ) , then with probability at least 1− δ, we have\nL(Ẑ) ≤ arg inf ‖Z‖tr≤λ L(Z) +O\nsλ√d(η2 + σ1) nLΣ + s √ log 1δ n  .\nIn particular, if the data points are generated from a unit normal distribution, then we have\nL(Ẑ) ≤ arg inf ‖Z‖tr≤λ L(Z) +O\n( sλ √ 1\nnL\n) +O s √\nlog 1δ n  . The proof of Theorem 4 can be found in Appendix B. Our proofs do not follow either from existing techniques for learning with matrix predictors (for instance Kakade et al. (2012)) or from results on matrix completion with trace norm regularization Shamir & Shalev-Shwartz (2011) due to the complex interplay of feature vectors and missing labels that we encounter in our learning model. Instead, our results utilize a novel form of Rademacher averages, bounding which requires tools from random matrix theory. We note that our results can even handle non-uniform sampling of labels (see Theorem 6 in Appendix B for details).\nWe note that the assumptions on the data distribution are trivially satisfied with finite σ1 and η by any distribution with support over a compact set. However, for certain distributions, this allows us to give superior bounds for trace norm regularization. We note that Frobenius norm regularization can give no better than a ( λ√ n ) style excess error bound even for such distributions (see Appendix C.2 for a proof), whereas\ntrace norm regularization allows us to get superior (\nλ√ nL\n) style bounds. This is especially contrasting when,\nfor instance, λ = O( √ L), in which case trace norm regularization gives O ( 1√ n ) excess error whereas the\nexcess error for Frobenius regularization deteriorates to O (√\nL n\n) . Thus, trace norm seems better suited to\nexploit situations where the data distribution is isotropic. Intuitively, we expect such results due to the following reason: when labels are very sparsely observed, such as when s = O (1), we observe the value of each label onO (n/L) training points. In such a situation, Frobenius norm regularization with say λ = √ L essentially allows an independent predictor zl ∈ Rd to be learned for each label l ∈ [L]. Since all these predictors are being trained on only O (n/L) training points, the performance accordingly suffers.\nOn the other hand, if we were to train a single predictor for all the labels i.e. Z = z1> for some z ∈ Rd, such a predictor would be able to observe O(n) points and consequently have much better generalization properties. Note that this predictor also satisfies ‖z1>‖tr ≤ √ L. This seems to indicate that trace norm regularization can capture cross label dependencies, especially in the presence of missing labels, much better than Frobenius norm regularization.\nHaving said that, it is important to note that the two regularizations (trace norm vs. Frobenius norm) might induce different biases in the learning framework. It would be an interesting exercise to study the biasvariance trade-offs offered by these two regularization techniques. However, if one has label correlations then we expect both formulations to suffer similar biases."

We first compare dimension reduction based approaches to assess their performance with varying dimensionality reduction ratios. Figure 1 presents these results for LEML, CPLST and BCS on the squared L2 loss with BR included for reference. Clearly LEML consistently performs better than other methods for all ratios. Next we compare LEML with three loss functions (squared, logistic, and L2-hinge) to WSABIE, which approximately optimizes a weighted approximate ranking loss. As Table 3 shows, although the best loss for each dataset might vary, LEML is always superior to or competitive with WSABIE.\nBased on Figure 1, Table 3, and further results in Appendix D.2, we make the following observations. 1) LEML can deliver accuracies competitive with BR even with a severe reduction in dimensionality, 2) On bibtex and compphys, LEML is even shown to outperform BR. This is a benefit brought forward by the design of LEML, wherein the relation between labels can be captured by a low rank Z. This enables LEML to better utilize label information than BR and yield better accuracies. 3) On autofood and compphys, CPLST seems to suffer from overfitting and demonstrates a significant dip in performance. In contrast, LEML, which brings regularization into the formulation performs well consistently on all datasets.\nLarger data. Table 4 shows results for LEML and WSABIE on the three larger datasets. We implemented LEML with the squared L2 loss using Algorithm 2 for comparison in the full labels case. Note that Hamming loss is not used here as it is not clear how to convert the label ranking given by WSABIE to a 0/1 encoding. For LEML, we report the time and the accuracies obtained after five alternating iterations. For WSABIE, we ran the method on each dataset with the hand-tuned parameters for about two days, and reported the time and results for the epoch with the highest average AUC. On eurlex and nus-wide, LEML is clearly superior than WSABIE on all evaluation criteria. On wiki, although both methods share a similar performance for k = 250, on increasing k to 500, LEML again outperforms WSABIE. Also clearly noticeable is the stark difference in the running times of the two methods. Whereas LEML takes less than 6 hours to deliver 0.9374 AUC on wiki, WSABIE requires about 1.6 days to achieve 0.9058 AUC. More specifically, WSABIE takes about 7,000s for the first epoch, 16,000s for the second and 36,000s for the third epoch which result in it spending almost two days on just 5 epochs. Although this phenomenon is expected due to the sampling scheme in WSABIE Weston et al. (2010), it becomes more serious as L increases. We leave the issue of designing a better sampling scheme with large L for future work. Figure 2a further illustrates this gap in training times for the nus-wide dataset. All in all, the results clearly demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of LEML."

We modeled our framework with rank constraints and regularizers to increase scalability and efficiency. To solve the obtained non-convex problem, we proposed an alternating minimization based method that critically exploits structure in the loss function to make our method scalable. We showed that our learning framework admits excess risk bounds that indicate better generalization performance for our methods than the existing methods like BR, something which our experiments also confirmed. Our experiments additionally demonstrated that our techniques are much more efficient than other large scale multi-label classifiers and give superior performance than the existing label compression based approaches. For future work, we would like to extend LEML to other (non decomposable) loss functions such as ranking losses and study conditions under which alternating minimization for our problem is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. Another open question is if our risk bounds can be improved by avoiding the uniform\nconvergence route that we use in the paper."

We show below, that conditioning on this event does not affect the Rademacher average calculations. A simple calculation shows that E\nX, r∥∥X l ∥∥22∣∣∣ lz ≤ nΣ. If we have n > 12p2 log LΣPd(η2+σ1) , we have P [¬Emax] < Pd(η2+σ1)Σ . This gives us the following bound:\nE X,l, s∥∥∥X l ∥∥∥2 2 { = E X, s∥∥∥X l ∥∥∥2 2 ∣∣∣∣ Emax{P [Emin] + EX, s∥∥∥X l ∥∥∥2 2 ∣∣∣∣¬Emin{ (1− P [Emax]) = E\nX, s∥∥∥X l ∥∥∥2 2 ∣∣∣∣ Emax{ (1− δ) + EX, s∥∥∥X l ∥∥∥2 2 ∣∣∣∣¬Emax{ δ ≤ E\nX, s∥∥∥X l ∥∥∥2 2 ∣∣∣∣ Emax{ + nΣ(Pd(η2 + σ1)Σ )\n≤ O (\nE X, s∥∥∥X l ∥∥∥2 2 ∣∣∣∣ Emax{) where the last step follows since our subsequent calculations will show that E\nX, r∥∥X l ∥∥22∣∣∣ Emaxz = O (nPd(η2 + σ1)). Thus, it suffices to bound E\nX, r∥∥X l ∥∥22∣∣∣ Emaxz = EX, r‖V ‖22∣∣∣ Emaxz. For sake of brevity we will omit the conditioning term from now on.\nFor simplicity let Al = Vlc where c = η · √ 2P · n and A = [A1A2 . . . AL]. Thus\nE X,l, s∥∥∥X l ∥∥∥2 2 { = c2 · E X,l, r ‖A‖22 z\nWe first bound the sub-Gaussian norm of the column vectors Al. For any vector v ∈ Rd, we have:\nE r exp ( A>l v )z = E u vexp 1 c ∑ i∈Il i〈xi,v〉 }~ = ( E s exp ( 〈x, 1 c v〉 ){)nl\n≤ ( exp (∥∥∥∥1c v ∥∥∥∥2\n2\nη2/2 ))nl = exp ( nl\n2η2P · n ‖v‖22 η 2/2 ) ≤ exp ( ‖v‖22 /2\n) where, in the second step, we have used the fact that xi,xj and i, j are independent for i 6= j, in the third step we have used the sub-Gaussian properties of x and in the fourth step, we have use the fact that the event Emax holds. This shows us that the sub-Gaussian norm of the column vector Al is bounded i.e. ‖Al‖ψ2 ≤ 1.\nWe now proceed to bound E X,\nr ‖A‖22 z = E\nX,\nr∥∥A>∥∥2 2 z . Our proof proceeds by an application of\na Bernstein-type inequality followed by a covering number argument and finishing off by bounding the\nexpectation in terms of the cumulative distribution function. The first two parts of the proof proceed on the lines of the proof of Theorem 5.39 in Vershynin (2012) For any fixed vector v ∈ Sd−1, the set of unit norm vectors in d dimensions, we have:\n‖Av‖22 = L∑ l=1 〈Al,v〉2 =: L∑ l=1 Z2l\nNow observe that conditioned on l, It ∩ It′ = ϕ if t 6= t′ and thus, conditioned on l, the variables Zt, Zt′ are independent for t 6= t′. This will allow us to apply the following Bernstein-type inequality\nTheorem 5 (Vershynin (2012), Corollary 5.17). Let X1, . . . , XN be independent centered sub-exponential variables with bounded sub-exponential norm i.e. for all i, we have ‖Xi‖ψ1 ≤ B for some B > 0. Then for some absolute constant c1 > 0, we have for any > 0,\nP [ N∑ i=1 Xi ≥ N ] ≤ exp ( −c1 min { 2 B2 , B } N ) .\nTo apply the above result, we will first bound expectation of the random variables Z2l .\nE q Z2l y = E q 〈Al,v〉2 y = E u v 1 c ∑ i∈Il i〈xi,v〉 2}~ = nl c2 E q 〈x,v〉2 y ≤ nlσ1 c2 ≤ σ1 η2\nwhere the fourth inequality follows from definition of the top singular norm σ1 of X := E q xx> y and the last inequality follows from the event Emax. The above calculation gives us a bound on the expectation of Z2l which will be used to center it. Since we have already established ‖Al‖ψ2 ≤ 1, we automatically get ‖Zl‖ψ2 ≤ 1. Using standard inequalities between the sub-exponential norm ‖·‖ψ1 and the sub-Gaussian norm ‖·‖ψ2 of random variables (for instance, see Vershynin, 2012, Lemma 5.14) we also have∥∥Z2l − E qZ2l y∥∥ψ1 ≤ 2 ∥∥Z2l ∥∥ψ1 ≤ 4 ‖Zl‖2ψ2 ≤ 4. Applying Theorem 5 to the variables Xl = Z2l − E q Z2l y , we get\nP [ L∑ l=1 Z2l − L σ1 η2 ≥ L ] ≤ exp ( −c1Lmin { 2, }) where c1 > 0 is an absolute constant. Thus with probability at least 1− exp ( −c1Lmin { 2, }) , for a fixed vector v ∈ Sd−1, we have the inequality\n‖Av‖22 ≤ ( σ1 η2 + ) L\nApplying a union bound over a 14 -net N1/4 over S d−1 (which can be of size at most 9d), we get that with probability at most 1− 9d exp ( −c1Lmin { 2, }) , we have the above inequality for every vector v ∈ N1/4 as well. We note that this implies a bound on the spectral norm of the matrix A (see Vershynin, 2012, Lemma 5.4) and get the following bound\n‖A‖22 ≤ 2 ( σ1 η2 + ) L\nPut = c2 · dL + ′ L where c2 = max { 1, ln 9c1 } and suppose d ≥ L. Since c2 ≥ 1, we have ≥ 1 which gives\nmin { , 2 } = . This gives us with probability at least 1− exp (−c1 ′),\n‖A‖22 ≤ 2 ( L σ1 η2 + c2d+ ′ )\nConsider the random variable Y = ‖A‖ 2 2\n2 − L σ1 η2 − c2d. Then we have P [Y > ] ≤ exp (−c1 ). Thus we\nhave E JY K = ∫ ∞ 0 P [Y > ] d ≤ ∫ ∞ 0 exp (−c1 ) d = 1\nc1 This gives us\nE r ‖A‖22 z ≤ 2 ( L σ1 η2 + c2d+ 1\nc1 ) and consequently,\nE X,l, s∥∥∥X l ∥∥∥2 2 { = c2· E X,l, r ‖A‖22 z ≤ 4η2P ·n ( L σ1 η2 + c2d+ 1\nc1\n) ≤ O ( nη2P ( d+ L\nσ1 η2\n)) ≤ O ( nPd(η2 + σ1) ) where the last step holds when d ≥ L. Thus, we are able to bound the Rademacher averages, for some absolute constant c3 as\nRn (Z) ≤ λ\nn √ Σ √∥∥∥∥ EX,l, r‖X l ‖22z ∥∥∥∥ ≤ c3λ √ Pd(η2 + σ1) nΣ ,\nwhich allows us to make the following claim:\nTheorem 6. Suppose we learn a predictor using the trace norm regularized formulation Ẑ = arg inf ‖Z‖tr≤λ L̂(Z) over a set of n training points. Further suppose that, for any l ∈ [L], the probability of observing the value of label l is given by pl and let P = max\nl∈[L] pl. Then with probability at least 1− δ, we have\nL(Ẑ) ≤ arg inf ‖Z‖tr≤λ L(Z) +O\n( sλ √ dP (η2 + σ1)\nnΣ\n) +O s √\nlog 1δ n  , where the terms η, σ1,Σ are defined by the data distribution as before.\nEssentially, the above result indicates that if some label is observed too often, as would be the case when P = Ω (1), we get no benefit from trace norm regularization since this is akin to a situation with fully observed labels. However, if the distribution on the labels is close to uniform i.e. P = O ( 1 L ) , the above calculation lets us bound the Rademacher average, and consequently, the excess risk as\nRn (Z) ≤ c3λ √ d(η2 + σ1)\nnLΣ ,\nthus proving the first part of Theorem 4. We now notice that However, in case our data distribution is near isotropic, i.e. Σ σ1, then this result gives us superior bounds. For instance, if the data points are generated from a standard normal distribution, then we have σ1 = 1, Σ = d and η = 1 using which we can bound the Rademacher average term as\nRn (Z) ≤ c3λ √ 2\nnL ,\nwhich gives us the second part of Theorem 4."

Our proof will essentially demonstrate this by considering a nonisotropic data distribution (since, for isotropic distributions, Theorem 4 shows that a tighter upper bound is actually possible). For simplicity, and w.l.o.g., we will prove the result for λ = 1. Let µ ∈ Rd be a fixed unit vector and consider the following data distribution\nxi = ζiµ,\nwhere ζi are independent Rademacher variables and a trivial label distribution\nyi = 1,\nwhere 1 ∈ RL is the all-ones vector. Note that the data distribution satisfies E r ‖x‖22 z = 1 and thus, satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 3. Let ωli = 1 iff the label l is observed for the i th training point. Note\nthat for any i, we have ∑L\nl=1 ω l i = 1 and that for any l ∈ [L], ωli = 1 with probability 1/L.

However, by Hölder’s inequality, we also have\nẐ = −µv >\n‖v‖2 ,\nand thus, L̂(Ẑ) = − 1n ‖v‖2 since ‖µ‖2 = 1. The following lemma shows that with constant probability, ‖v‖2 ≥ √ n/2 which shows that L(Ẑ) ≥ L̂(Ẑ) + Ω (√ 1 n ) , thus proving the lower bound.\nLemma 2. With probability at least 3/4, we have ‖v‖22 ≥ n/2. Proof.

We shall retain the distribution over labels as well as the loss function from our previous discussion in Appendix C.1. We shall also reuse ωli to denote the label observation pattern. We shall however use Rademacher vectors to define the data distribution i.e. each of the d coordinates of the vector x obeys the law\nr ∼ 1 2 (1{r=1} + 1{r=−1}).\nThus we sample xi as\nxi = 1√ d\n[ r1i , r 2 i , . . . , r d i ] ,\nwhere each coordinate is independently sampled. We now show that this distribution satisfies the assumptions of Theorem 4. We have E q xx> y = 1d · I where I is the d×d identity matrix. Thus σ1 = 1 d and Σ = 1.

Moreover, we can extend our formulation to handle missing labels; in contrast, most dimension reduction formulations (including CPLST) cannot accommodate missing labels. The ability to learn in the presence of missing labels is crucial as for most real-world applications, one cannot expect to accurately obtain (either through manual or automated labeling) all the labels for a given data point. For example, in image annotation, human labelers tag only prominent labels and typically miss out on several objects present in the image. Similarly, in online collections such as Wikipedia, where articles get tagged with categories, human labelers usually tag only with categories they know about. Moreover, there might be considerable noise/disagreement in the labeling. In order to solve for the low-rank linear model that results from our formulation, we use the popular alternating minimization algorithm that works well despite the non-convexity of the rank constraint. For general loss functions and trace-norm regularization, we exploit subtle structures present in the problem to design a fast conjugate gradient based method. For the special case of squared-L2 loss and trace-norm regularization, we further exploit the structure of the loss function to provide a more efficient and scalable algorithm. As compared to direct computation, our algorithm is O(d̄) faster, where d̄ is the average number of nonzero features in an instance.

Our results show that while in general the low-rank promoting trace-norm regularization does not provide better bounds than learning a full-rank matrix (e.g. using Frobenius norm regularization), for several interesting data distributions, trace-norm regularization does indeed give significantly better bounds. More specifically, for isotropic data distributions, we show that trace-norm based methods have excess risk of O( 1 √ nL ) while full-rank learning can only guarantee O( 1 √ n ) excess risk, where n is the number of training points and L is the number of labels.

However, existing approaches do not adequately address two key challenges: (a) the ability to tackle problems with a large number (say millions) of labels, and (b) the ability to handle data with missing labels. In this paper, we directly address both these problems by studying the multi-label problem in a generic empirical risk minimization (ERM) framework. Our framework, despite being simple, is surprisingly able to encompass several recent label-compression based methods which can be derived as special cases of our method. To optimize the ERM problem, we develop techniques that exploit the structure of specific loss functions such as the squared loss function to offer efficient algorithms. We further show that our learning framework admits formal excess risk bounds even in the presence of missing labels. Our risk bounds are tight and demonstrate better generalization performance for low-rank promoting trace-norm regularization when compared to (rank insensitive) Frobenius norm regularization. Finally, we present extensive empirical results on a variety of benchmark datasets and show that our methods perform significantly better than existing label compression based methods and can scale up to very large datasets such as the Wikipedia dataset.",
