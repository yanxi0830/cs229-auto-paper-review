      "text" : "Point Processes [4] have been used for modeling time-events series data. Hawkes Processes (HP) [9] are point processes for modeling self-exciting behavior, i.e., when the arrival of one event makes future events more likely to happen. This type of behavior has been observed in various domains, such as earthquakes, financial markets, web traffic patterns, crime rates [14, 16] and social media [22].\nAs an example, in high-frequency finance, buyers and sellers of stocks demonstrate herding behavior [7, 2]. After the main earthquake, several aftershocks follow according to a time-clustered pattern [18]. In web data, hyperlink proliferation\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n09 06\n8v 3\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\nacross pages exhibit self- and mutual-excitation [8]. In criminology, gang-related retaliatory crime patterns are grouped in time [14]. In social media, the ‘infectiousness’ of posts can be shown to be modeled through a self- and mutual-excitement assumption [22].\nIn Hawkes Processes analysis, some parametric kernels capture intra-domain typical behaviors, e.g., quick time-decaying exponential excitation in the case of finance and web data [1, 8]; slower power-law decay in earthquake-related data [18]; and periodicity-inducing sinusoidal kernel in TV-watching data [21].\nChoosing a proper kernel type may significantly contribute to learning the model parameters and better predicting future events. Kernel parameters may be fitted in the data through the gradient descent method over a likelihood function penalized by a regularization criterion (e.g., Akaike Information Criterion) on the number of parameters [19]. Another method of kernel estimation is through the use of the power spectrum of the second order statistics of the process: covariance density and normalized covariance [9]. These are well defined when the self-triggering function induces what is called stationary behaviour.\nIn this paper, we present an automatic kernel selection and learning algorithm for Hawkes Processes. Given four types of base kernels (EXP,PWL,SQR and SNS), our algorithm finds the best fitting kernel. For handling composite types of events, we develop a new kernel decomposition method which represents the composition (sum and product) of different kernels. For verifying the stationarity property of each composite kernel, we also derived analytical expressions for the stationarity conditions. To our best knowledge, this is the first multi-class kernel decomposition framework for HPs.\nThe main steps of the automatic framework, which will be thoroughly explained in the following sections, are then: discretized kernel estimation and greedy kernel decomposition. An automatic framework for extracting relevant typical features of self-excitement from raw data would likely make the Hawkes Processes analysis faster and conveniently expressed through a human-readable report. Thus, the automated generation of such a report is also discussed.\nAutomatic analysis frameworks for Gaussian Processes (GPs) are proposed in [5] and [10]. However, due the fundamental distinctions between GPs and HPs (such as stationarity conditions and causality assumptions for the latter), the techniques proposed for GPs can not be extended to HPs in a straightforward manner. We include additional references in the appendix."

      "text" : "A point process representation of a sequence of n time-events is expressed by a vector of the form (t1,t2, ... , tn). Treating the real line as a time axis, the vector can be intuitively associated with a so-called Counting Process N(t), s.t.:\n• dN(t) = 1, if there is an event at time t;\n• dN(t) = 0, otherwise.\nAn example of Counting Process is shown in Figure 1. A point process can be described through its intensity function (λ(t)), which can be understood as the instantaneous expected rate of arrival of events, or the expectation of derivative of the Counting Process N(t):\nλ(t) = lim h→0 E[N(t+ h)−N(t)] h\n(1)\nThis intensity function, if existing, uniquely characterizes the finite-dimensional distributions of the point process [4]. A simple example of this function would be the constant mean rate of arrival, µ, in the case of a homogeneous Poisson process.\nHawkes processes model the intensity function in terms of the self-excitement: when the arrival of an event makes subsequent arrivals more likely to happen [11]; and can be described through the following conditional intensity function λ(t):\nλ(t) = lim h→0 E(N(t+ h)−N(t)|H(t)) h\n= µ+ ∫ t −∞ φ(t− u)dN(u), (2)\nwhere:\n• H(t) is the history of the process, the set containing all the events up to time t;\n• µ is called background rate, or exogenous intensity, which is fixed as the mean of a Homogeneous Poisson Process;\n• φ(t) is denominated self-triggering kernel, or excitation function;\nFrom this function, one may notice that the intensity at time t will likely be affected by events which happened before the time t, described by the history of the process.\nFrom [9], we have that, if :\n||φ|| = ∫ ∞ 0 φ(t)dt ≤ 1, (3)\nthen the corresponding process will reach wide-sense stationary behavior, from which the asymptotic steady arrival rate:\nΛ = µ\n(1− ||φ||) , (4)\ncan be obtained, along with its covariance function, which is independent of t:\nν(τ) = E(dN(t)dN(t+ τ)). (5)\nEstimating Λ and ν(τ), also referred to as first- and second-order statistics, respectively, requires wide-sense stationarity assumptions which, besides being analytically convenient, are also connected to the fact that, in real data, the chain of self-excitedly induced further events will always be of finite type, or without ‘blowing up’, what corroborates the practicality of the estimated model."

For the kernel decomposition,\nfour base kernels will be used for identifying and estimating typical triggering behaviors:\n• EXP(α,β): The decay exponential kernel is parameterized by the amplitude α and decay rate β, and is useful for modeling quick influence decay, such as in finance or web data [8], in which initial transactions/hyperlinks have a lot of impact initially but gradually reduce their influence over time:\nEXP(α, β) = αe−βt (6)\n• PWL(K,c,p): The power law kernel is parameterized by the amplitude K, the exponent p, and the constant c, such as in Equation (7), and has been prevalent in earthquake [18] and social media-related data [22], modeling a slower decaying trend than the exponential:\nPWL(K, c, p) = K\n(t+ c)p (7)\n• SQR(B,L): The pulse kernel is described by the amplitude B and the length L. Being a trivial, steady, self-exciting dynamics on its own, it may also work as an offset level for the combined triggering with other kernel types, in the case of addition, and as a horizon truncation, in the case of multiplication1:\nSQR(B,L) = B(u(t)− u(t− L)) (8) 1u(t) is the step function\n• SNS(A,ω): A truncated sinusoidal, parameterized by the amplitude A and the angular velocity ω. This type of kernel base function captures well the self-excitement of periodic events, such as TV watching-related data (IPTV) [21], in which watching one episode of a TV program makes the viewer more likely to watch further ones. Since these shows are usually broadcasted weekly, the TV-watching behavior will likely demonstrate the weekly self-excitement. In addition, according to [14], homicide rates show a pronounced seasonal effect, peaking in the summer and tapering in the winter:\nSNS(A,ω) = Asin(ωt), (9)"

The steps are (1) nonparametric kernel estimation from discretized covariance and (2) parametric kernel search through our new kernel decomposition scheme.\nHere, the discretized kernel estimation is optional when a direct optimization of kernel structure is possible. Unfortunately, discontinuous functions (SQR, SNS) do not allow such optimization (e.g., gradient descent). In this paper, we use the discretized kernel estimation as an unified method for both continuous (EXP, PWL), discontinuous kernels (SQR, SNS) and, most importantly, their combinations.\nFurthermore, another great advantage of this step, compared with traditional sequential methods, is the fact that the value of ν for each value of τ can be calculated independently, while, in gradient descent, the value of the parameters at step t must be obtained before the values for step t + 1. When combined with parallelization of the loops, in our case, this step greatly improved the speed of obtainment of the most likely parametric representations of the sample processes."

However, in [2], it is argued that, being designed for univariate Hawkes Processes, these methods can hardly be used to handle large amounts of data where the kernel function is not well localized compared to the exogenous inter-events time. Subsequently, an extensive analysis of spectral methods for non-parametric kernel estimation on networked HPs is performed.\nIn [14], Networked HPs are explored for analysis and modeling of stock-trading and crime data. A variant of the spectral method for networked HPs, with excitation matrix composed by linear combinations of decaying-exponentials, there referred to as ‘excitation modes’, is developed in [8]. An iterative log-likelihood maximization for non-parametric kernel estimation is presented in [23].\nIn [21], a maximum-likelihood estimator with a Sparse-Group-Lasso regularizer is introduced.

In the financial data experiments, quantitative comparisons were made among the first and second levels of the decomposition framework over a set of time sequences, and also among our decomposition framework and an estimation method largely used in financial applications, described in [19]. In the earthquake data experiments, we evaluate the overall triggering behavior of earthquakes through the relative frequency of each estimated kernel type, out of the four base kernels.\nFor real-world data sets, no prior information about the kernel (type and parameters) is available. Thus, we use the log-likelihood of the kernel function over the time sequence as a quality criterion.\nGiven a realization (t1, t2, ..., tk) of some regular point process on [0,T], its log-likelihood (l) is expressed as:\nl = k∑ i=1 log(λ(ti))− ∫ T 0 λ(u)du.

      "text" : "As a means of evaluating the overall precision and efficiency of the kernel decomposition framework, experiments with synthetic data from the corresponding four basic kernel types were performed.\nSimulation algorithms related to Hawkes Processes, from which synthetic time sequences data may be obtained, are divided into two main categories: clusterbased [17] and intensity-based [20]. For the proposed experiments, the “Thinning” algorithm, an intensity-based one, was used, mainly because the parametric representations of the kernel types make it very convenient to accurately calculate the value of the intensity function throughout the whole simulation horizon.\nThe referred algorithm, whose full denomination is “Ogata’s Modified Thinning Algorithm”, basically consists of simulating time sequences using a exceedingly high constant value for the intensity function and then thinning out the generated\nevents using rejection sampling with regards to the locally calculated actual values of the intensity.\nFor an automatic decomposition framework willing to perform effective analysis of several domains of data, scale-independence is indispensable, as time sequences of disjoint datasets may occur in time scales differing by several orders of magnitude. As an example, earthquake events’ occurrences in a sequence are spaced by intervals of monthly and yearly scales. Thus, setting a horizon of a few months as the maximum value of τ in Equation (11) might result in a satisfactory discrete estimation grid, but using the same time length for estimating the triggering behavior of a finance-related sequence would require an impractically large grid resolution for making itself effective.\nA histogram of all the time intervals between events in a sequence may be readily generated, and is an indicator of the overall magnitude of the spacing among the events. Thus, as a rule of thumb, the horizon length for τ may be set as the smaller time interval strictly larger than 95% of the sequence’s intervals. In practice, this value of horizon length is obtained with the help of a histogram composed by 100 bins.\nFirst, we generated 10 sequences with the ’Thinning algorithm’ [20], in the time range of 0 to 100000, for each of the four basic kernel types, with predefined kernel parameters and influence horizon of 6.6 5. Then, the decomposition framework was used for building confusion matrices over the sets of sequences for both the original horizon length (i.e., 6.6) and the histogram-based horizon length. The confusion matrices are shown in Table 4.\n5By influence horizon, we mean that the excitation effect of each kernel is considered null for t > 6.6."

This is contrasting with the classical notion of an exogenous flow of information driving the prices towards a fundamental value [3].\nIn this endogeneity scenario, Hawkes Processes have become more and more present in the high-frequency finance domain, due to its structure being naturally adapted to model systems in which the discrete nature of the jumps in Nt is relevant, making the model remarkably suited to modeling high-frequency data [6]. Moreover, Hawkes Processes’ parameters, along with their corresponding straightforward interpretations, lead to a notably simple and flexible interpretation of the complex intra-day dynamics of modern electronic markets.\nFor the experimental setting, we picked 19 technology companies in the NASDAQ and NYSE lists of Google Finance: CSCO, GOOGL, HPQ, INTC, IBM, MSFT, ORCL, TXN, XRX, AAPL, ANGI, LITH, IAC, FB, LOCMQ, YELP, GRPN, AMZN and GCI. We extracted tick data from every two minutes of 30 business days (04/07/2017 to 05/18/2017). Whenever a stock price changed by some magnitude higher than some threshold, an event was logged in the corresponding time sequence. Ten different percentual thresholds, increasing at equally spaced intervals from 0.03% to 0.3%, were applied. This procedure resulted in 70 valid sequences, since the remaining ones did not contain enough points for the splitting between training and validation subsequences.\nThe 80% of the first elements for each sequence were then used as training data, and the remaining 20% were used for validation, i.e., we estimated the parameters of the kernel using the first 24 days and then calculated the log-likelihood on the last 6 days of each sequence. When comparing the log-likelihoods of first and second level decompositions, we observed that the second level, with composite kernels, resulted in a higher log-likelihood in 69 out of the 70 sequences (98.57%), what corroborates\nthe idea of a more flexible model of the kernel providing a more accurate description of the underlying dynamics of the process. Along the 70 sequences, the average value of the log-likelihood of the K1 Decomposition is -2096.95, while, for the K2 Decomposition, it is equal to -1894.61. The average Loglikelihood for each level is shown in Table 5. The percentual difference from each sequence is shown in Figure 8.\nWhen comparing the performance of the best estimation among the two levels and the usual Exponential HP model used in financial analysis, fitted through the gradient-based method from [19], it is possible to see that the Decomposition Algorithm exhibited a much more robust performance. Although the Exponential HP performed well in some sequences, it tended to get stuck in local maxima with very poor performance, usually leading to unstable or negative combinations of parameters. The Decomposition Algorithm performs better in 67.14% (47 out of 70) of the sequences. The comparison for each individual sequence is shown in Figure 7."

On further analyzing these fitted models, one can then identify and decompose components such as evolutionary trend, periodicity and clustering [18].\nAgain, the need to insert scale-independence, in the form of the aforementioned histogram-related heuristics, in the decomposition framework makes itself imperative, as earthquakes events are separated by time intervals of monthly or yearly scales. Thus, the estimation horizon for financial data, for example, lasting usually only a few seconds, would hardly capture the overall aspect of the triggering behavior in this case.\nThe data considered for the experiment was a set of 100 time sequences extracted from the USGS NCSN Catalog (NCEDC database), from the day of 1966/Jan/01 to 2015/Jan/01.

Given a realization (t1, t2, ..., tk) of some regular point process observed over the interval [0,T], the log-likelihood is expressed as:\nl = k∑ i=1 log(λ(ti))− ∫ T 0 λ(u)du\nProof. Let be the joint probability density of the realization:\nL = f(t1, t2, ..., tk) = k∏ i=1 f(ti)\nIt can be written in terms of the Conditional Intensity Function. We can then find f in terms of λ:\nλ(t) = f(t)\n1− F (t) =\ndF (t) dt 1− F (t) = −d log(1− F (t)) dt ,\nwhere, given the history up to last arrival u, H(u), F(t) is then defined as the conditional cumulative probability distribution of the next arrival time Tk+1:\nF (t) = F (t|H(u)) = ∫ t u f(s|H(u))ds\nIntegrating both sides of Equation (19) over (tk, t): − ∫ t tk λ(u)du = log(1− F (t))− log(1− F (tk))\nGiven that the realization is assumed to have come from a so-called simple process, i.e., a process in which multiple arrivals cannot occur at the same time, we have that F (tk) = 0 as Tk+1 > tk, which simplifies equation (19) to:\n− ∫ t tk λ(u)du = log(1− F (t))\nFurther rearranging the expression:\nF (t) = exp ( − ∫ t tk λ(u)du ) ,\nand\nf(t) = λ(t)exp ( − ∫ t tk λ(u)du ) Thus, the likelihood becomes:\nL = k∏ i=1 f(ti) = k∏ i=1 λ(ti)exp ( − ∫ ti ti−1 λ(u)du )\n= [ k∏ i=1 λ(ti) ] exp ( − ∫ tk 0 λ(u)du ) Given that the process is observed on [0,T], the likelihood must include the probability of seeing no arrivals in (tk, T ]:\nL = [ k∏ i=1 f(ti) ] (1− F (T ))\nThrough using the formulation of F(t), we have that:\nL = [ k∏ i=1 λ(ti) ] exp ( − ∫ T 0 λ(u)du ) Finally, getting the logarithm of the expression, we have the formula for l:\nl = k∑ i=1 log(λ(ti))− ∫ T 0 λ(u)du\nC Automatic Report"
