      "text" : "The fundamental challenge of integrated planning and learning is to design an autonomous agent that can plan its actions to maximize its expected total rewards while interacting with an unknown task environment. Recent research efforts tackling this challenge have progressed from the use of simple Markov models assuming discrete-valued, independent observations (e.g., in Bayesian reinforcement learning (BRL) (Poupart et al. 2006)) to that of a rich class of Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian process (GP) models characterizing continuous-valued, correlated observations in order to represent the latent structure of more complex, possibly noisy task environments with higher fidelity. Such a challenge is posed by the following important problems in machine learning, among others: Active learning/sensing (AL). In the context of environmental sensing (e.g., adaptive sampling in oceanography (Leonard et al. 2007), traffic sensing (Chen et al. 2012; Chen, Low, and Tan 2013; Chen et al. 2015)), its objective is to select the most informative (possibly noisy) observations for predicting a spatially varying environmental field (i.e., task environment) modeled by a GP subject to some sampling budget constraints (e.g., number of sensors,\nenergy consumption). The rewards of an AL agent are defined based on some formal measure of predictive uncertainty such as the entropy or mutual information criterion. To resolve the issue of sub-optimality (i.e., local maxima) faced by greedy algorithms (Krause, Singh, and Guestrin 2008; Low et al. 2012; Ouyang et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2016), recent developments have made nonmyopic AL computationally tractable with provable performance guarantees (Cao, Low, and Dolan 2013; Hoang et al. 2014; Low, Dolan, and Khosla 2009; 2008; 2011), some of which have further investigated the performance advantage of adaptivity by proposing nonmyopic adaptive observation selection policies that depend on past observations. Bayesian optimization (BO). Its objective is to select and gather the most informative (possibly noisy) observations for finding the global maximum of an unknown, highly complex (e.g., non-convex, no closed-form expression nor derivative) objective function (i.e., task environment) modeled by a GP given a sampling budget (e.g., number of costly function evaluations). The rewards of a BO agent are defined using an improvement-based (Brochu, Cora, and de Freitas 2010) (e.g., probability of improvement (PI) or expected improvement (EI) over currently found maximum), entropybased (Hennig and Schuler 2012; Hernández-Lobato, Hoffman, and Ghahramani 2014), or upper confidence bound (UCB) acquisition function (Srinivas et al. 2010). A limitation of most BO algorithms is that they are myopic. To overcome this limitation, approximation algorithms for nonmyopic adaptive BO (Marchant, Ramos, and Sanner 2014; Osborne, Garnett, and Roberts 2009) have been proposed, but their performances are not theoretically guaranteed. General tasks/problems. In practice, other types of rewards (e.g., logarithmic, unit step functions) need to be specified for an agent to plan and operate effectively in a given realworld task environment (e.g., natural phenomenon like wind or temperature) modeled by a GP, as detailed in Section 2.\nAs shall be elucidated later, similarities in the structure of the above problems motivate us to consider whether it is possible to tackle the overall challenge by devising a nonmyopic adaptive GP planning framework with a general class of reward functions unifying some AL and BO criteria and affording practitioners some flexibility to specify their desired choices for defining new tasks/problems. Such an integrated planning and learning framework has to address\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n06 89\n0v 1\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n2 1\nN ov\n2 01\nthe exploration-exploitation trade-off common to the above problems: The agent faces a dilemma between gathering observations to maximize its expected total rewards given its current, possibly imprecise belief of the task environment (exploitation) vs. that to improve its belief to learn more about the environment (exploration).\nThis paper presents a novel nonmyopic adaptive Gaussian process planning (GPP) framework endowed with a general class of Lipschitz continuous reward functions that can unify some AL and BO criteria (e.g., UCB) discussed earlier and offer practitioners some flexibility to specify their desired choices for defining new tasks/problems (Section 2). In particular, it utilizes a principled Bayesian sequential decision problem framework for jointly and naturally optimizing the exploration-exploitation trade-off, consequently allowing planning and learning to be integrated seamlessly and performed simultaneously instead of separately (Deisenroth, Fox, and Rasmussen 2015). In general, the resulting induced GPP policy cannot be derived exactly due to an uncountable set of candidate observations. A key contribution of our work here thus lies in exploiting the Lipschitz continuity of the reward functions to solve for a nonmyopic adaptive -optimal GPP ( -GPP) policy given an arbitrarily userspecified loss bound (Section 3). To plan in real time, we further propose an asymptotically optimal, branch-andbound anytime variant of -GPP with performance guarantee. Finally, we empirically evaluate the performances of our -GPP policy and its anytime variant in BO and an energy harvesting task on simulated and real-world environmental fields (Section 4). To ease exposition, the rest of this paper will be described by assuming the task environment to be an environmental field and the agent to be a mobile robot, which coincide with the setup of our experiments."

      "text" : "Notations and Preliminaries. Let S be the domain of an environmental field corresponding to a set of sampling locations. At time step t > 0, a robot can deterministically move from its previous location st−1 to visit location st ∈ A(st−1) and observes it by taking a corresponding realized (random) field measurement zt (Zt) where A(st−1) ⊆ S denotes a finite set of sampling locations reachable from its previous location st−1 in a single time step. The state of the robot at its initial starting location s0 is represented by prior observations/data d0 , 〈s0, z0〉 available before planning where s0 and z0 denote, respectively, vectors comprising locations visited/observed and corresponding field measurements taken by the robot prior to planning and s0 is the last component of s0. Similarly, at time step t > 0, the state of the robot at its current location st is represented by observations/data dt , 〈st, zt〉 where st , s0 ⊕ (s1, · · · st) and zt , z0 ⊕ (z1, · · · zt) denote, respectively, vectors comprising locations visited/observed and corresponding field measurements taken by the robot up until time step t and ‘⊕’ denotes vector concatenation. At time step t > 0, the robot also receives a reward R(zt, st) to be defined later. Modeling Environmental Fields with Gaussian Processes (GPs). The GP can be used to model a spatially varying environmental field as follows: The field is assumed to be a re-\nalization of a GP. Each location s ∈ S is associated with a latent field measurement Ys. Let YS , {Ys}s∈S denote a GP, that is, every finite subset of YS has a multivariate Gaussian distribution (Rasmussen and Williams 2006). Then, the GP is fully specified by its prior mean µs , E[Ys] and covariance kss′ , cov[Ys, Ys′ ] for all s, s′ ∈ S, the latter of which characterizes the spatial correlation structure of the environment field and can be defined using a covariance function. A common choice is the squared exponential covariance function kss′ , σ2y exp{−0.5(s−s′)>M−2(s−s′)}where σ2y is the signal variance controlling the intensity of measurements and M is a diagonal matrix with length-scale components l1 and l2 governing the degree of spatial correlation or “similarity” between measurements in the respective horizontal and vertical directions of the 2D fields in our experiments.\nThe field measurements taken by the robot are assumed to be corrupted by Gaussian white noise, i.e., Zt , Yst + ε where ε ∼ N (0, σ2n) and σ2n is the noise variance. Supposing the robot has gathered observations dt = 〈st, zt〉 from time steps 0 to t, the GP model can perform probabilistic regression by using dt to predict the noisy measurement at any unobserved location st+1 ∈ A(st) as well as provide its predictive uncertainty using a Gaussian predictive distribution p(zt+1|dt, st+1) = N (µst+1|dt , σ2st+1|st) with the following posterior mean and variance, respectively:\nµst+1|dt , µst+1 + Σst+1stΓ −1 stst(zt − µst) > σ2st+1|st , kst+1st+1 + σ 2 n − Σst+1stΓ−1ststΣstst+1\nwhere µst is a row vector with mean components µs for every location s of st, Σst+1st is a row vector with covariance components kst+1s for every location s of st, Σstst+1 is the transpose of Σst+1st , and Γstst , Σstst + σ 2 nI such that Σstst is a covariance matrix with components kss′ for every pair of locations s, s′ of st. An important property of the GP model is that, unlike µst+1|dt , σ 2 st+1|st is independent of zt. Problem Formulation. To frame nonmyopic adaptive Gaussian process planning (GPP) as a Bayesian sequential decision problem, let an adaptive policy π be defined to sequentially decide the next location π(dt) ∈ A(st) to be observed at each time step t using observations dt over a finite planning horizon of H time steps/stages (i.e., sampling budget of H locations). The value V π0 (d0) under an adaptive policy π is defined to be the expected total rewards achieved by its selected observations when starting with some prior observations d0 and following π thereafter and can be computed using the following H-stage Bellman equations:\nV πt (dt) , Q π t (dt, π(dt))\nQπt (dt, st+1) , E[R(Zt+1, st+1) + V πt+1(〈st+1, zt ⊕ Zt+1〉)|dt, st+1]\nfor stages t = 0, . . . ,H − 1 where V πH(dH) , 0. To solve the GPP problem, the notion of Bayes-optimality1 is exploited for selecting observations to achieve the largest\n1Bayes-optimality has been studied in discrete BRL (Poupart et al. 2006) whose assumptions (Section 1) do not hold in GPP. Continuous BRLs (Dallaire et al. 2009; Ross, Chaib-draa, and Pineau 2008) assume a known parametric form of observation function,\npossible expected total rewards with respect to all possible induced sequences of future Gaussian posterior beliefs p(zt+1|dt, st+1) for t = 0, . . . ,H − 1 to be discussed next. Formally, this involves choosing an adaptive policy π to maximize V π0 (d0), which we call the GPP policy π\n∗. That is, V ∗0 (d0) , V π∗ 0 (d0) = maxπ V π 0 (d0). By plugging π ∗ into V πt (dt) and Q π t (dt, st+1) above,\nV ∗t (dt) , maxst+1∈A(st)Q ∗ t (dt, st+1)\nQ∗t (dt, st+1) , E[R(Zt+1, st+1)|dt, st+1] + E[V ∗t+1(〈st+1, zt ⊕ Zt+1〉)|dt, st+1]\n(1)\nfor stages t = 0, . . . ,H − 1 where V ∗H(dH) , 0. To see how the GPP policy π∗ jointly and naturally optimizes the exploration-exploitation trade-off, its selected location π∗(dt) = arg maxst+1∈A(st)Q ∗ t (dt, st+1) at each time step t affects both the immediate expected reward E[R(Zt+1, st ⊕ π∗(dt))|dt, π∗(dt)] given current belief p(zt+1|dt, π∗(dt)) (i.e., exploitation) as well as the Gaussian posterior belief p(zt+2|〈st ⊕ π∗(dt), zt ⊕ zt+1〉, π∗(〈st ⊕ π∗(dt), zt ⊕ zt+1〉)) at next time step t + 1 (i.e., exploration), the latter of which influences expected future rewards E[V ∗t+1(〈st ⊕ π∗(dt), zt ⊕ Zt+1〉)|dt, π∗(dt)].\nIn general, the GPP policy π∗ cannot be derived exactly because the expectation terms in (1) usually cannot be evaluated in closed form due to an uncountable set of candidate measurements (Section 1) except for degenerate cases like R(zt+1, st+1) being independent of zt+1 and H ≤ 2. To overcome this difficulty, we will show in Section 3 later how the Lipschitz continuity of the reward functions can be exploited for theoretically guaranteeing the performance of our proposed nonmyopic adaptive -optimal GPP policy, that is, the expected total rewards achieved by its selected observations closely approximates that of π∗ within an arbitrarily user-specified loss bound > 0. Lipschitz Continuous Reward Functions. R(zt, st) , R1(zt)+R2(zt)+R3(st) whereR1,R2, andR3 are user-defined reward functions that satisfy the conditions below: • R1(zt) is Lipschitz continuous in zt with Lipschitz con-\nstant `1. So, hσ(u) , (R1 ∗ N (0, σ2))(u) is Lipschitz continuous in u with `1 where ‘∗’ denotes convolution; • R2(zt): Define gσ(u) , (R2 ∗ N (0, σ2))(u) such that (a) gσ(u) is well-defined for all u ∈ R, (b) gσ(u) can be evaluated in closed form or computed up to an arbitrary precision in reasonable time for all u ∈ R, and (c) gσ(u) is Lipschitz continuous2 in u with Lipschitz constant `2(σ); • R3(st) only depends on locations st visited/observed by the robot up until time step t and is independent of realized measurement zt. It can be used to represent some sampling or motion costs or explicitly consider exploration by defining it as a function of σ2st+1|st . Using the above definition of R(zt, st), the immediate expected reward in (1) evaluates to E[R(Zt+1, st+1)|dt, st+1]\nthe reward function to be independent of measurements and past states, and/or, when exploiting GP, maximum likelihood observations during planning with no provable performance guarantee.\n2Unlike R1, R2 does not need to be Lipschitz continuous (or continuous); it must only be Lipschitz continuous after convolution with any Gaussian kernel. An example of R2 is unit step function.\n= (hσst+1|st +gσst+1|st ) ( µst+1|dt ) +R3(st+1) which is Lipschitz continuous in the realized measurements zt:\nLemma 1 Let α(st+1) , ‖Σst+1stΓ−1stst‖ and d ′ t , 〈st, z′t〉. Then,|E[R(Zt+1,st+1)|dt,st+1]−E[R(Zt+1,st+1)|d′t,st+1]| ≤ α(st+1) ( `1 + `2(σst+1|st) ) ‖zt − z′t‖ .\nIts proof is in Appendix A. Lemma 1 will be used to prove the Lipschitz continuity of V ∗t in (1) later. Before doing this, let us consider how the Lipschitz continuous reward functions defined above can unify some AL and BO criteria discussed in Section 1 and be used for defining new tasks/problems. Active learning/sensing (AL). Setting R(zt+1, st+1) = R3(st+1) = 0.5 log(2πeσ\n2 st+1|st) yields the well-known\nnonmyopic AL algorithm called maximum entropy sampling (MES) (Shewry and Wynn 1987) which plans/decides locations with maximum entropy to be observed that minimize the posterior entropy remaining in the unobserved areas of the field. Since R(zt+1, st+1) is independent of zt+1, the expectations in (1) go away, thus making MES non-adaptive and hence a straightforward search algorithm not plagued by the issue of uncountable set of candidate measurements. As such, we will not focus on such a degenerate case. This degeneracy vanishes when the environment field is instead a realization of log-Gaussian process. Then, MES becomes adaptive (Low, Dolan, and Khosla 2009) and its reward function can be represented by our Lipschitz continuous reward functions: By setting R1(zt+1) = 0, R2 and gσst+1|st as identity functions with `2(σst+1|st) = 1, and R3(st+1) = 0.5 log(2πeσ2st+1|st), E[R(Zt+1, st+1)|dt, st+1] = µst+1|dt + 0.5 log(2πeσ 2 st+1|st). Bayesian optimization (BO). The greedy BO algorithm of Srinivas et al. (2010) utilizes the UCB selection criterion µst+1|dt + βσst+1|st (β ≥ 0) to approximately optimize the global BO objective of total field measurements∑H t=1 zt taken by the robot or, equivalently, minimize its total regret. UCB can be represented by our Lipschitz continuous reward functions: By setting R1(zt+1) = 0, R2 and gσst+1|st as identity functions with `2(σst+1|st) = 1, and R3(st+1) = βσst+1|st , E[R(Zt+1, st+1)|dt, st+1] = µst+1|dt + βσst+1|st . In particular, when β = 0, it can be derived that our GPP policy π∗ maximizes the expected total field measurements taken by the robot, hence optimizing the exact global BO objective of Srinivas et al. (2010) in the expected sense. So, unlike greedy UCB, our nonmyopic GPP framework does not have to explicitly consider an additional weighted exploration term (i.e., βσst+1|st ) in its reward function because it can jointly and naturally optimize the exploration-exploitation trade-off, as explained earlier. Nevertheless, if a stronger exploration behavior is desired (e.g., in online planning), then β has to be fine-tuned. Different from nonmyopic BO algorithm of Marchant, Ramos, and Sanner (2014) using UCB-based rewards, our proposed nonmyopic -optimal GPP policy (Section 3) does not need to impose an extreme assumption of maximum likelihood observations during planning and, more importantly, provides a performance guarantee, including for the extreme\nassumption made by nonmyopic UCB. Our GPP framework differs from nonmyopic BO algorithm of Osborne, Garnett, and Roberts (2009) in that every selected observation contributes to the total field measurements taken by the robot instead of considering just the expected improvement for the last observation. So, it usually does not have to expend all the given sampling budget to find the global maximum. General tasks/problems. In practice, the necessary reward function can be more complex than the ones specified above that are formed from an identity function of the field measurement. For example, consider the problem of placing wind turbines in optimal locations to maximize the total power production. Though the average wind speed in a region can be modeled by a GP, the power output is not a linear function of the steady-state wind speed. In fact, power production requires a certain minimum speed known as the cutin speed. After this threshold is met, power output increases and eventually plateaus. Assuming the cut-in speed is 1, this effect can be modeled with a logarithmic reward function3: R(zt+1, st+1) = R1(zt+1) gives a value of log(zt+1) if zt+1 > 1, and 0 otherwise where `1 = 1. To the best of our knowledge, hσst+1|st (u) has no closed-form expression. In Appendix B, we present other interesting reward functions like unit step function2 and Gaussian distribution that can be represented by R(zt+1, st+1) and used in real-world tasks.\nTheorem 1 below reveals that V ∗t (dt) (1) with Lipschitz continuous reward functions is Lipschitz continuous in zt with Lipschitz constant Lt(st) defined below: Definition 1 Let LH(sH) , 0. For t = 0, . . . ,H − 1, define Lt(st) , maxst+1∈A(st) α(st+1) ( `1 + `2(σst+1|st) ) +\nLt+1(st+1) √ 1 + α(st+1)2 .

The result below is a direct consequence of Theorem 1 and will be used to theoretically guarantee the performance of our proposed nonmyopic adaptive -optimal GPP policy in Section 3: Corollary 1 For t = 0, . . . ,H , |V ∗t (〈st, zt−1 ⊕ zt〉) − V ∗t (〈st, zt−1 ⊕ z′t〉)| ≤ Lt(st)|zt − z′t|."

      "text" : "The key idea of constructing our proposed nonmyopic adaptive -GPP policy is to approximate the expectation terms in (1) at every stage using a form of deterministic sampling, as illustrated in the figure below. Specifically, the measurement space of p(zt+1|dt, st+1) is first partitioned into n ≥ 2 intervals ζ0, . . . , ζn−1 such that intervals ζ1, . . . , ζn−2 are equally spaced within the bounded gray region [µst+1|dt − τσst+1|st , µst+1|dt + τσst+1|st ] specified by a user-defined width parameter τ ≥ 0 while intervals ζ0 and ζn−1 span the two infinitely long red tails. Note that τ > 0 requires n > 2 for the partition to be valid. The n sample measurements z0 . . . zn−1 are then selected by setting z0 as upper limit of red interval ζ0, zn−1 as lower limit of red interval ζn−1, and z1, . . . , zn−2 as centers of the respective gray intervals\n3In reality, the speed-power relationship is not exactly logarithmic, but this approximation suffices for the purpose of modeling.\np(zt+1|dt, st+1)\nz0 , µst+1|dt−τσst+1|st ; zn−1 , µst+1|dt+τσst+1|st ;\nzi,z0+i−0.5n−2 (z n−1−z0)\nfor i = 1, . . . , n− 2.\nwi,Φ( 2iτn−2−τ)−Φ( 2(i−1)τ n−2 −τ) for i = 1, . . . , n− 2; w0 = wn−1 , Φ(−τ).\nz0\nw0\nz1\nw1\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\nzi-1\nwi-1\nzi\nwi\nzi+1\nwi+1\nzn-1\nwn-1\nzn-2\nwn-2\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\n. . .\nzt+1\nζ1 ζi-1 ζi ζi+1 ζn-2ζ0 ζn-1\nζ1, . . . , ζn−2.

So,∑n−1 i=0 w\ni = 1. An example of such a partition is given in Appendix D. The selected sample measurements and their corresponding weights can be exploited for approximating V ∗t with Lipschitz continuous reward functions (1) using the following H-stage Bellman equations:\nV t (dt) , maxst+1∈A(st)Q t(dt, st+1) Q t(dt, st+1) , gσst+1|st ( µst+1|dt ) +R3(st+1) +\nn−1∑ i=0 wi ( R1(z i) + V t+1(〈st+1, zt ⊕ zi〉) )(2)\nfor stages t = 0, . . . ,H− 1 where V H(dH) , 0. The resulting induced -GPP policy π jointly and naturally optimizes the exploration-exploitation trade-off in a similar manner as that of the GPP policy π∗, as explained in Section 2. It is interesting to note that setting τ = 0 yields z0 = . . . = zn−1 = µst+1|dt , which is equivalent to selecting a single sample measurement of µst+1|dt with corresponding weight of 1. This is identical to the special case of maximum likelihood observations during planning which is the extreme assumption used by nonmyopic UCB (Marchant, Ramos, and Sanner 2014) for sampling to gain time efficiency. Performance Guarantee. The difficulty in theoretically guaranteeing the performance of our -GPP policy π (i.e., relative to that of GPP policy π∗) lies in analyzing how the values of the width parameter τ and deterministic sampling size n can be chosen to satisfy the user-specified loss bound , as discussed below. The first step is to prove that V t in (2) approximates V ∗t in (1) closely for some chosen τ and n values, which relies on the Lipschitz continuity of V ∗t in Corollary 1. Define Λ(n, τ) to be equal to the value of √ 2/π if n ≥ 2∧τ = 0, and value of κ(τ)+η(n, τ) if n > 2∧τ > 0 where κ(τ) , √ 2/π exp(−0.5τ2) − 2τΦ(−τ), η(n, τ) , 2τ(0.5−Φ(−τ))/(n− 2), and Φ is a standard normal CDF. Theorem 2 Suppose that λ > 0 is given. For all dt and t = 0, . . . ,H , if\nλ ≥ Λ(n, τ)σst+1|st(`1 + Lt+1(st+1)) (3) for all st+1 ∈ A(st), then |V t (dt)− V ∗t (dt)| ≤ λ(H − t) . Its proof uses Corollary 1 and is given in Appendix E. Remark 1. From Theorem 2, a tighter bound on the error |V t (dt) − V ∗t (dt)| can be achieved by decreasing the sam-\npling budget of H locations4 and increasing the deterministic sampling size n; increasing n reduces η(n, τ) and hence Λ(n, τ), which allows λ to be reduced as well. The width parameter τ has a mixed effect on this error bound: Note that κ(τ) (η(n, τ)) is proportional to some upper bound on the error incurred by the extreme sample measurements z0 and zn−1 (z1, . . . , zn−2), as shown in Appendix E. Increasing τ reduces κ(τ) but unfortunately raises η(n, τ). So, in order to reduce Λ(n, τ) further by increasing τ , it has to be complemented by raising n fast enough to keep η(n, τ) from increasing. This allows λ to be reduced further as well. Remark 2. A feasible choice of τ and n satisfying (3) can be expressed analytically in terms of the given λ and hence computed prior to planning, as shown in Appendix F. Remark 3. σst+1|st and Lt+1(st+1) for all st+1 and t = 0, . . . ,H − 1 can be computed prior to planning as they depend on s0 and all reachable locations from s0 but not on their measurements.\nUsing Theorem 2, the next step is to bound the performance loss of our -GPP policy π relative to that of GPP policy π∗, that is, policy π is -optimal:\nTheorem 3 Given the user-specified loss bound > 0, V ∗0 (d0) − V π\n0 (d0) ≤ by substituting λ = /(H(H + 1)) into the choice of τ and n stated in Remark 2 above.\nIts proof is in Appendix G. It can be observed from Theorem 3 that a tighter bound on the error V ∗0 (d0)− V π\n0 (d0) can be achieved by decreasing the sampling budget of H locations4 and increasing the deterministic sampling size n. The effect of width parameter τ on this error bound is the same as that on the error bound of |V t (dt) − V ∗t (dt)|, as explained in Remark 1 above. Anytime -GPP. Unlike GPP policy π∗, our -GPP policy π can be derived exactly since its incurred time is independent of the size of the uncountable set of candidate measurements. However, expanding the entire search tree of -GPP (2) incurs time containing a O(nH) term and is not always necessary to achieve -optimality in practice. To mitigate this computational difficulty5, we propose an anytime variant of -GPP that can produce a good policy fast and improve its approximation quality over time, as briefly discussed here and detailed with the pseudocode in Appendix H.\nThe key intuition is to expand the sub-trees rooted at “promising” nodes with the highest weighted uncertainty of their corresponding values V ∗t (dt) so as to improve their estimates. To represent such uncertainty at each encountered node, upper & lower heuristic bounds (respectively, V ∗ t (dt) and V ∗t (dt)) are maintained, like in (Smith and Simmons 2006). A partial construction of the entire tree is maintained and expanded incrementally in each iteration of anytime - GPP that incurs linear time in n and comprises 3 steps: Node selection. Traverse down the partially constructed tree by repeatedly selecting nodes with largest difference between their upper and lower bounds (i.e., uncertainty) discounted by weightwi ∗ of its preceding sample measurement\n4This changes -GPP by reducing its planning horizon though. 5The value of n is a bigger computational issue than that of H\nwhen is small and in online planning.\nzi ∗\nuntil an unexpanded node, denoted by dt, is reached. Expand tree. Construct a “minimal” sub-tree rooted at node dt by sampling all possible next locations and only their median sample measurements z ī recursively up to full heightH. Backpropagation. Backpropagate bounds from the leaves of the newly constructed sub-tree to node dt, during which the refined bounds of expanded nodes are used to inform the bounds of unexpanded siblings by exploiting the Lipschitz continuity of V ∗t (Corollary 1), as explained in Appendix H. Backpropagate bounds to the root of the partially constructed tree in a similar manner.\nBy using the lower heuristic bound to produce our anytime -GPP policy, its performance loss relative to that of GPP policy π∗ can be bounded, as proven in Appendix H."

Each simulated (real-world lg-K) field is spatially distributed over a 0.95 km by 0.95 km (520 m by 440 m) region discretized into a 20 × 20 (14 × 12) grid of sampling locations.

It can move to any of its 4 adjacent grid locations at each time step and is tasked to maximize its total rewards over 20 time steps (i.e., sampling budget of 20 locations).\nIn BO, the performances of our -GPP policy π and its anytime variant are compared with that of state-of-the-art nonmyopic UCB (Marchant, Ramos, and Sanner 2014) and greedy PI, EI, UCB (Brochu, Cora, and de Freitas 2010; Srinivas et al. 2010). Three performance metrics are used: (a) Total rewards achieved over the evolved time steps (i.e., higher total rewards imply less total regret in BO (Section 2)), (b) maximum reward achieved during experiment, and (c) search tree size in terms of no. of nodes (i.e., larger tree size implies higher incurred time). All experiments are run on a Linux machine with Intel Core i5 at 1.7 GHz. Energy Harvesting Task on Simulated Wind Speed Field. A robotic rover equipped with a wind turbine is tasked to harvest energy/power from the wind while exploring a polar region (Chen et al. 2014). It is driven by the logarithmic reward function described under ‘General tasks/problems’ in Section 2. Fig. 1 shows results of performances of our -GPP policy and its anytime variant averaged over 30 independent realizations of the wind speed field. It can be observed\n6Its actual prior mean is not zero; we have applied zero-mean GP to Ys − µs for simplicity.\nvs. no. of time steps for energy harvesting task. The plot of ∗ = 5 uses our anytime variant with a maximum tree size of 5× 104 nodes while the plot of = 250 effectively assumes maximum likelihood observations during planning like that of nonmyopic UCB (Marchant, Ramos, and Sanner 2014).\nthat the gradients of the achieved total rewards (i.e., power production) increase over time, which indicate a higher obtained reward with an increasing number of time steps as the robot can exploit the environment more effectively with the aid of exploration from previous time steps. The gradients eventually stop increasing when the robot enters a perceived high-reward region. Further exploration is deemed unnecessary as it is unlikely to find another preferable location within H ′ time steps; so, the robot remains near-stationary for the remaining time steps. It can also be observed that the incurred time is much higher in the first few time steps. This is expected because the posterior variance σst+1|st decreases with increasing time step t, thus requiring a decreasing deterministic sampling size n to satisfy (3).\nInitially, all -GPP policies achieve similar total rewards as the robots begin from the same starting location. After some time, -GPP policies with lower user-specified loss bound and longer online planning horizonH ′ achieve considerably higher total rewards at the cost of more incurred time. In particular, it can be observed that a robot assuming maximum likelihood observations during planning (i.e., = 250) like that of nonmyopic UCB or using a greedy policy (i.e., H ′ = 1) performs poorly very quickly. In the former case (Fig. 1a), the gradient of its total rewards stops increasing quite early (i.e., from time step 9 onwards), which indicates that its perceived local maximum is reached prematurely. Interestingly, it can be observed from Fig. 1d that the -GPP policy with H ′ = 2 and = 0.06 incurs more time than that with H ′ = 3 and = 0.8 despite the latter achieving higher total rewards. This suggests trading off tighter loss bound for longer online planning horizon H ′, especially when is too small that in turn requires a very large n and consequently incurs significantly more time5."

      "text" : "An agricultural robot is tasked to find the peak lg-K measurement (i.e., possibly in an over-fertilized area) while exploring the Broom’s Barn farm (Webster and Oliver 2007). It is driven by the UCB-based reward function described under ‘BO’ in Section 2. Fig. 2 shows results of performances of our -GPP policy and its anytime variant, nonmyopic UCB (i.e., = 25), and greedy PI, EI, UCB (i.e., H ′ = 1) aver-\naged over 25 randomly selected robot’s initial starting location. It can be observed from Figs. 2a and 2b that the gradients of the achieved total normalized7 rewards generally increase over time. In particular, from Fig. 2a, nonmyopic UCB assuming maximum likelihood observations during planning obtains much less total rewards than the other - GPP policies and the anytime variant after 20 time steps and finds a maximum lg-K measurement of 3.62 that is at least 0.4σy worse after 20 time steps. The performance of the anytime variant is comparable to that of our best-performing - GPP policy with = 3. From Fig. 2b, the greedy policy (i.e., H ′ = 1) with β = 0 performs much more poorly than its nonmyopic -GPP counterparts and finds a maximum lg-K measurement of 3.56 that is lower than that of greedy PI and EI due to its lack of exploration. By increasing H ′ to 2-4, our -GPP policies with β = 0 outperform greedy PI and EI as they can naturally and jointly optimize the explorationexploitation trade-off. Interestingly, Fig. 2c shows that our -GPP policy with β = 2 achieves the highest total rewards after 20 time steps, which indicates the need of a slightly stronger exploration behavior than that with β = 0. This may be explained by a small length-scale (i.e., spatial correlation) of the lg-K field, thus requiring some exploration to find the peak measurement. By increasing H ′ beyond 4 or with larger spatial correlation (Appendix J), we expect a diminishing role of the βσst+1|st term. It can also be observed that aggressive exploration (i.e., β ≥ 10) hurts the performance. Results of the tree size (i.e., incurred time) of our -GPP policy and its anytime variant are in Appendix I.\nDue to lack of space, we present additional experimental results for BO on simulated plankton density field in Appendix J that yield similar observations to the above."

It is driven by the UCB-based reward function described under ‘Bayesian optimization’ in Section 2.\nFig. 6 shows results of performances of our -GPP policy and its anytime variant, nonmyopic UCB (i.e., = 250), and greedy PI, EI, UCB (i.e., H ′ = 1) averaged over 30 independent realizations of the chl-a field. Similar to that of the energy harvesting task, the gradients of their achieved total rewards increase over time. In particular, it can be observed from Fig. 6a that nonmyopic UCB assuming maximum likelihood observations during planning obtains much less total rewards than the other -GPP policies and the anytime variant and finds a maximum chl-a measurement of 1.25 that is at least 0.26σy worse after 20 time steps. The anytime variant performs reasonably well, albeit slightly worse than our -GPP policy with = 25.0. From\nFig. 6b, the greedy policy (i.e., H ′ = 1) performs much more poorly than its nonmyopic counterparts and finds a maximum chl-a measurement of 1.28 that is at least 0.22σy worse after 20 time steps. Such a greedy policy with β = 0 is also worse than greedy PI and EI due to its lack of exploration. However, by increasing H ′ to 3 or 4, our -GPP policies with β = 0 outperform greedy PI and EI as they can naturally and jointly optimize the exploration-exploitation trade-off. To see this, Figs. 6c to 6f reveal that the weighted exploration term βσst+1|st in the UCB-based reward function becomes redundant when H\n′ ≥ 3; in fact, such nonmyopic -GPP policies with β = 0 achieve the highest total rewards among all -GPP policies withH ′ = 1, 2, 3, 4 and β = 0, 1, 10, 20 and their performances degrade with stronger exploration behavior (i.e., β > 0). Results of the tree size (i.e., incurred time) of our -GPP policy and its anytime variant are similar to that of the energy harvesting task and shown in Fig. 7."

Nevertheless, if a stronger exploration behavior is desired (e.g., in online planning), then β has to be fine-tuned. Different from nonmyopic BO algorithm of Marchant, Ramos, and Sanner (2014) using UCB-based rewards, our proposed nonmyopic -optimal GPP policy (Section 3) does not need to impose an extreme assumption of maximum likelihood observations during planning and, more importantly, provides a performance guarantee, including for the extreme",

In particular, it utilizes a principled Bayesian sequential decision problem framework for jointly and naturally optimizing the exploration-exploitation trade-off. In general, the resulting induced GPP policy cannot be derived exactly due to an uncountable set of candidate observations. A key contribution of our work here thus lies in exploiting the Lipschitz continuity of the reward functions to solve for a nonmyopic adaptive -optimal GPP ( -GPP) policy. To plan in real time, we further propose an asymptotically optimal, branch-and-bound anytime variant of -GPP with performance guarantee. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our -GPP policy and its anytime variant in Bayesian optimization and an energy harvesting task.",
