For instance, a facial image ensemble affected by multiple conditions can be represented as a higher order tensor with dimensionality of pixel×person×pose×illumination. To model such data, tensor factorization has shown significant advantages in terms of capturing multiple interactions among a set of latent factors. Therefore its theory and algorithms have been an active area of study within the past decade, see e.g. [1], [2], and have been successfully applied to various fields of applications such as face recognition, social network analysis, image and video completion, and brain signal processing [3], [4], [5], [6]. The two most popular tensor factorization frameworks are Tucker [7] and CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) [1], also known as canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) [8], which naturally results in two different definitions of tensor\n• Q.

When original data is only partially observed, tensor factorization can be applied for imputing the missing entries, known as tensor completion. CP factorization with missing values has been developed by employing CP weighted optimization (CPWOPT) [9] and nonlinear least squares (CPNLS) [10]. To naturally deal with missing data, the probabilistic framework for tensor factorization was exploited [3], [11], which has been extended to exponential family model [12] and nonparametric Bayesian model [13]. The main limitation of the existing tensor factorization scheme is that the tensor rank has to be specified manually, which tends to under- or over-fit the observations, resulting in severe deterioration of predictive performance. It is important to emphasize that our knowledge about the properties of tensor rank, especially CP rank, is surprisingly limited [14]. There is no straightforward algorithm to compute CP rank of an explicitly given tensor, and the problem has been shown to be NP-hard [15], [16]. In fact, determining or even bounding the tensor rank is quite difficult in contrast to matrix rank [17], [18]. In [19], ARD framework was applied to estimate the multilinear rank. However, the solution is based on MAP point estimation and is not applicable to incomplete tensor data.\nThe convex optimization of nuclear norm has gained considerable attention in matrix completion, which essentially seeks the minimum rank under the condition of limited observations. Since multilinear rank of a tensor is defined as the rank of its mode-n matricizations, it can be optimized by simply applying nuclear norm based framework, yielding an extension\nar X\niv :1\n41 0.\n23 86\nv1 [\ncs .C\nV ]\n9 O\nct 2\n01 4\n2 to tensor completion [20], which thus attracted many studies on low multilinear rank approximations [21], [22], [23]. In addition, the auxiliary information can be exploited to improve completion accuracy [6], [24], which, however, is only suitable to some specific applications. It is worth noting that the convex optimization of nuclear norm requires several tuning parameters, which is prone to over- or under-estimate the tensor rank. In addition, since CP rank, the standard definition of tensor rank, cannot be optimized by applying matrix techniques straightforwardly, its determination still remains challenging so far.\nOn the other hand, non-Gaussian noises or outliers may occur frequently in image and video data. To handle this problem, many robust techniques have been developed such as robust PCA [25], [26], [27], [28] and robust matrix factorization [29], [30], [31], [32], [33]. For robust tensor factorization, 2DSVD using R1-norm as the objective function was proposed by Huang et al. [34] and robust Tucker decompositions were studied in [35], [36]. To handle both missing data and outliers, the nuclear norm regularization has been combined with L1-norm loss function, which leads to a robust tensor completion [37]. However, the main limitation of above mentioned approaches is that the performance is quite sensitive to tuning parameters whose optimal selection is unrealistic or prohibitively expensive. For example, the parameter balancing model capacity between a low-rank term and a sparse term is generally tuned by performance evaluated on the groundtruth of missing data that is unknown in practice, implying that most existing approaches are impractical to obtain the optimal results. Therefore, it is great appeal for an automatic model and parameter selection only based on observed data, which can achieve an optimal predictive performance. Another limitation of existing robust tensor factorizations is that optimizations of latent factors are mainly based on point estimation, which is prone to overfitting especially when a large amount of missing data is present and not able to provide uncertainty information of predictions.\nTo address all these issues under a unified framework, we propose a probabilistic model with aim to recover the underlying low-rank tensor, modeled by multiplicative interactions among multiple groups of latent factors, and an additive sparse tensor modeling outliers, from partially observed data represented by a tensor of any order. More specifically, for the low-rank term, we specify a hierarchical sparsity-inducing prior shared by multiple groups of latent factors, which gains a column sparsity along the latent components, resulting in an automatic determination of CP rank. For the sparse term, a hierarchical view of Student-t prior is placed independently on each element associated with an individual hyperparameter. The toplevel hyperparameters can be learned by maximizing a lower-bound of the model evidence, resulting\nin that the sparsity constraint can be automatically adapted to varying fractions of outliers. To learn the model under a fully Bayesian framework, we derive a variational Bayesian algorithm for closedform posterior inference, which is of high efficiency. Our method can be used for robust tensor factorization, robust tensor completion and anomaly detection with a significant advantage of automatic model and parameter selections without requiring any tuning parameters. Empirical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of predictive performance and robustness to outliers, even though the groundtruth is allowed to be used to tune the parameters in competing methods.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the related work. Section 3 introduces preliminary multilinear operations and notations. Section 4 presents model specification and approximate Bayesian inference for robust tensor factorization, whose advantages are summarized in Section 5. Section 6 shows extensive experimental results, followed by the conclusion in Section 7."

      "text" : "Our work is somewhat related to probabilistic approaches for robust PCA [38], [39] and for robust matrix factorization [40], [41], [42]. In [38], Beta-Bernoulli distribution is exploited to model outliers and the low-rank matrix exclusively, which, however, results in high model complexity and slow inference. Missing values are considered in [39], where the number of latent components needs to be specified in advance. In [42], Jeffreys prior is adopted to model both noise and outliers. However, it cannot handle missing values. PRMF [40] uses Laplace distribution to model the residuals, while the rank of the underlying model should be given in advance. A fully Bayesian treatment of PRMF [41] employs a hierarchical view of Laplace distribution as the noise model, and applies MCMC sampling for model inference. However, the rank also needs to be tuned manually and missing values are not considered. Finally, all these matrix based approaches cannot handle interactions of multiple factors, which is crucial for higher-order tensors.\nHigher-order robust PCA (HORPCA), proposed very recently in [37], is the only existing tensor method that can handle both missing data and outliers. It formulates the problem by a convex optimization framework in which nuclear norm and L1-norm are exploited as regularization terms on the low-rank tensor and residual errors, respectively. However, it essentially optimizes the multilinear rank and the predictive performance is sensitive to tuning parameters. To our best knowledge, our paper is the first to present a fully Bayesian model for robust tensor factorization dealing with both missing data and outliers within one framework.\n3"

      "text" : "Let Y be an incomplete N th-order tensor of size I1×I2×· · ·×IN with missing entries. YΩ denotes the observed entries {Yi1i2...iN |(i1, i2, · · · , iN ) ∈ Ω} where\nΩ denotes a set of indices. We also define an indicator tensor O, whose entry Oi1i2···iN is equal to 1 if (i1, i2, · · · , iN ) ∈ Ω, otherwise is equal to 0. We assume Y is a noisy measurement of the true latent tensor X , and is corrupted by outliers S, i.e., Y = X + S + ε, where X is generated by tensor factorization with a low-CP-rank, representing the global information, S is enforced to be sparse, representing the local information, and ε is isotropic Gaussian noise (see Fig. 1).\nThe standard CP factorization [1] is expressed by\nX = R∑ r=1 a (1) ·r ◦ · · · ◦ a(N)·r = [[A(1), . . . ,A(N)]], (5)\nwhere ◦ denotes the outer product of vectors and [[· · · ]] is a shorthand notation of CP factorization. {A(n)|n = 1, . . . , N} are latent factor matrices corresponding to each of N modes, respectively. CP model can be interpreted as a sum of R rank-one tensors, which is related to the definition of CP rank that is the smallest integer R for which the above representation holds. The mode-n factor matrix of size In×R can be denoted by row-wise or column-wise vectors, that is,\nA(n) = [ a\n(n) 1 , . . . ,a (n) In\n]T = [ a\n(n) ·1 , . . . ,a (n) ·R\n] .\nTo formulate robust CP factorization under the probabilistic framework, a generative model is introduced based on model assumptions. Specifically, the observation model is expressed by\np ( YΩ ∣∣∣{A(n)}Nn=1,SΩ, τ) = I1∏\ni1=1 · · · IN∏ iN=1\nN ( Yi1...iN ∣∣∣〈a(1)i1 , · · · ,a(N)iN 〉+ Si1...iN , τ−1)Oi1···iN , (6)\nwhere τ denotes the noise precision, a(n)in denotes the inth row vector of A(n), and S only has values corresponding to observed locations. The likelihood model in (6) indicates that Yi1···iN is generated by multiple R-dimensional latent vectors { a\n(n) in ∣∣∣n = 1, . . . , N}, whereas each a(n)in affects a set of observations, i.e., a subtensor whose mode-n index is in. The essential difference between matrix factorization and tensor factorization is that the generalized inner product of N(≥ 3) latent vectors allows us to capture multilinear interactions reflecting the intrinsic structural property of data, which however leads to much more difficulties in model learning.\nIn practice, CP rank, i.e., the dimensionality of latent space denoted by R, is unknown and considered as a tuning parameter whose optimal selection is quite challenging especially in the presence of missing data. Since R controls the model complexity, we actually seek an automatic model selection strategy that can infer the true CP rank from partially observed data. To achieve this, in contrast to rank minimization on X ,\n4 we attempt to minimize the dimensionality of latent space, which corresponds to column-wise sparsity of factor matrices. Hence, we employ a sparsity inducing prior over factor matrices by associating an individual hyperparameter to each latent dimension. More specifically, a hierarchical prior is equally specified over N factor matrices, which is expressed by\np ( A(n) ∣∣λ) = In∏ in=1 N ( a (n) in ∣∣0,Λ−1), ∀n ∈ [1, N ] p(λ) =\nR∏ r=1 Ga(λr|c0, d0), (7)\nwhere Λ = diag(λ) denotes an inverse covariance matrix and is shared by latent factor matrices in all modes. The hyperprior over λ is an i.i.d. Gamma distribution Ga(x|a, b) = baxa−1e−bxΓ(a) where Γ(a) is the Gamma function.\nDue to the sparsity property, the initialization of R is usually set to its maximum possible value, while the effective dimensionality can be inferred automatically under Bayesian inference framework. For instance, if a particular λr has a posterior distribution concentrated at large values, { a (n) r |∀n ∈ [1, N ]} will tend to be zero. Since the priors are shared by N factor matrices, our framework can learn the same sparsity pattern for all factor matrices, yielding the minimum number of rank-one tensors.\nThe sparse term S is modeled also by a hierarchical sparsity inducing prior. More specifically, Gaussian priors are placed on each data entry associated with an individual precision hyperparameter on which an i.i.d. Gamma hyperprior is placed, that is\np(SΩ|γ) = ∏\ni1,...,iN\nN (Si1...iN |0, γ−1i1...iN ) Oi1...iN ,\np(γ) = ∏\ni1,...,iN\nGa(γi1...iN |aγ0 , bγ0). (8)\nNote that when an individual parameter γi1...iN goes to infinity, the corresponding element in S is enforced to be exact zero.\nThe priors in (7) and (8) are related to the framework of sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) [43] which is usually employed for variable selections. Since Laplacian and Student-t distributions are commonly applied to enforcing sparsity, we may question why the choice of a Gaussian prior should express any preference for sparsity. In fact, (8) can be interpreted as an infinite zero-mean Gaussian mixture with mixture coefficients drawn from a Gamma distribution, which is thus a hierarchical view of Student-t distribution. In other words, the marginal prior of SΩ is an i.i.d. Student-t distribution with the sparsity controlled by (aγ0 , b γ 0) to some extent. For the case of noninformative hyperprior with aγ0 = b γ 0 = 0, we obtain the improper marginal prior p(Si1...iN ) ∝ 1/|Si1...iN |. Note that if aγ0 = 1, the hyperprior becomes an exponential\nYΩ\nA(1) A(n) A(N)SΩ τ· · · · · ·\nλγ\nc0 d0a0 γ b0\nγ\naτ0 b τ 0\nFig. 2.

The elegance of this strategy therefore lies in the use of hierarchical modeling to obtain a prior which encourages sparsity while keeping fully conjugate exponential-family distributions throughout, which leads to the possibility of the fully Bayesian treatment. Although our setting is related to SBL, the crucial difference lies in that our model specification can achieve column-wise sparsity, and the statistical property is shared by a set of factor matrices {A(n)}Nn=1.\nTo complete the model, we also place a hyperprior over the noise precision τ , that is\np(τ) = Ga(τ |aτ0 , bτ0). (9) Finally, the probabilistic graphical model of robust tensor factorization is illustrated in Fig. 2. For simplicity of notations, all unknowns including both latent factor matrices and hyperparameters are collected and denoted together by Θ = {A(1), . . . ,A(N),λ,SΩ,γ, τ}. Therefore, the joint distribution of the model, i.e., p(YΩ,Θ), can be expressed by p ( YΩ ∣∣∣{A(n)}Nn=1,SΩ, τ) N∏\nn=1\np ( A(n) ∣∣λ)p(SΩ|γ)p(λ)p(γ)p(τ). In general, we can simply perform MAP estima-\ntion of Θ from the log-joint distribution (see Sec. 1 of Appendix) and most existing tensor factorization based on optimization approaches can be interpreted as point estimation by either maximum likelihood or MAP principles. However, in this study, we aim to provide a fully Bayesian treatment of the model by inferring the posterior distribution of Θ, expressed by p(Θ|YΩ) = p(Θ,YΩ)∫ p(Θ,YΩ) dΘ . Thus the predictive distribution over missing entries Y\\Ω can be also inferred by p(Y\\Ω|YΩ) = ∫ p(Y\\Ω|Θ)p(Θ|YΩ) dΘ."

Hence, we employ VB inference to learn our model and present only the main results, while the detailed derivations and proofs are provided in Appendix.\nWe therefore seek a distribution q(Θ) to approximate the true posterior distribution p(Θ|YΩ) in the sense of minimizing the KL divergence, that is\nKL ( q(Θ) ∣∣∣∣p(Θ|YΩ)) = ln p(YΩ)− L(q), where L(q) = ∫ q(Θ) ln { p(YΩ,Θ) q(Θ) } dΘ.

Furthermore, the most elegant characteristic is that the tradeoff between the low-rank approximation and the sparse representation can be learned automatically in the sense of maximizing the model evidence. • In contrast to point estimations by most existing tensor methods, the uncertainty information over all model parameters are taken into account, which can effectively prevent overfitting problem. The full posteriors of factor matrices and predicted missing entries can provide confidence information regarding the solutions. • An efficient and deterministic algorithm for Bayesian inference is developed, which empirically shows a fast convergence and its computational complexity scales linearly with the data size."

      "text" : "We firstly assess the performance quantitatively on synthetic data. The true low-rank tensor X of size 30 × 30 × 30 was generated by rank-3 factor matrices, i.e., A(n) ∈ R30×3, n = 1, 2, 3. Three components of the nth factor matrix are [sin(2π n30 in), cos(2π n 30 in), sgn(sin(0.5πin))], indicating that the first two components possess different frequencies related to n, and the third components are common in all modes. A random fraction of tensor entries were corrupted by outliers drawn from an uniform distribution U(−|H|, |H|). To mimic more realistic settings, a small noise drawn from N (0, 0.01) was also considered. Subsequently, a fraction of entries were randomly selected to be observed tensor YΩ, when missing data was considered. We utilized the root relative square error (RRSE), defined by ‖X̂−X‖2‖X‖2 , to evaluate the performance of tensor recovery. As for recovering the underlying factors, factor match error\n9\n(FME) [10] between the estimated factors and groundtruth was also evaluated. We compared our Bayesian robust tensor factorization (BRTF) with state-of-the-art methods including tensor factorization (CP-ALS [1], HOSVD [7], CP-ARD [19]), tensor factorization with missing data (CPWOPT [9] and CPNLS [10]), and robust tensor factorization with missing data (HORPCA [37]). It should be emphasized that the tuning parameters are necessary for most methods and have been carefully tuned based on ground-truth data, which is generally impractical for real applications. Specifically, CP-ALS, HOSVD, CPWOPT, CPNLS need to tune the parameter of tensor rank, and HORPCA needs to tune the penalty parameter. By contrast, BRTF and CP-ARD can automatically estimate tensor rank and do not require any tuning parameters. Two scenarios were considered: 1) tensor recovery from fully observed data, and 2) tensor completion from partially observed data.\nThe results for fully observed tensor are shown in Fig. 3. Rank R was initialized as maxn In for BRTF and CP-ARD. Observe that CPALS, CP-ARD and\nHOSVD are non-robust due to the sensitivity of L2norm loss function to outliers. HORPCA is shown to be robust when outliers are much larger than true data, while it performs poorly when the magnitude of outliers is within the range of true data. It should be noted that BRTF significantly outperforms competing methods under all conditions in terms of recovering the low-rank tensor and latent factors, indicating that it is more robust to outliers and non-Gaussian noises. In addition, the performance of BRTF is unaffected by the percentage and magnitude of outliers, which confirms the capability of automatically adapting the model to various types of outliers.\nA special case when the true CP Rank is larger than data dimensions, i.e., R > maxn In, was investigated under the condition of 1% outliers and the detailed results are shown in Table 1. The initial rank was set to 100 for both BRTF and CP-ARD. We observe that BRTF can correctly estimate rank R while CP-ARD overestimates it due to the corruptions by outliers. For CP-ALS and HOSVD, the optimal rank was selected from all possible values within [1, R] by multiple runs. The sensitivity of tuning parameters is also reported by standard deviation of RRSE under varying selections. Although ground-truth data was used to tune parameters by other methods, BRTF still\n10\nsignificantly outperforms all other methods in terms of RRSE and FME, while the runtime also shows its high efficiency. It should be noted that this experiment shows an essentially different property of tensor in contrast to matrix where R ≤ minn In is always satisfied. Therefore, the straightforward extension of many matrix based techniques is not applicable to this situation, which has been demonstrated by the low performance of HORPCA that employs the robust matrix technique to each mode-n matricization of the tensor alternately.\nThe results for partially observed tensor are shown in Fig. 4, and Fig. 1 is one example of that. Several tensor factorization based completion methods are compared under varying missing ratios. For computation efficiency, the rank R was initialized as 10 in BRTF. Observe that HORPCA is more robust than CWOPT and CPNLS, which cannot handle outliers explicitly, only when outliers are much larger than true data. By contrast, BRTF achieves the best performance among competing methods and its performances are quite stable under varying missing ratios, which demonstrates its robustness to both outliers and missing data. In addition, the results confirm that BRTF can accurately estimate the ground-truth of tensor rank in all cases. It should be emphasized that all competing methods had multiple runs to tune the parameters\nand the best possible predictive performance on missing data was reported, while BRTF only needs to run once. These results demonstrate that the superiorities of BRTF is not only in automatic model selection, but also in the accuracy of tensor factorization and completion. In addition, Table 2 shows the mean and standard deviation of runtime under different missing ratios, indicating the high efficiency of BRTF."

      "text" : "Anomaly detection is another important ability of BRTF which can model the local information explicitly. Hence, we now consider a real-world application in surveillance video sequences with aim to separate the foreground objects from the background. Since the background is highly correlated along the frames, thus can be modeled by a low-rank tensor, while the foreground objects are moving along frames, thus can be modeled by a sparse tensor. We conducted experiments on the popular video sequences1 by extracting 100 frames from Shopping mall sequence and 300 frames from the other two sequences. The stateof-the-art methods for robust matrix/tensor factorization and background modeling were employed for comparisons. The matrix-based methods, including\n1. http://perception.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/bk model/bk index.html\n11\nPCP [25], GoDec [33], DRMF [29], RegL1ALM [30], VBRPCA [42], PRMF [40], BRMF [41], and DECOLOR [45], were performed on grayscale videos, while HORPCA [37] and BRTF were performed on original color videos represented by tensors with an additional RGB mode. For competing methods, if necessary, the tuning parameters were selected close to optimal by visual quality due to the lack of groundtruth.\nAs shown in Fig. 5, BRTF successfully separates the background and foreground on all the sequences. From one frame of Hall, we observe that BRTF can completely separate the person, who stands for a while and then moves away, from the background, while all other methods capture this person by both background and foreground. In another frame of Hall, the ghosting effects are observed by all methods except DECOLOR and BRTF. For the sequence of Shopping Mall, VBRPCA, BRMF, DECOLOR and BRTF obtain clearer background than those by other methods. For the sequence of Water Surface, DECOLOR and BRTF are clearly superior to other methods. Note that DECOLOR obtains comparable results with BRTF, since it incorporates the auxiliary information that is specially designed for this application. By contrast, BRTF, as a general tool for robust factorization, has shown the superiorities not only in handling tensor data, but also in more robustness than existing robust matrix factorizations.\nTo illustrate the property of simultaneous robust completion and anomaly detection, we conducted additional experiments on the same sequences by randomly dropping 90% pixels and compared BRTF with RegL1ALM, PRMF and HORPCA, which can handle both missing data and outliers. As illustrated in Fig. 6, BRTF is significantly superior to matrix based RegL1ALM and PRMF and tensor based HORPCA in terms of recovering the background. We observe that in the presence of missing pixels, the ghost effects are more severe by other methods, while BRTF is unaffected, indicating its better robustness to missing data and outliers. Although HORPCA is also a robust tensor factorization method, it shows comparable results with matrix based methods and cannot recover well the color of background. It should be noted that all competing methods require tuning parameters whose selection is quite time consuming, while BRTF works in a fully automatic fashion."

      "text" : "In this section, we further investigate the model property in terms of robustness to non-Gaussion noises. We use the CMU-PIE face database [46] for multilinear model analysis and evaluation. All the facial images are first aligned by their eye position and then cropped to size 32 × 32. Next, we use 1500 facial images selected from the first 30 subjects with\n5 poses and 10 illumination changes to construct a forth-order tensor X ∈ R1024×30×5×10. Two common types of noise that arises in the images are saltand-pepper noise (impulse noise) and poisson noise (shot photon noise), which are both non-Gaussian. We consider noise removal for the facial images corrupted by both poisson and salt-and-pepper noise with ratio of 10% (see Fig. 7) and compare BRTF with tensor based methods including HORPCA, CP-ALS, TuckerARD [19], and HOSVD. Note that the tuning parameters of HORPCA were selected carefully by using the ground-truth of images while BRTF and Tucker-ARD can automatically learn the model parameters without requiring fine-tuning. CP-ALS was performed using the CP rank obtained from BRTF and HOSVD was performed using the multilinear rank obtained from Tucker-ARD.\nFig. 7 shows the qualitative results of some example images including 2 people under 5 poses and 2 lighting variations. We can observe that BRTF and HORPCA are robust to non-Gaussian noises and obtain the satisfactory visual quality, while CP-ALS, HOSVD and Tucker-ARD cannot perform well for non-Gaussian noise removal. The detailed quantitative evaluation results are shown in Table 3 which\n12\ncontains recovery performance evaluated by RRSE and PSNR as well as computational efficiency measured by runtime. BRTF and HORPCA outperform the other methods significantly because of robust property of their model assumptions. It should be noted that although HORPCA tuned parameters by the ground-truth, resulting in the best possible performance, BRTF still outperforms HORPCA in terms of recovery performance. Due to multiple runs for tuning parameter selections, the computation of HORPCA is much more expensive than BRTF. Tucker-ARD is another method that can achieve automatic model selection, however, it cannot handle non-Gaussian noise and its computational efficiency is quite low. These results demonstrate the superiority of BRTF in terms of denoising performance, robustness to nonGaussian noise and computational efficiency. In summary, BRTF is a robust method which is similar to HORPCA; BRTF can achieve automatic rank determination which is similar to Tucker-ARD; BRTF is based on CP factorization which is similar to CPALS. The most significant characteristic of BRTF is the hierarchical probabilistic tensor model and full posterior inference of all unknown variables."

The objective is to explicitly infer the underlying low-CP-rank tensor capturing the global information and a sparse tensor capturing the local information (also considered as outliers), thus providing the robust predictive distribution over missing entries. The lowCP-rank tensor is modeled by multilinear interactions between multiple latent factors on which the column sparsity is enforced by a hierarchical prior, while the sparse tensor is modeled by a hierarchical view of Student-t distribution that associates an individual hyperparameter with each element independently. For model learning, we develop an efficient closed-form variational inference under a fully Bayesian treatment, which can effectively prevent the overfitting problem and scales linearly with data size. In contrast to existing related works, our method can perform model selection automatically and implicitly without need of tuning parameters. More specifically, it can discover the groundtruth of CP rank and automatically adapt the sparsity inducing priors to various types of outliers. In addition, the tradeoff between the low-rank approximation and the sparse representation can be optimized in the sense of maximum model evidence. The extensive experiments and comparisons with many state-of-the-art algorithms on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiorities of our method from several perspectives.",
