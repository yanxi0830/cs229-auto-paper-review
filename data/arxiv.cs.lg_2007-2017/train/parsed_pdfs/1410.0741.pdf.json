      "text" : "The Volterra Series were first studied by Vito Volterra and were named after him. The first application of the Volterra series to the study of nonlinear systems was done by Norbert Wiener (see Schetzen, 1980, p.517). The time invariant series can be represented by (1) below.\ny (t) = ∫ ∞ −∞ h1(σ1)u(t− σ1)dσ1\n+ ∫ ∞ −∞ ∫ ∞ −∞ h2(σ1, σ2)u(t− σ1)u(t− σ2)dσ1dσ2 + · · ·\n+ ∫ ∞ −∞ · · · ∫ ∞ −∞ hN (σ1, · · · , σi)u(t− σ1) · · ·\nu(t− σN )dσ1 · · · dσN (1)\nHere u represents the input to the system, y is the system output and hn is known as the nth Volterra kernel, it can also be called the nth order impulse response. This terminology comes because the first term of eq. (1) is the same as the convolution integral which relates the output of a system to the input and the 1st order impulse response of\nar X\niv :1\n41 0.\n07 41\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n3 O\nthe system1. Higher order terms of the Volterra series can be seen as higher order impulse responses. The terms Volterra kernel and impulse response will be used interchangeably in this document.\nSeveral modifications can and should be made to (1) before performing an identification. These modifications include: discretization of the integrals, modification of the limits of integration based on known characteristics of physical systems, and reduction of the Volterra kernel using the Laguerre polynomials to reduce the number of model parameters."

      "heading" : "2. Simplifying the Volterra Series for Practical Application",
      "text" : "If a system is causal, which means that the output at some time t depends only on past inputs(u(t−σ) for σ > 0) and not on future inputs (u(t−σ) for σ < 0). The Volterra series can be written as shown in eq. (2) below. Note that (2) only includes the first term of the series for simplicity. It should also be noted that all known physical systems appear to be causal. A more detailed discussion of causality can be found in Schetzen (1980, p.21,89).\ny (t) = ∫ ∞ 0 h1(σ1)u(t− σ1)dσ1 (2)\nThe Volterra series may also be discretized by using the convolution sum instead of the convolution integral, yielding eq. (3). Again, only the first term of the series is shown for simplicity.\ny (t) = ∞∑ i1=0 h1(i1)u(t− i1) (3)\nFinally, if the system is assumed to have finite memory or fading memory and finite order another simplification can be made. Fading Memory means that the there is some time M in the past before which inputs will no longer have affect on the output of the system. Equation (4) is referred to as the discrete, finite memory, N th order Volterra Series.\ny (t) = N∑ n=1 νnM (t) (4)\nνnM (t) = M∑ i1=0 · · · M∑ in=0 hn(i, . . . , in)u(t− i1) · · ·u(t− in)\n1. Note that eq. (1), and consequently most of the other equations in this paper represent SISO systems for compactness. MIMO systems can be accounted for by solving several MISO sets, and expanding the expression with ui(t), i = 1 . . . I where I is the total number of inputs. For illustrative purposes it is sufficient to look at SISO systems for now."

      "heading" : "2.1 Volterra Model Limitations",
      "text" : "This class of finite Volterra models is defined as the class of V(N,M) models by Doyle et al. (2001). Where N is the nonlinear degree and M is the dynamic order. In other words N is the number of Volterra terms and M is the memory length of the system. Using this notation it is easy to describe different Volterra Models by examining the behaviors of the limiting cases. These are: V(∞,M),V(N,∞), and V(∞,∞) (Doyle et al., 2001, Ch. 2), (Pearson, 1999, Sec.4.2).\nIt is important to consider the limitations of the V(N,M) class. Some of these limitations include not being able to exhibit output multiplicity (Boyd and Chua, 1985). This can be described intuitively by saying that if a system can exhibit the same output by different local inputs (i.e. different steady state responses to the same steady state input), it must have had paths that differed initially. This leads to a similar conclusion which says conditionally stable impulse responses cannot be described by a fading memory Volterra model. Volterra models also cannot produce persistent oscillations or chaos in response to asymptotically constant input sequences.\nThe limitations of the Volterra series can be seen as beneficial or detrimental depending on the desired output of the model. If a model for a system with persistent oscillations is desired then VL models should not be used. However, it is useful to have a model that implicitly rejects these types of characteristics if the physical system does not exhibit them. More information on this subject can be found in Doyle et al. (2001); Pearson (1999)"

      "text" : "Another important practical limitation, that isn’t dependent on the application, is Volterra Model Parameterization. In other words how many parameters are required to define a V(N,M) model. The total number of parameters can be represented as C(N,M) (Doyle et al., 2001). The following equations describe the calculation of C(N,M).\nC(N,M) = M∑ n=0 Cn(M) (5) Cn(M) = (M + 1) n\nC(N,M) = M∑ n=0 Cn(M) = (M + 1)N+1 − 1 M (6)\n'MN\nHere Cn(M) is the total number of coefficients in hn(The n th Volterra Kernel) of the Volterra model V(N,M). Although Doyle et al. (2001, p.19) discusses methods for reducing the number of coefficients, the relationship is still exponential and therefore remains a barrier for practical application. Table 1 below demonstrates how quickly the number of required parameters can grow, especially considering that M is regularly between 50 and 250 in many industrial processes. The number of model parameters required makes any Voterra model with N > 2 impratical."

It can be shown that the general expression for the Laguerre functions in the time domain is eq. (9) below.\nln(t) = √ 2a n∑ k=0 (−1)kn!2n−k k![(n− k)!]2 (2at)n−ke−at (9)"

      "heading" : "3.1.2 Laguerre Time Scale Factor – a",
      "text" : "There is some interesting discussion that should take place concerning the value a in eq. (9). It is a factor by which the time scale of the Laguerre functions can be lengthened or shortened. It is often referred to as the Laguerre time scale because of this. Examination of the frequency domain representation of the Laguerre polynomials shows that the a term defines the time constant of a filter. This leads to more discussion on the use of Laguerre polynomials as filters. It is sufficient to know for the purposes of this paper that the parameter a or rather 1/a is the time constant of the “Laguerre Filter” and that because of this filter the Laguerre functions can reject noise in experimental data if it is chosen properly.\nEquations (10) and (11) below are frequency domain representations of the Laguerre polynomials and make the filter more obvious. Observe that α is a low pass filter and β is an all-pass filter making the net effect of the Laguerre Functions a filter with time constant 1/a. For more detail on the frequency domain representation of the Laguerre Functions see Schetzen (1980, Sec. 16.2). For more information on the Laguerre filter see Silva (1995) and King and Paraskevopoulos (1977).\nLn(s) = √ 2a (a− s)n\n(a+ s)n+1 ;σ > −a (10)\nor\nLn(s) =\n[ √ 2a\na+ s ] ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nα\n[ (a− s) (a+ s) ]n ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nβ\n;σ > −a (11)\nResearch has been performed to identify the optimal time scale factor a for a given identification problem. It has been suggested that the factor should be placed near the dominant pole of the system (Zheng and Zafiriou, 1995), however if the system has delay the factor a will be greatly affected (Wang and Cluett, 1994). Methods exist for calculating the optimal time scale value for linear systems, or require previous knowledge of the system and thus are not generally applicable to nonlinear system identification (Clowes, 1965), (Fu and Dumont, 1993), and (Parks, 1971). Current general practice is to perform a nonlinear optimization to calculate the value for a that will yield the minimum error.\nIf the value for a is optimal the coefficients of the higher order terms of the Laguerre polynomial will go to zero. This is valuable because the main purpose of using the Laguerre functions is to reduce the number of parameters that need to be identified for a V(N,M) model. If the value of a is not optimal then the Laguerre functions can still be used but a higher order Laguerre polynomial will be required. Some further discussion of properties can be found in Appendix 6."

Depending on the complexity of the relationship between one term of the Volterra series and the output; a different order R of the Laguerre polynomial could be used for each separate term of the Volterra series. This option gives one the ability to use more or less Laguerre coefficients to aproximate a certain term of the Volterra series if needed.

      "text" : "The parameterization of the Volterra series was discussed earlier in this document. It was identified to be a significant impediment to the practical application of Volterra model identification because of the number of I/O that are required to confidently identify such a large number of model parameters. The replacement of the Volterra kernel with the Laguerre polynomials allows a reduction of the required parameters. This occurs because the Laguerre functions approximate each Volterra kernel with R parameters instead of M parameters (assuming R is the same for each term). The total number of coefficients in the reduced Volterra model V(N,R) can be derived similarly to eq. (6) and is shown below in eq. (29).\nC(N,R) = R N (29)\nTable 2 below shows the amount of parameters for a Volterra-Laguerre model with N Volterra terms and an Rth order Laguerre polynomial.\nThe number of required parameters for a Volterra-Laguerre model is much less than that of a Volterra model. For example, consider a Volterra system with M = 50 and N = 3. Table 1 shows that this would require approximately 8000 parameters to describe. Fitting the same Volterra model with N = 3 and Laguerre polynomials of order R = 3. The number of parameters is reduced to 27 which is less than 0.5 percent of the number required for the Volterra series.\nIt is important to remember that reduction of the number of required model parameters is desirable because of the amount of required I/O data to identify them. For a fixed amount of I/O data the identification of the parameters will have some statistical confidence inversely proportional to the number of parameters. If the number of required parameters are decreased then the statistical confidence will go up. For industrial applications this means that less time can be spent collecting data to achieve the same (or better) statistical confidence in the model parameters. The other way of looking at it is that a better model can be made with the same amount of I/O data. Either way use of the Volterra-Laguerre series can be extremely beneficial."

And, ’Ankle (shank) acceleration - horizontal forward acceleration [mg]’ was y(t) . Hundreds of simulations were run using samples drawn uniformly from the following domains: N , the nonlinear degree or Volterra order was taken from integers [1, 5] for each input, lr was drawn from integers [2, 4] for each volterra kernel, and an,i was taken from the set of real numbers on [0.005, 100] for each laguerre series. Hundreds more simulations were run using equal N , lr, and an,i as well.\nCompiling the results from these simulations and plotting the corresponding distributions of the sum of the squared error (SSE) indicates the difference in the expected error from a scenario with N , lr, and an,i fixed (according to practice in current literature) as opposed to the case where they can be different.\nNormalizing the means to the lowest value of SSE the difference between the baseline simulations and the variable parameter simulations is approximately 5.5 percent. It should be noted that the simulations with variable parameters have a tighter distribution. It should also be noted that lower SSE is not necessarily desirable because of over-fitting.\nThis example illustrates that, in general a VL model fit with non-equal parameters will have less error than a model with equal parameters."

A novel algorithm is presented to generalize identification of discrete VL systems. The proposed algorithm allows flexibility of parameterization to fit any class of system that can be described by a V(N,M), l an,i r VolterraLaguerre model.

Any member of the class of fading memory systems can be approximated to arbitrary accuracy by a finite Volterra model (Boyd and Chua, 1985) . A better discussion of fading memory systems and the work done on them can be found in Doyle et al. (2001, p. 41),and Boyd and Chua (1985, Sec. III). It turns out that the concept of fading memory has been around at least as long as the Volterra series itself. Regularly the Horizon should be equal to the number of steps in the time to steady state. In EHPC there has been work suggesting criteria for choosing the memory length or “Horizon” of finite memory systems, see Kong and De Keyser (1994) for more details and references.\nAn example of infinite memory is an integrating process such as the level of tank with respect to influent flow. If the influent flow rate of a tank steps from 0 to a positive value of x the tank will begin to fill. If the model ever “forgets” that the flow rate was changed to x then it would predict that the tank level should stop changing. Thus this model requires infinite memory to correctly predict the level of the tank.\nSome more discussion regarding systems with infinite memory can be found in Schetzen (1980, p.334). Systems with infinite memory can still be handled but require some special treatment. In the case of the above example the level signal could be differentiated giving a constant rate of increase of the level."
