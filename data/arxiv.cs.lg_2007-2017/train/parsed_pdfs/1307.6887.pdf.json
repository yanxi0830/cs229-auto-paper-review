      "text" : "Learning from prior tasks and transferring that experience to improve future performance is a key aspect of intelligence, and is critical for building lifelong learning agents. Recently, multi-task and transfer learning received much attention in the supervised and reinforcement learning (RL) setting with both empirical and theoretical encouraging results (see recent surveys by Pan and Yang, 2010; Lazaric, 2011). Most of these works focused on scenarios where the tasks are batch learning problems, in which a training set is directly provided to the learner. On the other hand, the online learning setting (Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi, 2006), where the learner is presented with samples in a sequential fashion, has been rarely considered (see Mann and Choe (2012) for an example in RL and Sec. E in the supplementary material for a discussion on related settings).\nThe multi–arm bandit (MAB) (Robbins, 1952) is a simple yet powerful framework formalizing the online learning with partial feedback problem, which encompasses a large number of applications, such as clinical trials, online advertisements and adaptive routing. In this paper we take a step towards understanding and providing formal bounds on transfer in stochastic MABs. We focus on a sequential transfer scenario where an (online) learner is acting in a series of tasks drawn from a stationary distribution over a finite set of MABs. Prior to learning, the model parameters of each bandit problem are not known to the learner, nor does it know the distribution probability over the bandit problems. Also, we assume that the learner is not provided with the identity of the task. This setting is sufficient to model a number of interesting problems, including: a tutoring system working to help a sequence of students to learn, by finding the right type of education program for them, where each student may be a remedial, normal or honors student but which is unknown; an online advertisement site that wishes to run a sequence of ads with maximum expected click for a sequence of webpages based on the type of the users of each webpage, which is unknown to the system. To act efficiently in this setting, it is crucial to define a mechanism for transferring knowledge across tasks. In fact the learner may encounter the same bandit problem over and over throughout the learning, and an efficient algorithm should be able to reuse (transfer) the knowledge obtained in previous tasks, when it is presented with the same problem again. This can be achieved by modeling the reward distribution of the whole process as a latent variable model (LVM), where the observed variables are the rewards of pulling the arms and the latent variable is the identity of the bandit. If we can accurately estimate this LVM, we show that an extension of the UCB algorithm (Auer et al., 2002) is able to exploit this prior knowledge to reduce the regret through tasks (Sec. 3).\nIn this paper we rely on a new variant of method-of-moments (Anandkumar et al., 2012a,c), the robust tensor power method (RTP) (Anandkumar et al., 2012b), to estimate the LVM associated with the sequential-bandit problem. RTP relies on decomposing the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of certain tensors for estimating the model means (Anandkumar et al., 2012b). We prove that RTP provides a consistent estimate of the means of all arms for every bandit problem as long as they are pulled at least three times per task (Sec. 4.2). This guarantees that once RTP is paired with an efficient bandit algorithm able to exploit the transferred\nknowledge about the models (Sec. 4.3), we obtain a bandit algorithm, called tUCB, guaranteed to perform as well as UCB in early episodes, thus avoiding any negative transfer effect, and then to approach the performance of the ideal case when the set of bandit problems is known in advance (Sec. 4.4). Finally, we report some preliminary results on synthetic data confirming the theoretical findings (Sec. 5)."

      "text" : "We consider a stochastic MAB problem defined by a set of arms A = {1, . . . ,K}, |A| = K , where each i ∈ A is characterized by a distribution νi and the samples observed from each arm are independent and identically distributed. We focus on the setting where there exists a set of models Θ = {θ = (ν1, . . . , νK)}, |Θ| = m, which contains all the possible bandit problems. We denote the mean of an arm i, the best arm, and the best value of a model θ ∈ Θ respectively by µi(θ), i∗(θ), µ∗(θ). We define the arm gap of an arm i for a model θ as ∆i(θ) = µ∗(θ) − µi, while the model gap for an arm i between two models θ and θ′ is defined as Γi(θ, θ′) = |µi(θ) − µi(θ′)|.\nWe also introduce some tensor notation. Let X ∈ RK be a random realization of all the arms from a random model. All the realizations are i.i.d. conditional on a model θ̄ and E[X |θ = θ̄] = µ(θ), where the i-th component of µ(θ) ∈ RK is [µ(θ)]i = µi(θ). Given two realizations X1 and X2, we define the second moment matrix M2 = E[X1 ⊗ X2] such that [M2]i,j = E[X1i X 2 j ] and the third moment tensor M3 = E[X\n1⊗X2⊗X3]. Since the realizations are conditionally independent, we have that E[X1 ⊗ X2|θ = θ̄] = E[X1|θ = θ̄] ⊗ E[X2|θ = θ̄] = µ(θ) ⊗ µ(θ) and this allows us to rewrite the second and third moments as M2 = ∑ θ ρ(θ)µ(θ) ⊗2,M3 = ∑ θ ρ(θ)µ(θ) ⊗3 (Anandkumar et al., 2012c), where v⊗p = v ⊗ v ⊗ · · · v is the p-th tensor power. Let A be a 3rd order member of the tensor product of the Euclidean space RK (as M3), then we define the multilinear map as follows. For a set of three matrices {Vi ∈ RK×m}1≤i≤3 , the (i1, i2, i3) entry in the 3-way array representation of A(V1, V2, V3) ∈ Rm×m×m is [A(V1, V2, V3)]i1,i2,i3 := ∑ 1≤j1,j2,j3≤n\nAj1,j2,j3 [V1]j1,i1 [V2]j2,i2 [V3]j3,i3 . We also use different norms: the Euclidean norm ‖ · ‖; the Frobenius norm ‖ · ‖F ; the matrix max-norm ‖A‖max = maxij |[A]ij |.\nWe consider the sequential transfer setting where at each episode j the learner interacts with a task θ̄j , drawn from a distribution ρ over Θ, for n steps. The objective is to minimize the (pseudo-)regret over J episodes measured as the difference between the rewards obtained by the optimal arms i∗(θ̄j) and the rewards achieved by the learner. More formally, the regret is defined as\nRJ = ∑J\nj=1 Rjn = ∑J j=1 ∑ i6=i∗ T ji,n∆i(θ̄ j), (1)\nwhere T ji,n is the number of pulls to arm i after n steps of episode j. The only information available to the learner is the number of models m, number of episodes J and number of steps n per task."

      "text" : "Before considering the transfer problem, we show that a simple variation to UCB allows to effectively exploit the knowledge of Θ and obtain a significant reduction in the regret. The mUCB (model-UCB) algorithm in Fig. 1 takes as input a set of models Θ including the current (unknown) model θ̄. At each step t, the algorithm computes a subset Θt ⊆ Θ containing only the models whose means µi(θ) are compatible with the current estimates µ̂i,t of the means µi(θ̄) of the current model, obtained averaging Ti,t pulls, and their uncer-\ntainty εi,t (see Eq. 2 for an explicit definition of this term). Notice that it is enough that one arm does not satisfy the compatibility condition to discard a model θ. Among all the models in Θt, mUCB first selects the model with the largest optimal value and then it pulls its corresponding optimal arm. This choice is coherent with the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle used in UCB-based algorithms, since mUCB always pulls the optimal arm corresponding to the optimistic model compatible with the current estimates µ̂i,t. We show that mUCB incurs a regret which is never worse than UCB and it is often significantly smaller.\nWe denote the set of arms which are optimal for at least a model in a set Θ′ as A∗(Θ′) = {i ∈ A : ∃θ ∈ Θ′ : i∗(θ) = i}. The set of models for which the arms in A′ are optimal is Θ(A′) = {θ ∈ Θ : ∃i ∈ A′ : i∗(θ) = i}. The set of optimistic models for a given model θ̄ is Θ+ = {θ ∈ Θ : µ∗(θ) ≥ µ∗(θ̄)}, and their corresponding optimal arms A+ = A∗(Θ+). The following theorem bounds the expected regret (similar bounds hold in high probability). The lemmas and proofs (using standard tools from the bandit literature) are available in Sec. B of the supplementary material.\nTheorem 1. If mUCB is run with δ = 1/n, a set of m models Θ such that the θ̄ ∈ Θ and\nεi,t = √ log(mn2/δ)/(2Ti,t−1), (2)\nwhere Ti,t−1 is the number of pulls to arm i at the beginning of step t, then its expected regret is\nE[Rn] ≤ K + ∑\ni∈A+\n2∆i(θ̄) log ( mn3 )\nminθ∈Θ+,i Γi(θ, θ̄) 2 ≤ K + ∑ i∈A+\n2 log ( mn3 )\nminθ∈Θ+,i Γi(θ, θ̄) , (3)\nwhere A+ = A∗(Θ+) is the set of arms which are optimal for at least one optimistic modelΘ+ andΘ+,i = {θ ∈ Θ+ : i∗(θ) = i} is the set of optimistic models for which i is the optimal arm.\nRemark (comparison to UCB). The UCB algorithm incurs a regret\nE[Rn(UCB)] ≤ O (∑\ni∈A\nlogn\n∆i(θ̄)\n) ≤ O ( K logn\nmini∆i(θ̄)\n) .\nWe see that mUCB displays two major improvements. The regret in Eq. 3 can be written as\nE[Rn(mUCB)] ≤ O (∑\ni∈A+\nlogn\nminθ∈Θ+,i Γi(θ, θ̄)\n) ≤ O ( |A+|\nlogn\nmini minθ∈Θ+,i Γi(θ, θ̄)\n) .\nThis result suggests that mUCB tends to discard all the models in Θ+ from the most optimistic down to the actual model θ̄ which, with high-probability, is never discarded. As a result, even if other models are still in Θt, the optimal arm of θ̄ is pulled until the end. This significantly reduces the set of arms which are actually pulled by mUCB and the previous bound only depend on the number of arms in A+, which is |A+| ≤ |A∗(Θ)| ≤ K . Furthermore, it is possible to show that for all arms i, the minimum gap minθ∈Θ+,i Γi(θ, θ̄) is guaranteed to be larger than the arm gap ∆i(θ̄) (see Lem. 4 in Sec. B), thus further improving the performance of mUCB w.r.t. UCB."

The algorithm uses two subalgorithms, the bandit algorithm umUCB (uncertain model-UCB), whose objective is to minimize the regret at each episode, and RTP (robust tensor power method) which at each episode j computes an estimate {µ̂ji (θ)} of the arm means of all the models. The bandit algorithm umUCB in Fig. 3 is an extension of the mUCB algorithm. It first computes a set of models Θjt whose means µ̂i(θ) are compatible with the current estimates µ̂i,t. However, unlike the case where the exact models are available, here the models themselves are estimated and the uncertainty εj in their means (provided as input to umUCB) is taken into account in the definition of Θjt . Once the active set is computed, the algorithm computes an upper-confidence bound on the value of each arm i\nfor each model θ and returns the best arm for the most optimistic model. Unlike in mUCB, due to the uncertainty over the model estimates, a model θ might have more than one optimal arm, and an upper-confidence bound on the mean of the arms µ̂i(θ) + εj is used together with the upper-confidence bound µ̂i,t+ εi,t, which is directly derived from the samples observed so far from arm i. This guarantees that the B-values are always consistent with the samples generated from the actual model θ̄j . Once umUCB terminates, RTP (Fig. 4) updates the estimates of the model means µ̂j(θ) = {µ̂ji (θ)}i ∈ RK using the samples obtained from each arm i. At the beginning of each task umUCB pulls all the arms 3 times, since RTP needs at least 3 samples from each arm to accurately estimate the 2nd and 3rd moments (Anandkumar et al., 2012b). More precisely, RTP uses all the reward samples generated up to episode j to estimate the 2nd and 3rd moments (see Sec. 2) as\nM̂2 = j −1 ∑j l=1 µ1l ⊗ µ2l, and M̂3 = j−1 ∑j l=1 µ1l ⊗ µ2l ⊗ µ3l, (4)\nwhere the vectors µ1l, µ2l, µ3l ∈ RK are obtained by dividing the T li,n samples observed from arm i in episode l in three batches and taking their average (e.g., [µ1l]i is the average of the first T l i,n/3 samples). 1 Since µ1l, µ2l, µ3l are independent estimates of µ(θ̄l), M̂2 and M̂3 are consistent estimates of the second and third moments M2 and M3. RTP relies on the fact that the model means µ(θ) can be recovered from the spectral decomposition of the symmetric tensor T = M3(W,W,W ), where W is a whitening matrix for M2, i.e., M2(W,W ) = Im×m (see Sec. 2 for the definition of the mapping A(V1, V2, V3)). Anandkumar et al. (2012b) (Thm. 4.3) have shown that under some mild assumption (see later Assumption 1) the model means {µ(θ)}, can be obtained as µ(θ) = λ(θ)Bv(θ), where (λ(θ), v(θ)) is a pair of eigenvector/eigenvalue for the tensor T and B := (WT)+.Thus the RTP algorithm estimates the eigenvectors v̂(θ) and the eigenvalues λ̂(θ), of the m×m×m tensor T̂ := M̂3(Ŵ , Ŵ , Ŵ ).2 Once v̂(θ) and λ̂(θ) are computed, the estimated mean vector µ̂j(θ) is obtained by the inverse transformation µ̂j(θ) = λ̂(θ)B̂v̂(θ), where B̂ is the pseudo inverse of ŴT(for a detailed description of RTP algorithm see Anandkumar et al., 2012b)."

      "text" : "umUCB requires as input εj , i.e., the uncertainty of the model estimates. Therefore we need finite sample complexity bounds on the accuracy of {µ̂i(θ)} computed by RTP. The performance of RTP is directly affected by the error of the estimates M̂2 and M̂3 w.r.t. the true moments. In Thm. 2 we prove that, as the number of tasks j grows, this error rapidly decreases with the rate of√ 1/j. This result provides us with an upper-bound on the error εj needed for building the confidence intervals in umUCB. The following definition and assumption are required for our result.\nDefinition 1. Let ΣM2 = {σ1, σ2, . . . , σm} be the set of m largest eigenvalues of the matrix M2. Define σmin := minσ∈ΣM2 σ, σmax := minσ∈ΣM2 σ and λmax := maxθ λ(θ). Define the minimum gap between the distinct eigenvalues of M2 as Γσ := minσi 6=σl(|σi − σl|).\nAssumption 1. The mean vectors {µ(θ)}θ are linear independent and ρ(θ) > 0 for all θ ∈ Θ.\nWe now state our main result which is in the form of a high probability bound on the estimation error of mean reward vector of every model θ ∈ Θ.\n1Notice that 1/3([µ1l]i + [µ2l]i + [µ1l]i) = µ̂ l i,n, the empirical mean of arm i at the end of episode l.\n2The matrix Ŵ ∈ RK×m is such that M̂2(Ŵ , Ŵ ) = Im×m, i.e., Ŵ is the whitening matrix of M̂2. In general Ŵ is not unique.

(5)\nRemark (comparison with the previous bounds). This bound improves on the previous bounds of Anandkumar et al. (2012c,a) moving from a dependency on the number of models of order O(m5) to a milder quadratic dependency on m.3 4 Although the dependency on σmin is a bit worse in our bounds in comparison to those of Anandkumar et al. (2012c,a), here we have the advantage that there is no dependency on the smallest singular value of the matrix {µ(θ) : θ ∈ Θ}, whereas those results scale polynomially with this factor.\nRemark (computation of C(Θ)). As illustrated in Fig. 3, umUCB relies on the estimates µ̂j(θ) and on their accuracy εj . Although the bound reported in Thm. 2 provides an upper confidence bound on the error of the estimates, it contains terms which are not computable in general (e.g., σmin). In practice, C(Θ) should be considered as a parameter of the algorithm.5 This is not dissimilar from to the parameter usually introduced in the definition of εi,t in front of the square-root term in UCB.\n4.3 Regret Analysis of umUCB We now analyze the regret of umUCB when an estimated set of models Θj is provided as input. At episode j, for each model θ we define the set of non-dominated arms (i.e., potentially optimal arms) as Aj∗(θ) = {i ∈ A : ∄i′, µ̂ji (θ)+εj < µ̂ji′(θ)−εj}. Among the non-dominated arms, when the actual model is θ̄j , the set of optimistic arms is Aj+(θ; θ̄j) = {i ∈ Aj∗(θ) : µ̂ji (θ) + εj ≥ µ∗(θ̄j)}. As a result, the set of optimistic models is Θj+(θ̄j) = {θ ∈ Θ : Aj+(θ; θ̄j) 6= ∅}. In some cases, because of the uncertainty in the model estimates, unlike in mUCB, not all the models θ 6= θ̄j can be discarded, not even at the end of a very long episode. Among the optimistic models, the set of models that cannot be discarded is defined as Θ̃j+(θ̄\nj) = {θ ∈ Θj+(θ̄j) : ∀i ∈ Aj+(θ; θ̄j), |µ̂ji (θ)− µi(θ̄j)| ≤ εj}. Finally, when we want to apply the previous definitions to a set of models Θ′ instead of single model we have, e.g., Aj∗(Θ′; θ̄j) = ⋃ θ∈Θ′ A j ∗(θ; θ̄j).\nThe proof of the following results are available in Sec. D of the supplementary material, here we only report the number of pulls, and the corresponding regret bound.\nCorollary 1. If at episode j umUCB is run with εi,t as in Eq. 2 and εj as in Eq. 2 with a parameter δ′ = δ/2K , then for any arm i ∈ A, i 6= i∗(θ̄j) is pulled Ti,n times such that\n \n\nTi,n ≤ min\n{ 2 log ( 2mKn2/δ )\n∆i(θ̄j)2 ,\nlog ( 2mKn2/δ )\n2min θ∈Θ\nj i,+\n(θ̄j) Γ̂i(θ; θ̄j)2\n} + 1 if i ∈ Aj1\nTi,n ≤ 2 log ( 2mKn2/δ ) /(∆i(θ̄\nj)2) + 1 if i ∈ Aj2 Ti,n = 0 otherwise\nw.p. 1 − δ, where Θji,+(θ̄j) = {θ ∈ Θj+(θ̄j) : i ∈ A+(θ; θ̄j)} is the set of models for which i is among theirs optimistic non-dominated arms, Γ̂i(θ; θ̄j) = Γi(θ, θ̄j)/2−εj, Aj1 = Aj+(Θj+(θ̄j); θ̄j)−Aj+(Θ̃j+(θ̄j); θ̄j) (i.e., set of arms only proposed by models that can be discarded), and Aj2 = Aj+(Θ̃j+(θ̄j); θ̄j) (i.e., set of arms only proposed by models that cannot be discarded).\nThe previous corollary states that arms which cannot be optimal for any optimistic model (i.e., the optimistic non-dominated arms) are never pulled by umUCB, which focuses only on arms in i ∈ Aj+(Θj+(θ̄j); θ̄j). Among these arms, those that may help to remove a model from the active set (i.e., i ∈ Aj1) are potentially pulled less than UCB, while the remaining arms, which are optimal for the models that cannot be discarded (i.e., i ∈ Aj2), are simply pulled according to a UCB strategy. Similar to mUCB, umUCB first pulls the arms that are more optimistic until either the active set Θjt changes or they are no longer optimistic (because of the evidence from the actual samples). We are now ready to derive the per-episode regret of umUCB.\n3Note that the improvement is mainly due to accuracy of the orthogonal tensor decomposition obtained via the tensor power method relative to the previously cited works. This is a direct consequence of the perturbation bound of Anandkumar et al. (2012b, Thm. 5.1), which is at the core of our sample complexity bound.\n4The result of Anandkumar et al. (2012a) has the explicit dependency of order m3 on the number of model as well as implicit dependency of order m2\nthrough the parameter α0. 5One may also estimate the constant C(Θ) in an online fashion using doubling trick (Audibert et al., 2012).\nTheorem 3. If umUCB is run for n steps on the set of models Θj estimated by RTP after j episodes with δ = 1/n, and the actual model is θ̄j , then its expected regret (w.r.t. the random realization in episode j and conditional on θ̄j) is\nE[Rjn] ≤ K+ ∑\ni∈A j 1\nmin\n{ 2 log ( 2mKn3 )\n∆i(θ̄j)2 ,\nlog ( 2mKn3 )\n2min θ∈Θ\nj i,+\n(θ̄j) Γ̂i(θ; θ̄j)2\n} ∆i(θ̄ j) + ∑\ni∈A j 2\n2 log ( 2mKn3 )\n∆i(θ̄j) .\nRemark (negative transfer). The transfer of knowledge introduces a bias in the learning process which is often beneficial. Nonetheless, in many cases transfer may result in a bias towards wrong solutions and a worse learning performance, a phenomenon often referred to as negative transfer. The first interesting aspect of the previous theorem is that umUCB is guaranteed to never perform worse than UCB itself. This implies that tUCB never suffers from negative transfer, even when the set Θj contains highly uncertain models and might bias umUCB to pull suboptimal arms. Remark (improvement over UCB). In Sec. 3 we showed that mUCB exploits the knowledge of Θ to focus on a restricted set of arms which are pulled less than UCB. In umUCB this improvement is not as clear, since the models in Θ are not known but are estimated online through episodes. Yet, similar to mUCB, umUCB has the two main sources of potential improvement w.r.t. to UCB. As illustrated by the regret bound in Thm. 3, umUCB focuses on arms in Aj1 ∪Aj2 which is potentially a smaller set than A. Furthermore, the number of pulls to arms in Aj1 is smaller than for UCB whenever the estimated model gap Γ̂i(θ; θ̄j) is bigger than ∆i(θ̄j). Eventually, umUCB reaches the same performance (and improvement over UCB) as mUCB when j is big enough. In fact, the set of optimistic models reduces to the one used in mUCB (i.e., Θj+(θ̄\nj) ≡ Θ+(θ̄j)) and all the optimistic models have only optimal arms (i.e., for any θ ∈ Θ+ the set of non-dominated optimistic arms is A+(θ; θ̄j) = {i∗(θ)}), which corresponds to Aj1 ≡ A∗(Θ+(θ̄j)) and Aj2 ≡ {i∗(θ̄j)}, which matches the condition of mUCB. For instance, for any model θ, to have A∗(θ) = {i∗(θ)} we need for any arm i 6= i∗(θ) that µ̂ji (θ) + εj ≤ µ̂ji∗(θ)(θ)− ε\nj . As a result j ≥ 2C(Θ)/min θ̄∈Θ min θ∈Θ+(θ̄) mini∆i(θ) 2 + 1\nepisodes are needed in order for all the optimistic models to have only one optimal arm independently from the actual identity of the model θ̄j . Although this condition may seem restrictive, in practice umUCB starts improving over UCB much earlier, as illustrated in the numerical simulation in Sec. 5.\n4.4 Regret Analysis of tUCB Given the previous results, we derive the bound on the cumulative regret over J episodes (Eq. 1).\nTheorem 4. If tUCB is run over J episodes of n steps in which the tasks θ̄j are drawn from a fixed distribution ρ over a set of models Θ, then its cumulative regret is\nRJ ≤ JK + J∑\nj=1\n∑\ni∈A j 1\nmin\n{ 2 log ( 2mKn2/δ )\n∆i(θ̄j)2 ,\nlog ( 2mKn2/δ )\n2 min θ∈Θ\nj i,+ (θ̄j)\nΓ̂ji (θ; θ̄ j)2\n} ∆i(θ̄ j) + J∑\nj=1\n∑\ni∈A j 2\n2 log ( 2mKn2/δ )\n∆i(θ̄j) ,\nw.p. 1− δ w.r.t. the randomization over tasks and the realizations of the arms in each episode.\nThis result immediately follows from Thm. 3 and it shows a linear dependency on the number of episodes J . This dependency is the price to pay for not knowing the identity of the current task θ̄j . If the task was revealed at the beginning of the task, a bandit algorithm could simply cluster all the samples coming from the same task and incur a much smaller cumulative regret with a logarithmic dependency on episodes and steps, i.e., log(nJ). Nonetheless, as discussed in the previous section, the cumulative regret of tUCB is never worse than for UCB and as the number of tasks increases it approaches the performance of mUCB, which fully exploits the prior knowledge of Θ."

      "text" : "In this section we report preliminary results of tUCB on synthetic data. The objective is to illustrate and support the previous theoretical findings. We define a set Θ of m = 5 MAB problems with K = 7 arms each, whose means {µi(θ)}i,θ are reported in Fig. 5 (see Sect. F in the supplementary material for the actual values), where each model has a different color and squares correspond to optimal arms (e.g., arm 2 is optimal for model θ2). This set of models is chosen to be challenging and illustrate some interesting cases useful to understand the functioning of the algorithm.6 Models θ1 and θ2 only differ in their optimal arms and this makes it difficult to distinguish them. For arm 3 (which is optimal for model θ3 and thus potentially selected by mUCB), all the models share exactly the same mean value. This implies that no model can be discarded by pulling it. Although this might\n6Notice that although Θ satisfies Assumption 1, the smallest singular value σmin = 0.0039 and Γσ = 0.0038, thus making the estimation of the models difficult.\n0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n30\nNumber of Tasks (J)\nUCB UCB+ mUCB tUCB\nFigure 6: Complexity over tasks.\n0 5000 10000 15000 50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\n350\nNumber of Steps (n)\nR eg\nre t\nUCB UCB+ mUCB tUCB (J=1000) tUCB (J=2000) tUCB (J=5000)\nFigure 7: Regret of UCB, UCB+, mUCB, and tUCB (avg. over episodes) vs episode length. 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\n160\n180\n200\n220\n240\n260\nNumber of Tasks (J)\nP er\n− ep\nis od\ne R\neg re\nt\nUCB UCB+ mUCB tUCB\nFigure 8: Per-episode regret of tUCB.\nsuggest that mUCB gets stuck in pulling arm 3, we showed in Thm. 1 that this is not the case. Models θ1 and θ5 are challenging for UCB since they have small minimum gap. Only 5 out of the 7 arms are actually optimal for a model in Θ. Thus, we also report the performance of UCB+ which, under the assumption that Θ is known, immediately discards all the arms which are not optimal (i /∈ A∗) and performs UCB on the remaining arms. The model distribution is uniform, i.e., ρ(θ) = 1/m.\nBefore discussing the transfer results, we compare UCB, UCB+, and mUCB, to illustrate the advantage of the prior knowledge of Θ w.r.t. UCB. Fig. 7 reports the per-episode regret of the three algorithms for episodes of different length n (the performance of tUCB is discussed later). The results are averaged over all the models in Θ and over 200 runs each. All the algorithms use the same confidence bound εi,t. The performance of mUCB is significantly better than both UCB, and UCB+, thus showing that mUCB makes an efficient use of the prior of knowledge of Θ. Furthermore, in Fig. 6 the horizontal lines correspond to the value of the regret bounds up to the n dependent terms and constants7 for the different models in Θ averaged w.r.t. ρ for the three algorithms (the actual values for the different models are in the supplementary material). These values show that the improvement observed in practice is accurately predicated by the upper-bounds derived in Thm. 1.\nWe now move to analyze the performance of tUCB. In Fig. 8 we show how the per-episode regret changes through episodes for a transfer problem with J = 5000 tasks of length n = 5000. In tUCB we used εj as in Eq.2 with C(Θ) = 2. As discussed in Thm. 3, UCB and mUCB define the boundaries of the performance of tUCB. In fact, at the beginning tUCB selects arms according to a UCB strategy, since no prior information about the models Θ is available. On the other hand, as more tasks are observed, tUCB is able to transfer the knowledge acquired through episodes and build an increasingly accurate estimate of the models, thus approaching the behavior of mUCB. This is also confirmed by Fig. 6 where we show how the complexity of tUCB changes through episodes. In both cases (regret and complexity) we see that tUCB does not reach the same performance of mUCB. This is due to the fact that some models have relatively small gaps and thus the number of episodes to have an accurate enough estimate of the models to reach the performance of mUCB is much larger than 5000 (see also the Remarks of Thm. 3). Since the final objective is to achieve a small global regret (Eq. 1), in Fig. 7 we report the cumulative regret averaged over the total number of\n7For instance, for UCB we compute ∑\ni 1/∆i.\ntasks (J) for different values of J and n. Again, this graph shows that tUCB outperforms UCB and that it tends to approach the performance of mUCB as J increases, for any value of n."

      "text" : "In this paper we introduce the transfer problem in the multi-armed bandit framework when a tasks are drawn from a finite set of bandit problems. We first introduced the bandit algorithm mUCB and we showed that it is able to fully exploit the prior knowledge on the set of bandit problems Θ and reduce the regret w.r.t. UCB. When the set of models is unknown we define a method-ofmoments variant (RTP) which consistently estimates the means of the models in Θ from the samples collected through episodes. This knowledge is then transferred to umUCB which never performs worse than UCB and tends to approach the performance of mUCB. For these algorithms we derive regret and sample complexity bounds, and we show preliminary numerical simulations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work studying the problem of transfer in multi-armed bandit and it opens a series of interesting questions.\nOptimality of mUCB. In some cases, mUCB may miss the opportunity to explore arms that could be useful in discarding models. For instance, an arm i /∈ A∗(Θ) may correspond to very large gaps Γi(θ, θ̄) and few pulls to it, although leading to large regret, may be enough to discard many models, thus guaranteeing a very small regret in the following. This observation rises the question whether the optimistic approach in this case still guarantees an optimal tradeoff between exploration and exploitation. Since the focus of this paper is on transfer and mUCB is already guaranteed to perform better than UCB, we left this question for future work.\nOptimality of tUCB. At each episode, tUCB transfers the knowledge about Θ acquired from previous tasks to achieve a small per-episode regret using umUCB. Although this strategy guarantees that the per-episode regret of tUCB is never worse than UCB, it may not be the optimal strategy in terms of the cumulative regret through episodes. In fact, if J is large, it could be preferable to run a model identification algorithm instead of umUCB in earlier episodes so as to improve the quality of the estimates µ̂i(θ). Although such an algorithm would incur a much larger regret in earlier tasks (up to linear), it could approach the performance of mUCB in later episodes much faster than done by tUCB. This trade-off between identification of the models and transfer of knowledge resembles the exploration-exploitation trade-off in the single-task problem and it may suggest that different algorithms than tUCB are possible."

      "text" : "Lemma 1. mUCB never pulls arms which are not optimal for at least one model, that is ∀i /∈ A∗(Θ), Ti,n = 0 with probability 1. Notice also that |A∗(Θ)| ≤ |Θ|.\nLemma 2. The actual model θ̄ is never discarded with high-probability. Formally, the event E = {∀t = 1, . . . , n, θ̄ ∈ Θt} holds with probability P[E ] ≥ 1− δ if\nεi,t =\n√ 1\n2Ti,t−1 log\n( mn2\nδ\n) ,\nwhere Ti,t−1 is the number of pulls to arm i at the beginning of step t and m = |Θ|.\nIn the previous lemma we implicitly assumed that |Θ| = m ≤ K . In general, the best choice in the definition of εi,t has a logarithmic factor with min{|Θ|,K}.\nLemma 3. On event E , all the arms i /∈ A∗(Θ+), i.e., arms which are not optimal for any of the optimistic models, are never pulled, i.e., Ti,n = 0 with probability 1− δ.\nThe previous lemma suggests that mUCB tends to discard all the models in Θ+ from the most optimistic down to the actual model θ̄ which, on event E , is never discarded. As a result, even if other models are still in Θt, the optimal arm of θ̄ is pulled until the end. Finally, we show that the model gaps of interest (see Thm. 1) are always bigger than the arm gaps.\nLemma 4. For any model θ ∈ Θ+, Γi∗(θ)(θ, θ̄) ≥ ∆i∗(θ)(θ̄).\nProof of Lem. 1. From the definition of the algorithm we notice that It can only correspond to the optimal arm i∗ of one model in the set Θt. Since Θt can at most contain all the models in Θ, all the arms which are not optimal are never pulled.\nProof of Lem. 2. We compute the probability of the complementary event EC , that is that event on which there exist at least one step t = 1, . . . , n where the true model θ̄ is not in Θt. By definition of Θt, we have that\nE = {∀t, θ̄ ∈ Θt} = {∀t, ∀i ∈ A, |µi − µ̂i,t| ≤ εi,t},\nthen\nP[EC ] = P[∃t, i, |µi − µ̂i,t| ≥ εi,t] ≤ n∑\nt=1\n∑\ni∈A\nP[|µi − µ̂i,t| ≥ εi,t] = n∑\nt=1\n∑\ni∈A∗(Θ)\nP[|µi − µ̂i,t| ≥ εi,t]\nwhere the upper-bounding is a simple union bound and the last passage comes from the fact that the probability for the arms which are never pulled is always 0 according to Lem. 1. At time t, µ̂i,t is the empirical average of the Ti,t−1 samples observed from arm i up to the beginning of round t. We define the confidence εi,t as\nεi,t =\n√ 1\n2Ti,t−1 log ( |Θ|nα δ ) ,\nwhere δ ∈ (0, 1) and α is a constant chosen later. Since Ti,t−1 is a random variable, we need to take an additional union bound over Ti,t−1 = 1, . . . , t− 1 thus obtaining\nP[EC ] ≤ n∑\nt=1\n∑\ni∈A∗(Θ)\nt−1∑\nTi,t−1=1\nP[|µi − µ̂i,t| ≥ εi,t]\n≤ n∑\nt=1\n∑\ni∈A∗(Θ)\nt−1∑\nTi,t−1=1\n2 exp ( − 2Ti,t−1ε2i,t ) ≤ n(n− 1) |A ∗(Θ)|δ |Θ|nα .\nSince |A∗(Θ)| < |Θ| (see Lem. 1) and by taking α = 2 we finally have P[EC ] ≤ δ.\nProof of Lem. 3. On event E , Θt always contains the true model θ̄, thus only models with larger optimal value could be selected as the optimistic model θt = argmaxθ∈Θt µ∗(θ), thus restricting the focus of the algorithm only to the models in Θ+ and their respective optimal arms.\nProof of Lem. 4. By definition of Θ+ we have µi∗(θ)(θ) = µ∗(θ) > µ∗(θ̄) and by definition of optimal arm we have µ∗(θ̄) > µi∗(θ)(θ̄), hence µ∗(θ) > µi∗(θ)(θ̄). Recalling the definition of model gap, we have Γi∗(θ)(θ) = |µi∗(θ)(θ) − µi∗(θ)(θ̄)| = µ∗(θ) − µi∗(θ)(θ̄), where we used the definition of µ∗(θ) and the previous inequality. Using the definition of arm gap ∆i, we obtain\nΓi∗(θ)(θ, θ̄) = µ∗(θ)− µi∗(θ)(θ̄) ≥ µ∗(θ̄)− µi∗(θ)(θ̄) = ∆i∗(θ)(θ̄), which proves the statement.\nProof of Thm. 1. We decompose the expected regret as\nE[Rn] = ∑\ni∈A\n∆iE[Ti,n] = ∑\ni∈A∗(Θ)\n∆iE[Ti,n] ≤ nP{EC}+ ∑\ni∈A+\n∆iE[Ti,n|E ],\nwhere the refinement on the sum over arms follows from Lem. 1 and 3 and the high probability event E . In the following we drop the dependency on θ̄ and we write µi(θ̄) = µi.\nWe now bound the regret when the correct model is always included in Θt. On event E , only the restricted set of optimistic models Θ+ = {θ ∈ Θ : µ∗(θ) ≥ µ∗} is actually used by the algorithm. Thus we need to compute the number of pulls to the suboptimal arms before all the models in Θ+ are discarded from Θt. We first compute the number of pulls to an arm i needed to discard a model θ on event E . We notice that\nθ ∈ Θt ⇔ {∀i ∈ A, |µi(θ)− µ̂i,t| ≤ εi,t}, which means that a model θ is included only when all its means are compatible with the current estimates. Since we consider event E , |µi − µ̂i,t| ≤ εi,t, thus θ ∈ Θt only if for all i ∈ A\n2εi,t ≥ Γi(θ, θ̄), which corresponds to\nTi,t−1 ≤ 2\nΓi(θ, θ̄)2 log ( |Θ|n2 δ ) , (6)\nwhich implies that if there exists at least one arm i for which at time t the number of pulls Ti,t exceeds the previous quantity, then ∀s > t we have θ /∈ Θt (with probability P(E)). To obtain the final bound on the regret, we recall that the algorithm first selects an optimistic model θt and then it pulls the corresponding optimal arm until the optimistic model is not discarded. Thus we need to compute the number of times the optimal arm of the optimistic model is pulled before the model is discarded. More formally, since we know that on event E we have that Ti,n = 0 for all i /∈ A+, the constraints of type (6) could only be applied to the arms i ∈ A+. Let t be the last time arm i is pulled, which coincides, by definition of the algorithm, with the last time any of the models in Θ+,i = {θ ∈ Θ+ : i∗(θ) = i} (i.e., the optimistic models recommending i as the optimal arm) is included in Θt. Then we have that Ti,t−1 = Ti,n − 1 and the fact that i is pulled corresponds to the fact the a model θi ∈ Θ+,i is such that\nθi ∈ Θt ∧ ∀θ′ ∈ Θt, µ∗(θi) > µ∗(θ′), which implies that (see Eq. 6)\nTi,n ≤ 2\nminθ∈Θ+,i Γi(θ, θ̄) 2 log ( |Θ|n2 δ ) + 1. (7)\nwhere the minimum over Θ+,i guarantees that all the optimistic models with optimal arm i are actually discarded. Grouping all the conditions, we obtain the expected regret\nE[Rn] ≤ K + ∑\ni∈A+\n2∆i(θ̄)\nminθ∈Θ+,i Γi(θ, θ̄) 2 log\n( |Θ|n3 )\nwith δ = 1/n. Finally we can apply Lem. 4 which guarantees that for any θ ∈ Θ+,i the gaps Γi(θ, θ̄) ≥ ∆i(θ̄) and obtain the final statement.\nRemark (proof). The proof of the theorem considers a worst case. In fact, while pulling the optimal arm of the optimistic model i∗(θt) we do not consider that the algorithm might actually discard other models, thus reducing Θt before the optimistic model is actually discarded. More formally, we assume that for any θ ∈ Θt not in Θ+,i the number of steps needed to be discarded by pulling i∗(θt) is larger than the number of pulls needed to discard θt itself, which corresponds to\nmin θ∈Θ+,i Γ2i (θ, θ̄) ≥ max θ∈Θ+\nθ/∈Θ+,i\nΓ2i (θ, θ̄).\nWhenever this condition is not satisfied, the analysis is suboptimal since it does not fully exploit the structure of the problem and mUCB is expected to perform better than predicted by the bound.\nRemark (comparison to UCB with hypothesis testing). An alternative strategy is to pair UCB with hypothesis testing of fixed confidence δ. Let Γmin(θ̄) = miniminθ Γi(θ, θ̄), if at time t there exists an arm i such that Ti,t > 2 log(2/δ)Γ2min, then all the models θ 6= θ̄ can be discarded with probability 1 − δ. Since from the point of view of the hypothesis testing the exploration strategy is unknown, we can only assume that after τ steps we have Ti,τ ≥ τ/K for at least one arm i. Thus after τ > 2K log(2/δ)/Γ2min steps, the hypothesis testing returns a model θ̂ which coincides with θ̄ with probability 1 − δ. If τ ≤ n, from time τ on, the algorithm always pulls It = i∗(θ̂) and incurs a zero regret with high probability. If we assume τ ≤ n, the expected regret is\nE[Rn(UCB+Hyp)] ≤ O (∑\ni∈A\nlognτ\n∆i\n) ≤ O ( K lognτ\n∆\n) .\nWe notice that this algorithm only has a mild improvement w.r.t. standard UCB. In fact, in UCB the big-O notation hides the constants corresponding to the exponent of n in the logarithmic term. This suggests that whenever τ is much smaller than n, then there might be a significant improvement. On the other hand, since τ has an inverse dependency w.r.t. Γmin, it is very easy to build model sets Θ where Γmin = 0 and obtain an algorithm with exactly the same performance as UCB.\nC Sample Complexity Analysis of RTP\nIn this section we provide the full sample complexity analysis of the RTP algorithm. In our analysis we rely on some results of Anandkumar et al. (2012b). Anandkumar et al. (2012b) have provided perturbation bounds on the error of the orthonormal eigenvectors v̂(θ) and the corresponding eigenvalues λ̂(θ) in terms of the perturbation error of the transformed tensor ǫ = ‖T−T̂‖ (see Anandkumar et al., 2012b, Thm 5.1). However, this result does not provide us with the sample complexity bound on the estimation error of model means. Here we complete their analysis by proving a sample complexity bound on the ℓ2-norm of the estimation error of the means ‖µ(θ)− µ̂(θ)‖.\nWe follow the following steps in our proof: (i) we bound the error ǫ in terms of the estimation errors ǫ2 := ‖M̂2 −M2‖ and ǫ3 := ‖M̂3 − M3‖ (Lem. 6). (ii) we prove high probability bounds on the error ǫ2 and ǫ3 using some standard concentration inequality results (Lem. 7). The bounds on the errors of the estimates v̂(θ) and λ̂(θ) immediately follow from combining the results of Lem. 6, Lem. 7 and Thm. 5. (iii) Based on these bounds we then prove our main result by bounding the estimation error associated with the inverse transformation µ̂(θ) = λ̂(θ)B̂v̂(θ) in high probability.\nWe begin by recalling the perturbation bound of Anandkumar et al. (2012b):\nTheorem 5 (Anandkumar et al., 2012b). Pick η ∈ (0, 1). Define W := UD−1/2, where D ∈ Rm×m is the diagonal matrix of the m largest eigenvalues of M2 and U ∈ RK×m is the matrix with the eigenvectors associated with the m largest eigenvalues of M2 as its columns. Then W is a linear mapping which satisfies WTM2W = I. Let T̂ = T + E ∈ Rm×m×m, where the 3rd order moment tensor T = M3(W,W,W ) is symmetric and orthogonally decomposable in the form of ∑ θ∈Θ λ(θ)v(θ)\n⊗3, where each λ(θ) > 0 and {v(θ)}θ is an orthonormal basis. Define ǫ := ‖E‖ and λmax = maxθ λ(θ). Then there exist some constants C1, C2 > 0, some polynomial function f(·), and a permutation π on Θ such that the following holds w.p. 1− η\n‖v(θ)− v̂(π(θ))‖ ≤ 8ǫ/λ(θ), |λ(θ) − λ̂(π(θ))| ≤ 5ǫ,\nfor ǫ ≤ C1 λminm , L > log(1/η)f(k) and N ≥ C2(log(k) + log log(λmax/ǫ)), where N and L are the internal parameters of RTP algorithm.\nFor ease of exposition we consider the RTP algorithm in asymptotic case, i.e., N,L → ∞ and η ≈ 1. We now prove bounds on the perturbation error ǫ in terms of the estimation error ǫ2 and ǫ3. This requires bounding the error between W = UD−1/2 and Ŵ = ÛD̂−1/2 using the following perturbation bounds on ‖U − Û‖, ‖D̂−1/2 −D−1/2‖ and ‖D̂1/2 −D1/2‖. Lemma 5. Assume that ǫ2 ≤ 1/2min(Γσ, σmin), then we have\n‖D̂−1/2 −D−1/2‖ ≤ 2ǫ2 (σmin)3/2 , and ‖D̂1/2 −D1/2‖ ≤ ǫ2 σmax , and ‖Û − U‖ ≤ 2 √ mǫ2 Γσ .\nProof. Here we just prove bounds on ‖D̂−1/2 −D−1/2‖ and ‖Û −U‖. The bound on ‖D̂−1/2 −D−1/2‖ can be proven using a similar argument to that used for bounding ‖D̂1/2 −D1/2‖. Let Σ̂m = {σ̂1, σ̂2, . . . , σ̂m} be the set of m largest eigenvalues of the matrix M̂2. We have\n‖D̂−1/2 −D−1/2‖ (1)= max 1≤i≤m ∣∣∣∣ √ 1 σi − √ 1 σ̂i ∣∣∣∣ = max1≤i≤m\n  ∣∣∣ 1σi − 1 σ̂i ∣∣∣ √\n1 σi\n+ √\n1 σ̂i\n \n≤ max 1≤i≤m\n(√ σi ∣∣∣∣ 1\nσi − 1 σ̂i\n∣∣∣∣ )\n≤ max 1≤i≤m\n∣∣∣∣ σi − σ̂i√\nσiσ̂i\n∣∣∣∣ (2)\n≤ ǫ2√ σmin(σmin − ǫ2)\n(3) ≤ 2ǫ2 (σmin)3/2 ,\nwhere in (1) we use the fact that the spectral norm of matrix is its largest singular value, which in case of a diagonal matrix coincides with its biggest element, in (2) we rely on the result of Weyl (see Stewart and Sun, 1990, Thm. 4.11, p. 204) for bounding the difference between σi and σ̂i, and in (3) we make use of the assumption that ǫ2 ≤ 1/2σmin.\nIn the case of ‖U − Û‖ we rely on the perturbation bound of Wedin (1972). This result guarantees that for any positive definite matrix A the difference between the eigenvectors of A and the perturbed Â (also positive definite) is small whenever there is a minimum gap between the eigenvalues of Â and A. More precisely, for any positive definite matrix A and Â such that ||A− Â|| ≤ ǫA, let the minimum eigengap be ΓA↔Â := minj 6=i |σi − σ̂j |, then we have\n‖ui − ûi‖ ≤ ǫA\nΓA↔Â , (8)\nwhere (ui, σi) is an eigenvalue/vector pair for the matrix A. Based on this result we now bound the error ‖U − Û‖\n‖U − Û‖ ≤ ‖U − Û‖F ≤ √∑\ni\n‖ui − ûi‖2 (1) ≤ √ mǫ2\nΓ M2↔M̂2\n(2) ≤ √ mǫ2\nΓσ − ǫ2 (3) ≤ 2 √ mǫ2 Γσ ,\nwhere in (1) we rely on Eq. 8 and in (2) we rely on the definition of the gap as well as Weyl’s inequality. Finally, in (3) We rely on the fact that ǫ2 ≤ 1/2Γσ for bounding denominator from below.\nOur result also holds for those cases where the multiplicity of some of the eigenvalues are greater than 1. Note that for any eigenvalue λ with multiplicity l the linear combination of the corresponding eigenvectors {v1, v2, . . . , vl} is also an eigenvector of the matrix. Therefore, in this case it suffices to bound the difference between the eigenspaces of two matrix. The result of Wedin (1972) again applies to this case and bounds the difference between the eigenspaces in terms of the perturbation ǫ2 and Γσ .\nWe now bound ǫ in terms of ǫ2 and ǫ3.\nLemma 6. Let µmax := maxθ ‖µ(θ)‖, if ǫ2 ≤ 1/2min(Γσ, σmin), then the estimation error ǫ is bounded as\nǫ ≤ ( m\nσmin\n)3/2 ( 10ǫ2 ( 1\nΓσ +\n1\nσmin\n)( ǫ3 + µ 3 max ) + ǫ3 ) .\nProof. Based on the definitions of T and T̂ we have\nǫ = ‖T − T̂‖ = ‖M3(W,W,W )− M̂3(Ŵ , Ŵ , Ŵ )‖ ≤ ‖M3(W,W,W )− M̂3(W,W,W )‖+ ‖M̂3(W,W,W )− M̂3(W,W, Ŵ )‖ + ‖M̂3(W,W, Ŵ )− M̂3(W, Ŵ , Ŵ )‖+ ‖M̂3(W, Ŵ , Ŵ )− M̂3(Ŵ , Ŵ , Ŵ )‖\n= ‖EM3(W,W,W )‖ + ‖M̂3(W,W,W − Ŵ )‖+ ‖M̂3(W,W − Ŵ , Ŵ )‖ + ‖M̂3(W − Ŵ , Ŵ , Ŵ )‖,\n(9)\nwhere EM3 = M3 − M̂3. We now bound the terms in the r.h.s. of Eq. 9 in terms of ǫ3 and ǫ2. We begin by bounding ‖EM3(W,W,W )‖:\n‖EM3(W,W,W )‖ ≤ ‖EM3‖‖W‖3 ≤ ‖EM3‖‖U‖3‖D−1‖3/2 ≤ ‖EM3‖‖U‖3F‖D−1‖3/2\n(1) =\n( m\nσmin\n)3/2 ‖EM3‖ ≤ ( m\nσmin\n)3/2 ǫ3,\n(10)\nwhere in (1) we use the fact that U is an orthonormal matrix and D is diagonal. In the case of ‖M̂3(W,W,W − Ŵ )‖ we have\n‖M̂3(W,W,W − Ŵ )‖ ≤ ‖W‖2‖W − Ŵ‖‖M̂3‖ ≤ ‖W‖2‖W − Ŵ‖(‖M̂3 −M3‖+ ‖M3‖) (1)\n≤ ‖W‖2‖W − Ŵ‖(ǫ3 + µ3max) ≤ ‖W‖2‖UD−1/2 − ÛD̂−1/2‖(ǫ3 + µ3max) ≤ ‖W‖2(‖(U − Û)D−1/2‖+ ‖Û(D̂−1/2 −D−1/2)‖) ( ǫ3 + µ 3 max ) ≤ ‖W‖2 ( ‖U − Û‖√\nσmin + √ m‖D̂−1/2 −D−1/2‖\n) ( ǫ3 + µ 3 max ) .\nwhere in (1) we use the definition of M3 as a linear combination of the tensor product of the means µ(θ). This result combined with the result of Lem. 5 and the fact that ‖W‖ ≤ √ m/σmin (see Eq. 10) implies that\n‖M̂3(W,W,W − Ŵ )‖ ≤ m\nσmin\n( 2 √ mǫ2\nΓσ √ σmin\n+ 2 √ mǫ2\n(σmin)3/2\n)( ǫ3 + µ 3 max )\n≤ 2ǫ2 ( m\nσmin\n)3/2 ( 1\nΓσ +\n1\nσmin\n)( ǫ3 + µ 3 max ) .\n(11)\nLikewise one can prove the following perturbation bounds for M̂3(W,W − Ŵ , Ŵ ) and M̂3(W,W − Ŵ , Ŵ ):\n‖M̂3(W,W − Ŵ , Ŵ )‖ ≤ 2 √ 2ǫ2\n( m\nσmin\n)3/2 ( 1\nΓσ +\n1\nσmin\n)( ǫ3 + µ 3 max )\n‖M̂3(W − Ŵ , Ŵ , Ŵ )‖ ≤ 4ǫ2 ( m\nσmin\n)3/2 ( 1\nΓσ +\n1\nσmin\n)( ǫ3 + µ 3 max ) .\n(12)\nThe result then follows by plugging the bounds of Eq. 10, Eq. 11 and Eq. 12 into Eq. 9.\nWe now prove high-probability bounds on ǫ3 and ǫ2 when M2 and M3 are estimated by sampling.\nLemma 7. For any δ ∈ (0, 1), if M̂2 and M̂3 are computed with samples from j episodes, then we that with probability 1− δ:\nǫ3 ≤ K1.5 √ 6 log(2K/δ)\nj and ǫ2 ≤ 2K\n√ log(2K/δ)\nj .\nProof. Using some norm inequalities for the tensors we obtain\nǫ3 = ‖M3 − M̂3‖ ≤ K1.5‖M3 − M̂3‖max = K1.5max i,j,x |[M3]i,j,x − [M̂3]i,j,x|.\nA similar argument leads to the bound of Kmaxi,j |[M2]i,j− [M̂2]i,j | on ǫ2. One can easily show that, for every 1 ≤ i, j, x ≤ K , the term [M3]i,j,x − [M̂3]i,j,x and [M3]i,j,x − [M̂3]i,j,x can be expressed as a sum of martingale differences with the maximum value 1/j. The result then follows by applying the Azuma’s inequality (e.g., see Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi, 2006, appendix, pg. 361) and taking the union bound.\nWe now draw our attention to the proof of our main result.\nProof of Thm. 2. We begin by deriving the condition of Eq. 5. The assumption on ǫ2 in Lem. 6 and the result of Lem. 7 hold at the same time, w.p. 1− δ, if the following inequality holds\n2K\n√ log(2K/δ)\nj ≤ 1/2min(Γσ, σmin).\nBy solving the bound w.r.t. j we obtain\nj ≥ 16K 2 log(2K/δ)\nmin(Γσ, σmin)2 . (13)\nA similar argument applies in the case of the assumption on ǫ in Thm. 5. The results of Thm. 5 and Lem. 6 hold at the same time if we have\nε ≤ ( mK\nσmin\n)3/2 ( 20ǫ2 ( 1\nΓσ +\n1\nσmin\n) + ǫ3 ) ≤ C1\nλmin m ,\nwhere in the first inequality we used that ε3 ≤ K3/2 and µ3max ≤ K3/2 by their respective definitions. This combined with high probability bounds of Lem. 7 on ǫ1 and ǫ2 implies\n( m\nσmin\n)1.5 ( 20K2.5 √ log(4K/δ)\nj\n( 1\nΓσ +\n1\nσmin\n) +K1.5\n√ 6 log(4K/δ)\nj\n) ≤ C1\nλmin m .\nBy solving this bound w.r.t. j (and some simplifications) we obtain w.p. 1− δ\nj ≥ 43 2m5K6 log(4K/δ)\nC1σ3minλ 2 min\n( 1\nΓσ +\n1\nσmin\n)2 .\nCombining this result with that of Eq.13 and taking the union bound leads to the bound of Eq. 5 on the minimum number of samples.\nWe now draw our attention to the main result of the theorem. We begin by bounding ‖µ(θ)− µ̂(π(θ))‖ in terms of estimation error term ǫ3 and ǫ2:\n‖µ(θ)− µ̂(π(θ))‖ = ‖λ(θ)Bv(θ) − λ̂(π(θ))B̂v̂(π(θ))‖ ≤‖(λ(π(θ)) − λ̂(θ))Bv(π(θ))‖ + ‖λ̂(θ)(B − B̂)v(π(θ))‖ + ‖λ̂(θ)B̂(v(π(θ)) − v̂(θ))‖ ≤|λ(θ) − λ̂(π(θ))|‖B‖ + λ̂(π(θ))‖B − B̂‖+ λ̂(π(θ))‖B̂‖‖v(θ)− v̂(π(θ))‖,\n(14)\nwhere in the last line we rely on the fact that both v(θ) and v̂(π(θ)) are normalized vectors. We first bound the term ‖B − B̂‖: ‖B − B̂‖ = ‖UD1/2 − ÛD̂1/2‖ ≤ ‖(U − Û)D1/2‖+ ‖Û(D1/2 − D̂1/2)‖\n(1) ≤ 2 √ mǫ2σmax Γσ + √ mǫ2 σmax ≤ √mǫ2 ( 2σmax Γσ + 1 σmax ) ,\nwhere in (1) we make use of the result of Lem. 5. Furthermore, we have\n‖B̂‖ = ‖ÛD̂1/2‖ ≤ √ mσ̂max ≤ √ m(σ1/2max + ǫ 1/2 2 ) ≤ √ m(σ1/2max + σ 1/2 min) ≤ √ 2mσmax,\nwhere we used the condition on ǫ2. This combined with Eq.14 and the result of Thm 5 and Lem. 6 implies\n‖µ(π(θ)) − µ̂(θ)‖ (1)\n≤ 5√mσmaxǫ+ √ mǫ2 (λ(θ) + ǫ) ( 2σmax Γσ + 1 σmax ) + 8ǫ λ(θ) √ 2mσmax (λ(θ) + ǫ)\n(2) ≤ 5√mσmaxǫ+ √ mǫ2 ( λ(θ) + 5C1\nσmin m )(2σmax Γσ + 1 σmax ) + 8 √ 2mσmax ( 1 + 5C1 σmin m ) ǫ\n≤ 5√mσmax ( m\nσmin\n)3/2 ( 10ǫ2 ( 1\nΓσ +\n1\nσmin\n)( ǫ3 + µ 3 max ) + ǫ3 )\n+ √ mǫ2 ( λ(θ) + 5C1\nσmin m )(2σmax Γσ + 1 σmax )\n+ 8 √ 2mσmax ( 1 +\n5C1 m\n)( m\nσmin\n)3/2 ( 10ǫ2 ( 1\nΓσ +\n1\nσmin\n)( ǫ3 + µ 3 max ) + ǫ3 ) .\nwhere in (1) we used ||B|| ≤ √mσmax, the bound on λ̂(π(θ)) ≤ λ(θ) + 5ǫ, ‖v(θ) − v̂(π(θ))‖ ≤ 8ǫ/λ(θ), in (2) we used λ(θ) = 1/ √ ρ(θ) ≥ 1 and the condition that ε ≤ 5C1σmin/m. The result then follows by combining this bound with the high probability bound of Lem. 7 and taking union bound as well as collecting the terms."

At episode j, all the arms i /∈ Aj+(Θj+(θ̄j); θ̄j) are never pulled on event E , i.e., Ti,n = 0 with probability 1− δ.\nLemma 11.

At episode j, for any model θ ∈ (Θj+(θ̄j)− Θ̃j(θ̄j)) (i.e., an optimistic model that can be discarded), the number of pulls to any arm i ∈ Aj+(θ; θ̄j) needed before discarding θ is\nT ji,n ≤ 1\n2 ( Γi(θ, θ̄j)/2− εj\n)2 log ( 2mKn2\nδ\n) + 1, (17)\nwith probability 1− δ.\nProof of Lem. 8. We first notice that the algorithm only pulls arms recommended by a model θ ∈ Θjt . Let î∗(θ) = argmaxi Bjt (i; θ) with θ ∈ Θjt , and i ∈ Aj∗(θ; θ̄j). According to the selection process, we have\nBjt (i; θ) < B j t (̂i∗; θ).\nSince θ ∈ Θjt we have that for any i, |µ̂i,t−µ̂ji (θ)| ≤ εi,t+εj which leads to µ̂ji (θ)−εj ≤ µ̂i,t+εi,t. Since µ̂ji (θ)−εj ≤ µ̂ji (θ)+εj , then we have that\nµ̂ji (θ) − εj ≤ min{µ̂i,t + εi,t, µ̂ji (θ) + εj} = Bjt (i; θ).\nFurthermore from the definition of the B-values we deduce that\nBjt (̂i∗; θ) ≤ µ̂jî∗(θ) + ε j.\nBringing together the previous inequalities, we obtain\nµ̂ji (θ) − εj ≤ µ̂jî∗(θ) + ε j .\nwhich is a contradiction with the definition of non-dominated arms Aj∗(Θ; θ̄j).\nProof of Lem. 9. The probability of E1 is computed in Lem. 2 with the difference that now we need an extra union bound over all the models and that the union bound over the arms cannot be restricted to the number of models. The probability of E2 follows from Thm. 2.\nProof of Lem. 10. We first recall that on event E , at any episode j, the actual model θ̄j is always in the active set Θjt . If an arm i is pulled, then according to the selection strategy, there exists a model θ ∈ Θt such that\nBjt (i; θ) ≥ Bjt (̂i∗(θ̄j); θ̄j).\nSince î∗(θ̄j) = argmaxiB j t (i; θ̄ j), then Bjt (̂i∗(θ̄ j); θ̄j) ≥ Bjt (i∗(θ̄j); θ̄j) where i∗(θ̄j) is the true optimal arm of θ̄j . By definition of B(i; θ), on event E we have that Bjt (i∗(θ̄j); θ̄j) ≥ µ∗(θ̄j) and that Bjt (i; θ) ≤ µ̂ji (θ) + εj . Grouping these inequalities we obtain\nµ̂ji (θ) + ε j ≥ µ∗(θ̄j),\nwhich, together with Lem. 8, implies that i ∈ Aj+(θ; θ̄j) and that this set is not empty, which corresponds to θ ∈ Θj+(θ̄j).\nProof of Lem. 11. Let t be the last time arm i is pulled (Ti,t−1 = Ti,n + 1), then according to the selection strategy we have\nBjt (i; θ j t ) ≥ Bjt (̂i∗(θ̄j); θ̄j) ≥ Bjt (i∗; θ̄j),\nwhere i∗ = i∗(θ̄j). Using the definition of B, we have that on event E\nBjt (i∗(θ̄ j); θ̄j) = min { (µ̂ji∗(θ̄ j) + εj); (µ̂i∗,t + εi∗,t) } ≥ µ∗(θ̄j)\nand\nBjt (i; θ j t ) ≤ µ̂i,t + εi,t ≤ µi(θ̄j) + 2εi,t.\nBringing the two conditions together we have\nµi(θ̄ j) + 2εi,t ≥ µ∗(θ̄j) ⇒ 2εi,t ≥ ∆i(θ̄j),\nwhich coincides with the (high-probability) bound on the number of pulls for i using a UCB algorithm and leads to the statement by definition of εi,t.\nProof of Lem. 12. According to Lem. 10, a model θ can only propose arms in Aj+(θ; θ̄j). Similar to the analysis of mUCB, θ is discarded from Θjt with high probability after t steps and j episodes if\n2(εi,t + ε j) ≤ Γi(θ, θ̄j).\nAt round j, if εj ≥ Γi(θ, θ̄j)/2 then the algorithm will never be able to pull i enough to discard θ (i.e., the uncertainty on θ is too large), but since i ∈ Aj∗(θ; θ̄j), this corresponds to the case when θ ∈ Θ̃j(θ̄j). Thus, the condition on the number of pulls to i is derived from the inequality\nεi,t ≤ Γi(θ, θ̄j)/2− εj ."

      "text" : "As discussed in the introduction, transfer in online learning has been rarely studied. In this section we review possible alternatives and a series of settings which are related to the problem we consider in this paper. Models estimation. Although in tUCB we use RTP for the estimation of the model means, a wide number of other algorithms could be used, in particular those based on the method of moments (MoM). Recently a great deal of progress has been made regarding the problem of parameter estimation in LVM based on the method of moments approach (MoM) (Anandkumar et al., 2012c,a,b). The main idea of MoM is to match the empirical moments of the data with the model parameters that give rise\nto nearly the same corresponding population quantities. In general, matching the model parameters to the observed moments may require solving systems of high-order polynomial equations which is often computationally prohibitive. However, for a rich class of LVMs, it is possible to efficiently estimate the parameters only based on the low-order moments (up to the third order) (Anandkumar et al., 2012c). Prior to RTP various scenarios for MoM are considered in the literature for different classes of LVMs using different linear algebra techniques to deal with the empirical moments Anandkumar et al. (2012c,a). The variant introduced in (Anandkumar et al., 2012c, Algorithm B) recovers the matrix of the means {µ(θ)} up to a permutation in columns without any knowledge of ρ. Also, theoretical guarantees in the form of sample complexity bounds with polynomial dependency on the parameters of interest have been provided for this algorithm. The excess correlation analysis (ECA) (Alg. 5 in Anandkumar et al. (2012a)) generalizes the idea of the MoM to the case that ρ is not fixed anymore but sampled from some Dirichlet distribution. The parameters of this Dirichlet distribution is not to be known by the learner.8 In this case again we can apply a variant of MoM to recover the models. Online Multi-task. In the online multi-task learning the task change at each step (n = 1) but at the end of each step both the true label (in the case of online binary classification) and the identity of the task are revealed. A number of works (Dekel et al., 2006; Saha et al., 2011; Cavallanti et al., 2010; Lugosi et al., 2009) focused on this setting and showed how the samples coming from different tasks can be used to perform multi-task learning and improve the worst-case performance of an online learning algorithm compared to using all the samples separately. Contextual Bandit. In contextual bandit (e.g., see Agarwal et al., 2012; Langford and Zhang, 2007), at each step the learner observes a context xt and has to choose the arm which is best for the context. The contexts belong to an arbitrary (finite or continuous) space and are drawn from a stationary distribution. This scenario resembles our setting where tasks arrive in a sequence and are drawn from a ρ. The main difference is that in our setting the learner does not observe explicitly the context and it repeatedly interact with that context for n steps. Furthermore, in general in contextual bandits some similarity between contexts is used, while here the models are completely independent. Non-stationary Bandit. When the learning algorithm does not know when the actual change in the task happens, then the problem reduces to learning in a piece-wise stationary environment. Garivier and Moulines (2011) introduces a modified version of UCB using either a sliding window or discounting to track the changing distributions and they show, when optimally tuned w.r.t. the number of switches R, it achieves a (worst-case) expected regret of order O( √ TR) over a total number of steps T and R switches. Notice that this could be also considered as a partial transfer algorithm. Even in the case when the switch is directly observed, if T is too short to learn from scratch and to identify similarity with other previous tasks, one option is just to transfer the averages computed before the switch. This clearly introduces a transfer bias that could be smaller than the regret cumulated in the attempt of learning from scratch. This is not surprising since transfer is usually employed whenever the number of samples that can be collected from the task at hand is relatively small. If we applied this algorithm to our setting T = nJ and R = J , the corresponding performance would be O(J √ n), which matches the worst-case performance of UCB (and tUCB as well) on J tasks. This result is not surprising since the advantage of knowing the switching points (every n steps) could always be removed by carefully choosing the worst possible tasks. Nonetheless, whenever we are not facing a worst case, the non-stationary UCB would have a much worse performance than tUCB."

Although results in supervised and reinforcement learning show that transfer may significantly improve the learning performance, most of the literature on transfer is focused on batch learning tasks. In this paper we study the problem of sequential transfer in online learning, notably in the multi-armed bandit framework, where the objective is to minimize the cumulative regret over a sequence of tasks by incrementally transferring knowledge from prior tasks. We introduce a novel bandit algorithm based on a method-of-moments approach for the estimation of the possible tasks and derive regret bounds for it.",
