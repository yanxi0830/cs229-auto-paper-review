      "text" : "In many situations where a classifier is to be learned, it is easy to collect unlabeled data but costly to obtain labels. This has motivated the pool-based active learning model, in which a learner has access to a collection of unlabeled data points and is allowed to ask for individual labels in an adaptive manner. The hope is that choosing these queries intelligently will rapidly yield a low-error classifier, much more quickly than with random querying. A central focus of active learning is developing efficient querying strategies and understanding their label complexity.\nOver the past decade or two, there has been substantial progress in developing such rigorously-justified active learning schemes for general concept classes. For the most part, these schemes can be described as mellow: rather than focusing upon maximally informative points, they query any point whose label cannot reasonably be inferred from the information received so far. It is of interest to develop more aggressive strategies with better label complexity.\nAn exception to this general trend is the aggressive strategy of [12], whose label complexity is known to be optimal in its dependence on a key parameter called the splitting index. However, this strategy has been primarily of theoretical interest because it is difficult to implement algorithmically. In this paper, we introduce a variant of the methodology that yields efficient algorithms. We show that it admits roughly the same label complexity bounds as well as having promising experimental performance.\nAs with the original splitting index result, we operate in the realizable setting, where data can be perfectly classified by some function h∗ in the hypothesis class H. At any given time during the active learning process, the remaining candidates—that is, the elements of H consistent with the data so far—are called the version space. The goal of aggressive active learners is typically to pick queries that are likely to shrink this version space rapidly. But what is the right notion of size? Dasgupta [12] pointed out that the diameter of the version space is what matters, where the distance between two classifiers is taken to be the fraction of points on which they make different predictions. Unfortunately, the diameter is a difficult measure to work with because it cannot, in general, be decreased at a steady rate. Thus the earlier work used a procedure that has quantifiable label complexity but is not conducive to implementation.\nWe take a fresh perspective on this earlier result. We start by suggesting an alternative, but closely related, notion of the size of a version space: the average pairwise distance between hypotheses in the version space, with respect to some underlying probability distribution π on H. This distribution π can be arbitrary—that is, there is no requirement that the target h∗ is chosen from it—but should be chosen so\nar X\niv :1\n70 2.\n08 55\n3v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 9\nJ un\n2 01\nthat it is easy to sample from. When H consists of linear separators, for instance, a good choice would be a log-concave density, such as a Gaussian.\nAt any given time, the next query x is chosen roughly as follows:\n• Sample a collection of classifiers h1, h2, . . . , hm from π restricted to the current version space V .\n• Compute the distances between them; this can be done using just the unlabeled points.\n• Any candidate query x partitions the classifiers {hi} into two groups: those that assign it a + label (call these V +x ) and those that assign it a − label (call these V −x ). Estimate the average-diameter after labeling x by the sum of the distances between classifiers hi within V + x , or those within V − x , whichever\nis larger.\n• Out of the pool of unlabeled data, pick the x for which this diameter-estimate is smallest.\nThis is repeated until the version space has small enough average diameter that a random sample from it is very likely to have error less than a user-specified threshold . We show how all these steps can be achieved efficiently, as long as there is a sampler for π.\nDasgupta [12] pointed out that the label complexity of active learning depends on the underlying distribution, the amount of unlabeled data (since more data means greater potential for highly-informative points), and also the target classifier h∗. That paper identifies a parameter called the splitting index ρ that captures the relevant geometry, and gives upper bounds on label complexity that are proportional to 1/ρ, as well as showing that this dependence is inevitable. For our modified notion of diameter, a different averaged splitting index is needed. However, we show that it can be bounded by the original splitting index, with an extra multiplicative factor of log(1/ ); thus all previously-obtained label complexity results translate immediately for our new algorithm."

      "text" : "The theory of active learning has developed along several fronts. One of these is nonparametric active learning, where the learner starts with a pool of unlabeled points, adaptively queries a few of them, and then fills in the remaining labels. The goal is to do this with as few errors as possible. (In particular, the learner does not return a classifier from some predefined parametrized class.) One scheme begins by building a neighborhood graph on the unlabeled data, and propagating queried labels along the edges of this graph [24, 7, 10]. Another starts with a hierarchical clustering of the data and moves down the tree, sampling at random until it finds clusters that are relatively pure in their labels [13]. The label complexity of such methods have typically be given in terms of smoothness properties of the underlying data distribution [6, 22].\nAnother line of work has focused on active learning of linear separators, by querying points close to the current guess at the decision boundary [3, 14, 4]. Such algorithms are close in spirit to those used in practice, but their analysis to date has required fairly strong assumptions to the effect that the underlying distribution on the unlabeled points is logconcave. Interestingly, regret guarantees for online algorithms of this sort can be shown under far weaker conditions [8].\nThe third category of results, to which the present paper belongs, considers active learning strategies for general concept classes H. Some of these schemes [9, 15, 5, 2, 23] are fairly mellow in the sense described earlier, using generalization bounds to gauge which labels can be inferred from those obtained so far. The label complexity of these methods can be bounded in terms of a quantity known as the disagreement coefficient [20]. In the realizable case, the canonical such algorithm is that of [9], henceforth referred to as CAL. Other methods use a prior distribution π over the hypothesis class, sometimes assuming that the target classifier is a random draw from this prior. These methods typically aim to shrink the mass of the version space under π, either greedily and explicitly [11, 19, 18] or implicitly [16]. Perhaps the most widely-used of these methods is the latter, query-by-committee, henceforth QBC. As mentioned earlier, shrinking π-mass is not an optimal strategy if low misclassification error is the ultimate goal. In particular, what matters is not\nthe prior mass of the remaining version space, but rather how different these candidate classifiers are from each other. This motivates using the diameter of the version space as a yardstick, which was first proposed in [12] and is taken up again here."

Thus the worst case error of any hypothesis in the version space is the diameter of the version space. The splitting index roughly characterizes the number of queries required for an active learning algorithm to reduce the diameter of the version space below .\nWhile reducing the diameter of a version space V ⊂ H, we will sometimes identify pairs of hypotheses h, h′ ∈ V that are far apart and therefore need to be separated. We will refer to {h, h′} as an edge. Given a set of edges E = {{h1, h′1}, . . . , {hn, h′n}} ⊂ (H 2 ) , we say a data point x ρ-splits E if querying x separates at least a ρ fraction of the pairs, that is, if\nmax {∣∣E+x |, |E−x ∣∣} ≤ (1− ρ)|E|\nwhere E+x = E ∩ (H+x\n2\n) and similarly for E−x .

The Õ notation hides polylogarithmic factors in d, ρ, τ , log 1/ , and the failure probability δ.\nTheorem 1 (Dasgupta 2005). Suppose H is a hypothesis class with splitting index (ρ, , τ). Then to learn a hypothesis with error ,\n(a) any active learning algorithm with ≤ 1/τ unlabeled samples must request at least 1/ρ labels, and\n(b) if H has VC-dimension d, there is an active learning algorithm that draws Õ(d/(ρτ) log2(1/ )) unlabeled data points and requests Õ((d/ρ) log2(1/ )) labels.\nUnfortunately, the only known algorithm satisfying (b) above is intractable for all but the simplest hypothesis classes: it constructs an -covering of the hypothesis space and queries points which whittle away at the diameter of this covering. To overcome this intractability, we consider a slightly more benign setting in which we have a samplable prior distribution π over our hypothesis space H."

While this potential function may seem strange at first glance, it is closely related to the original splitting index. The following lemma, whose proof is deferred to Section 5, shows the splitting index bounds the average splitting index for any hypothesis class.\nLemma 3. Let π be a probability measure over a hypothesis class H. If H has splitting index (ρ, , τ), then it has average splitting index ( ρ4dlog(1/ )e , 2 , τ).\nDasgupta [12] derived the splitting indices for several hypothesis classes, including intervals and homogeneous linear separators. Lemma 3 implies average splitting indices within a log(1/ ) factor in these settings.\nMoreover, given access to samples from π|V , we can easily estimate the quantities appearing in the definition of average splitting. For an edge sequence E = ({h1, h′1}, . . . , {hn, h′n}), define\nψ(E) := n∑ i=1 d(hi, h ′ i).\nWhen hi, h ′ i are i.i.d. draws from π|V for all i = 1, . . . , n, which we denote E ∼ (π|V )2×n, the random variables ψ(E), ψ(E−x ), and ψ(E + x ) are unbiased estimators of the quantities appearing in the definition of average splitting.\nLemma 4. Given E ∼ (π|V )2×n, we have • E [\n1 nψ(E)\n] = Φ(V ) and\n• E [\n1 nψ(E + x ) ] = π(V +x ) 2 π(V )2 Φ(V + x ) for any x ∈ X . Similarly for E−x and V −x .\nProof. From definitions and linearity of expectations, it is easy to observe E[ψ(E)] = nΦ(V ). By the independence of hi, h ′ i, we additionally have\nE [ 1\nn ψ(E+x )\n] = 1\nn E  ∑ {hi,h′i}∈E + x d(hi, h ′ i)  = 1\nn E  ∑ {hi,h′i}∈E 1[hi ∈ V +x ]1[h′i ∈ V +x ] d(hi, h′i)  = 1\nn ∑ {hi,h′i}∈E ( π(V +x ) π(V ) )2 E [ d(hi, h ′ i) |hi, h′i ∈ V +x ] = ( π(V +x )\nπ(V )\n)2 Φ(V +x ).\nRemark: It is tempting to define average splitting in terms of the average diameter as\nmax{Φ(V +x ),Φ(V −x )} ≤ (1− ρ)Φ(V ).\nHowever, this definition does not satisfy a nice relationship with the splitting index. Indeed, there exist hypothesis classes V for which there are many points which 1/4-split E for any E ⊂ ( V 2 ) but for which every x ∈ X satisfies max{Φ(V +x ),Φ(V −x )} ≈ Φ(V ).\nThis observation is formally proven in the appendix."

First note that by halving ρ̂t at each step, we immediately give up a factor of two in our approximation. This can be made smaller by taking narrower steps. Additionally, with a constant factor increase in mt and nt, the approximation ratios in Lemma 5 can be set to any constant.\nRemark 2: At first glance, it appears that select requires us to know ρ in order to calculate δ0. However, a crude lower bound on ρ suffices. Such a bound can always be found in terms of . This is because any version space is ( /2, , /2)-splittable [12, Lemma 1]. By Lemma 3, so long as τ is less than /4, we can substitute 8dlog(2/ )e for ρ in when we compute δ0.\nProof of Theorem 6. Let T := dlog(1/ρ)e+ 1. By Lemma 5, we know that for rounds t = 1, . . . , T , we don’t return any point which does worse than ρ̂t/2-average splits V with probability 1 − δ/2. Moreover, in the T -th round, it will be the case that ρ/4 ≤ ρ̂T ≤ ρ/2, and therefore, with probability 1− δ/2, we will select a point which does no worse than ρ̂T /2-average split V , which in turn does no worse than ρ/8-average split V .\nNote that we draw mt+nt hypotheses at each round.

Intuitively, splittability says that for any set of large edges there are many data points which remove a significant fraction of them. One may suspect this should imply that if a set of edges is large on average, then there should be many data points which remove a significant fraction of their weight.

Then Hoeffding’s inequality [21], combined with Lemma 4, tells us that there exist sequences n, δn ↘ 0 such that with probability at least 1− 3δn, the following hold simultaneously:\n• Φ(V )− n ≤ 1nψ(E) ≤ Φ(V ) + n,\n• 1nψ(E + x ) ≥\nπ(V +x ) 2\nπ(V )2 Φ(V + x )− n, and\n• 1nψ(E − x ) ≥\nπ(V −x ) 2\nπ(V )2 Φ(V − x )− n.\nFor n small enough, we have that Φ(V ) − n > 2 . Combining the above with Lemma 9, we have with probability at least τ − 3δn,\nmax\n{ π(V +x ) 2\nπ(V )2 Φ(V +x ),\nπ(V −x ) 2\nπ(V )2 Φ(V −x )\n} − n ≤ 1\nn max{ψ(E+x ), ψ(E−x )}\n≤ (\n1− ρ 4dlog(1/ )e\n) ψ(E)\nn ≤ (\n1− ρ 4dlog(1/ )e\n) (Φ(V ) + n).\nBy taking n→∞, we have n, δn ↘ 0, giving us the lemma."

      "text" : "We compared DBAL against the baseline passive learner as well as two other generic active learning strategies: CAL and QBC. CAL proceeds by randomly sampling a data point and querying it if its label cannot be inferred from previously queried data points. QBC uses a prior distribution π and maintains a version space V . Given a randomly sampled data point x, QBC samples two hypotheses h, h′ ∼ π|V and queries x if h(x) 6= h′(x).\nWe tested on two hypothesis classes: homogeneous, or through-the-origin, linear separators and k-sparse monotone disjunctions. In each of our simulations, we drew our target h∗ from the prior distribution. After each query, we estimated the average diameter of the version space. We repeated each simulation several times and plotted the average performance of each algorithm.\nHomogeneous linear separators The class of d-dimensional homogeneous linear separators can be identified with elements of the d-dimensional unit sphere. That is, a hypothesis h ∈ Sd−1 acts on a data point x ∈ Rd via the sign of their inner product:\nh(x) := sign(〈h, x〉).\nIn our simulations, both the prior distribution and the data distribution are uniform over the unit sphere. Although there is no known method to exactly sample uniformly from the version space, Gilad-Bachrach et al. [17] demonstrated that using samples generated by the hit-and-run Markov chain works well in practice. We adopted this approach for our sampling tasks.\nFigure 1 shows the results of our simulations on homogeneous linear separators.\nSparse monotone disjunctions A k-sparse monotone disjunction is a disjunction of k positive literals. Given a Boolean vector x ∈ {0, 1}n, a monotone disjunction h classifies x as positive if and only if xi = 1 for some positive literal i in h.\nIn our simulations, each data point is a vector whose coordinates are i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables with parameter p. The prior distribution is uniform over all k-sparse monotone disjunctions. When k is constant, it is possible to sample from the prior restricted to the version space in expected polynomial time using rejection sampling.\nThe results of our simulations on k-sparse monotone disjunctions are in Figure 2."

      "text" : "Remark from Section 3\nIn Section 3, the remark after the definition of average splitting stated that there exist hypothesis classes V for which there are many points which 1/4-split E for any E ⊂ ( V 2 ) but for which any x ∈ X satisfies\nmax{Φ(V +x ),Φ(V −x )} ≈ Φ(V ).\nHere we formally prove this statement. Consider the hypothesis class of homogeneous linear separators and let V = {e1, . . . , en} ⊂ H where ek is the k-th unit coordinate vector. Let the data distribution be uniform over the n-sphere and the prior distribution π be uniform over V . As a subset of the homogeneous linear separators, V has splitting index (1/4, ,Θ( )) [12, Theorem 10].\nOn the other hand, for any i 6= j, d(hi, hj) = 1/2. This implies that\nΦ(V ) = Pr(h 6= h′)Eh,h′ [d(h, h′) |h 6= h′] = n− 1\n2n .\nMoreover, any query x ∈ X eliminates at most half the hypotheses in V in the worst case. Therefore, for all x ∈ X ,\nmax{Φ(V +x ),Φ(V −x )} ≥ (n/2− 1)\n2(n/2) = ( n− 2 n− 1 ) Φ(V ).\nProofs of Lemma 5 and Lemma 7\nThe proofs in this section rely crucially on two concentration inequalities. The first is due to Hoeffding [21].\nLemma 10 (Hoeffding 1963). Let X1, . . . , Xn be i.i.d. random variables taking values in [0, 1] and let X = ∑ Xi and µ = E[X]. Then for t > 0,\nPr(X − µ ≥ t) ≤ exp ( −2t 2\nn ) Our other tool will be the following multiplicative Chernoff-Hoeffding bound due to Angluin and Valiant\n[1].\nLemma 11 (Angluin and Valiant 1977). Let X1, . . . , Xn be i.i.d. random variables taking values in [0, 1] and let X = ∑ Xi and µ = E[X]. Then for 0 < β < 1,\n(i) Pr(X ≤ (1− β)µ) ≤ exp ( −β\n2µ 2\n) and\n(ii) Pr(X ≥ (1 + β)µ) ≤ exp ( −β\n2µ 3\n) .\nWe now turn to the proof of Lemma 5.\nLemma 5. Let ρ, , δ0 > 0 be given. Suppose that version space V satisfies Φ(V ) > . In select, fix a round t and data point x ∈ X that exactly ρ-average splits V (that is, max{π|V (V +x )2Φ(V +x ), π|V (V −x )2Φ(V −x )} = (1− ρ)Φ(V )). If mt ≥ 48ρ̂2t log 4 δ0 and nt ≥ max { 32 ρ̂2t Φ̂t , 40 Φ̂2t } log 4δ0 then with probability 1− δ0,\n(a) Φ̂t ≥ (1− ρ̂t/4)Φ(V );\n(b) if ρ ≤ ρ̂t/2, then 1nt max {ψ(E + x ), ψ(E − x )} > (1− ρ̂t)Φ̂t; and\n(c) if ρ ≥ 2ρ̂t, then 1nt max {ψ(E + x ), ψ(E − x )} ≤ (1− ρ̂t)Φ̂t.\nProof. In round t, let ρ̂ := ρ̂t, Φ̂ := Φ̂t, m := mt, and n := nt.\nFor (a), recall Φ̂ = 1mψ(E ′) for E′ ∼ (π|V )2×m. By Lemma 11, we have for β0 > 0\nPr ( (1− β0)Φ(V ) ≤ Φ̂ ≤ (1 + β0)Φ(V ) ) ≥ 1− 2 exp ( −mβ 2 0\n3\n) .\nTaking m ≥ 3 β20\nlog (\n4 δ0\n) , we have the above probability is at least 1− δ0/2. Let us condition on this event\noccurring. To see (b), say w.l.o.g. ( π(V +x ) π(V ) )2 Φ(V +x ) = (1− ρ)Φ(V ). Then, we have\nPr\n( 1\nn ψ(E+x ) ≤ (1− ρ̂)Φ̂\n) ≤ Pr ( 1\nn ψ(E+x ) ≤ (1− ρ̂)(1 + β0)Φ(V )\n) .\nTaking β such that (1− β)(1− ρ) = (1− ρ̂)(1 + β0), we have by Lemma 11 (i),\nPr\n( 1\nn ψ(E+x ) ≤ (1− ρ̂)Φ̂\n) ≤ Pr ( 1\nn ψ(E+x ) ≤ (1− β)(1− ρ)Φ(V ) ) ≤ exp ( −nβ\n2(1− ρ)Φ(V ) 2 ) ≤ exp ( −n(1− ρ)Φ̂\n2(1 + β0) · [ 1− (1− ρ̂)(1 + β0) 1− ρ ]2)\n≤ exp ( −n(1− ρ̂/2)Φ̂ 2(1 + β0) · [ 1− (1− ρ̂)(1 + β0) 1− ρ̂/2 ]2) .\nTaking β0 ≤ ρ̂/4, the above is less than exp ( −nΦ̂ρ̂ 2\n32\n) . With n as in the lemma statement and combined\nwith our results on the concentration of Φ̂, we have that with probability 1− δ0\n1 n max\n{ ψ(E+x ), ψ(E − x ) } > (1− ρ̂)Φ̂.\nTo see (c), suppose now that w.l.o.g. ( π(V −x ) π(V ) )2 Φ(V −x ) ≤ ( π(V +x ) π(V ) )2 Φ(V +x ) = (1 − ρ)Φ(V ). We need to\nconsider two cases.\nCase 1: ρ ≤ 1/2. Taking β such that (1 + β)(1− ρ) = (1− ρ̂)(1− β0), we have by Lemma 11 (ii),\nPr\n( 1\nn ψ(E+x ) > (1− ρ̂)Φ̂\n) ≤ Pr ( 1\nn ψ(E+x ) > (1− ρ̂)(1− β0)Φ(V ) ) = Pr ( 1\nn ψ(E+x ) > (1 + β)(1− ρ)Φ(V ) ) ≤ exp ( −nβ\n2(1− ρ)Φ(V ) 3 ) ≤ exp ( −n(1− ρ)Φ̂\n3(1 + β0) · [ (1− ρ̂)(1− β0) 1− ρ − 1 ]2)\n≤ exp ( − nΦ̂ 6(1 + β0) · [ (1− ρ̂)(1− β0) 1− 2ρ̂ − 1 ]2) .\nTaking β0 ≤ ρ̂/4, the above is less than exp ( −nΦ̂ρ̂ 2\n12\n) .

Taking β0 ≤ 1/16, we have\nPr\n( 1\nn ψ(E+x ) > (1− ρ̂)Φ̂\n) ≤ Pr ( 1\nn ψ(E+x ) > (1− ρ̂)(1− β0)Φ(V ) ) = Pr ( 1\nn ψ(E+x ) > (1− ρ)Φ(V ) + ((1− ρ̂)(1− β0)− (1− ρ))Φ(V ) ) ≤ Pr ( 1\nn ψ(E+x ) > (1− ρ)Φ(V ) + (ρ− ρ̂− β0)Φ(V ) ) ≤ Pr ( 1\nn ψ(E+x ) > (1− ρ)Φ(V ) + (ρ 2 − β0 ) Φ(V ) ) ≤ Pr ( 1\nn ψ(E+x ) > (1− ρ)Φ(V ) +\n( 1\n4 − β0\n) Φ(V ) ) ≤ Pr ( 1\nn ψ(E+x ) > (1− ρ)Φ(V ) + 1 4 − β0 1 + β0 Φ̂ ) ≤ Pr ( 1\nn ψ(E+x ) > (1− ρ)Φ(V ) +\n3\n17 Φ̂\n)\nBy Lemma 10, the above is less than exp ( −nΦ̂ 2\n40\n) . Because ( π(V −x ) π(V ) )2 Φ(V −x ) ≤ ( π(V +x ) π(V ) )2 Φ(V +x ), we also\ncan say\nPr\n( 1\nn ψ(E−x ) > (1− ρ̂)Φ̂\n) ≤ exp ( −nΦ̂ 2\n40\n) .\nRegardless of which case we are in, we have for n as in the lemma statement, with probability 1− δ0,\n1 n max\n{ ψ(E+x ), ψ(E − x ) } ≤ (1− ρ̂)Φ̂.\nWe next provide the proof of Lemma 7.\nLemma 7. The following holds for DBAL:\n(a) Suppose that for all t = 1, 2, . . . ,K that Φ(Vt) > . Then the probability that the termination condition is ever true for any of those rounds is bounded above by K exp ( − n32 ) .\n(b) Suppose that for some t = 1, 2, . . . ,K that Φ(Vt) ≤ /2. Then the probability that the termination condition is not true in that round is bounded above by K exp ( − n48 ) .\nProof. Recall that the termination condition from DBAL is 1nψ(E) < 3 4 for E ∼ (π|V ) 2×n. Part (a) follows from plugging in β = 14 into Lemma 11 (i) and taking a union bound over rounds 1, . . . ,K. Similarly, part (b) follows from plugging in β = 14 into Lemma 11 (ii) and taking a union bound over rounds 1, . . . ,K."
