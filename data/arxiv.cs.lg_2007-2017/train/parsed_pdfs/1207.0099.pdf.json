      "text" : "When estimating a quantity consisting of two elements, a two-stage approach of first estimating the two elements separately and then approximating the target quantity based on the estimates of the two elements often performs poorly, because the first stage is carried out without regard to the second stage and thus a small error incurred in the first stage can cause a big error in the second stage. To cope with this problem, it would be more appropriate to directly estimate the target quantity in a single-shot process without separately estimating the two elements.\nA seminal example that follows this general idea is pattern recognition by the support vector machine (Boser et al., 1992; Cortes & Vapnik, 1995; Vapnik, 1998): Instead of separately estimating two probability distributions of patterns for positive and negative classes, the support vector machine directly learns the boundary between the two classes that is sufficient for pattern recognition. More recently, a problem of estimating the ratio of two probability densities was tackled in a similar fashion (Qin, 1998; Sugiyama et al., 2008; Gretton et al., 2009; Kanamori et al., 2009; Nguyen et al., 2010; Kanamori et al., 2012; Sugiyama et al., 2012b; Sugiyama et al., 2012a): The ratio of two probability densities is directly estimated without going through separate estimation of the two probability densities.\nIn this paper, we further explore this line of research, and propose a method for directly estimating the difference between two probability densities in a single-shot process. Density differences are useful for various purposes such as class-balance estimation under class-prior change (Saerens et al., 2002; Du Plessis & Sugiyama, 2012), change-point detection in time series (Kawahara & Sugiyama, 2012; Liu et al., 2012), feature extraction (Torkkola, 2003), video-based event detection (Matsugu et al., 2011), flow cytometric data analysis (Duong et al., 2009), ultrasound image segmentation (Liu et al., 2010), non-rigid image registration (Atif et al., 2003), and image-based target recognition (Gray\n& Principe, 2010).\nFor this density-difference estimation problem, we propose a single-shot method, called the least-squares density-difference (LSDD) estimator, that directly estimates the density difference without separately estimating two densities. LSDD is derived within a framework of kernel least-squares estimation, and its solution can be computed analytically in a computationally efficient and stable manner. Furthermore, LSDD is equipped with crossvalidation, and thus all tuning parameters such as the kernel width and the regularization parameter can be systematically and objectively optimized. We derive a finite-sample error bound for the LSDD estimator in a non-parametric setup and show that it achieves the optimal convergence rate.\nWe also apply LSDD to L2-distance estimation and show that it is more accurate than the difference of KDEs, which tends to severely under-estimate the L2-distance (Anderson et al., 1994). Compared with the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (Kullback & Leibler, 1951), the L2-distance is more robust against outliers (Basu et al., 1998; Scott, 2001; Besbeas & Morgan, 2004).\nFinally, we experimentally demonstrate the usefulness of LSDD in semi-supervised\nclass-prior estimation and unsupervised change detection.\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we derive the LSDD method and investigate its theoretical properties. In Section 3, we show how the L2distance can be approximated by LSDD. In Section 4, we illustrate the numerical behavior of LSDD. Finally, we conclude in Section 5."

For Gaussian kernels, the KDE-based density-difference estimator is given by\nf̃(x) := p̂(x)− p̂′(x),\nwhere\np̂(x) := 1\nn(2πσ2)d/2\nn∑\ni=1\nexp ( −‖x− xi‖ 2\n2σ2\n) ,\np̂′(x) := 1\nn′(2πσ′2)d/2\nn′∑\ni′=1\nexp ( −‖x− x ′ i′‖2\n2σ′2\n) .\nThe Gaussian widths σ and σ′ may be determined based on cross-validation (Härdle et al.,\n2004).\nHowever, we argue that the KDE-based density-difference estimator is not the best approach because of its two-step nature: Small estimation error in each density estimate can cause a big error in the final density-difference estimate. More intuitively, good density estimators tend to be smooth and thus a density-difference estimator obtained from such smooth density estimators tends to be over-smoothed (Hall & Wand, 1988; Anderson et al., 1994, see also numerical experiments in Section 4.1.1).\nTo overcome this weakness, we give a single-shot procedure of directly estimating the\ndensity difference f(x) without separately estimating the densities p(x) and p′(x)."

To achieve the optimal rate by KDE, we should choose a kernel specifically tailored to each regularity α (Parzen, 1962). But such a kernel is not non-negative and it is difficult to implement in practice. On the other hand, our LSDD estimator can always achieve the optimal learning rate with a Gaussian kernel without regard to regularity α.\n1Because our theoretical result is highly technical, we only describe a rough idea here. More precise statement of the result and its complete proof are provided in Appendix A, where we utilize the mathematical technique developed in Eberts and Steinwart (2011) for a regression problem."

      "text" : "Eq.(9) and Eq.(10) themselves give approximations to L2(p, p′). Nevertheless, we argue that the use of their combination, defined by\nL̂2(X ,X ′) := 2ĥ⊤θ̂ − θ̂⊤Hθ̂, (11)\nis more sensible. To explain the reason, let us consider a generalized L2-distance estimator of the following form:\nβĥ ⊤ θ̂ + (1− β)θ̂⊤Hθ̂, (12)\nwhere β is a real scalar. If the regularization parameter λ (≥ 0) is small, then Eq.(12) can be expressed as\nβĥ ⊤ θ̂ + (1− β)θ̂⊤Hθ̂ = ĥ⊤H−1ĥ− λ(2− β)ĥ⊤H−2ĥ+ op(λ), (13)\nwhere op denotes the probabilistic order (its derivation is given in Appendix B).\nThus, the bias introduced by regularization (i.e., the second term in the right-hand side of Eq.(13) that depends on λ) can be eliminated if β = 2, which yields Eq.(11). Note that, if no regularization is imposed (i.e., λ = 0), both Eq.(9) and Eq.(10) yield ĥ ⊤ H−1ĥ, the first term in the right-hand side of Eq.(13).\nEq.(11) is actually equivalent to the negative of the optimal objective value of the LSDD optimization problem without regularization (i.e., Eq.(4) with λ = 0). This can be naturally interpreted through a lower bound of L2(p, p′) obtained by Legendre-Fenchel\nconvex duality (Rockafellar, 1970):\nL2(p, p′) = sup g\n[ 2 (∫ g(x)p(x)dx− ∫ g(x)p′(x)dx ) − ∫ g(x)2dx ] ,\nwhere the supremum is attained at g = f . If the expectations are replaced by empirical estimators and the linear-in-parameter model (2) is used as g, the above optimization problem is reduced to the LSDD objective function without regularization (see Eq.(4)). Thus, LSDD corresponds to approximately maximizing the above lower bound and Eq.(11) is its maximum value.\nThrough eigenvalue decomposition of H , we can show that\n2ĥ ⊤ θ̂ − θ̂⊤Hθ̂ ≥ ĥ⊤θ̂ ≥ θ̂⊤Hθ̂.\nThus, our approximator (11) is not less than the plain approximators (9) and (10).\n3.3 Further Bias Correction\nĥ ⊤ H−1ĥ, the first term in Eq.(13), is an essential part of the L2-distance estimator (11). However, it is actually a slightly biased estimator of the target quantity h⊤H−1h (= θ∗⊤Hθ∗ = h⊤θ∗):\nE[ĥ ⊤ H−1ĥ] = h⊤H−1h+ tr ( H−1 ( 1\nn V p +\n1\nn′ V p′\n)) , (14)\nwhere E denotes the expectation over all samples X = {xi}ni=1 and X ′ = {x′i′}n ′ i′=1, and V p and V p′ are defined by Eq.(6) (its derivation is given in Appendix C).\nThe second term in the right-hand side of Eq.(14) is an estimation bias that is generally non-zero. Thus, based on Eq.(14), we can construct a bias-corrected L2-distance estimator\nas\nL̃2(X ,X ′) := 2ĥ⊤θ̂ − θ̂⊤Hθ̂ − tr ( H−1 ( 1\nn V̂ p +\n1\nn′ V̂ p′\n)) , (15)\nwhere V̂ p is an empirical estimator of covariance matrix V p:\nV̂ p := 1\nn\nn∑\ni=1\n( ψ(xi)− ψ̂p )( ψ(xi)− ψ̂p )⊤ ,\nand ψ̂p is an empirical estimator of the expectation ψp:\nψ̂p := 1\nn\nn∑\ni=1\nψ(xi).\nThe true L2-distance is non-negative by definition (see Eq.(8)), but the above biascorrected estimate can take a negative value. Following the same line as Baranchik (1964), the positive-part estimator may be more accurate:\nL 2 (X ,X ′) := max { 0, L̃2(X ,X ′) } .\nHowever, in our preliminary experiments, L 2 (X ,X ′) does not always perform well particularly when H is ill-conditioned. For this reason, we practically propose to use L̂2(X ,X ′) defined by Eq.(11)."

Let\np(x) = N(x; (µ, 0, . . . , 0)⊤, (4π)−1Id),\np′(x) = N(x; (0, 0, . . . , 0)⊤, (4π)−1Id),\nwhere N(x;µ,Σ) denotes the multi-dimensional normal density with mean vector µ and variance-covariance matrix Σ with respect to x, and Id denotes the d-dimensional identity matrix.\nWe first illustrate how LSDD and KDE behave under d = 1 and n = n′ = 200. Figure 1 depicts the data samples, densities and density difference estimated by KDE, and density difference estimated by LSDD for µ = 0 (i.e., f(x) = p(x)− p′(x) = 0). This shows that LSDD gives a more accurate estimate of the density difference f(x) than KDE. Figure 2 depicts the results for µ = 0.5 (i.e., f(x) 6= 0), showing again that LSDD performs well.\nNext, we compare the L2-distance approximator based on LSDD and that based on KDE. For µ = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and d = 1, 5, we draw n = n′ = 200 samples from the above p(x) and p′(x). Figure 3 depicts the mean and standard error of estimated L2-distances over 100 runs as functions of mean µ. When d = 1, the LSDD-based L2distance estimator gives accurate estimates of the true L2-distance, whereas the KDEbased L2-distance estimator slightly underestimates the true L2-distance. This is caused by the fact that KDE tends to provide smoother density estimates (see Figure 2(c) again). Such smoother density estimates are accurate as density estimates, but the difference of smoother density estimates yields a smaller L2-distance estimate (Anderson et al., 1994).\nThis tendency is more significant when d = 5; the KDE-based L2-distance estimator severely underestimates the true L2-distance, which is a typical drawback of the twostep procedure. On the other hand, the LSDD-based L2-distance estimator still gives reasonably accurate estimates of the true L2-distance even when d = 5.\n4.1.2 L2-Distance vs. KL-Divergence\nThe Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (Kullback & Leibler, 1951) is a popular divergence measure for comparing probability distributions. The KL-divergence from p(x) to p′(x) is defined as\nKL(p‖p′) := ∫ p(x) log p(x)\np′(x) dx.\nFirst, we illustrate the difference between the L2-distance and the KL-divergence. For\nd = 1, let\np(x) = (1− η)N(x; 0, 12) + ηN(x;µ, 1/42),\np′(x) = N(x; 0, 12).\nImplications of the above densities are that samples drawn from N(x; 0, 12) are inliers, whereas samples drawn from N(x;µ, 1/42) are outliers. We set the outlier rate at η = 0.1 and the outlier mean at µ = 0, 2, 4, . . . , 10 (see Figure 4).\nFigure 5 depicts the L2-distance and the KL-divergence for outlier mean µ = 0, 2, 4, . . . , 10. This shows that both the L2-distance and the KL-divergence increase as µ increases. However, the L2-distance is bounded from above, whereas the KL-divergence diverges to infinity as µ tends to infinity. This result implies that the L2-distance is less sensitive to outliers than the KL-divergence, which well agrees with the observation given in Basu et al. (1998).\nNext, we draw n = n′ = 100 samples from p(x) and p′(x), and estimate the L2-distance by LSDD and the KL-divergence by the Kullback-Leibler importance estimation procedure2 (KLIEP) (Sugiyama et al., 2008; Nguyen et al., 2010). Figure 6 depicts the estimated L2-distance and KL-divergence for outlier mean µ = 0, 2, 4, . . . , 10 over 100 runs. This shows that both LSDD and KLIEP reasonably capture the profiles of the true L2-distance and the KL-divergence, although the scale of KLIEP values is much different from the true values (see Figure 5) because the estimated normalization factor was unreliable.\nFinally, based on the permutation test procedure (Efron & Tibshirani, 1993), we conduct hypothesis testing of the null hypothesis that densities p and p′ are the same. More specifically, we first compute a distance estimator for the original datasets X and X ′ and obtain D̂(X ,X ′). Next, we randomly permute the |X ∪ X ′| samples, and assign the first |X | samples to a set X̃ and the remaining |X ′| samples to another set X̃ ′. Then we compute the distance estimator again using the randomly permuted datasets X̃ and X̃ ′ and obtain D̃(X̃ , X̃ ′). Since X̃ and X̃ ′ can be regarded as being drawn from the same distri2Estimation of the KL-divergence from data has been extensively studied recently (Wang et al., 2005; Sugiyama et al., 2008; Pérez-Cruz, 2008; Silva & Narayanan, 2010; Nguyen et al., 2010). Among them, KLIEP was shown to possess a superior convergence property and demonstrated to work well in practice. KLIEP is based on direct estimation of density ratio p(x)/p′(x) without density estimation of p(x) and p′(x).\nbution, D̃(X̃ , X̃ ′) would take a value close to zero. This random permutation procedure is repeated many times, and the distribution of D̃(X̃ , X̃ ′) under the null hypothesis (i.e., the two distributions are the same) is constructed. Finally, the p-value is approximated by evaluating the relative ranking of D̂(X ,X ′) in the histogram of D̃(X̃ , X̃ ′). We set the significance level at 5%.\nFigure 7 depicts the rejection rate of the null hypothesis for outlier rate η = 0.1 and outlier mean µ = 0, 2, 4, . . . , 10, based on the L2-distance estimated by LSDD and the KL-divergence estimated by KLIEP. This shows that the KLIEP-based test rejects the null hypothesis more frequently for large µ, whereas the rejection rate of the LSDD-based test is kept almost constant even when µ is changed. This result implies that the twosample test by LSDD is more robust against outliers (i.e., two distributions tend to be regarded as the same even in the presence of outliers) than the KLIEP-based test.\nFigure 8 depicts the rejection rate of the null hypothesis for outlier mean µ = 10 for outlier rate η = 0, 0.05, 0.1, . . . , 0.35. When η = 0 (i.e., no outliers), both the LSDD-based test and the KLIEP-based test accept the null hypothesis with the designated significance level approximately. When η = 0.1, the LSDD-based test still keeps a low rejection rate, whereas the KLIEP-based test tends to reject the null hypothesis. When η ≥ 0.3, the LSDD-based test and the KLIEP-based test tend to reject the null hypothesis in a similar way."

      "text" : "The objective of change detection is to discover abrupt property changes behind timeseries data.\nLet y(t) ∈ Rm be an m-dimensional time-series sample at time t, and let\nY (t) := [y(t)⊤,y(t+ 1)⊤, . . . ,y(t+ k − 1)⊤]⊤ ∈ Rkm\nbe a subsequence of time series at time t with length k. We treat the subsequence Y (t) as a sample, instead of a single point y(t), by which time-dependent information can be incorporated naturally (Kawahara & Sugiyama, 2012). Let Y(t) be a set of r retrospective subsequence samples starting at time t:\nY(t) := {Y (t),Y (t+ 1), . . . ,Y (t+ r − 1)}.\nOur strategy is to compute a certain dissimilarity measure between two consecutive segments Y(t) and Y(t+r), and use it as the plausibility of change points (see Figure 11). As a dissimilarity measure, we use the L2-distance estimated by LSDD and the KL-divergence\nestimated by the KL importance estimation procedure (KLIEP) (Sugiyama et al., 2008; Nguyen et al., 2010). We set k = 5 and r = 50.\nFirst, we use the IPSJ SIG-SLP Corpora and Environments for Noisy Speech Recognition (CENSREC) dataset4 provided by the National Institute of Informatics, Japan, which records human voice in a noisy environment such as a restaurant. The top graph in Figure 12(a) displays the original time-series, where true change points were manually annotated. The bottom two graphs in Figure 12(a) plot change scores obtained by KLIEP and LSDD, showing that the LSDD-based change score indicates the existence of change points more clearly than the KLIEP-based change score.\nNext, we use a dataset taken from the Human Activity Sensing Consortium (HASC) challenge 2011 5, which provides human activity information collected by portable threeaxis accelerometers. Because the orientation of the accelerometers is not necessarily fixed, we take the ℓ2-norm of the 3-dimensional data. The top graph in Figure 12(b) displays the original time-series for a sequence of actions “jog”, “stay”, “stair down”, “stay”, and “stair up” (there exists 4 change points at time 540, 1110, 1728, and 2286). The bottom two graphs in Figure 12(b) depict the change scores obtained by KLIEP and LSDD, showing that the LSDD score is much more stable and interpretable than the KLIEP score."

      "text" : "In this paper, we proposed a method for directly estimating the difference between two probability density functions without density estimation. The proposed method, called the least-squares density-difference (LSDD), was derived within a framework of kernel least-squares estimation, and its solution can be computed analytically in a computation-\n4http://research.nii.ac.jp/src/en/CENSREC-1-C.html 5http://hasc.jp/hc2011/\nally efficient and stable manner. Furthermore, LSDD is equipped with cross-validation, and thus all tuning parameters such as the kernel width and the regularization parameter can be systematically and objectively optimized. We showed the asymptotic normality of LSDD in a parametric setup and derived a finite-sample error bound for LSDD in a non-parametric setup. In both cases, LSDD achieves the optimal convergence rate.\nWe also proposed an L2-distance estimator based on LSDD, which nicely cancels a bias caused by regularization. The LSDD-based L2-distance estimator was experimentally shown to be more accurate than the difference of kernel density estimators and more robust against outliers than Kullback-Leibler divergence estimation.\nDensity-difference estimation is a novel research paradigm in machine learning, and we have given a simple but useful method for this emerging topic. Our future work will develop more powerful algorithms for density-difference estimation and explores a variety of applications."

The densities are bounded: There exists M such that\n‖p‖∞ ≤ M and ‖p′‖∞ ≤ M.\nThe density difference f = p− p′ is a member of Besov space with regularity α: f ∈ Bα2,∞ and, for r = ⌊α⌋+ 1 where ⌊α⌋ denotes the largest integer less than or equal to α,\n‖f‖Bα2,∞ := ‖f‖L2(Rd) + sup t>0 (t−αωr,L2(Rd)(f, t)) < c,\nwhere Bα2,∞ is the Besov space with regularity α and ωr,L2(Rd) is the r-th modulus of smoothness (see Eberts and Steinwart (2011) for the definitions).\nThen we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 2. Suppose Assumption 1 is satisfied. Then, for all ǫ > 0 and p ∈ (0, 1), there exists a constant K > 0 depending on M, c, ǫ, p such that for all n ≥ 1, τ ≥ 1, and λ > 0, the LSDD estimator f̂ in Hγ satisfies\n‖f̂ − f‖2L2(Rd)+λ‖f̂‖2Hγ ≤ K ( λγ−d+γ2α+ γ−(1−p)(1+ǫ)d λpn + γ− 2(1−p)d 1+p (1+ǫ+ 1−p 4 )\nλ 3p−p2 1+p n 2 1+p\n+ τ n2λ + τ n\n) ,\nwith probability not less than 1− 4e−τ .\nTo prove this, we utilize the technique developed in Eberts and Steinwart (2011) for\na regression problem.\nProof. First, note that\n‖f̂‖2L2(Rd) − 2Qnf̂ + ‖f‖2L2(Rd) + λ‖f̂‖2Hγ ≤ ‖f0‖2L2(Rd) − 2Qnf0 + ‖f‖2L2(Rd) + λ‖f0‖2Hγ .\nTherefore, we have\n‖f̂ − f‖2L2(Rd) + λ‖f̂‖2Hγ\n= ‖f̂‖2L2(Rd) − 2Qnf̂ + ‖f‖2L2(Rd) + 2(Qn −Q)f̂ + λ‖f̂‖2Hγ ≤ ‖f0‖2L2(Rd) − 2Qnf0 + ‖f‖2L2(Rd) + 2(Qn −Q)f̂ + λ‖f̂‖2Hγ = ‖f0‖2L2(Rd) − 2Qf0 + ‖f‖2L2(Rd) + 2(Qn −Q)(f̂ − f0) + λ‖f̂‖2Hγ = ‖f0 − f‖2L2(Rd) + 2(Qn −Q)(f̂ − f) + 2(Qn −Q)(f − f0) + λ‖f̂‖2Hγ . (16)\nLet\nK(x) :=\nr∑\nj=1\n( r\nj\n) (−1)1−j 1\njd\n( 2\nγ √ π\n) d 2\nexp ( −2‖x‖ 2\nj2γ2\n) ,\nand f̃(x) := (γ √ π)− d 2 f . Using K and f̃ , we define\nf0 := K ∗ f̃ := ∫\nRd\nf̃(y)K(x− y)dy,\ni.e., f0 is the convolution of K and f̃ . Because of Lemma 2 in Eberts and Steinwart (2011), we have f0 ∈ Hγ and\n‖f0‖Hγ ≤ (2r − 1)‖f̃‖L2(Rd) (∵ Lemma 2 of Eberts and Steinwart (2011))\n≤ (2r − 1)(γ √ π)− d 2‖f‖L2(Rd) ≤ (2r − 1)(γ √ π)− d 2 (‖p‖L2(Rd) + ‖p′‖L2(Rd)) ≤ (2r − 1)(γ √ π)− d 22 √ M. (17)\nMoreover, Lemma 3 in Eberts and Steinwart (2011) gives\n‖f0‖∞ ≤ (2r − 1)‖f‖∞ ≤ (2r − 1)M, (18)\nand Lemma 1 in Eberts and Steinwart (2011) yields that there exists a constant Cr,2 such that\n‖f0 − f‖2L2(Rd) ≤ Cr,2ω2r,L2(Rd)(f, γ\n2 ) ≤ Cr,2c2γ2α. (19)\nNow, following a similar line to Theorem 3 in Eberts and Steinwart (2011), we can\nshow that, for all ǫ > 0 and p ∈ (0, 1), there exists a constant Cǫ,p such that\n|(Pn − P )(f̂ − f)| ≤ f̂ − f.\nTo bound this, we derive the tail probability of\n(Pn − P ) (\nf̂ − f ‖f̂ − f‖2\nL2(Rd) + λ‖f̂‖2Hγ + r\n) ,\nwhere r > 0 is a positive real such that r > r∗ for\nr∗ = min f∈Hγ ‖f − f‖2L2(Rd) + λ‖f‖2Hγ .\nLet\ngf,r = f − f\n‖f − f‖2 L2(Rd) + λ‖f‖2Hγ + r\nfor f ∈ Hγ and r > r∗. Then we have\n‖gf,r‖∞ ≤ ‖f‖∞ + ‖f‖∞\n‖f − f‖2 L2(Rd) + λ‖f‖2Hγ + r\n≤ ‖f‖Hγ + ‖f‖∞‖f − f‖2 L2(Rd) + λ‖f‖2Hγ + r ≤ 1 λ‖f‖Hγ + r/‖f‖Hγ + M r ≤ 1 2 √ rλ + M r ,\nand\nPg2f,r = P (f − f)2\n(‖f − f‖2 L2(Rd) + λ‖f‖2Hγ + r)2 ≤ M‖f − f‖2L2(Rd) (‖f − f‖2 L2(Rd) + λ‖f‖2Hγ + r)2 ≤ M r .\nHere, let\nFr := {f ∈ Hγ | ‖f − f‖2L2(Rd) + λ‖f‖2Hγ ≤ r},\nand we assume that there exists a function such that\nE [ sup f∈Fr |(Pn − P )(f − f)| ] ≤ ϕn(r),\nwhere E denotes the expectation over all samples. Then, by the peeling device (see Theorem 7.7 in Steinwart & Christmann, 2008), we have\nE sup f∈Hγ\n|(Pn − P )gf,r| ≤ 8ϕ(r)\nr .\nTherefore, by Talagrand’s concentration inequality, we have\nPr [ sup f∈Hγ |(Pn − P )gf,r| < 10ϕn(r) r + √ 2Mτ nr + 14τ 3n ( 1 2 √ rλ + M r )] ≥ 1− e−τ , (20)\nwhere Pr[·] denotes the probability of an event.\nFrom now on, we give an upper bound of ϕn. The RKHS Hγ can embedded in arbitrary Sobolev space Wm(Rd). Indeed, by the proof of Theorem 3.1 in Steinwart and Scovel (2004), we have\n‖f‖Wm(Rd) ≤ Cmγ− m 2 + d 4 ‖f‖Hγ\nfor all f ∈ Hγ. Moreover, the theories of interpolation spaces give that, for all f ∈ Wm(Rd), the supremum norm of f can be bounded as\n‖f‖∞ ≤ C ′m‖f‖ 1− d 2m L2(Rd) ‖f‖ d 2m Wm(Rd) ,\nif d < 2m. Here we set m = d 2p . Then we have\n‖f‖∞ ≤ C ′′p‖f‖1−pL2(Rd)‖f‖ p Hγ γ− d(1−p) 4 .\nNow, since Fr ⊂ (r/λ)1/2BHγ and\nP (f − f)2 ≤ M‖f − f‖2L2(Rd) ≤ Mr for f ∈ Fr\nhold from Theorem 7.16 and Theorem 7.34 in Steinwart and Christmann (2008), we can take\nϕn(r) = max { C1,p,ǫγ − (1−p)(1+ǫ)d 2\n( r λ ) p 2 (Mr) 1−p 2 n−1/2,\nC2,p,ǫγ −\n(1−p)(1+ǫ)d 1+p ( r λ ) p 1+p [( r λ ) p 2 γ− d(1−p) 4 r 1−p 2 ] 1−p 1+p n−1/(1+p) } ,\nwhere ǫ > 0 and p ∈ (0, 1) are arbitrary and C1,p,ǫ, C2,p,ǫ are constants depending on p, ǫ. In the same way, we can also obtain a bound of supf∈Hγ |(P ′n − P ′)gf,r|.\nIf we set r to satisfy\n1 8 ≥ 10ϕn(r) r +\n√ 2Mτ\nnr +\n14τ\n3n\n( 1\n2 √ rλ\n+ M\nr\n) , (21)\nthen we have\n|(Qn −Q)(f̂ − f)| ≤ 1\n4\n( r + ‖f̂ − f‖2L2(Rd) + λ‖f̂‖Hγ ) , (22)\nwith probability 1− 2e−τ . To satisfy Eq.(21), it suffices to set\nr = C\n( γ−(1−p)(1+ǫ)d\nλpn +\nγ− 2(1−p)d 1+p (1+ǫ+ 1−p 4 )\nλ 3p−p2 1+p n 2 1+p\n+ τ\nn2λ +\nτ n\n) , (23)\nwhere C is a sufficiently large constant depending on M, ǫ, p.\nFinally, we bound the term (Qn −Q)(f0 − f). By Bernstein’s inequality, we have\n|(Pn − P )(f0 − f)| ≤ C ( ‖f − f0‖L2(P ) √ τ\nn +\n2rMτ\nn\n)\n≤ C (√ 2M‖f − f0‖L2(Rd) √ τ\nn +\n2rMτ\nn\n)\n≤ C ( ‖f − f0‖2L2(Rd) + 2Mτ\nn +\n2rMτ\nn\n) , (24)\nwith probability 1 − e−τ , where C is a universal constant. In a similar way, we can also obtain\n|(P ′n − P ′)(f0 − f)| ≤ C ( ‖f − f0‖2L2(Rd) + 2Mτ\nn +\n2rMτ\nn\n) .\nCombining these inequalities, we have\n|(Qn −Q)(f0 − f)| ≤ C ( ‖f − f0‖2L2(Rd) + 2rMτ\nn\n) , (25)\nwith probability 1− 2e−τ , where C is a universal constant.\nSubstituting Eqs.(22) and (25) into Eq.(16), we have\n‖f̂ − f‖2L2(Rd) + λ‖f̂‖2Hγ\n≤ 2 { ‖f0 − f‖2L2(Rd) + C ( ‖f − f0‖2L2(Rd) + 2rMτ\nn\n) + r + λ‖f0‖Hγ } ,\nwith probability 1− 4e−τ . Moreover, by Eqs.(19) and (17), the right-hand side is further bounded by\n‖f̂ − f‖2L2(Rd) + λ‖f̂‖2Hγ ≤ C { γ2α + r + λγ−d + 1 + τ\nn\n} ,\nFinally, substituting (23) into the right-hand side, we have\n‖f̂ − f‖2L2(Rd) + λ‖f̂‖2Hγ\n≤ C { γ2α + γ−(1−p)(1+ǫ)d\nλpn +\nγ− 2(1−p)d 1+p (1+ǫ+ 1−p 4 )\nλ 3p−p2 1+p n 2 1+p\n+ λγ−d + τ\nλn2 +\nτ n\n} ,\nwith probability 1− 4e−τ for τ ≥ 1. This gives the assertion.\nIf we set\nλ = n− 2α+d (2α+d)(1+p)+(ǫ−p+ǫp) , γ = n− 1 (2α+d)(1+p)+(ǫ−p+ǫp) ,\nand take ǫ, p sufficiently small, then we immediately have the following corollary.\nCorollary 1. Suppose Assumption 1 is satisfied. Then, for all ρ, ρ′ > 0, there exists a constant K > 0 depending on M, c, ρ, ρ′ such that for all n ≥ 1, τ ≥ 1, the densitydifference estimator f̂ with appropriate choice of γ and λ satisfies\n‖f̂ − f‖2L2(Rd) + λ‖f̂‖2Hγ ≤ K ( n− 2α 2α+d +ρ + τ\nn1−ρ′\n) , (26)\nwith probability not less than 1− 4e−τ .\nNote that n− 2α\n2α+d is the optimal learning rate to estimate a function in Bα2,∞ (Eberts\n& Steinwart, 2011). Therefore, the density-difference estimator with a Gaussian kernel achieves the optimal learning rate by appropriately choosing the regularization parameter and the Gaussian width. Because the learning rate depends on α, the LSDD estimator has an adaptivity to the smoothness of the true function.\nOur analysis heavily relies on the techniques developed in Eberts and Steinwart (2011) for a regression problem. The main difference is that the analysis in their paper involves a clipping procedure, which stems from the fact that the analyzed estimator requires an empirical approximation of the expectation of the square term. The Lipschitz continuity of the square function f 7→ f 2 is utilized to investigate this term, and the clipping procedure is used to ensure the Lipschitz continuity. On the other hand, in the current paper, we can exactly compute ‖f‖2 L2(Rd) so that we do not need the Lipschitz continuity.\nB Derivation of Eq.(13)\nWhen λ (≥ 0) is small, (H + λIb)−1 can be expanded as\n(H + λIb) −1 =H−1 − λH−2 + op(λ),\nwhere op denotes the probabilistic order. Then Eq.(12) can be expressed as\nβĥ ⊤ θ̂ + (1− β)θ̂⊤Hθ̂\n= βĥ ⊤ (H + λIb) −1 ĥ+ (1− β)ĥ⊤ (H + λIb)−1H (H + λIb)−1 ĥ = βĥ ⊤ H−1ĥ− λβĥ⊤H−2ĥ\n+ (1− β)ĥ⊤H−1ĥ− 2λ(1− β)ĥ⊤H−2ĥ+ op(λ)\n= ĥ ⊤ H−1ĥ− λ(2− β)ĥ⊤H−2ĥ+ op(λ),\nwhich concludes the proof.\nC Derivation of Eq.(14)\nBecause E[ĥ] = h, we have\nE[ĥ ⊤ H−1ĥ− h⊤H−1h] = E[(ĥ− h)⊤H−1(ĥ− h)]\n= tr ( H−1E[(ĥ− h)(ĥ− h)⊤] )\n= tr ( H−1 ( 1\nn V p[ψ] +\n1 n′ V p′[ψ]\n)) ,\nwhich concludes the proof."

    "abstractText" : "We address the problem of estimating the difference between two probability densities. A naive approach is a two-step procedure of first estimating two densities separately and then computing their difference. However, such a two-step procedure does not necessarily work well because the first step is performed without regard to the second step and thus a small error incurred in the first stage can cause a big error in the second stage. In this paper, we propose a single-shot procedure for directly estimating the density difference without separately estimating two densities. We derive a non-parametric finite-sample error bound for the proposed single-shot density-difference estimator and show that it achieves the optimal convergence rate. The usefulness of the proposed method is also demonstrated experimentally.",
