      "text" : "State-space models (SSMs) are a widely used class of models that have found success in applications as diverse as robotics, ecology, finance and neuroscience (see, e.g., Brown et al. [3]). State-space models generalize other popular time series models such as linear and nonlinear auto-regressive models: (N)ARX, (N)ARMA, (G)ARCH, etc. [21].\nIn this article we focus on Bayesian learning of nonparametric nonlinear state-space models. In particular, we use sparse Gaussian processes (GPs) [19] as a convenient method to encode general assumptions about the dynamical system such as continuity or smoothness. In contrast to conventional parametric methods, we allow the user to easily trade off model capacity and computation time. Moreover, we present a variational training procedure that allows very complex models to be learned without risk of overfitting.\nOur variational formulation leads to a tractable approximate posterior over nonlinear dynamical systems. This approximate posterior can be used to compute fast probabilistic predictions of future trajectories of the dynamical system. The computational complexity of our learning approach is linear in the length of the time series. This is possible thanks to the use of variational sparse GPs [22] which lead to a smoothing problem for the latent state trajectory in a simpler auxiliary dynamical system. Smoothing in this auxiliary system can be carried out with any conventional technique (e.g. sequential Monte Carlo). In addition, we present a stochastic variational inference procedure [10] to accelerate learning for long time series and we also present an online learning scheme.\nThis work is useful in situations where: 1) it is important to know how uncertain future predictions are, 2) there is not enough knowledge about the underlying nonlinear dynamical system to create a principled parametric model, and 3) it is necessary to have an explicit model that can be used to simulate the dynamical system into the future. These conditions arise often in engineering and finance. For instance, consider an autonomous aircraft adapting its flight control when carrying a large external load of unknown weight and aerodynamic characteristics. A model of the nonlinear dynamics of the new system can be very useful in order to automatically adapt the control strategy. When few data points are available, there is high uncertainty about the dynamics. In this situation,\nar X\niv :1\n40 6.\n49 05\nv2 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n3 N\nov 2\n01 4\na model that quantifies its uncertainty can be used to synthesize control laws that avoid the risks of overconfidence.\nThe problem of learning flexible models of nonlinear dynamical systems has been tackled from multiple perspectives. Ghahramani and Roweis [9] presented a maximum likelihood approach to learn nonlinear SSMs based on radial basis functions. This work was later extended by using a parameterized Gaussian process point of view and developing tailored filtering algorithms [6, 7, 23]. Approximate Bayesian learning has also been developed for parameterized nonlinear SSMs [5, 24].\nWang et al. [25] modeled the nonlinear functions in SSMs using Gaussian processes (GP-SSMs) and found a MAP estimate of the latent variables and hyperparameters. Their approach preserved the nonparametric properties of Gaussian processes. Despite using MAP learning over state trajectories, overfitting was not an issue since it was applied in a dimensionality reduction context where the latent space of the SSM was much smaller than the observation space. In a similar vein, [4, 12] presented a hierarchical Gaussian process model that could model linear dynamics and nonlinear mappings from latent states to observations. More recently, Frigola et al. [8] learned GP-SSMs in a fully Bayesian manner by employing particle MCMC methods to sample from the smoothing distribution. However, their approach led to predictions with a computational cost proportional to the length of the time series.\nIn the rest of this article, we present an approach to variational Bayesian learning of flexible nonlinear state-space models which leads to a simple representation of the posterior over nonlinear dynamical systems and results in predictions having a low computational complexity."

      "text" : "We consider discrete-time nonlinear state-space models built with deterministic functions and additive noise\nxt+1 = f(xt) + vt, (1a) yt = g(xt) + et. (1b)\nThe dynamics of the system are defined by the state transition function f(xt) and independent additive noise vt (process noise). The states xt ∈ RD are latent variables such that all future variables are conditionally independent on the past given the present state. Observations yt ∈ RE are linked to the state via another deterministic function g(xt) and independent additive noise et (observation noise). State-space models are stochastic dynamical processes that are useful to model time series y , {y1, ...,yT }. The deterministic functions in (1) can also take external known inputs (such as control signals) as an argument but, for conciseness, we will omit those in our notation.\nA traditional approach to learn f and g is to restrict them to a family of parametric functions. This is particularly appropriate when the dynamical system is very well understood, e.g. orbital mechanics of a spacecraft. However, in many applications, it is difficult to specify a class of parametric models that can provide both the ability to model complex functions and resistance to overfitting thanks to an easy to specify prior or regularizer. Gaussian processes do have these properties: they can represent functions of arbitrary complexity and provide a straightforward way to specify assumptions about those unknown functions, e.g. smoothness. In the light of this, it is natural to place Gaussian process priors over both f and g [25]. However, the extreme flexibility of the two Gaussian processes leads to severe nonidentifiability and strong correlations between the posteriors of the two unknown functions. In the rest of this paper we will focus on a model with a GP prior over the transition function and a parametric likelihood. However, our variational formulation can also be applied to the double GP case (see supplementary material).\nA probabilistic state-space model with a Gaussian process prior over the transition function and a parametric likelihood is specified by\nf(x) ∼ GP ( mf (x), kf (x,x ′) ) , (2a)\nxt | ft ∼ N (xt | ft,Q), (2b) x0 ∼ p(x0) (2c)\nyt | xt ∼ p(yt | xt,θy), (2d) where we have used ft , f(xt−1). Since f(x) ∈ RD, we use the convention that the covariance function kf returns a D×D matrix. We group all hyperparameters into θ , {θf ,θy,Q}. Note that\nwe are not restricting the likelihood (2d) to any particular form. The joint distribution of a GP-SSM is\np(y,x, f) = p(x0) T∏ t=1 p(yt|xt)p(xt|ft)p(ft|f1:t−1,x0:t−1), (3)\nwhere we use the convention f1:0 = ∅ and omit the conditioning on θ in the notation. The GP on the transition function induces a distribution over the latent function values with the form of a GP predictive:\np(ft|f1:t−1,x0:t−1) = N ( mf (xt−1) + Kt−1,0:t−2K −1 0:t−2,0:t−2(f1:t−1 −mf (x0:t−2)),\nKt−1,t−1 −Kt−1,0:t−2K−10:t−2,0:t−2K>t−1,0:t−2 ) , (4)\nwhere the subindices of the kernel matrices indicate the arguments to the covariance function necessary to build each matrix, e.g. Kt−1,0:t−2 = [kf (xt−1,x0) . . . kf (xt−1,xt−2)]. When t = 1, the distribution is that of a GP marginal p(f1|x0) = N (mf (x0), kf (x0,x0)). Equation (3) provides a sequential procedure to sample state trajectories and observations. GPSSMs are doubly stochastic models in the sense that one could, at least notionally, first sample a state transition dynamics function from eq. (2a) and then, conditioned on that function, sample the state trajectory and observations.\nGP-SSMs are a very rich prior over nonlinear dynamical systems. In Fig. 1 we illustrate this concept by showing state trajectories sampled from a GP-SSM with fixed hyperparameters. The dynamical systems associated with each of these trajectories are qualitatively very different from each other. For instance, the leftmost panel shows the dynamics of an almost linear non-oscillatory system whereas the rightmost panel corresponds to a limit cycle in a nonlinear system. Our goal in this paper is to use this prior over dynamical systems and obtain a tractable approximation to the posterior over dynamical systems given the data."

      "text" : "Variational inference [1] is a popular method for approximate Bayesian inference based on making assumptions about the posterior over latent variables that lead to a tractable lower bound on the evidence of the model (sometimes referred to as ELBO). Maximizing this lower bound is equivalent to minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximate posterior and the exact one. Following standard variational inference methodology, [1] we obtain the evidence lower bound of a GP-SSM augmented with inducing points\nlog p(y|θ) ≥ ∫ x,f ,u q(x, f ,u) log p(u)p(x0) ∏T t=1 p(ft|f1:t−1,x0:t−1,u)p(yt|xt)p(xt|ft) q(x, f ,u) . (7)\nIn order to achieve tractability, we use a variational distribution that factorizes as\nq(x, f ,u) = q(u)q(x) T∏ t=1 p(ft|f1:t−1,x0:t−1,u), (8)\nwhere q(u) and q(x) can take any form but the terms relating to f are taken to match those of the prior (3). As a consequence, the difficult p(ft|...) terms inside the log cancel out and lead to the following lower bound\nL(q(u), q(x),θ) = −KL(q(u)‖p(u)) +H(q(x)) + ∫ x q(x) log p(x0)\n+ T∑ t=1 {∫ x,u q(x)q(u) ∫ ft\np(ft|xt−1,u) log p(xt|ft)︸ ︷︷ ︸ Φ(xt,xt−1,u) +\n∫ x q(x) log p(yt|xt) } (9)\nwhere KL denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence and H the entropy. The integral with respect to ft can be solved analytically: Φ(xt,xt−1,u) = − 12 tr(Q\n−1Bt−1) + logN (xt|At−1u,Q) where At−1 = Kt−1,uK −1 u,u, and Bt−1 = Kt−1,t−1 −Kt−1,uK−1u,uKu,t−1.\nAs in other variational sparse GP methods, the choice of variational distribution (8) gives the ability to precisely learn the latent function at the locations of the inducing inputs. Away from those locations, the posterior takes the form of the prior conditioned on the inducing variables. By increasing the number of inducing variables, the ELBO can only become tighter [22]. This offers a straightforward trade-off between model capacity and computation cost without increasing the risk of overfitting."

The optimal distribution q∗(x) is equivalent to the smoothing distribution of an auxiliary parametric state-space model. The auxiliary model is simpler than the original one in (3) since the latent states factorize with a Markovian structure. Equation (12) can be interpreted as a nonlinear state-space model with a Gaussian state transition density, N (xt|At−1µ,Q), and a likelihood augmented with an additional term: exp{− 12 tr ( Q−1(Bt−1 + At−1ΣA T t−1) ) }.\nSmoothing in nonlinear Markovian state-space models is a standard problem in the context of time series modeling. There are various existing strategies to find the smoothing distribution which could be used depending on the characteristics of each particular problem [20]. For instance, in a mildly nonlinear system with Gaussian noise, an extended Kalman smoother can have very good performance. On the other hand, problems with severe nonlinearities and/or non-Gaussian likelihoods can lead to heavily multimodal smoothing distributions that are better represented using particle methods. We note that the application of sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) is particularly straightforward in the present auxiliary model."

We propose a hybrid variational-sampling approach whereby approximate samples from q∗(x) are obtained with a sequential Monte Carlo smoother. However, as discussed in section 3.4, depending on the characteristics of the dynamical system, other smoothing methods could be more appropriate [20]. As an alternative to smoothing on the auxiliary dynamical system in (12), one could force a q(x) from a particular family of distributions and optimise the evidence lower bound with respect to its variational parameters. For instance, we could posit a Gaussian q(x) with a sparsity pattern in the covariance matrix assuming zero covariance between non-neighboring states and maximize the ELBO with respect to the variational parameters.\nWe use stochastic gradient descent [10] to maximize the ELBO (where we have plugged in the optimal q∗(u) [22]) by using its gradient with respect to the hyperparameters. Both quantities are stochastic in our hybrid approach due to variance introduced by the sampling of q∗(x). In fact, vanilla sequential Monte Carlo methods will result in biased estimators of the gradient and the parameters of q∗(u). However, in our experiments this has not been an issue.

Since both q∗(u) and ∂L∂θ/z1:M depend linearly on q(x) via sufficient statistics that contain a summation over all elements in the state trajectory, we can obtain unbiased estimates of these sufficient statistics by using one or multiple segments of the sequence that are sampled uniformly at random. However, obtaining q(x) also requires a time complexity of O(T ). Yet, in practice, q(x) can be approximated by running the smoothing algorithm locally around those segments. This can be justified by the fact that in a time series context, the smoothing distribution at a particular time is not largely affected by measurements that are far into the past or the future [20].

(10) and the optimal variational distribution of the emission inducing variables is a Gaussian distribution\nq∗(v) ∝ p(v) T∏ t=1 exp{〈logN (yt|Ct v,R)〉q(xt)} (27)\nwhere\nCt = Kt,vK −1 v,v, Dt = Kt,t −Kt,vK−1v,vKv,t.\nThe optimal variational distribution of the state trajectory is\nq∗(x) ∝ p(x0) T∏ t=1 exp{−1 2 tr(Q−1(Bt−1 + At−1ΣAt−1 T ))− 1 2 tr(R−1(Dt + CtΛCt T ))}\nN (xt|At−1µ,Q)N (yt|Ctν,R), (28)\nwhere we have used q(v) = N (ν,Λ)."
