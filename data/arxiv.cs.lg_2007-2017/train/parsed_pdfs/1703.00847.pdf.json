      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION Networks underpin a powerful framework for modeling and analysis of large scale dynamical systems. Applications include neuroscience [1], financial markets [2], protein dynamics [3], climate sciences [4] and the power grid [5]. Moreover, networks play an indispensable role in building foundational aspects of control theory [6], statistical inference [7] and optimization theory[8]. The compactness of representation and the capability of unveiling influences, cause-effect relationships and dependencies amongst many variables are some of the key attributes enabled by network based approaches [9], [10]. An essential aspect of many studies is to determine a graphical representation of how multiple sub-systems/agents interact from measured time series data. It is often the case that active manipulation of the system is prohibited or not possible; for example, in financial markets the prices of stocks are available as data but it is not possible (or not allowed) to manipulate the prices. In many cases, the influences between sub-systems/ agents is mutual, thus separating source and destination or cause and effect in such cases is not meaningful.\nIn this article, we are concerned with the task of unveiling the network topology that relates multiple linear dynamical systems from temporal data, where it is not possible to excite the system externally. Here, we assume that the underlying network is bi-directed, that is, the influences between agents is mutual and describing cause-effect relationships is not obvious. We further restrict the study to systems where the interaction flow is well characterized by a tree structure.\n1Saurav Talukdar is with Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA, sauravtalukdar@umn.edu\n2Deepjyoti Deka is with Los Alamos National Lab, Los Alamos, USA, deepjyoti@lanl.gov\n3Donatello Materassi is with Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, USA, dmateras@utk.edu\n4Murti V. Salapaka is with Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Minneapolis, USA, murtis@umn.edu\nLearning the structure of a network of static random variables is an active research area in many fields since almost half a century [10], [9], [11], [12], [13]. Recently, there has been growing interest on determining the structure of a network of dynamically related systems. Network reconstruction for a collection of wide sense stationary processes related by linear dynamical systems is approached using inverse of the power spectral density matrix in [14], Wiener filtering in [15], [16] and mutual information in [17]. Our work builds on [15], where it is shown that multivariate Wiener filtering recovers the Markov blanket of each node in the network which includes spurious edges in addition to the true edges in the underlying network. The main contribution of this article is a method that eliminates the spurious links to obtain an exact reconstruction of the underlying topology for dynamical systems that have bi-directional interactions with the interaction topology described by a tree. We instantiate the motivation and the results to a power grid. The theory and results are inspired by [18] where aspects of the power grid are modeled in a static framework.\nThe power grid is a large engineered infrastructural network that has facilitated uninterrupted availability of energy fueling huge technological advances. Power distribution systems, which consist of the medium and low-voltage lines that connect the distribution substations to the end-users are structurally characterized by interconnections that can be modeled via a radial topology [19]. The radial topology may be altered over time by changing the operational lines selected from a set of permissible lines, while maintaining the tree structure [20] (see Fig. 1). In recent years, the proliferation of smart controllable devices and household generators has led to greater focus on the estimation and control of the distribution system. A critical need, here, is the accurate estimation of the current radial topology that may change over time due to unreported maintenance or faults. The estimation problem is further exacerbated by\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n00 84\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\nM ar\n2 01\n7\nthe historical low-penetration of real-time line meters in the distribution grid. The challenge is being partly met by the use of advanced meters like PMUs (Phase Measurement Units) [21] and distribution micro-PMUs [22] that provide high fidelity measurements of the state of the buses. Prior research directions in this area include learning using inverse covariance matrices [23], trends in voltage variance [20], [24], [25], graphical model learning [18] and maximum likelihood schemes [26]. However, the above indicated studies assume the measured data to be independent samples from a static distribution. Such an assumption may not be accurate as fast sampled (sub-sec sampling) data in the grid arise from the evolution of states that are not static but dynamic. Here, we avoid the static assumption and consider the nodal measurements to arise from the swing dynamics in the power grid [5]. Under the dynamical framework, we apply our analytical development pertinent to bi-directed dynamically related processes, to provably learn the correct radial topology of the grid. We demonstrate the performance of our learning framework on IEEE test dynamic networks.\nIn the next section we introduce notions from graph theory, which are utilized later, following which we introduce the framework of Linear Dynamic Graphs in Section III. In Section IV the Wiener filtering based network topology reconstruction algorithm is discussed. Then we present results and algorithms to obtain an exact reconstruction for a tree topology in Section V, after which we introduce the swing dynamics of a network of generators in Section VI to illustrate the algorithms presented with examples in Section VII. We end with conclusions in Section VIII."

      "text" : "In this section, basic notions of graph theory that are useful for the subsequent development are recalled [27].\nDefinition 1 (Directed and Undirected Graphs): An undirected graph G is a pair (V,A) where V is a set of vertices or nodes and A is a set of edges or arcs, which are unordered subsets (i, j), i, j ∈ V . We refer to j as the neighbor of i and vice versa. If arcs in A are ordered, it is called a directed (or oriented) graph.\nDefinition 2 (Topology of a graph): Given an oriented graph G = (V,A), its topology top(G) is defined as the undirected graph G′ = (V,A′) that is obtained by removing the orientation on all its edges, and avoiding repetition. For an undirected graph G, top(G) = G. An example of a directed graph is represented in Figure 2(a) with its topology in Figure 2(b).\nDefinition 3 (Two Hop Neighbor): In the undirected graph top(G) = (V,A ′ ), k ∈ V is a two hop neighbor\nof i ∈ V , if there is a j ∈ V such that (i, j) ∈ A′ and (j, k) ∈ A′ .\nDefinition 4 (Children, Parents and Kins): In a directed graph G = (V,A), for a node j ∈ V , the children of j are defined as CG(j) := {i|(i, j) ∈ A} and the parents of j as PG(j) := {i|(j, i) ∈ A}. Kins of j ∈ V are defined as, KG(j) := {i|i 6= j and i ∈ CG(j) ∪ ∪ PG(j) ∪ PG(CG(j))}. Note that the kin relation is a symmetric relationship; i ∈ KG(j) if and only if j ∈ KG(i).\nDefinition 5 (Kin-graph): Given an oriented graph G = (V,A), its kin-graph is the undirected graph G̃ = (V, Ã), where\nÃ := {(i, j)|i ∈ KG(j), j ∈ V }, and is denoted as kin(G) := G̃.\nDefinition 6: (Path) A path is a non empty undirected graph P = (V,E) with V = {x0, x1, · · · , xk} and E = {(x0, x1), (x1, x2), · · · , (xk−1, xk)}. We will denote a path by x0 − x1 − x2 − · · · − xk−1 − xk.\nDefinition 7: (Cycle) A path P of length at least 2 with the edge set {(x0, x1), (x1, x2), · · · , (xk−1, xk), (xk, x0)} is a cycle.\nDefinition 8: (Connectedness) A non-empty undirected graph G := (V,A) is connected if for any a, c ∈ V there exists a path of the form a− b1 − b2 − · · · − bm − c in G.\nDefinition 9: (Tree) A connected undirected graph without cycles is called a tree. There is a unique path between any two nodes in a tree.\nDefinition 10: (Leaf Node/ Non leaf Node of a Tree) In a tree T , a node with degree 1 is called a leaf node. Nodes with degree greater than 1 are called non leaf nodes."

      "text" : "In this section we introduce a class of models for the description of a network of JWSS (Jointly Wide Sense Stationary) processes. The node dynamics of the j− th node is given by:\nxj = ej + m∑\ni=1,i6=j Hji(z)xi, j = 1, 2, · · · ,m.\nIf an agent i ‘influences’another agent j, that is, Hji(z) 6= 0, a directed edge is drawn from i to j and a directed graph is obtained. The noise component at each node ej is assumed to be zero mean WSS and uncorrelated with {ek}mk=1,k 6=j .\nDefinition 11 (Linear Dynamic Graph [15]): A Linear Dynamic Graph G is defined as a pair (H(z), E) where • E = (e1 ... em)′ is a vector of m uncorrelated WSS\nprocesses {ej}mj=1. Thus, the power spectral density matrix of E, ΦE(z) is a diagonal matrix of size m×m. • H(z) is a m×m matrix of stable transfer functions in F such that diagonal entries H(j, j)(z) = 0, for j = 1, ...,m and H(j, i)(z) = Hji(z), i 6= j is the (j, i) entry of H(z). A compact expression for the output processes {xj}mj=1 of the LDG is,\nX(k) = H(z)X(k) + E(k), (1)\nwhere X = [x1, · · · , xm]′. Let V := {x1, ..., xm} and let A := {(xj , xi)|Hji(z) 6= 0}. The pair G = (V,A) is the associated directed graph of the LDG. Nodes and edges of a LDG refer to the nodes and edges of the graph G. A LDG (H(z), E) is well-posed if each entry of (I−H(z))−1 is stable and topologically detectable if Φej (e\nιω) > 0 for any ω ∈ [−π, π] and j = 1, ...,m. In this article we focus on a restricted class of LDGs; bi-directed LDGs, which is defined below.\nDefinition 12 (bi-directed LDG): A LDG (H(z), E) whose associated graph is bidirectional is called a bidirected LDG. Note that in an bi-directed LDG Hji(z) 6= 0 almost surely implies that Hij(z) 6= 0 almost surely. The associated graph of a bi-directed LDG could be interpreted as an undirected graph (see Figure 3 (b))."

      "text" : "In this section we present Algorithm 1, which recovers the kin-graph of the underlying LDG from the observed data using multivariate Wiener filtering [15]. The multivariate Wiener filter of estimating xj from xj := {x1, ..., xj−1, xj+1, ..., xm} is given by, Wj(z) = [Wj1(z) ... Wjj−1(z) Wjj+1(z) · · ·Wjm(z)] = Φxjxj (z)Φ −1 xjxj (z).\nAlgorithm 1 Topology Learning using Wiener Filtering Input: Time series xi for nodes i ∈ {1, 2, ...,m} Output: The kin graph of T , T ′ = (V, ET ′).\n1: Edge set ET ′ ← {} 2: for all j ∈ {1, 2, ...,m} do 3: Compute Wj(z) 4: for all i ∈ {1, 2, ...,m}, i 6= j do 5: if Wji(z) 6= 0 then 6: ET ′ ← ET ′ ∪ {(i, j)} 7: end if 8: end for 9: end for\nRemark 1: It is proven in [15] that if Wji(z) 6= 0 then i and j are kins. The converse is also true except for pathological cases (see [15]). Thus, we assume our LDG transfer functions are not from the pathological set, thereby enabling Algorithm 1 to recover the kin graph of the LDG. The kin graph obtained after application of Algorithm 1 is an undirected graph, hence, direction of the link cannot be inferred from the output of Algorithm 1. Note that Algorithm 1 is driven by the power spectral density matrices, which can be computed solely from the measured data.\nConsider a bi-directed LDG (H(z), E) with the associated undirected graph G = (V,A). Let the output of the LDG be given by X = (x1, ..., xm)′. The Wiener filtering based topology reconstruction leads to an undirected graph G ′ = (V,A′) such that A′ = A ∪ {edges between two hop neighbors in G}."

      "heading" : "V. NETWORK RECONSTRUCTION FOR BI-DIRECTED LDGS WITH TREE TOPOLOGY",
      "text" : "In this section we restrict our to attention to bi-directed LDGs whose underlying topology is a tree T . Applying Algorithm 1 described in the previous section to a bi-directed LDG with a tree topology T := (V, ET ) results in the topology T ′ with edge set ET ′ = ET ∪ {(xi, xj)|xi, xj ∈ V are two hop neighbors in T }. Note that ET ⊂ ET ′ . We assume that there exist a path of length at least four in T and present analytical results leading to algorithms that eliminate the spurious two hop neighbor links in T ′. Thus, the generative tree topology T is exactly determined. For the subsequent developments we will need the notion of dseparation, which is defined below.\nDefinition 13 (d-separation [10]): In a directed graph (V,A), I, J, Z be three disjoint subsets of V . Then dsep(I, Z, J) (to be read as Z, d-separates I and J) if and only if every path p from a node i in I to a node j in J satisfies the following conditions • p contains a chain of the form π1 → z → π2 or a fork\nof the form π1 ← z → π2 such that z belongs to the set Z, • p contains a collider of the form π1 → xc ← π2 such that xc or its descendants do not belong to the set Z,\nwhere, π1 and π2 are nodes in V . Theorem 5.1: Consider a directed graph (V,A) such that I, J, Z are disjoint and form a partition of V . Then dsep(I, Z, J) if and only if there is no edge of the form\n1) i→ j, 2) j → i, 3) i→ z and z ← j,\nwhere, i, j and z are nodes in I, J and Z respectively. Proof: See [28] for the proof.\nTheorem 5.2: In the bi-directed LDG (H(z), E) with a tree topology T and non leaf nodes a, b, a− b is an edge in T if and only if there exist nodes c and d distinct from a and b such that dsep(c, {a, b}, d) holds.\nProof: (⇒) It is given that a b is a link between non leaf nodes a and b in the bi-directed LDG associated with the tree T . As a and b are non leaf nodes, there exist nodes c and d on opposite sides of the edge a b such that c a b d , is a part of the LDG as shown in Figure 4 (a), where, one can show that A∪B∪C∪D∪{a, b, c, d} = V and that there exist no path between any two sets amongst A, B, C and D in T that does not involve nodes a or b. Consider I := A ∪C ∪ c, J := B ∪D ∪ d and Z := {a, b}. Thus, applying Theorem 5.1 with the partition I, J, Z of V as defined above, we conclude that dsep(I, Z, J) holds, which implies, dsep(c, {a, b}, d). This completes the proof in the forward direction.\n(⇐) The proof is by contradiction and left to the reader.\nTheorem 5.3: If a− b is a edge in T such that a is a leaf node, then there exist no nodes c, d distinct from a and b such that dsep(c, {a, b}, d) holds.\nProof: The proof uses Theorem 5.1, the property of a tree topology that there is a unique path between every pair of nodes and is left to the reader.\nDefinition 14 (Moralized Graph): The graph obtained by connecting all parents having a common child in a directed graph with an undirected edge and then replacing all directed edges with undirected edges is its moralized graph.\nRemark 2: The kin graph obtained using Wiener reconstruction(see Algorithm 1 and Remark 1) is the moralized graph of the directed graph associated with the LDG.\nDefinition 15 (Ancestors): In a directed graph G = (V,A), node j ∈ V is an ancestor of node k ∈ V if there is a directed sub-graph of G of the form j → π1 → · · · → πl → k from j to k, where, {π1, · · · , πl} ∈ V .\nDefinition 16 (Ancestral Set): In a directed graph (V,A), the ancestral set of a node j is the collection of ancestors of j including j itself and is denoted by an(j). Given a collection of nodes B subset of V , the ancestral set of B, an(B) := ⋃\nj∈B an(j).\nDefinition 17 (Ancestral Graph): Given a directed graph G = (V,A),the ancestral graph of a set of nodes B subset of V is the graph Gan(B) = (an(B), E(an(B))) obtained from G by removing all nodes not in an(B).\nTheorem 5.4: Let I, J, Z be three disjoint sets of nodes in a directed graph G = (V,A) that can have directed cycles. Then I, J are d-separated by Z in G if and only if they are separated by Z in the moral ancestral graph of I, J, Z, that is, dsep(I, Z, J) in G if and only if sep(I, Z, J) in the moralized graph of Gan(I∪Z∪J), where, sep(I, Z, J) means after removing the nodes Z there is no path between any node in I and any node in J .\nProof: See [29], [30] for the proof.\nCorollary 5.1: Consider a bi-directed LDG (H(z), E) with a topology of a tree T whose vetrex set be V . If I, J, Z are disjoint and form a partition of V , then sep(I, Z, J) in the kin graph T ′ implies dsep(I, Z, J) in the bi-directed LDG associated with T .\nProof: The proof is left to the reader. Based on Theorem 5.2 and Theorem 5.3, we present Algorithm 2 which identifies the set of non leaf nodes Vnl, the set of leaf nodes Vl and eliminates the spurious edges between\nnon leaf node pairs and leaf node pairs to obtain the graph T := (V, ET ). Set ET is the edge set obtained after removing each spurious edge between two non-leaf nodes or two leaf nodes from ET ′ .\nAlgorithm 2 Elimination of spurious edges involving non leaf nodes in kin graph T ′ Input: T ′ = (V, ET ′) Output: T = (V, ET )\n1: Edge set ET ← {} 2: for all edge a− b in ET ′ do 3: if Z := {a, b} there exist I 6= {φ} and J 6= {φ}\nsuch that sep(I, Z, J) holds in T ′ then 4: Vnl ← Vnl ∪ {a, b}, ET ← ET ∪ {(a, b)} 5: end if 6: end for 7: Vl ← V − Vnl 8: for all a ∈ Vl, b ∈ V nl with (a, b) ∈ ET ′ do 9: ET ← ET ∪ {(a, b)}\n10: end for\nSince the underlying topology is a tree, so each leaf node is connected to only one non leaf node (and no other leaf node) in T . Note that the only spurious edges that exist in T connect a leaf node (set Vl) with a non-leaf nodes (in set Vnl). Next we focus our attention on elimination of such spurious edges between a leaf node and a non-leaf node. Consider leaf node xi ∈ Vl.Note that the neighbors of xi in T comprise of non-leaf nodes of its kin-set in T . Wlog assume that the kin set of node i in T excluding the other leaf nodes is denoted by, KT (xi) = {xjk}mk=1,jk 6=i, where each xjk ∈ Vnl.\nTheorem 5.5: Suppose xi is a leaf node in T such that card(KT (xi)) = 2, that is, KT (xi) = {xj1 , xj2}. If xi−xj1 is the edge in T then xj2 is the only non leaf two hop neighbor of xi in the graph T with the xi−xj2 edge removed.\nProof: The proof uses the idea that the spurious link would provide new two hop neighbors to arrive at a contradiction and is left to the reader.\nTheorem 5.6: Suppose card(KT (xi)) ≥ 3, then xjk is the only common non leaf neighbor of each node in KT (xi) ∪ {xi}\\{xjk} in T , if and only if, xi − xjk is the edge in T and all other edges connecting xi to nodes in KT (xi)\\xjk are spurious(that is they are not in T ).\nProof: The proof is based on contradiction and is left to the reader.\nThus, by analyzing the adjacency matrix of the reconstructed topology T , spurious links associated with leaf nodes can be eliminated from the set T to recover the edge set associated T ∗. In the case of persistently exciting time series data and infinite samples, T ∗ = T . The steps to obtain the estimate T ∗ of the true topology T is described in Algorithm 3.\nIn this section we presented two algorithms, to be applied in the order Algorithm 2 followed by Algorithm 3 which build on the kin graph obtained from Algorithm 1 to recover the exact topology of a bi-directed LDG whose associated\nAlgorithm 3 Elimination of spurious edges involving leaf nodes from T to obtain the estimate T ∗ Input: T = (V, ET ), Vl, Vnl Output: T ∗ = (V, ET ∗)\n1: Edge set ET ← {} 2: for all a ∈ Vl do 3: if card(KT (a)) ≥ 3 then 4: determine bj ∈ Vnl in KT (a) which is a neighbor\nof all nodes in KT (a) ∪ {a}, and, 5: ET ← ET − {(a, bi)}i6=j,bi∈KT (a) 6: end if 7: if card(KT (a)) = 2 then 8: Use Theorem 5.5 to determine xj2 and update ET ← ET − (a, xj2)\n9: end if 10: end for 11: ET ∗ ← ET\ngraph is a tree.

      "text" : "In this section we present a model for a radial network of generators in a power system and demonstrate that this model fits the bi-directed LDG framework. The topology of the power network is modeled by a graph G = (V,A) where nodes in V represent buses and edges in A represent transmission lines. Each bus i is associated with a voltage phase angle θi that determines its state. The state dynamics in each node in the system is governed by the following second order equation:\nmiθ̈i + diθ̇i = −pe,i + pin,i, i = 1, 2, · · · ,m, (2) Here pin,i and pe,i are power input and electrical power output respectively at node i. Equation (2) describes the swing dynamics for θi with mi > 0 and di > 0 being the rotational inertia and damping of the generator or rotating load device at node i respectively. The electrical power output is complex valued (AC current). However, for small dynamics, we assume constant voltage magnitudes, purely inductive lines and a small signal approximation [31]. The electrical power output from node i is then given by [5]:\npe,i = m∑\nk=1\nbik(θi − θk), i ∈ {1, · · · ,m}, (3)\nwhere bi,k ≥ 0 is the susceptence on the line between nodes i, k ∈ A. Indeed, bik(θi−θk) represents the power flow from node i to node k in the network. Using fi = θ̇i, we can write the following linear state space representation of the power system dynamics [ θ̇\nḟ\n] = [ 0 I\n−M−1L −M−1D ] [ θ f ] + [ 0 M−1 ] pin,\n(4)\nwhere, M = diag{mi}, D = diag{di} are diagonal mass and damping matrices of the network, I ∈ Rm×m is the identity matrix , 0 ∈ Rm×m is the zero matrix. L = LT ∈ Rm×m is the network susceptance weighted Laplacian with off-diagonal elements L(i, k) = −bik and diagonal elements L(i, i) = ∑m k=1,k 6=i bik. The state vector [θ\nT fT ]T ∈ R2m is comprised of a stacked vector of all angles θ ∈ Rm and frequencies f ∈ Rm. The vector pin ∈ Rm is a collection of power inputs to all nodes in the system. The output equation of the network in discrete time is given by,\nX(k) = [ I 0 ] [ θ(k) ω(k) ] , (5)\nwhere the states θ is measured using nodal PMUs [21]. All state and input variables in (4) can be interpreted as deviations from the steady state, pin thus represents ambient deviations from input and modelled as a vector of zero mean uncorrelated WSS processes.\nThe discretized version of the continuous time network dynamics characterized by (4) and (5) takes the form X(k) = H(z)X(k)+E, which justifies the modeling of a network of generators as a LDG (H(z), E). The bi-directedness arises due to the symmetric nature of L. In the next section we apply the three stage topology identification process to LDGs of generators governed by the swing equations with the underlying topology being a tree."

Applying the Wiener filtering based network reconstruction procedure (Algorithm 1) on the output data from the chain, results in the kin graph of the chain T ′ as shown in Figure 5(I)(b).

There are 11 generator nodes (shown in yellow) and the rest are load nodes. The simulation parameters are available in [33].

    "abstractText" : "In this article we present a method to reconstruct the interconnectedness of dynamically related stochastic processes, where the interactions are bi-directional and the underlying topology is a tree. Our approach is based on multivariate Wiener filtering which recovers spurious edges apart from the true edges in the topology reconstruction. The main contribution of this work is to show that all spurious links obtained using Wiener filtering can be eliminated if the underlying topology is a tree based on which we present a three stage network reconstruction procedure for trees. We illustrate the effectiveness of the method developed by applying it on a typical distribution system of the electric grid.",
