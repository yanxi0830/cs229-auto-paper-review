      "text" : "Statistical problems in modern data settings are increasingly high-dimensional, where the number of parameters is very large, potentially outnumbering even the number of observations. An important class of such problems involves estimating the graph structure of a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF), with applications ranging from biological inference in gene networks, analysis of fMRI brain connectivity data and analysis of interactions in social networks. Specifically, given n independently drawn samples {y1,y2, . . . ,yn} from a p-variate Gaussian distribution, so that yi ∼ N (µ,Σ), the task is to estimate its inverse covariance matrix Σ−1, also referred to as the precision or concentration matrix. The non-zero pattern of this inverse covariance matrix Σ−1 can be shown to correspond to the underlying graph structure of the GMRF. An active line of work in high-dimensional settings, where p ≫ n, is based on imposing constraints on the model space; in the GMRF case a common structured constraint is that of sparsity of the inverse covariance matrix. Accordingly, recent papers by Banerjee et al. [2008], Friedman et al. [2008], Yuan and Lin [2007] have proposed an estimator that minimizes the Gaussian negative log-likelihood regularized by the ℓ1 norm of the entries (typically restricted to those on the off-diagonal) of the inverse covariance matrix, which encourages sparsity in its entries. The resulting\noptimization problem is a log-determinant program, which is convex, and can be solved in polynomial time.\nFor such large-scale optimization problems arising from high-dimensional statistical estimation, standard optimization methods typically suffer sub-linear rates of convergence (Agarwal et al. [2010]). This would be too expensive for the Gaussian MLE problem, since the number of matrix entries scales quadratically with the number of nodes. Luckily, the log-determinant problem has special structure; the log-determinant function is strongly convex and one can thus obtain linear (i.e. geometric) rates of convergence via the state-of-the-art methods. However, even linear rates in turn become infeasible when the problem size is very large, with the number of nodes in the thousands and the number of matrix entries to be estimated in the millions. Here we ask the question: can we obtain superlinear rates of convergence for the optimization problem underlying the ℓ1-regularized Gaussian MLE?\nFor superlinear rates, one has to consider second-order methods which at least in part use the Hessian of the objective function. There are however some caveats to the use of such second-order methods in high-dimensional settings. First, a straightforward implementation of each second-order step would be very expensive for high-dimensional problems. Secondly, the log-determinant function in the Gaussian MLE objective acts as a barrier function for the positive definite cone. This barrier property would be lost under quadratic approximations so there is a danger that Newton-like updates will not yield positive-definite matrices, unless one explicitly enforces such a constraint in some manner.\nIn this paper, we present QUIC (QUadratic approximation of Inverse Covariance matrices), a second-order algorithm, that solves the ℓ1-regularized Gaussian MLE. We perform Newton steps that use iterative quadratic approximations of the Gaussian negative log-likelihood. The computation of the Newton direction is a Lasso problem (Meier et al. [2008], Friedman et al. [2010]), which we then solve using coordinate descent. A key facet of our method is that we are able to reduce the computational cost of a coordinate descent update from the naive O(p2) to O(p) complexity by exploiting the structure present in the problem, and by a careful arrangement and caching of the computations. Furthermore, an Armijo-rule based step size selection rule ensures sufficient descent and positive definiteness of the intermediate iterates. Finally, we use the form of the stationary condition characterizing the optimal solution to focus the Newton direction computation on a small subset of free variables, but in a manner that preserves the strong convergence guarantees of second-order descent. We note that when the solution has a block-diagonal structure as described in Mazumder and Hastie [2012], Witten et al. [2011], the fixed/free set selection in QUIC can automatically identify this sparsity structure and avoid updates to the off-diagonal block elements.\nA preliminary version of this paper appeared in the NIPS 2011 conference [Hsieh et al., 2011]. This paper contains the following enhancements to the conference version: (i) inclusion of generalized matrix regularized in the problem statement and subsequent analysis, (ii) detailed convergence analysis of our proposed method, QUIC, (iii) detailed experimental comparisons under different parameters and precision/recall curves for synthetic data, and (iv) new material on the relationship of the free and fixed sets in QUIC with recent covariance thresholding techniques (see Section 3.4 for more details).\nThe outline of the paper is as follows. We start with a review of related work and the problem setup in Section 2. In Section 3, we present our algorithm that combines quadratic approximation, Newton’s method and coordinate descent. In Section 4, we show superlinear convergence of our method. We summarize the experimental results in Section 5, where we compare the algorithm using both real data and synthetic examples from Li and Toh [2010]. We observe that our algorithm performs overwhelmingly better (quadratic instead of linear convergence) than existing solutions described in the literature.\nNotation. In this paper, boldfaced lowercase letters denote vectors and uppercase letters denote p × p real matrices. Sp++ denotes the space of p × p symmetric positive definite matrices and X ≻ 0 and X 0 means that X is positive definite or positive semidefinite, respectively. The vectorized listing of the elements of a p × p matrix X is denoted by vec(X) ∈ Rp 2\nand the Kronecker product of the matrices X and Y is denoted by X ⊗ Y . For a real-valued function f(X), ∇f(X) is a p × p matrix with (i, j) element equal to ∂∂Xij f(X) and denoted by ∇ijf(X), while ∇ 2f(X) is the p2 × p2 Hessian matrix. We will use the ℓ1 and ℓ∞ norms defined on the vectorized form of matrix X: ‖X‖1 := ∑\ni,j |Xij | and ‖X‖∞ := maxi,j |Xij |. We also employ elementwise ℓ1-regularization, ‖X‖1,Λ := ∑\ni,j λij |Xij |, where Λ = [λij] with λij > 0 for off-diagonal elements, and λii ≥ 0 for diagonal elements."

      "text" : "Let y be a p-variate Gaussian random vector, with distribution N (µ,Σ). Given n independently drawn samples {y1, . . . ,yn} of this random vector, the sample covariance matrix can be written as\nS = 1\nn− 1\nn ∑\nk=1\n(yk − µ̂)(yk − µ̂) T , where µ̂ =\n1\nn\nn ∑\nk=1\nyk. (1)\nGiven a regularization penalty λ > 0, the ℓ1-regularized Gaussian MLE for the inverse covariance matrix can be written as the solution of the following regularized log-determinant program:\nargmin X≻0\n{\n− log detX + tr(SX) + λ\np ∑\ni,j=1\n|Xij |\n}\n. (2)\nThe ℓ1 regularization promotes sparsity in the inverse covariance matrix, and thus encourages a sparse graphical model structure. We consider a generalized weighted ℓ1 regularization, where given a symmetric nonnegative weight matrix Λ = [λij], we can assign different nonnegative weights to different entries, obtaining the regularization term ‖X‖1,Λ = ∑p i,j=1 λij |Xij |. In this paper we will focus on solving the following generalized sparse inverse covariance estimation problem:\nargmin X≻0\n{\n− log detX + tr(SX) + ‖X‖1,Λ\n}\n= argmin X≻0 f(X), (3)\nwhere X∗ = (Σ∗)−1. In order to ensure that problem (3) has a unique minimizer, as we show later, it is sufficient to require that λij > 0 for off-diagonal entries, and λii ≥ 0 for diagonal entries. The standard off-diagonal ℓ1 regularization variant λ ∑ I 6=j |Xij | is a special\ncase of this weighted regularization function. For further details on the background and utility of ℓ1 regularization in the context of GMRFs, we refer the reader to Yuan and Lin [2007], Banerjee et al. [2008], Friedman et al. [2008], Ravikumar et al. [2011], Duchi et al. [2008].\nDue in part to its importance, there has been an active line of work on efficient optimization methods for solving (2) and (3). Since the regularization term is non-smooth and hard to solve, many methods aim to solve the dual problem of (3):\nΣ∗ = argmax |Wij−Sij |≤λij log detW, (4)\nwhich has a smooth objective function with bounded constraints. Banerjee et al. [2008] propose a block-coordinate descent method to solve the dual problem (4), by updating one row and column of W at a time. They show that the dual of the corresponding row subproblem can be written as a standard Lasso problem, which they then solve by Nesterov’s first order method. Friedman et al. [2008] follow the same strategy, but propose to use a coordinate descent method to solve the row subproblems instead; their method is implemented in the widely used R package called glasso. In other approaches, the dual problem (4) is treated as a constrained optimization problem, for which Duchi et al. [2008] apply a projected subgradient method called PSM, while Lu [2009] proposes an accelerated gradient descent method called VSM.\nOther first-order methods have been pursued to solve the primal optimization problem (2). d’Aspremont et al. [2008] apply Nesterov’s first order method to (2) after smoothing the objective function; Scheinberg et al. [2010] apply an augmented Lagrangian method to handle the smooth and nonsmooth parts separately; the resulting algorithm is implemented in the ALM software package. In Scheinberg and Rish [2010], the authors propose to directly solve the primal problem by a greedy coordinate descent method called SINCO. However, each coordinate update of SINCO has a time complexity of O(p2), which becomes computationally prohibitive when handling large problems. We will show in this paper that after forming the quadratic approximation, the time complexity of one coordinate update can be performed in O(p) operations. This trick is one of the key advantages of our proposed method, QUIC.\nOne common characteristic of the above methods is that they are first-order iterative methods that mainly use gradient information at each step. Such first-order methods have become increasingly popular in recent years for high-dimensional problems in part due to their ease of implementation, and because they require very little computation and memory at each step. The caveat is that they have at most linear rates of convergence (Bertsekas [1995]). To achieve superlinear convergence rates, one has to consider second-order methods, which have attracted some attention only recently for the sparse inverse covariance estimation problem. Li and Toh [2010] handle the non-smoothness of the ℓ1 regularization in the objective function by doubling the number of variables, and solving the resulting constrained optimization problem by an inexact interior point method. Schmidt et al. [2009] propose a second order Projected Quasi-Newton method (PQN) that solves the dual problem (4), since the dual objective function is smooth. The key difference of our method when compared to these recent second order solvers is that we directly solve the ℓ1-regularized primal objective using a second-order method. As we show, this allows us\nto leverage structure in the problem, and efficiently approximate the generalized Newton direction using coordinate descent. Subsequent to the preliminary version of this paper (see [Hsieh et al., 2011]), Olsen et al. [2012] have proposed generalizations to our framework to allow various inner solvers such as FISTA, conjugate gradient (CG), and LBFGS to be used, in addition to our proposed coordinate descent scheme."

      "text" : "We first note that the objective f(X) in the non-differentiable optimization problem (3), can be written as the sum of two parts, f(X) = g(X) + h(X), where\ng(X) = − log detX + tr(SX) and h(X) = ‖X‖1,Λ. (5)\nThe first component g(X) is twice differentiable, and strictly convex. The second part, h(X), is convex but non-differentiable. Following the approach of Tseng and Yun [2007] and Yun and Toh [2011], we build a quadratic approximation around any iterate Xt for this composite function by first considering the second-order Taylor expansion of the smooth component g(X):\nḡXt(∆) ≡ g(Xt) + vec(∇g(Xt)) T vec(∆) +\n1 2 vec(∆)T∇2g(Xt) vec(∆). (6)\nThe Newton direction Dt for the entire objective f(X) can then be written as the solution of the regularized quadratic program:\nDt = argmin ∆\n{ ḡXt(∆) + h(Xt +∆) } . (7)\nWe use this Newton direction to compute our iterative estimates {Xt} for the solution of the optimization problem (3). This variant of Newton method for such composite objectives is also referred to as a “proximal Newton-type method,” and was empirically studied in Schmidt [2010]. Tseng and Yun [2007] considered the more general case where the Hessian ∇2g(Xt) is replaced by any positive definite matrix. See also the recent paper by Lee et al. [2012], where convergence properties of such general proximal Newton-type methods are discussed. We note that a key caveat to applying such second-order methods in high-dimensional settings is that the computation of the Newton direction appears to have a large time complexity, which is one reason why first-order methods have been so popular for solving the high-dimensional ℓ1-regularized Gaussian MLE.\nLet us delve into the Newton direction computation in (7). Note that it can be rewritten as a standard Lasso regression problem [Tibshirani, 1996]:\nargmin ∆\n1 2 ‖H 1 2 vec(∆) +H− 1 2b‖22 + ‖vec(Xt +∆)‖1,Λ, (8)\nwhere H = ∇2g(Xt) and b = vec(∇g(Xt)). Many efficient optimization methods exist that solve Lasso regression problems, such as the coordinate descent method [Meier et al., 2008], the gradient projection method [Polyak, 1969], and iterative shrinking methods [Daubechies et al.,\n2004, Beck and Teboulle, 2009]. When applied to the Lasso problem of (7), most of these optimization methods would require the computation of the gradient of ḡXt(∆):\n∇ḡXt(∆) = H vec(∆) + b. (9)\nThe straightforward approach for computing (9) for a general p2 × p2 Hessian matrix H would take O(p4) time, making it impractical for large problems. Fortunately, for the sparse inverse covariance problem (3), the Hessian matrix H has the following special form (see for instance [Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2009, Chapter A.4.3]):\nH = ∇2g(Xt) = X −1 t ⊗X −1 t .\nWe show how to exploit this special form of the Hessian matrix to perform one coordinate descent step that updates one element of ∆ in O(p) time. Hence a full sweep of coordinate descent steps over all the variables requires O(p3) time. This key observation is one of the reasons that makes our Newton-like method viable for solving the inverse covariance estimation problem.\nThere exist other functions which allow efficient computation of Hessian times vector. As an example, we consider the case of ℓ1-regularized logistic regression. Suppose we are given n samples with feature vectors x1, . . . ,xn ∈ R\np and labels y1, . . . , yn, and we solve the following optimization problem to compute the model parameter w:\narg min w∈Rp\nn ∑\ni=1\nlog(1 + e−yiw T xi) + λ‖w‖1.\nFollowing our earlier approach, we can decompose this objective function into smooth and non-smooth parts, g(w) + h(w), where\ng(w) =\nn ∑\ni=1\nlog(1 + e−yiw T xi) and h(w) = λ‖w‖1.\nIn order to apply coordinate descent to solve the quadratic approximation, we have to compute the gradient as in (9). The Hessian matrix ∇2g(w) is a p × p matrix, so direct computation of this gradient costs O(p2) flops. However, the Hessian matrix for logistic regression has the following simple form\nH = ∇2g(w) = XDXT ,\nwhere D is a diagonal matrix with Dii = e−yiw\nT xi\n(1+e−yiw T xi )2\nand X = [x1, x2, . . . , xn].\nTherefore we can write\n∇ḡXt(∆) = (∇ 2g(w)) vec(∆) + b = XD(XT vec(∆)) + b. (10)\nThe time complexity to compute (10) is only proportional to the number of nonzero elements in the data matrix X, which can be much smaller than O(p2) for sparse datasets. Therefore similar quadratic approximation approaches are also efficient for solving the\nℓ1-regularized logistic regression problem as shown by [Friedman et al., 2010, Yuan et al., 2012].\nIn the sequel, we detail three innovations which make our quadratic approximation algorithm feasible for solving large sparse inverse covariance problems. First, we approximate the Newton direction computation using an efficient coordinate descent method that exploits the structure of Hessian matrix, so that we reduce the time cost of each coordinate descent update step from O(p2) to O(p). Second, we employ an Armijo-rule based step size selection to ensure sufficient descent and positive-definiteness of the next iterate. Finally, we use the form of the stationary condition characterizing the optimal solution, to focus the Newton direction computation to a small subset of free variables, in a manner that preserves the strong convergence guarantees of second-order descent. We outline each of these three innovations in the following three subsections. A high level overview of our method is presented in Algorithm 1.\nAlgorithm 1: Quadratic Approximation method for Sparse Inverse Covariance Learning (QUIC overview)\nInput : Empirical covariance matrix S (positive semi-definite, p× p), regularization parameter matrix Λ, initial iterate X0, inner stopping tolerance ǫ.

      "text" : "In order to compute the Newton direction, we have to solve the Lasso problem (7). From [Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2009, Chapter A.4.3], the gradient and Hessian for g(X) = − log detX + tr(SX) are\n∇g(X) = S −X−1 and ∇2g(X) = X−1 ⊗X−1. (11)\nIn order to formulate our problem accordingly, we can verify that for a symmetric matrix ∆ we have tr(X−1t ∆X −1 t ∆) = vec(∆) T (X−1t ⊗X −1 t ) vec(∆), so that ḡXt(∆) in (7) can be\nrewritten as\nḡXt(∆) = − log detXt + tr(SXt) + tr((S −Wt) T∆) +\n1 2 tr(Wt∆Wt∆), (12)\nwhere Wt = X −1 t .\nIn Friedman et al. [2007], Wu and Lange [2008], the authors show that coordinate descent methods are very efficient for solving Lasso type problems. An obvious way to update each element of ∆ (to solve (7)) requires O(p2) floating point operations since Wt ⊗ Wt is a p\n2 × p2 matrix, thus yielding an O(p4) procedure. As we show below, our implementation reduces the cost of one variable update to O(p) by exploiting the structure of the specific form of the second order term tr(Wt∆Wt∆).\nFor notational simplicity, we will omit the iteration index t in the derivations below where we only discuss a single Newton iteration; this applies to the rest of the this section and section 3.2 as well. (Hence, the notation for ḡXt is also simplified to ḡ.) Furthermore, we omit the use of a separate index for the coordinate descent updates. Thus, we simply use D to denote the current iterate approximating the Newton direction and use D′ for the updated direction. Consider the coordinate descent update for the variable Xij , with i < j that preserves symmetry: D′ = D+µ(eie T j +eje T i ). The solution of the one-variable problem corresponding to (7) yields µ:\nargmin µ\nḡ(D + µ(eie T j + eje T i )) + 2λij |Xij +Dij + µ|. (13)\nWe expand the terms appearing in the definition of ḡ after substituting D′ = D+µ(eie T j + eje T i ) for ∆ in (12) and omit the terms not dependent on µ. The contribution of tr(SD\n′)− tr(WD′) yields 2µ(Sij−Wij), while the regularization term contributes 2λij |Xij+Dij+µ|, as seen from (13). The quadratic term can be rewritten (using the fact that tr(AB) = tr(BA) and the symmetry of D and W ) to yield:\ntr(WD′WD′) = tr(WDWD) + 4µwTi Dwj + 2µ 2(W 2ij +WiiWjj), (14)\nwhere wi refers to the i-th column of W . In order to compute the single variable update we seek the minimum of the following quadratic function of µ:\n1 2 (W 2ij +WiiWjj)µ 2 + (Sij −Wij +w T i Dwj)µ + λij|Xij +Dij + µ|. (15)\nLetting a = W 2ij +WiiWjj, b = Sij −Wij +w T i Dwj, and c = Xij +Dij the minimum is achieved for:\nµ = −c+ S(c− b/a, λij/a), (16)\nwhere\nS(z, r) = sign(z)max{|z| − r, 0} (17)\nis the soft-thresholding function. Similarly, when i = j, for D′ = D + µeie T i , we get\ntr(WD′WD′) = tr(WDWD) + 2µwTi Dwi + µ 2(W 2ii). (18)\nTherefore the update rule for Dii can be computed by (16) with a = W 2 ii, b = Sii −Wii + wTi Dwi, and c = Xii +Dii. Since a and c are easy to compute, the main computational cost arises while evaluating wTi Dwj, the third term contributing to coefficient b above. Direct computation requires O(p2) time. Instead, we maintain U = DW by updating two rows of the matrix U for every variable update in D costing O(p) flops, and then compute wTi uj using O(p) flops. Another way to view this arrangement is that we maintain a decomposition WDW = ∑p\nk=1wku T k throughout the process by storing the vectors uk, the columns of matrix U . The representation allows us to compute wTi Dwj, the (i, j) element of WDW , using only O(p) flops, enabling fast computation of µ in (16). In order to maintain the matrix U , we also need to update 2p elements, namely two coordinates of each uk when Dij is modified. We can compactly write the row updates of U as follows: ui· ← ui· + µwj· and uj· ← uj· + µwi·, where ui· refers to the i-th row vector of U .\nUpdate rule when X is diagonal\nThe calculation of the Newton direction can be simplified if X is a diagonal matrix. For example, this occurs in the first Newton iteration when we initialize QUIC using the identity (or diagonal) matrix. When X is diagonal, the Hessian ∇2g(X) = X−1 ⊗X−1 is a diagonal matrix, which indicates that all one variable sub-problems are independent of each other. Therefore, we only need to update each variable once to reach the optimum of (7). In particular, by examining (16), the optimal solution for D′ij is\nD′ij =\n\n\n\nS ( − Sij\nWiiWjj , λij WiiWjj\n)\nif i 6= j,\n−Xii + S ( Xii − Sii−Wii\nW 2 ii\n, λii W 2\nii\n) if i = j, (19)\nwhere, as a reminder, Wii = 1/Xii. Thus, in this case, the closed form solution for each variable can be computed in O(1) time, so the time complexity for the first Newton direction is further reduced from O(p3) to O(p2).\nUpdating only a subset of variables\nIn our QUIC algorithm we compute the Newton direction using only a subset of the variables we call the free set. We identify these variables in each Newton iteration based on the value of the gradient (we will discuss the details of the selection in Section 3.3). In the following, we define the Newton direction restricted to a subset J of variables as the solution of a quadratic approximation.\nDefinition 1. Let J denote a (symmetric) subset of variables. The Newton direction restricted to J is defined as:\nD∗J(X) ≡ arg min D:Dij=0 ∀(i,j)/∈J\ntr(∇g(X)TD) + 1\n2 vec(D)T∇2g(X) vec(D) + ‖X +D‖1,Λ. (20)\nThe cost to compute the Newton direction is thus substantially reduced when the free set is small, which as we will show in Section 3.3, occurs when the optimal solution of the ℓ1-regularized Gaussian MLE is sparse."

      "heading" : "3.2 Computing the Step Size",
      "text" : "Following the computation of the Newton direction D∗ = D∗J(X) (restricted to the subset of variables J), we need to find a step size α ∈ (0, 1] that ensures positive definiteness of the next iterate X + αD∗ and leads to a sufficient decrease of the objective function.\nWe adopt Armijo’s rule (Bertsekas [1995],Tseng and Yun [2007]) and try step-sizes α ∈ {β0, β1, β2, . . . } with a constant decrease rate 0 < β < 1 (typically β = 0.5), until we find the smallest k ∈ N with α = βk such that X + αD∗ is (a) positive-definite, and (b) satisfies the following sufficient decrease condition:\nf(X + αD∗) ≤ f(X) + ασδ, δ = tr(∇g(X)TD∗) + ‖X +D∗‖1,Λ − ‖X‖1,Λ, (21)\nwhere 0 < σ < 0.5. We verify positive definiteness while we compute the Cholesky factorization (costs O(p3) flops) needed for the objective function evaluation that computes log det(X + αD∗). This step dominates the computational cost in the step-size computations. We use the standard convention in convex analysis that f(X) = +∞ when X is not in the effective domain of f , i.e., X is not positive definite. Using this convention, (21) enforces positive definiteness of X +αD∗. Next, we prove three important properties (P1–P3) that the line search procedure governed by (21) satisfies:\nP1. The condition (21) is satisfied for some (sufficiently small) α, establishing that the algorithm does not enter into an infinite line search step. We note that in Proposition 1 below we show that the line search condition (21) can be satisfied for any symmetric matrix D (even one which is not the Newton direction).\nP2. For the Newton direction D∗, the quantity δ in (21) is negative, which ensures that the objective function decreases. Moreover, to guarantee that Xt converges to the global optimum, δ should be small enough when the current iterate Xt is far from the optimal solution. In Proposition 2 we will prove the stronger condition that δ ≤ −(1/M2)‖D‖2F for some constant M . ‖D‖ 2 F can be viewed as a measure of the\ndistance from optimality of the current iterate Xt, and this bound ensures that the objective function decrease is proportional to ‖D‖2F .\nP3. When X is close enough to the global optimum, the step size α = 1 will satisfy the line search condition (21). We will show this property in Proposition 3. Moreover, combined with the global convergence of QUIC proved in Theorem 2, this property suggests that after a finite number of iterations α will always be 1; this also implies that only one Cholesky factorization is needed per iteration (to evaluate log det(X+ αD∗) for computing f(X + αD)).\nWe first prove a useful lemma.\nLemma 1. For X,D symmetric and 1 ≥ α ≥ 0:\n‖X + αD‖1,Λ ≤ α‖X +D‖1,Λ + (1− α)‖X‖1,Λ.\nProof. Since ‖·‖1,Λ is convex for Λ ≥ 0, the following holds for 0 ≤ α ≤ 1:\n‖X + αD‖1,Λ = ‖α(X +D) + (1− α)X‖1,Λ ≤ α‖X +D‖1,Λ + (1− α)‖X‖1,Λ. (22)\nProposition 1 (corresponds to Property P1). For any X ≻ 0 and symmetric D, there exists an ᾱ > 0 such that for all α < ᾱ, the matrix X + αD satisfies the line search condition (21).\nProof. When α < σn(X)/‖D‖2 (where σn(X) stands for the smallest eigenvalue of X and ‖D‖2 is the induced 2-norm of D, i.e., the largest eigenvalue of D), we have ‖αD‖2 < σn(X), which implies that X + αD ≻ 0. So we can write:\nf(X + αD)− f(X) = g(X + αD)− g(X) + ‖X + αD‖1,Λ − ‖X‖1,Λ\n≤ g(X + αD)− g(X) + α(‖X +D‖1,Λ − ‖X‖1,Λ), (by Lemma 1) = α tr((∇g(X))TD) +O(α2) + α(‖X +D‖1,Λ − ‖X‖1,Λ) = αδ +O(α2).\nTherefore for any fixed 0 < σ < 1 and sufficiently small α, the line search condition (21) must hold.\nBefore proving properties P2 and P3, we first state a few lemmas that will be useful in the sequel.\nLemma 2. δ = δJ(X) in the line search condition (21) satisfies\nδ = tr((∇g(X))TD∗) + ‖X +D∗‖1,Λ − ‖X‖1,Λ ≤ − vec(D ∗)T∇2g(X) vec(D∗), (23)\nwhere D∗ = D∗J(X) is the minimizer of the ℓ1-regularized quadratic approximation defined in (20).\nProof. According to the definition of D∗ ≡ D∗J(X) in (20), for all 0 < α < 1 we have:\ntr(∇g(X)TD∗) + 1\n2 vec(D∗)T∇2g(X) vec(D∗) + ‖X +D∗‖1,Λ ≤\ntr(∇g(X)TαD∗) + 1\n2 vec(αD∗)T∇2g(X) vec(αD∗) + ‖X + αD∗‖1,Λ. (24)\nWe combine (24) and Lemma 1 to yield:\ntr(∇g(X)TD∗) + 1\n2 vec(D∗)T∇2g(X) vec(D∗) + ‖X +D∗‖1,Λ ≤\nα tr(∇g(X)TD∗) + 1\n2 α2 vec(D∗)T∇2g(X) vec(D∗) + α‖X +D∗‖1,Λ + (1− α)‖X‖1,Λ.\nTherefore\n(1−α)[tr(∇g(X)TD∗)+‖X +D∗‖1,Λ−‖X‖1,Λ]+ 1\n2 (1−α2) vec(D∗)T∇2g(X) vec(D∗) ≤ 0.\nDivide both sides by 1− α > 0 to get:\ntr(∇g(X)TD∗) + ‖X +D∗‖1,Λ − ‖X‖1,Λ + 1\n2 (1 + α) vec(D∗)T∇2g(X) vec(D∗) ≤ 0.\nBy taking the limit as α ↑ 1, we get:\ntr(∇g(X)TD∗) + ‖X +D∗‖1,Λ − ‖X‖1,Λ ≤ − vec(D ∗)T∇2g(X) vec(D∗),\nwhich proves (23).\nSince ∇2g(X) = X−1 ⊗ X−1 is positive definite, Lemma 2 ensures that δ < 0 for all X ≻ 0. Since the updates in our algorithm satisfy the line search condition (21), we have established that the function value is decreasing. It also follows that all the iterates {Xt}t=0,1,... belong to the level set U defined by:\nU = {X | f(X) ≤ f(X0) and X ∈ S p ++}. (25)\nLemma 3. The level set U defined in (25) is contained in the set {X | mI X MI} for some constants m,M > 0, if we assume that the off-diagonal elements of Λ and the diagonal elements of S are positive.\nProof. We begin the proof by showing that the largest eigenvalue of X is less then M , a well chosen constant that depends only on Λ, f(X0) and the matrix S. We note that S 0 and X ≻ 0 implies tr(SX) ≥ 0 and therefore:\nf(X0) > f(X) ≥ − log detX + ‖X‖1,Λ. (26)\nSince ‖X‖2 is the largest eigenvalue of the p×pmatrixX, we have log detX ≤ p log(‖X‖2). Combine with (26) and the fact that the off-diagonal elements of Λ are no smaller than some λ > 0:\nλ ∑\ni 6=j\n|Xij | ≤ ‖X‖1,Λ ≤ f(X0) + p log(||X||2). (27)\nSimilarly, ‖X‖1,Λ ≥ 0 implies that:\ntr(SX) ≤ f(X0) + p log(||X||2). (28)\nNext, we introduce α = mini Sii and β = maxi 6=j |Sij | and split tr(SX) into diagonal and off-diagonal terms in order to bound it:\ntr(SX) = ∑\ni\nSiiXii + ∑\ni 6=j\nSijXij ≥ α tr(X)− β ∑\ni 6=j\n|Xij |.\nSince ||X||2 ≤ tr(X),\nα||X||2 ≤ α tr(X) ≤ tr(XS) + β ∑\ni 6=j\n|Xij |.\nCombine with (27) and (28) to get:\nα||X||2 ≤ (1 + β/λ)(f(X0) + p log(||X||2)). (29)\nThe left hand side of inequality (29), as a function of ||X||2, grows much faster than the right hand side (note α > 0), and therefore ||X||2 can be bounded depending only on the values of f(X0), α, β and λ.\nIn order to prove the lower bound, we consider the smallest eigenvalue of X denoted by a and use the upper bound on the other eigenvalues to get:\nf(X0) > f(X) > − log detX ≥ − log a− (p− 1) logM, (30)\nwhich shows that m = e−f(X0)M−(p−1) is a lower bound for a.\nWe note that the conclusion of the lemma also holds if the conditions on Λ and S are replaced by only the requirement that the diagonal elements of Λ are positive, see Banerjee et al. [2008]. We emphasize that Lemma 3 allows the extension of the convergence results to the practically important case when the regularization does not penalize the diagonal. In subsequent arguments we will continue to refer to the minimum and maximum eigenvalues m and M established in the proof.\nProposition 2 (corresponds to Property P2). δ = δJ (X) as defined in the line search condition (21) satisfies\nδ ≤ −(1/‖X‖22)‖D ∗‖2F ≤ −(1/M 2)‖D∗‖2F , (31)\nwhere M is as in Lemma 3.\nProof. We want to further bound the right hand side of (23). Since ∇2g(X) = X−1 ⊗ X−1, the smallest eigenvalue of ∇2g(X) is 1/‖X‖22, and we combine with Lemma 3 to get (31).\nThe eigenvalues of any iterate X are bounded by Lemma 3, and therefore ∇2g(X) = X−1 ⊗ X−1 is Lipschitz continuous. Next, we prove that α = 1 satisfies the line search condition when we are close to the global optimum.\nProposition 3 (corresponds to Property P3). Assume that ∇2g is Lipschitz continuous, i.e., ∃L > 0 such that ∀t > 0,\n‖∇2g(X + tD)−∇2g(X)‖F ≤ L‖tD‖F = tL‖D‖F . (32)\nThen, if X is close enough to X∗, the line search condition (21) will be satisfied with step size α = 1.\nProof. We need to derive a bound for the decrease in the objective function value. We define g̃(t) = g(X + tD), which yields g̃′′(t) = vec(D)T∇2g(X + tD) vec(D). First, we bound |g̃′′(t)− g̃′′(0)|:\n|g̃′′(t)− g̃′′(0)| = | vec(D)T (∇2g(X + tD)−∇2g(X)) vec(D)|\n≤ ‖ vec(D)T (∇2g(X + tD)−∇2g(X))‖2‖ vec(D)‖2 (by Cauchy-Schwartz) ≤ ‖ vec(D)‖22‖∇ 2g(X + tD)−∇2g(X)‖2 (by definition of ‖ · ‖2 norm) ≤ ‖D‖2F ‖∇ 2g(X + tD)−∇2g(X)‖F (since ‖ · ‖2 ≤ ‖ · ‖f for any matrix) ≤ ‖D‖2F tL‖D‖F (by (32)) = tL‖D‖3F .\nTherefore, an upper bound for g̃′′(t):\ng̃′′(t) ≤ g̃′′(0) + tL‖D‖3F = vec(D) T∇2g(X) vec(D) + tL‖D‖3F .\nIntegrate both sides to get\ng̃′(t) ≤ g̃′(0) + t vec(D)T∇2g(X) vec(D) + 1\n2 t2L‖D‖3F\n= tr((∇g(X))TD) + t vec(D)T∇2g(X) vec(D) + 1\n2 t2L‖D‖3F .\nIntegrate both sides again:\ng̃(t) ≤ g̃(0) + t tr((∇g(X))TD) + 1\n2 t2 vec(D)T∇2g(X) vec(D) +\n1 6 t3L‖D‖3F .\nTaking t = 1 we have\ng(X +D) ≤ g(X) + tr(∇g(X)TD) + 1\n2 vec(D)T∇2g(X) vec(D) +\n1 6 L‖D‖3F\nf(X +D) ≤ g(X) + ‖X‖1,Λ + (tr(∇g(X) TD) + ‖X +D‖1,Λ − ‖X‖1,Λ)\n+ 1\n2 vec(D)T∇2g(X) vec(D) +\n1 6 L‖D‖3F\n≤f(X) + δ + 1\n2 vec(D)T∇2g(X) vec(D) +\n1 6 L‖D‖3F\n≤f(X) + δ\n2 +\n1 6 L‖D‖3F (by Lemma 2)\n≤f(X) + ( 1\n2 −\n1 6 LM2‖D‖F )δ (by Proposition 2).\nWhen X is close to X∗, D is close to 0; therefore when k is large enough, the second term must be smaller than σδ ( 0 < σ < 0.5), which implies that the line search condition (21) holds with α = 1."

      "heading" : "3.3 Identifying which variables to update",
      "text" : "In this section, we use the stationary condition of the Gaussian MLE problem to select a subset of variables to update in any Newton direction computation. Specifically, we partition the variables into free and fixed sets based on the value of the gradient at the start of the outer loop that computes the Newton direction. We define the free set Sfree and fixed set Sfixed as:\nXij ∈ Sfixed if |∇ijg(X)| ≤ λij , and Xij = 0,\nXij ∈ Sfree otherwise. (33)\nWe will now show that a Newton update restricted to the fixed set of variables would not change any of the coordinates in that set. In brief, the gradient condition |∇ijg(X)| < λij entails that the inner coordinate descent steps, according to the update in (16), would set these coordinates to zero, so they would not change since they were zero to begin with.\nAt non-differentiable points of ‖X‖1, only sub-gradient can be defined. To derive the optimality condition, we begin by introducing the minimum-norm subgradient for f and relate it to the optimal solution X∗ of (3).\nDefinition 2. We define the minimum-norm subgradient gradSij f(X) as follows:\ngradSij f(X) =\n\n \n \n∇ijg(X) + λij if Xij > 0,\n∇ijg(X) − λij if Xij < 0,\nsign(∇ijg(X))max(|∇ijg(X)| − λij, 0) if Xij = 0.\nLemma 4. For any index set J , gradSijf(X) = 0 ∀(i, j) ∈ J if and only if ∆ ∗ = 0 is a solution of the following optimization problem:\nargmin ∆ f(X +∆) such that ∆ij = 0 ∀(i, j) /∈ J. (34)\nProof. Any optimal solution ∆∗ for (34) must satisfy the following, for all (i, j) ∈ J ,\n∇ijg(X +∆ ∗)\n\n \n \n= −λij if Xij > 0,\n= λij if Xij < 0,\n∈ [−λij λij] if Xij = 0.\n(35)\nIt can be seen immediately that ∆∗ = 0 satisfies (35) if and only if gradSij f(X) = 0 for all (i, j) ∈ J .\nIn our case, ∇g(X) = S −X−1 and therefore\ngradSijf(X) =\n\n \n \n(S −X−1)ij + λij if Xij > 0, (S −X−1)ij − λij if Xij < 0, sign((S −X−1)ij)max(|(S −X −1)ij | − λij, 0) if Xij = 0.\nThe definition of the minimum-norm sub-gradient is closely related to the definition of the fixed and free sets. A variable Xij belongs to the fixed set if and only if Xij = 0 and gradSijf(X) = 0. Therefore, taking J = Sfixed in Lemma 4 we arrive at the following crucial property of the fixed set.\nProposition 4. For any Xt and corresponding fixed and free sets Sfixed and Sfree as defined by (33), ∆∗ = 0 is the solution of the following optimization problem:\nargmin ∆ f(Xt +∆) such that ∆ij = 0 ∀(i, j) ∈ Sfree.\nBased on the above proposition, if we perform block coordinate descent restricted to the fixed set, then no updates would occur. We then perform the inner loop coordinate descent updates restricted to only the free set to find the Newton direction. With this modification, the number of variables over which we perform the coordinate descent update of (16) can be potentially reduced from p2 to the number of non-zeros in Xt. When the solution is sparse (depending on the value of Λ) the number of free variables is much smaller than p2 and we can obtain huge computational gains as a result. In essence, we very efficiently select a subset of the coordinates that need to be updated.\nThe attractive facet of this modification is that it leverages the sparsity of the solution and intermediate iterates in a manner that falls within the block coordinate descent framework of Tseng and Yun [2007]. The index sets J1, J2, . . . corresponding to the block coordinate descent steps in the general setting of Tseng and Yun [2007][p. 392] need to satisfy a Gauss-Seidel type of condition:\n⋃\nj=0,...,T−1\nJt+j ⊇ N ∀t = 1, 2, . . . (36)\nfor some fixed T , where N denotes the full index set. In our framework J1, J3, . . . denote the fixed sets at various iterations, and J2, J4, . . . denote the free sets. Since J2i+1 and J2i+2 is a partitioning of N the choice T = 3 will suffice. But will the size of the free set be small? We initialize X0 to a diagonal matrix, which is sparse. The following lemma shows that after a finite number of iterations, the iterates Xt will have a similar sparsity pattern as the limit X∗. Lemma 5 is actually an immediate consequence of Lemma 8 in Section 4.\nLemma 5. Assume that {Xt} converges to X ∗, the optimal solution of (3). If for some index pair (i, j), |∇ijg(X ∗)| < λij (so that X ∗ ij = 0), then there exists a constant t̄ > 0 such that for all t > t̄, the iterates Xt satisfy\n|∇ijg(Xt)| ≤ λij and (Xt)ij = 0. (37)\nNote that |∇ijg(X ∗)| < λij implies X ∗ ij = 0 from from the optimality condition of (3). A similar (so called shrinking) strategy is used in SVM and ℓ1-regularized logistic regression problems as mentioned in Yuan et al. [2010]. In our experiments, we demonstrate that this strategy reduces the size of the free set very quickly."

      "heading" : "3.4 The block-diagonal structure of X∗",
      "text" : "It has been shown recently by (Mazumder and Hastie [2012],Witten et al. [2011]) that when the thresholded covariance matrixE defined byEij = S(Sij , λ) = sign(Sij)max(|Sij |− λ, 0) has the following block-diagonal structure:\nE =\n\n    E1 0 . . . 0 0 E2 . . . 0 ... ... ...\n... 0 0 0 Ek\n\n    , (38)\nthen the solution X∗ of the inverse covariance estimation problem (2) also has the same block-diagonal structure:\nX∗ =\n\n    X∗1 0 . . . 0 0 X∗2 . . . 0 ... ... ...\n... 0 0 0 X∗k\n\n    .\nThis result can be extended to the case when the elements are penalized differently, i.e., λij ’s are different. Then, if Eij = S(Sij , λij) is block diagonal, so is the solution X\n∗ of (3), see Hsieh et al. [2012]. Thus each X∗i can be computed independently. Based on this observation one can decompose the problem into sub-problems of smaller sizes. Since the complexity of solving (3) is O(p3), solving several smaller sub-problems is much faster. In the following, we show that our updating rule and fixed/free set selection technique can automatically detect this block-diagonal structure for free.\nRecall that we have a closed form solution in the first iteration when the input is a diagonal matrix. Based on (19), since Xij = 0 for all i 6= j in this step, we have\nDij = XiiXjjS(−Sij, λij) = −XiiXjjS(Sij, λij) for all i 6= j.\nWe see that after the first iteration the nonzero pattern of X will be exactly the same as the nonzero pattern of the thresholded covariance matrix E as depicted in (38). In order to establish that the same is true at each subsequent step, we complete our argument using induction, by showing that the structure is preserved.\nMore precisely, we show that the off-diagonal blocks always belong to the fixed set if |Sij| ≤ λij . Recall the definition of the fixed set in (33). We need to check whether |∇ijg(X)| ≤ λij for all (i, j) in the off-diagonal blocks of E. Taking the inverse preserves the diagonal structure, and therefore ∇ijg(X) = Sij − X −1 ij = Sij. We conclude noting that Eij = 0 implies that |∇ijg(X)| ≤ λij, meaning that (i, j) will belong to the fixed set.\nWe decompose the matrix into smaller blocks prior to running Cholesky factorization to avoid the O(p3) time complexity. The connected components of X can be detected in O(‖X‖0) time, which is very efficient when X is sparse. The detailed description of QUIC is presented in Algorithm 2."

According to Lemma 3, the level set U defined in (25) contains all the iterates, and it is in turn contained in the compact set S ≡ {X | mI X MI}. According to the Weierstrass extreme value theorem [Apostol, 1974], any continuous function in a compact set attains its minimum. Furthermore, ∇2g(X) = X−1 ⊗X−1 implies ∇2g(X) M−2I.

In the rest of this section, we will show that {Yt}t=1,2,... converges to the global optimum, thus {Xt}t=1,2,... generated by QUIC also converges to the global optimum.\nOur first step towards the convergence proof is a lemma on convergent subsequences of Xt.\nLemma 6. For any convergent subsequence Yst → Y ∗, we have Dst ≡ DJst (Yst) → 0.\nProof. The objective value decreases according to the line search condition (21) and Proposition 2. According to Lemma 3, f(Yst) cannot converge to negative infinity, so f(Xst)− f(Xst+1) → 0. The line search condition (21) implies that we have αstδst → 0.\nWe proceed to prove the statement by contradiction. If Dst does not converge to 0, then there exist an infinite index set T ⊆ {s1, s2, . . .} and η > 0 such that ‖Dt‖F > η for all t ∈ T . According to Proposition 2, δst is bounded away from 0, therefore δst 6→ 0, while αst → 0. We can assume without loss of generality that αst < 1, that is the line search condition is not satisfied in the first attempt. We will work in this index set T in the derivations that follow.\nThe line search step size αt < 1 (t ∈ T ) satisfies (21), but αt = αt/β does not satisfy (21) by the minimality of our line search procedure. So we have:\nf(Yt + αtDt)− f(Yt) ≥ σαtδt. (40)\nIf Yt + αtDt is not positive definite, then we define f(Yt + αtDt) to be ∞, so (40) still holds. We expand the definition of f and apply Lemma 1:\nσαt∆t ≤ g(Yt + αtDt)− g(Yt) + ‖Yt + αtDt‖1,Λ − ‖Yt‖1,Λ\n≤ g(Yt + αtDt)− g(Yt) + αt‖|Yt +Dt‖1,Λ + (1− αt)‖Yt‖1,Λ − ‖Yt‖1,Λ\n= g(Yt + αtDt)− g(Yt) + αt(‖Yt +Dt‖1,Λ − ‖Yt‖1,Λ),∀t ∈ T .\nBy the definition of δt we have:\nσδt ≤ g(Yt + αtDt)− g(Yt)\nαt + δt − tr(∇g(Yt)\nTDt),\n(1− σ)(−δt) ≤ g(Yt + αtDt)− g(Yt)\nαt − tr(∇g(Yt)\nTDt).\nBy Proposition 2 we have:\n(1− σ)M−2‖Dt‖ 2 F ≤\ng(Yt + αtDt)− g(Yt)\nαt − tr(∇g(Yt)\nTDt)\n(1− σ)M−2‖Dt‖F ≤ g(Yt + αt‖Dt‖F Dt ‖Dt‖F )− g(Yt)\nαt‖Dt‖F − tr(∇g(Yt) T Dt ‖Dt‖F ).\nWe set α̂t = αt‖Dt‖F . Since ‖Dt‖F > η for all t ∈ T we have:\n(1− σ)M−2η ≤ g(Yt + α̂t\nDt ‖Dt‖F )− g(Yt)\nα̂t − tr(∇g(Yt) T Dt ‖Dt‖F )\n= α̂t tr(∇g(Yt) Dt ‖Dt‖F ) +O(α̂2t )\nα̂t − tr(∇g(Yt) T Dt ‖Dt‖F )\n= O(α̂t) (41)\nAgain, by Proposition 2,\n−αtδt ≥ αtM −2‖Dt‖ 2 F ≥ M −2αt‖Dt‖F η.\nSince {αtδt}t → 0, it follows that {αt‖Dt‖F }t → 0 and {α̂ k}t → 0. Taking limit of (41) as t ∈ T̄ and t → ∞, we have\n(1− σ)M−2η ≤ 0,\na contradiction, finishing the proof.\nIn Lemma 6, we prove that DJt converges to zero for the converging subsequence. Next we show that DJ is closely related to grad\nSf(Y ) defined in Definition 2, which in turn is an indicator of optimality as proved in Lemma 4.\nLemma 7. For any index set J and positive definite Y , DJ(Y ) = 0 if and only if gradSij f(Y ) = 0 for all (i, j) ∈ J .\nProof. DJ(Y ) = 0 if and only if D = 0 satisfies the optimality condition of (20). The condition can be written as (35) restricted to (i, j) ∈ J , which in turn is equivalent to the optimality condition of f . Therefore DJ(Y ) = 0 iff grad S ij f(Y ) = 0 for all (i, j) ∈ J .\nBased on these lemmas, we are now able to prove our main convergence theorem.\nTheorem 2. Algorithm 3 converges to a unique global optimum Y ∗.\nProof. Assume a subsequence {Yt}T converges to Ȳ . Since the choice of the index set Jt selected at each step is finite, we can further assume that Jt = J̄0 for all t ∈ T , considering a subsequence of T if necessary. From Lemma 6, DJ̄0(Yt) → 0. By the continuity of ∇g(Y ) and ∇2g(Y ), it is easy to show DJ̄0(Yt) → DJ̄0(Ȳ ). Therefore DJ̄0(Ȳ ) = 0. Based on Lemma 7, we have\ngradSijf(Y ) = 0 for all (i, j) ∈ J̄0.\nFurthermore, {DJ̄0(Yt)}T → 0 and ‖Yt − Yt+1‖F ≤ ‖DJ̄0(Yt)‖F , so {Yt+1}t∈T also converges to Ȳ . By considering a subsequence of T if necessary, we can further assume that Jt+1 = J̄1 for all t ∈ T . By the same argument, we can show that {DJt+1(Yt)}T → 0, so DJ̄1(Ȳ ) = 0. Similarly, we can show that DJ̄t(Ȳ ) = 0 ∀t = 0, . . . , T − 1 can be assumed for an appropriate subset of T . With assumption (39) and Lemma 7 we have\ngradSij f(Ȳ ) = 0 ∀i, j. (42)\nUsing Lemma 4 with J is the set of all variables, we can show that (42) implies Ȳ is the global optimum."

      "text" : "Newton methods on constrained minimization problems: The convergence rate of the Newton method on bounded constrained minimization has been studied in Levitin and Polyak [1966] and Dunn [1980]. Here, we briefly mention their results.\nAssume we want to solve a constrained minimization problem\nmin x∈Ω F (x),\nwhere Ω is a nonempty subset of Rn denoting the constraint set and F : Rn → R has a second derivative ∇2F (x). Then beginning from x0, the natural Newton updates entail computing the (k + 1)th iterate xk+1 as\nxk+1 = argmin x∈Ω\n∇F (xk) T (x− xk) +\n1 2 (x− xk) T∇2F (xk)(x− xk). (43)\nFor simplicity, we assume F is strictly convex, and has a unique minimizer x∗ in Ω. Then the following theorem holds\nTheorem 3 (From Theorem 3.1 in Dunn [1980]). Assume F is strictly convex, has a unique minimizer x∗ in Ω, and that ∇2F (x) is Lipschitz continuous. Then for all x0 sufficiently close to x∗, the sequence {xk} generated by (43) converges quadratically to x ∗.\nThis theorem is proved in Dunn [1980]. In our case, the objective function f(X) is non-smooth so that Theorem 3 does not directly apply. Instead, we will first show that after a finite number of iterations the sign of the iterates {Xt} generated by QUIC will not change, so that we can then use Theorem 3 to establish asymptotic quadratic convergence.\nQuadratic convergence rate for QUIC:\nUnlike the previous section, our Algorithm 3 does not perform an unrestricted Newton update: it iteratively selects variable subsets {Jt}t=1,... in the manner of fixed and free sets, and performs Newton directions restricted to the free sets. In the following, we show that the sequence {Xt}t=1,2,... generated by QUIC does converge quadratically to the global optimum.\nAssume X∗ is the optimal solution, then we can divide the index set with λij 6= 0 into three subsets:\nP = {(i, j) | X∗ij > 0}, N = {(i, j) | X∗ij < 0}, (44) Z = {(i, j) | X∗ij = 0}.\nFrom the optimality condition of X∗,\n∇ijg(X ∗)\n\n \n \n= −λij if (i, j) ∈ P,\n= λij if (i, j) ∈ N,\n∈ [−λij , λij ] if (i, j) ∈ Z.\n(45)\nLemma 8. Assume that the sequence {Xt} converges to the global optimum X ∗. Then there exists a t̄ such that\n(Xt)ij\n\n \n \n≥ 0 if (i, j) ∈ P\n≤ 0 if (i, j) ∈ N\n= 0 if (i, j) ∈ Z\n(46)\nfor all t > t̄.\nProof. We prove the case for (i, j) ∈ P by contradiction, the other two cases can be handled similarly. If we cannot find a t̄ satisfying (46), then there exists an infinite subsequence {Xst} such that (Xst)ij < 0. We consider the update from Xst−1 to Xst . From Lemma 3, we can assume that st is large enough so that the step size equals 1, therefore Xst = Xst−1 + D(Xst−1) where D(Xst−1) is defined in (20). Since (Xst)ij = (Xst−1)ij + (D(Xst−1))ij < 0, from the optimality condition of (20) we have\n(\n∇g(Xst−1) +∇ 2g(Xst−1) vec(D(Xst−1))\n)\nij = λij . (47)\nSince D(Xst−1) converges to 0, (47) implies that {∇ijg(Xst−1)} will converge to λij. However, (45) implies ∇ijg(X\n∗) = −λij, and by the continuity of ∇g we get that {∇ijg(Xt)} converges to ∇ijg(X ∗) = −λij, a contradiction, finishing the proof.\nThe following lemma shows that the coordinates from the fixed set remain zero after a finite number of iterations.\nLemma 9. Assume Xt → X ∗. There exists a t̄ > 0 such that variables in P or N will not be selected to be in the fixed set Sfixed, when t > t̄. That is,\nSfixed ⊆ Z.\nProof. Since Xt converges to X ∗, (Xt)ij converges to X ∗ ij > 0 if (i, j) ∈ P and to X ∗ ij < 0 if (i, j) ∈ N . Recall that (i, j) belongs to the fixed set only if (Xt)ij = 0. When t is large enough, (Xt)ij 6= 0 when Xt ∈ P ∪ N , therefore P and N will be disjoint from the fixed set. Moreover, by the definition of the fixed set (33), indexes with λij = 0 will never be selected. We proved that the fixed set will be a subset of Z when t is large enough.\nTheorem 4. The sequence {Xt} generated by the QUIC algorithm converges quadratically to X∗.\nProof. First, if the index sets P,N and Z (related to the optimal solution) are given, the optimum of (2) is the same as the optimum of the following constrained minimization problem:\nmin X\n− log det(X) + tr(SX) + ∑\n(i,j)∈P\nλijXij − ∑\n(i,j)∈N\nλijXij\ns.t. Xij ≥ 0 ∀(i, j) ∈ P, (48)\nXij ≤ 0 ∀(i, j) ∈ N,\nXij = 0 ∀(i, j) ∈ Z.\nIn the following, we show that when t is large enough, QUIC solves the minimization problem described by (48).\n1. The constraints in (48) are satisfied by QUIC iterates after a finite number of steps, as shown in Lemma 8. Thus, the ℓ1-regularized Gaussian MLE (3) is equivalent to the smooth constrained objective (48), since the constraints in (48) are satisfied when solving (3).\n2. Since the optimization problem in (48) is smooth, it can be solved using constrained Newton updates as in (43). The QUIC update direction DJ (Xt) is restricted to a set of free variables in J . This is exactly equal to the unrestricted Newton update as in (43), after a finite number of steps, as established by Lemma 9. In particular, at each iteration the fixed set is contained in Z, which is the set which always satisfies (Dt)Z = 0 for large enough t.\n3. Moreover, by Lemma 3 the step size is α = 1 when t is large enough.\nTherefore our algorithm is equivalent to the constrained Newton method in (43), which in turn converges quadratically to the optimal solution of (48). Since the revised problem (48) and our original problem (3) has the same minimum, we have shown that QUIC converges quadratically to the optimum of (3).\nIn the next section, we show that this asymptotic convergence behavior of QUIC is corroborated empirically as well."

In our implementation we use an iterative solver to compute Dt, which after a finite set of iterations only solves the problem to some accuracy. In the first experiment we explore how varying the accuracy to which we compute the Newton direction affects overall performance. In Figure 1 we plot the total run times for the ER biology dataset from [Li and Toh, 2010] correspond to different numbers of inner iterations used in the coordinate descent solver of QUIC.\nWe can observe that QUIC with one inner iteration converges faster in the beginning, but eventually achieves just a linear convergence rate, whileQUIC with 20 inner iterations converges more slowly in the beginning, but eventually achieves quadratic convergence. Based on this observation, we propose an adaptive stopping condition: we set the number of coordinate descent steps to be αt for the t-th outer iteration, where α is a constant; we use α = 1/3 in our experiments. Figure 1(b) shows that by using this adaptive stopping condition, QUIC is not only efficient in the beginning, but also achieves quadratic convergence."

      "text" : "We first compare the run times of the different methods on synthetic data. We generate the two following types of graph structures for the underlying Gaussian Markov Random Fields:\n• Chain Graphs: The ground truth inverse covariance matrix Σ−1 is set to be Σ−1i,i−1 =\n−0.5 and Σ−1i,i = 1.25.\nGiven the inverse covariance matrix Σ−1, we draw a limited number, n = p/2 i.i.d. samples from the corresponding GMRF distribution, in order to simulate the high-dimensional setting.\nTable 1 shows the attributes of the synthetic datasets that we used in the timing comparisons. The dimensionality varies from {1000, 4000, 10000}. For chain graphs, we select λ so that the solution has (approximately) the correct number of nonzero elements. In order to test the performance of the algorithms under different values of λ, for the case of random-structured graphs we considered two λ values; one of which resulted in the discovery of the correct number of non-zeros and one which resulted in five-times thereof. We measured the accuracy of the graph structure recovered by the true positive rate (TPR) and false positive rate (FPR) defined as\nTPR = |{(i, j) | (X∗)ij > 0 and Qij > 0}|\n|{(i, j) | Qij > 0}| ,FPR =\n|{(i, j) | (X∗)ij > 0 and Qij = 0}|\n|{(i, j) | Qij = 0}| ,\n(49)\nwhere Q is the ground truth sparse inverse covariance. Since QUIC does not natively compute a dual solution, the duality gap cannot be used as a stopping condition.1 In practice, we can use the minimum-norm sub-gradient\n1Note, that W = X−1 cannot be expected to satisfy the dual constraints requiring |Wij − Sij | ≤ λij . One could project X−1 in order to enforce the constraints and use the resulting matrix to compute the duality gap. Our implementation provides this computation only if the user requests it.\ndefined in Definition 2 as the stopping condition. There is no additional computational cost to this approach because X−1 is computed as part of the QUIC algorithm. In the experiments, we report the time for each algorithm to achieve ǫ-accurate solution defined by f(Xk)− f(X∗) < ǫf(X∗).\nTable 2 shows the results for ǫ = 10−2 and 10−6, where ǫ = 10−2 tests the ability for an algorithm to get a good initial guess (the nonzero structure), and ǫ = 10−6 tests whether an algorithm can achieve an accurate solution. Table 2 shows that QUIC is consistently and overwhelmingly faster than other methods, both initially with ǫ = 10−2, and at ǫ = 10−6. Moreover, for the p = 10000 random pattern, there are p2 = 100 million variables and the selection of fixed/free sets helpsQUIC to focus only on very small subset of them. We converge to the solution in about 15 minutes, while other methods fail to even have an initial guess within 8 hours.\nIn some applications, researchers are primarily interested in the obtained graphical structure represented by the solution. Therefore, in addition to the objective function value, we further compare the true positive rate and false positive rate of the obtained nonzero pattern in Xt by each algorithm. In Figure 2, we use two synthetic datasets, chain1000 and random1000, as examples. For each algorithm, we plot the objective function value, true positive rate, and false positive rate of the iterates Xt versus run time. For\nthe methods that solve the dual problem, the sparse inverse covariance matrix Xt = W −1 t is usually dense, so we consider elements with absolute value larger than 10−6 as nonzero elements. We can see thatQUIC not only obtains lower objective function value efficiently, but also recover the ground truth structure of GMRF faster than other methods."

      "text" : "We use the real world biology datasets preprocessed by Li and Toh [2010] to compare the performance of our method with other state-of-the-art methods. In the first set of experiments, we set the regularization parameter λ to be 0.5, which achieves reasonable sparsity for the following datasets: Estrogen (p = 692), Arabidopsis (p = 834), Leukemia (p = 1, 225), Hereditary (p = 1, 869). In Figure 3 we plot the relative error (f(Xt) − f(X∗))/f(X∗) (on a log scale) against time in seconds. We can observe from Figure 3 that under this setting – large λ and sparse solution – QUIC can be seen to achieve superlinear convergence while other methods exhibit at most a linear convergence. Overall, we see that QUIC can be five times faster than other methods, and can be expected to be even faster if a higher accuracy is desired.\nIn the second set of experiments, we compare the algorithms under different values of the regularization parameter λ on the ER dataset. In Figure 3(a) we show the results for λ = 0.5. We then decrease λ to 0.1, 0.05, 0.01 using the same datasets and show the results in Figure 5. A smaller λ yields a denser solution, and we list the density of the convergence point X∗ in Figure 5. From Figure 5 we can see that QUIC is the most efficient method when λ is large (solution is sparse), but IPM and PSM outperforms QUIC when λ is small (solution is dense). However, those cases are usually not useful in practice because when solving the ℓ1-regularized MLE problem one usually wants a sparse graphical structure for the GMRF. The main reason that QUIC is very efficient under large λ is that with fixed/free set selection, the coordinate descent method can focus on a small portion of variables, while in PSM and IPM the whole matrix is considered at each iteration.\nTo further demonstrate the power of fixed/free set selection, we use Hereditarybc dataset as an example. In Figure 4, we plot the size of the free set versus iterations for Hereditarybc dataset. Starting from a total of 18692 = 3, 493, 161 variables, the size of the free set progressively drops, in fact to less than 120, 000 in the very first iteration. We can see the super-linear convergence of QUIC even more clearly when we plot it against the number of iterations."

      "heading" : "5.3 Block-diagonal structure",
      "text" : "As discussed earlier, Mazumder and Hastie [2012], Witten et al. [2011] showed that when the thresholded covariance matrix E = max(|S|−λ, 0) is block-diagonal, then the problem can be naturally decomposed into sub-problems. This observation has been implemented in the latest version of glasso. In the end of Section 3, we discuss that the fixed/free set selection can automatically identify the block-diagonal structure of the thresholded matrix, and thus QUIC can benefit from block-diagonal structure even when we do not explicitly decompose the matrix. In the following experiment we will show that with input sample\ncovariance S with block-diagonal structure represented by E (see Section 3.4), QUIC still outperforms glasso. Moreover, we will show that when some off-diagonal elements are added into the problem, while QUIC is still efficient because of its fixed/free set selection, glasso on the other hand suddenly becomes very slow.\nWe generate synthetic data with block-diagonal structure as follows. We generate a sparse 150 × 150 inverse covariance matrix Θ̄ as discussed in Section 5.2.1, and then replicate Θ̄ eight times on the diagonal blocks to form a 1200 × 1200 block-diagonal matrix. Using this inverse covariance matrix to generate samples, we compare the following methods:\n• QUIC: our proposed algorithm.\n• glasso: In the latest version of glasso, the matrix is first decomposed into connected components based on the thresholded covariance matrix max(|S| − λ), and then each sub-problem is solved individually.\nWe then test the two algorithms for regularization parameter λ taking values from the set {0.017, . . . , 0.011}. When λ = 0.017, the thresholded covariance matrix E has eight blocks, while when λ = 0.011 the block structure reduces to a single block. For each single λ trial, we compare the time taken by QUIC and glasso to achieve (f(Xt)− f(X∗))/f(X∗) < 10−5. Figure 6 shows the experimental results. We can see that both methods are very fast for the case where the problem can be decomposed into 8 subproblems (large λ); however, when we slightly increase λ so that there is only 1 connected component, QUIC becomes much faster than glasso. This is because even for the nondecomposable case, QUIC can still keep most of the very sparse off-diagonal blocks in the fixed set to speedup the process, while glasso cannot benefit from this sparse structure."

However, each coordinate update of SINCO has a time complexity of O(p2), which becomes computationally prohibitive when handling large problems. We will show in this paper that after forming the quadratic approximation, the time complexity of one coordinate update can be performed in O(p) operations. This trick is one of the key advantages of our proposed method, QUIC. One common characteristic of the above methods is that they are first-order iterative methods that mainly use gradient information at each step.
