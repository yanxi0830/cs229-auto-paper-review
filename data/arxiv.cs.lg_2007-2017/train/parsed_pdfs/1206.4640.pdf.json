      "text" : "Collaborative prediction of user preferences has attracted fast growing attention in the machine learning community, best demonstrated by the million-dollar Netflix Challenge. Among various models proposed, matrix factorization is arguably the most widely applied method, due to its high accuracy, scalability (Su & Khoshgoftaar, 2009) and flexibility to incorporating domain knowledge (Koren et al., 2009). Hence, not surprisingly, matrix factorization is the centerpiece of most state-of-the-art collaborative filtering systems, including the winner of Netflix Prize (Bell & Koren, 2007). Indeed, matrix factorization has been widely applied to tasks other than collaborative filtering, including structure from motion, localization in wireless sensor network, DNA microarray estimation and beyond. Matrix factorization is also considered as a fundamental building block of many popular algorithms\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nin regression, factor analysis, dimension reduction, and clustering (Singh & Gordon, 2008).\nDespite the popularity of factorization methods, not much has been done on the theoretical front. In this paper, we fill the blank by analyzing the stability vis a vis adversarial noise of the matrix factorization methods, in hope of providing useful insights and guidelines for practitioners to design and diagnose their algorithm efficiently.\nOur main contributions are three-fold: In Section 3 we bound the gap between the solution matrix of the factorization method and the ground truth in terms of root mean square error. In Section 4, we treat the matrix factorization as a subspace fitting problem and analyze the difference between the solution subspace and the ground truth. This facilitates an analysis of the prediction error of individual users, which we present in Section 5. To validate these results, we apply them to the problem of collaborative filtering under manipulator attack in Section 6. Interestingly, we find that matrix factorization are robust to the so-called “targeted attack”, but not so to the so-called “mass attack” unless the number of manipulators are small. These results agree with the simulation observations.\nWe briefly discuss relevant literatures. Azar et al. (2001) analyzed asymptotic performance of matrix factorization methods, yet under stringent assumptions on the fraction of observation and on the singular values. Drineas et al. (2002) relaxed these assumptions but it requires a few fully rated users – a situation that rarely happens in practice. Srebro (2004) considered the problem of the generalization error of learning a low-rank matrix. Their technique is similar to the proof of our first result, yet applied to a different context. Specifically, they are mainly interested in binary prediction (i.e., “like/dislike”) rather than recovering the real-valued ground-truth matrix (and its column subspace). In addition, they did not investigate the stability of the algorithm under noise and manipulators.\nRecently, some alternative algorithms, notably StableMC (Candes & Plan, 2010) based on nuclear norm optimization, and OptSpace (Keshavan et al., 2010b) based on gradient descent over the Grassmannian, have been shown to be stable vis a vis noise (Candes & Plan, 2010; Keshavan et al., 2010a). However, these two methods are less effective in practice. As documented in Mitra et al. (2010); Wen (2010) and many others, matrix factorization methods typically outperform these two methods. Indeed, our theoretical results reassure these empirical observations, see Section 3 for a detailed comparison of the stability results of different algorithms."

Thus, the ijth entry is the rating of item-i from user-j. The valid range of the rating is [−k,+k]. Y is assumed to be a rank-r matrix1, so there exists a factorization of this rating matrix Y = UV T , where Y ∈ Rm×n, U ∈ Rm×r, V ∈ Rn×r. Without loss of generality, we assume m ≤ n throughout the paper. Collaborative filtering is about to recover the rating matrix from a fraction of entries possibly corrupted by noise or error. That is, we observe Ŷij for (ij) ∈ Ω the sampling set (assumed to be uniformly random), and\nŶ = Y +E being a corrupted copy of Y , and we want to recover Y .

Recall that matrix factorization methods assume that, in the idealized noiseless case, the preference of each user belongs to a low-rank subspace. Therefore, if this subspace can be readily recovered, then we can predict preferences of a new user without re-run the matrix factorization algorithms. We analyze the latter, prediction error on individual users, in Section 5.\nTo illustrate the difference between the stability of the recovered matrix and that of the recovered subspace, consider a concrete example in movie recommendation, where there are both honest users and malicious manipulators in the system. Suppose we obtain an output subspace N∗ by (3) and the missing ratings are filled in by (4). If N∗ is very “close” to ground truth subspace N , then all the predicted ratings for honest users will be good. On the other hand, the prediction error of the preference of the manipulators – who do not follow the low-rank assumption – can be large, which leads to a large error of the recovered matrix. Notice that we are only interested in predicting the preference of the honest users. Hence the subspace stability provides a more meaningful metric here."

We express singular value decomposition of Y and Y ∗ in block matrix form as in (F.1) and (F.2) of Appendix F, and set the dimension of Σ1 and Σ̂1 to be r × r. Recall, rank(Y ) = r, so Σ1 = diag(σ1, ..., σr), Σ2 = 0, Σ̂1 = diag(σ ′ 1, ..., σ ′\nr). By setting Σ̂2 to 0 we obtained Y ′, the nearest rank-r matrix to Y ∗.

The common characteristic of targeted attacks is that they pretend to be the honest users in all ratings except on a few targets of interest. Thus, each dummy user can be decomposed into:\ne = egnd + s,\nwhere egnd ∈ N and s is sparse. Mass Attacks include random attack, love-hate attack (Mobasher et al., 2007) and others.

Proposition 3 essentially shows that matrix factorization approach is robust to the targeted attack model due to the fact that smax is small. Indeed, if the sampling rate |Ω|/(m(n + ne)) is fixed, then RMSE converges to zero as m increases. This coincides with empirical results on Netflix data (Bell & Koren, 2007). In contrast, similarity-based algorithms (kNN) are extremely vulnerable to such attacks, due to the high similarity between dummy users and (some) honest users.\nIt is easy to see that the factorization method is less robust to mass attacks, simply because ‖Egnd⊥‖F is not sparse, and hence smax can be as large as m. Thus, the right hand side of (12) may not diminish. Nevertheless, as we show below, if the number of ”Mass Attackers” does not exceed certain threshold, then the error will mainly concentrates on the E block. Hence, the prediction of the honest users is still acceptable.\nProposition 4.

Then the theory is applied to the notorious manipulator problem in collaborative filtering, which leads to an interesting insight of MF’s inherent robustness.\nMatrix factorization is an important tool both for matrix completion task and for PCA with missing data. Yet, its practical success hinges on its stability – the\nability to tolerate noise and corruption. This paper is a first attempt to understand the stability of matrix factorization, which we hope will help to guide the application of matrix factorization methods.\nWe list some possible directions to extend this research in future. In the theoretical front, the arguably most important open question is that under what conditions matrix factorization can reach a solution near global optimal. In the algorithmic front, we showed here that matrix factorization methods can be vulnerable to general manipulators. Therefore, it is interesting to develop a robust variation of MF that provably handles arbitrary manipulators."
