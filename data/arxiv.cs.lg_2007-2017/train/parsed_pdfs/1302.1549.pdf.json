    "abstractText" : "A pseudo independent (PI) model is a proba­ bilistic domain model (PDM) where proper subsets of a set of collectively dependent variables display marginal independence. PI models cannot be learned correctly by many algorithms that rely on a single link search. Earlier work on learning PI models has sug­ gested a straightforward multi-link search al­ gorithm. However, when a domain contains recursively embedded PI submodels, it may escape the detection of such an algorithm. In this paper, we propose an improved al­ gorithm that ensures the learning of all em­ bedded PI submodels whose sizes are upper bounded by a predetermined parameter. We show that this improved learning capability only increases the complexity slightly beyond that of the previous algorithm. The perfor­ mance of the new algorithm is demonstrated through experiment.",
