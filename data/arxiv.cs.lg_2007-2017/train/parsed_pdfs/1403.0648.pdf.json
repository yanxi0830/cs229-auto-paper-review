      "text" : "Following the mainstream interest in “big data”, one valuable direction of machine learning is towards to building up distributed, scalable and self-incentivised systems which could organise for solving large scale problems. Recently, prediction markets (Wolfers and Zitzewitz, 2004) show the promise of being the abstract framework for machine learners to design these systems. As one type of markets, prediction markets naturally introduce the concepts such as self-incentivised computation and distributed environment. Additionally, the close relationship between prediction markets and probabilities shed light on a new way of achieving probabilistic modelling (Storkey, 2011).\nSince Pennock and Wellman (1996), researchers have spent decades on building connections between machine learning and prediction markets. However, this problem has still not been well solved. One reason is that the framework of prediction markets is somehow too flexible, and in order to analyse the markets for machine learning goals one has to first specify a market model to describe the prediction markets. The other reason is that given a market model, we may still not know what the market is doing, even if we understand agent behaviours and market mechanisms. As distinct from most machine learning methods which explicitly define and optimise certain objectives, markets only introduce local objectives to each individual agent. To interpret a market as a machine learning method, we have to find the global objective that the market aims to optimise. This idea motivates our work.\nInstead of just focusing on market mechanisms (Chen and Vaughan, 2010), we would like to incorporate the agents and analyse our market as a whole. This setting is similar to (Storkey, 2011; Penna et al., 2012; Barbu and Lay, 2012); but unlike Barbu and Lay (2012), we will build a model on agent behaviours; and unlike\nar X\niv :1\n40 3.\n06 48\nv1 [\ncs .G\nT ]\nStorkey (2011) and Penna et al. (2012), we model agents using risk measures, which makes our markets analytical.\nThe novel results of this paper are:\n• establishing a new prediction market model which both inherits the strengths of prediction markets and has mathematical convenience;\n• giving explicitly the global objective that the market aims to optimise as a whole, and interpreting the market trading process as a sequential optimisation procedure of the global objective;\n• strengthening the intimate connections between machine learning and markets by showing that the market effectively solves the dual of certain machine learning problems."

      "text" : "Let Ω be the space of all possible future states. We say a prediction market is built on Ω if it trades securities associated with the future state ω ∈ Ω. Specifically, securities are defined as a set of random variables {ξk(·)} = {ξ1(·), ξ2(·) . . . , ξK(·)}. Each ξk(·) : Ω → R is a payment function, that is, one unit of this security will pay to the holder ξk(ω) if ω turns out to be the future state. This definition is quite general, and securities defined in this way are also referred to as complex securities (Abernethy et al., 2013). We require that all securities {ξk(·)} (collected into the vector ξ(·)) are linearly independent, that is, for a ∈ RK , we have a · ξ(·) = 0 only if a = 0. If they are not, then we can always pick a subset {ξk′(·)} of linearly independent securities from {ξk(·)} such that all the other securities in {ξk(·)} can be represented by the linear combination of {ξk′(·)} (Kreyszig, 2007). Therefore it is redundant to consider {ξk(·)} that are not linearly independent. As an example, the Arrow-Debreu security is a special case of complex securities. When the sample space Ω is discrete and contains only finite number of states, Arrow-Debreu securities are a set of K = |Ω| securities, in which the k-th one pays one unit if the k-th state is true: ξk(ω) = 1(ω = k). Note that in general cases K < |Ω|, e.g. when the value of ω is continuous, there will be infinite number of states but we always have a finite K for practice.\nAgents can only trade these predefined securities. The behaviour of an agent is characterised by its portfolio {w, sk} = {w, s1, s2, . . . , sK}, where w is the amount of money that the agent has, and sk is the amount of shares the agent holds in security k. We collect all sk into vector s. If an agent has a portfolio {w, sk}, the total payment of the securities is\nX(·) = s · ξ(·), (2.1)\nwhere X(·) : Ω → R is in essence a random variable on Ω. We call X(·) the risky asset because of its uncertainty and w the risk-free asset. The gross payment is thus\nX̂(·) = w + s · ξ(·) = w +X(·), (2.2)\nwhich is also a random variable. We call X̂(·) the (gross) asset. Denote X the set of allX(·) that are accessible for an agent, and similarly X̂ the set of all X̂(·). Notice that since {ξk(·)} are linearly independent, there exists a unique map (bijection) between X(·) and s via (2.1). Therefore a portfolio could also be represented by {w,X(·)}. In our setting X ⊆ span(ξ1(·), ξ2(·) . . . , ξK(·)), but it is possible to make X more abstract, which is not a space spanned by a prefixed number of securities but allows new security types to be added on the fly. This discussion is beyond our scope.\nA market consists of two processes, that 1) each agent chooses a portfolio {w,X(·)} it would like to hold, and 2) agents try to move to their preferred portfolio by trading. To describe the decision making process we need a model of portfolio selection, while to describe trading we need to specify a market mechanism. These two parts will be discussed in Section 3 and 4.\nLater in this paper, when the context is clear we will omit parentheses and write a random variable in an uppercase letter, e.g.X (except the securities, which are denoted by ξ), and use the lowercase of the same letter for the value of it, e.g. x. We will also write functionals in letters without any parentheses."

      "text" : "Agents select assets based on their preferences. An agent’s preference order of two assets is measured by a functional f : X̂ → R, such that the agent prefers one asset X̂ than the other asset Ŷ if and only if f(X̂) > f(Ŷ ), and that the agent is indifferent between X and Y if and only if f(X̂) = f(Ŷ ). There are plenty of theories on choosing and analysing a specific form of f . These includes expected utility theory (EUT) (Von Neumann and Morgenstern, 2007), dual utility theory (Yaari, 1987), risk measures (Artzner et al., 1999), etc. EUT is perhaps the most popular theories in economics and game theory, while risk measures are commonly seen in finance literature. We choose to use risk measures to model agent behaviours. We introduce risk measures in this section, while putting the detailed justification of using risk measures and its relation to EUT in Section 6."

      "heading" : "3.1 Risk measures",
      "text" : "As is indicated by their name, risk measures assign higher scores to assets that are more “risky”. They can also be understood as measures of the potential loss of choosing certain asset. A (monetary) risk measure is defined as a functional ρ : X → R such that ρ(0) is finite and ρ satisfies the following conditions (Artzner et al., 1999):\nTranslation invariance If X ∈ X and m ∈ R, then\nρ(X +m) = ρ(X)−m. (3.1)\nMonotonicity If X,Y ∈ X and X ≤ Y , then\nρ(X) ≥ ρ(Y ). (3.2)\nHere X ≤ Y should be understood as P (x ≤ y) = 1, that is, with the probability of one that X will generate a lower return than Y . Thus monotonicity indicates that an asset with a better return deserves a lower risk. Due to translation invariance, a risk measure maps any risk-free asset to itself, and is additive w.r.t. any risk-free asset. Therefore, the output of a risk measure has the same unit with a risk-free asset, and can be calculated like an asset.\nThe domains of risk measures and the preference functional f are different, as risk measures are defined on X while the space of assets that agent can hold is X̂ . Fortunately, we could easily extend the definition to the domain X̂ by applying translation invariance (3.1)\nρ(X̂) = ρ(X + w) = ρ(X)− w, ∀X̂ ∈ X̂ . (3.3)\nA corresponding f can thus be obtained by f = −ρ.\nRisk measures are very generic. In our discussion we will use both risk measures and a specific class of them, the convex risk measures (Föllmer and Schied, 2002). A risk measure is convex if ∀X1, X2 ∈ X and λ ∈ [0, 1]\nρ(λX1 + (1− λ)X2) ≤ λρ(X1) + (1− λ)ρ(X2). (3.4)\nIt says that the risk of a combination of two assets should not be higher than holding them separately. In other words, convex risk measures encourage diversification, which is a natural condition on risk measures."

      "text" : "Recall that a portfolio that leads to a higher value of f(X̂) is preferred. Thus the favourite portfolio of an agent should be the one that maximises f , which we denote by {w,X}opt. The behaviour of choosing {w,X}opt is called the rational choice, and an agent is rational if it always chooses {w,X}opt as its trading goal. Since in our framework f = −ρ, a rational agent will choose will {w,X}opt under the rule of\nmin {w,X} ρ(X̂) = min {w,X} ρ(w +X). (3.7)\nIn a market an agent only cares about its own goal (3.7). It seems like this property prevents us from linking markets to machine learning methods, as the latter always aim to achieve certain global objectives. However, with a careful design, we can let our markets implicitly define global objectives and make an agent contributes to the global objective at the same time as it achieves its own goal."

      "heading" : "4 Multi-period Trading Markets",
      "text" : "In this section we will build our market, a multi-period trading market whose trades are driven by a market maker. “Multi-period” is used to indicate that the prices of the securities are allowed to vary at different time steps, and that agents can trade with the market maker in multiple times (Föllmer et al., 2004). The market maker is introduced to simplify the market mechanism and to make the market run efficiently.\nIt is difficult to characterise the trading process in the markets with unspecified mechanisms, and those markets may not run efficiently. For example, there may not exist a consistent agreement among agents on how much should be paid to buy/sell one share of a security. Moreover, one agent who wants to sell a certain amount of shares may not find any buyers (Chen and Pennock, 2007). One way to simplify the trading process is by introducing a market maker (Hanson, 2007). A market maker is a special agent. It is a price maker, who defines the price for trading each security. All agents are only allowed to trade with the market maker. They can, however, make a trade at any time as long as they agree to pay under the market maker’s pricing. The pricing rule of a market maker at time step t is a functional ct : X → R. At different time steps the cost for purchasing an asset may be different, i.e. it may happen that ct(X) 6= ct′(X) when t 6= t′.\nSuppose that an agent has a portfolio {wt−1, Xt−1} at time t−1 and it would like to buy ∆Xt from the market maker at t. The agent cannot propose an arbitrary price ∆wt for ∆Xt but has to accept the price provided by the market maker ∆wt = −ct(∆Xt). The updated portfolio is thus restricted to {wt−1−ct(∆Xt), Xt−1 +∆Xt},\nand the updated asset is restricted to X̂t = Xt−1 + wt−1 + ∆Xt − ct(∆Xt). Now a rational agent only cares about choosing its optimal purchase amount ∆Xt such that ρ(X̂t) is minimised:\nmin {wt,Xt} ρ(X̂t) = min ∆Xt∈X\nρ(Xt−1 + ∆Xt + wt−1 − ct(∆Xt)). (4.1)\nThis portfolio selection procedure leads to Algorithm 1.\nAlgorithm 1 Select({wt−1, Xt−1}, ρ(·), ct(·)): portfolio selection of a rational agent Require: portfolio {wt−1, Xt−1}, risk measure ρ(·), pricing rule ct(·)\ncompute ∆Xt = arg min∆X′t∈X ρ(Xt−1 + ∆X ′ t + wt−1 − ct(∆X ′t)) using (4.1)\nEnsure: {∆Xt,−ct(∆Xt)}\nWe now consider a multi-period market which involves a set A = {1, 2, . . . , N} of agents and a market maker. Assume that at each round t there is only one agent at ∈ A that trades with the market maker. This assumption indicates that each agent trades with the market maker separately, and they do not cooperate to make a joint purchase. {a1, a2, . . . , aT } is thus the trading queue of the market. Since there are multiple agents, we use an extra subscript to distinguish the portfolios of different agents. For example, an agent n ∈ A’s portfolio at time t is {wn,t, Xn,t}. The initial values are denoted with the subscript t = 0. We collect all wn,t, Xn,t, X̂n,t into vectors wt,Xt and X̂t, respectively. We assume that agents do not bring in any risky asset at the beginning, which is a natural assumption since only the market maker can issue securities. This assumption means we have X0 = 0 and so X̂0 = w0.\nAt time t, only the agent at updates its portfolio by trading with the market maker while all the other agents keep the same portfolios as at t− 1. Suppose the asset that the agent at would like to purchase is ∆Xat,t, then for all n ∈ A\nXn,t = Xn,t−1 + 1(n = at)∆Xat,t, (4.2a) wn,t = wn,t−1 − 1(n = at)ct(∆Xat,t).

Before we start to analyse the multi-period trading markets, we introduce the machine learning context for which we want our markets to be utilised. Many machine learning tasks could be interpreted under the following generic framework: given a set of data sampled from a space Ω and a hypothesis space P which contains a class of accessible probabilities on Ω, we would like to find a probability from P that can best describe the data. Usually we use a functional F : P → R to characterise the “best” performance, such that the best probability is the one that minimises F .

Their study focuses on the market makers while agents are not directly modelled, which motivates a framework for the whole market.\nStorkey (2011) defines and analyses a type of prediction markets based on definitions on the markets, securities, and agents. Agents are modelled by EUT, that is, an agent is rational by maximising its expected utility. By analysing the equilibrium status of the market the author shows that the market can aggregate beliefs from agents to output a probability distribution over the future events. The author does not discuss precise market mechanisms or give the global objective of the market, which makes it difficult to link these markets to optimisation procedures.\nAnother important progress is given by Penna et al. (2012), who apply the market scoring rules as the market mechanism to the framework of Storkey (2011). The work shows that with a large population of agents whose portfolios are drawn from a demand distribution, the whole market implements stochastic mirror descent. One concern is that they suggest using EUT to model agents but they do not use it to solve the optimal portfolios for the agents. This problem is partially solved by Premachandra and Reid (2013), who derives the solution for a certain type of expected utilities. A similar setting is also studied by Sethi and Vaughan (2013). They focus more on the convergence of the market dynamics, and show how markets can aggregate beliefs by using numerical evidences."

      "heading" : "6.1 Risk measures and EUT",
      "text" : "Here we justify the choice of risk measures as the agent decision rules. First, the output value of a risk measure can be treated as a risk-free asset and standard linear operations are well defined for it. In comparison, an expected utility outputs a number that only has abstract meaning, i.e. to measure the degree of agent’s satisfaction. Additionally, risk measures force translation invariance by definition, but expected utility functions do not have this property in general. With the help of translation invariance, the wealth w can always be separated from the risky asset X , which implies that the optimal portfolio does not depend on w. This saves us from the trouble of associating w with the aggregation weights, as the relationship between them is highly\ninconsistent and varies dramatically under different utilities (Storkey et al., 2012). Finally, we could always derive convex a risk measure ρu from any expected utility (Föllmer et al., 2004)\nρu(X) ≡ inf{m ∈ R | EP [u(X +m)] ≥ u0}, (6.1)\nwhere P is the personal belief of the agent. In fact, the output of this risk measure is the risk premium, the least amount of money that one would like to borrow in order to accept this risky asset. Then a sensible decision rule should be to find an asset that minimise the premium, which leads to our decision rule.\nAs an example, consider the HARA utility\nuH(x) = 1− γ γ\n( ax\n1− γ + b\n)γ , a > 0, ax\n1− γ + b > 0. (6.2)\nThe resultant convex risk measure is the one who has the following penalty functional\nα(Q) = γ\na η−1/η(−u0)1/γ E\n[( dQ\ndP\n)η]1/η + (1− γ) b\na , (6.3)\nwhere 1/η+1/γ = 1. A special case of HARA is given by b = 1 and γ → −∞, which leads to the exponential utility function uE(x) = − exp(−ax). It is easy to check that the risk measure associated with exponential utility uE is exactly the entropic risk measure in (3.6) with θ = a (Föllmer and Schied, 2002)."

      "heading" : "7.1 Opinion Pooling",
      "text" : "The opinion pooling problem is a common setting for prediction market models (Barbu and Lay, 2012; Storkey et al., 2012). Garg et al. (2004) show that the objective of an opinion pool is to minimise a weighted sum of a set of divergences. Particularly, for logarithmic opinion pool the objective is to\nmin P∈P ∑ n wnD[P ||Pn], (7.1)\nwhere D[·||·] is the KL-divergence and {wn} are weight parameters.\nNow consider an log-opinion pool of a set of A probabilities on a finite discrete sample space Ω with K states. To set up a market that matches the log-opinion pool, we first define a market on the same space Ω and introduce K Arrow-Debreu securities. We introduce N agents, and assign a unique probability Pn ∈ A to agent n as its personal belief. According to (3.6), agent n’s risk measure has the form\nρn(sn) = 1\nθn log K∑ k=1 pke −θnsn,k , (7.2)\nwhere we let θn match the weight wn by θ−1n = wn. For the sake of simplicity, we choose a logarithmic market scoring rule market maker (Hanson, 2007)\nc(s0) = 1\nθ0 log K∑ k=1 eθ0s0,k . (7.3)\nThe market can be run by using Algorithm 2. Two typical simulation results are shown in Figure 1 and 2. The primal problem of this market is (applying Proposition 1 and 2)\nmin P∈P\n1\nθ0 D[P ||P0] + ∑ n∈A 1 θn D[P ||Pn], (7.4)\nwhere the domain P = ∆K is the probability simplex in K dimensions and P0 = uniform(K) is the discrete uniform distribution in ∆K . In this case the optimal P can be analytically solved. Recall that θ−1n = wn and we have\nP ∝ ∏ n∈A P wn/(θ −1 0 + ∑ n∈A wn) n . (7.5)\nSince we introduce the market maker, the aggregated belief P is not a pure weighted product of agents’ beliefs, but with a bias towards P0. However, when the population is sufficiently large such that ∑ n θ −1 n θ−10 , the effect of the market maker could be ignored and we will end up with a pure aggregation of agent beliefs (Penna et al., 2012)."

      "heading" : "7.2 Bayesian Update",
      "text" : "We give our second example by first setting up a market and then match a machine learning problem to the market. Let’s build a market on a continuous sample space Ω = R. We only define one security ξ(ω) = ω, and so the asset X = sω. We introduce only one agent. Again, the agent is characterised by an entropic risk measures, with coefficient θ1 and P1 = N (µ1, σ21) is the normal distribution. The moment-generating function in (3.6) is\nMX(−θ1) = EP1 [e−θ1sω] = e−θ1sµ1+σ 2 1θ 2 1s 2/2, (7.6)\nand so the risk measure is ρ1(s) = −sµ1 + σ21θ1s2/2. For the market maker we use the quadratic market scoring rule c(s) = θ0s2/2. Now we could run this market using Algorithm 2 with only one agent.\nIt could be shown that this market implements a Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) update for the Gaussian, in which the prior is provided by the market maker and the likelihood information is provided by the agent.\nConsider the setting of estimating a univariate Gaussian N (µ, σ1). All we need is the sufficient statistics calculated from a set of N data points D = {x1, x2, . . . , xN}. For clarity of exposition let’s assume that we only care about the Bayesian updates of the mean parameter µ, and think σ1 is a prefixed constant. Introduce a Conjugate prior on the mean\np(µ | µ0, σ0) ∝ exp ( − 1 θ0 (µ− µ0)2 2σ20 ) , (7.7)\nwhere θ−10 is so-called the pseudo count. The posterior is\np(µ | D, µ0, σ0) ∝ p(µ | µ0, σ0)p(D | µ, σ1) ∝ exp ( − 1 θ0 (µ− µ0)2 2σ20 ) exp ( −N (µ− x̄) 2 2σ21 ) ∝ exp\n( − 1 θ0 (µ− µ0)2 2σ20 − 1 θ1 (µ− µ1) 2σ21 ) , (7.8)\nwhere µ1 = x̄ denotes the sample mean of the data set, and θ1 = N−1. If our goal is to calculate the MAP distribution then we have an optimisation problem\nL = min µ∈R\n1\nθ0\n(µ− µ0)2\n2σ20 +\n1\nθ1\n(µ− µ1)2\n2σ21 . (7.9)\nLet\nF0(µ) ≡ 1\nθ0\n(µ− µ0)2\n2σ20 , F1(µ) ≡\n1\nθ1\n(µ− µ1)2\n2σ21 , (7.10)\nand thus we have L = minµ∈R F0(µ) + F1(µ). Since F0 and F1 are convex, we could apply the Fenchel’s duality to the problem L, which gives us the following dual problem\n− L′ = min s∈R F ∗0 (s) + F ∗ 1 (−s), (7.11)\nwhere F ∗0 is the Legendre-Fenchel transform of F0\nF ∗0 (s) = sup µ∈R\nsµ− F0(s) = sµ0 + 1\n2 σ20θ0s 2, (7.12)\nand similarly F ∗1 (s) = sµ1 + 1 2σ 2 1θ1s 2. Choose the hyperparameter µ0 = 0, σ0 = 1, and we finally have\n− L′ = min s∈R θ0 2 s2 +\n( −sµ1 + 1\n2 σ21θ1s 2\n) = min\ns∈R c(x) + ρ1(s). (7.13)\nThis is exactly the agent’s objective. Since s and µ are dual to each other, the market performs the Bayesian update (MAP estimate) in the dual space of the mean parameters."

      "heading" : "7.3 Logistic Regression",
      "text" : "In the third example we discuss a classic machine learning problem. Given a data set D = {{xm,ym} | xm ∈ RK ,ym = {+1,−1},m = 1, . . . ,M}, we would like to build logistic regression model with l2-regularisation. The objective is\nL = min w∈RK\n1\nM M∑ m=1 log ( 1 + eym(w·xm) ) + λ 2 ‖w‖2, (7.14)\nwhere ‖ · ‖ is the l2 norm.\nTo convert this problem to a market we use (5.2) and Proposition 1. Let the sample space be the space that generates the data Ω ≡ RK∪{+1,−1} and each future state is associated with a data in Ω, ω = {x, y}. Define K securities, each of which is ξk(ω) = yxk. We introduce N = K agents, such that the agent n = k is only interested in trading in the k-th security ξk. Thus the shares of security k held by agent n is sn,k = 1(n = k)wk, and the asset is Xn = sn · ξ = wnξn. The market inventory is s0 = ∑ n sn = w. Let c(w) be the first term on the RHS of (7.14) and define the risk measure of agent n as ρn(sn) = λs2n/2. We end up with\nL = min w c(w) + K∑ k=1 λ 2 w2k = min{sn} c(s0) + N∑ n=1 ρn(sn). (7.15)\nNow the market is ready to run under Algorithm 2. In order to show a slightly deeper connection to a specific learning method, we notice that the objective of agent n at each round is min∆wk,t c(wt−1+∆wk,t)+(wk,t−1+ ∆wk,t)\n2/2. As the solution to this is not analytic, it is costly to solve for the exactly minimum of this objective at each time. To get rid of this problem, we could relax the condition that agents behaviour is rationally optimal, and let the agents accept a portfolio as long as it is better than its current position ρn(ŝn,t) < ρn(ŝn,t−1). Specifically agents can take steps towards the optimal solution. This can be achieved by the following portfolio updating rule\n∆wk,t = −a d\ndwk\n( c(w) + λ\n2 w2k )∣∣∣∣ w=wt−1 , (7.16)\nwhere a > 0 is adjusted such that ρn(ŝn,t) < ρn(ŝn,t−1). In practice a could be chosen by backtracking line search (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004). The market we designed above effectively implements a coordinate descent algorithm (Luo and Tseng, 1992).\nNote that, instead of introducing N = K agents, we can match the logistic regression problem by using only one agent and allowing it to trade all securities. This will result in a standard gradient descent method."

      "heading" : "8 Conclusion",
      "text" : "This paper establishes and discusses a new model for prediction markets. We use risk measures instead of expected utility to model agents, which results in an analytical market framework. We show that our market as a whole optimises certain global objective through its market dynamics. Based on this result, we make intimate connections between machine learning and markets.\nOne future work would be conducting a detailed analysis of this framework using the tools of convex optimisation (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004). A particularly interesting topic is to find the conditions under which the market will converge. As we have observed, the stochasticity comes in when a large population of agents are involved, which is believed to be the nature of any real market (Penna et al., 2012)."

Additionally, the market dynamics provides a sensible algorithm for optimising the global objective.
