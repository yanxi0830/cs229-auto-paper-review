      "text" : "In the BEST-1-ARM problem, we are given n stochastic arms A1, . . . , An. The ith arm Ai has a reward distribution Di with an unknown mean µi ∈ [0, 1]. We assume that all reward distributions are Gaussian distributions with variance 1. Upon each play of Ai, we can get a reward value sampled i.i.d. from Di. Our goal is to identify the arm with largest mean using as few samples as possible. We assume here that the largest mean is strictly larger than the second largest (i.e., µ[1] > µ[2]) to ensure the uniqueness of the solution, where µ[i] denotes the i\nth largest mean. The problem is also called the pure exploration problem in the stochastic multi-armed bandit literature.\nWe say an algorithm A is δ-correct for BEST-1-ARM, if it outputs the correct answer on any instance with probability at 1− δ, and we use TA(I) to denote the expected number of total samples taken by algorithm A on instance I . We also define the gap of ith arm, ∆[i] := µ[1] − µ[i]."

      "text" : "We propose to study BEST-1-ARM from the perspective of instance optimality, the ultimate notion of optimality (see e.g., Fagin et al. (2003); Afshani et al. (2009)).\nFor the 2-arm cases, the KKS-JMNS bound O(∆−2 ln ln∆−12 ) is an upper bound for every instance, and the Farrell lower bound Ω(∆−2 ln ln∆−12 ) is a lower bound for the worst case instances. As we observed in (Chen and Li (2015)), it is impossible to obtain an instance optimal algorithm even for the 2-arm cases. While the observation has ruled out any hope of an instance optimal algorithm for BEST-1-ARM, however, as we will see, it is still possible to obtain very satisfiable answer in terms of instance optimality.\nNow, we formally define what is an instance-wise lower bound. Clearly, two arm instances differ only by a permutation of arms should be considered as the same instance. Inspired by Afshani et al. (2009), we give the following natural definition.\nDefinition 3.1 (Order-Oblivious Instance-wise Lower Bound) Given a BEST-1-ARM instance I and a confidence level δ, we define\nL(I, δ) := inf A:A is δ-correct for BEST-1-ARM\n1\nn! · ∑ π∈Sym(n) TA(π ◦ I),\nwhere the summation is over all n! permutations of {1, . . . , n}.\nThe MT lower bound immediately implies that L(I, δ) = Ω( ∑n i=2 ∆ −2 [i] ln δ −1). We conjecture that the two-arm instance is the only obstruction toward an instance-wise optimal algorithm. More precisely, we have the following conjecture.\nConjecture 3.2 There is an algorithm for BEST-1-ARM with sample complexity O(L(I, δ) + ∆−22 ln ln∆ −1 2 ),\nfor any instance I and δ < 0.1. And we say such an algorithm is almost instance-wise optimal for BEST-1-ARM.\nIn the light of the discussion for the 2-arm cases, there must be a gap between the sample complexity of a δ-correct algorithm and L(I, δ), and Conjecture 3.2 states that the gap can be as small as an additive factor ∆−22 ln ln∆ −1 2 , which is all we need to find out the best arm from the top-2 arms, and is an inevitable gap even for the 2-arm instances. Moreover, we provide an explicit formula for L(I, δ). Interestingly, the formula involves an entropy term (similar entropy terms also appear in Afshani et al. (2009) for completely different problems). We define the entropy term first.\nDefinition 3.3 Given a BEST-1-ARM instance I , let\nGk = {i ∈ [2, n] | 2 −k ≤ ∆[u] < 2 −k+1}, Hk = ∑ i∈Gk ∆−2[i] , and pk = Hk/ ∑ j Hj.\nWe can view {pk} as a discrete probability distribution. We define the following quantity as the gap entropy for the instance I\nEnt(I) = ∑\nGk 6=∅ pk log p\n−1 k . 1\nRemark 3.4 We choose to partition the arms based on the powers of 2. There is nothing special about 2 and replacing it by any other constant only changes Ent(I) by a constant factor.\nThen we formally state our conjecture.\nConjecture 3.5 For any BEST-1-ARM instance I and δ < 0.1, we have\nL(I, δ) = Θ ( ∑n\ni=2 ∆−2 [i] · ( ln δ−1 + Ent(I) )\n)\n.\nIn the next section, we will try to motivate the term Ent(I) and explain the reasons that lead us to make the above conjecture."

      "text" : "In our recent work (Chen and Li (2015)), we provide an algorithm with the following sample complexity:\nO (\n∆−2[2] ln ln∆ −1 [2] +\n∑n\ni=2 ∆−2[i] ln δ\n−1 + ∑n\ni=2 ∆−2[i] ln lnmin(n,∆ −1 [i] )\n)\n. (1)\nFurthermore, the algorithm achieves a sample complexity of\nO (\n∆−2[2] ln ln∆ −1 [2] +\n∑n\ni=2 ∆−2[i] ln δ\n−1 )\n, (2)\nfor clustered instances (We say an instance is clustered if the number of nonempty Gks is bounded by a constant).\nOur new upper bounds (1) and (2) match our conjectured gap entropy lower bound in two extreme cases. On one extreme, the maximum value Ent(I) can get is O(ln lnn). This can be achieved by instances in which there are log n nonempty groups Gi and they have almost the same weight Hi. Hence, (1) is optimal for such instances. On the other extreme where there is only a constant number of nonempty groups (i.e., the instance is clustered), Ent(I) = O(1), and our algorithm can achieve almost instance optimality (without relying on the Conjecture 3.5, due to the MT lower bound) in this case.\nBesides the fact that our algorithm can achieve optimal results for both extreme cases, we have more reasons to believe why Ent(I) should enter the picture.\nUpper Bounds: First, we motivate the gap entropy Ent from the algorithmic side. Consider an elimination-based algorithm (such as Karnin et al. (2013) or our algorithm). We must ensure that the best arm is not eliminated in any round. Recall that in the rth round, we want to eliminate arms with gap ∆r = Θ(2−r), which is done by obtaining an approximation of the best arm, then take O(∆−2r ln δ −1 r ) samples from each arm and eliminate the arms with smaller empirical means. Roughly speaking, we\n1. Note that it is exactly the Shannon entropy for the distribution defined by {pk}.\nneed to assign the failure probability δr carefully to each round (by union bound, we need ∑\nr δr ≤ δ). The algorithm in Karnin et al. (2013) used δr = O(δ · r−2), and we used a better way to assign δr. Indeed, if one can assign δr’s optimally (i.e., minimize ∑ r Hr ln δ −1 r subject to ∑\nr δr ≤ δ), one could achieve the entropy bound ∑\nr Hr · (ln δ −1 + Ent(I)) (by letting δr = δHr/\n∑\niHi). Of course, this does not lead to an algorithm directly, as we do not know His in advance.\nUsing our techniques, we can estimate the values Hr’s when we enter the rth elimination stage. The only obstacle for implementing the above idea of assigning δr’s optimally is that we do not know ∑\nr Hr initially. We believe the difficulty can be overcome by additional new algorithmic ideas.\nLower Bounds: In Chen and Li (2015), we prove the following lower bound, improving the MT lower bound.\nTheorem 4.1 (Theorem 1.6 in Chen and Li (2015)) There exist constants c, c1 > 0 and N ∈ N such that, for any δ < 0.005 and any δ-correct algorithm A, and any n ≥ N , there exists an n arms instance I such that TA[I] ≥ c · ∑n i=2 ∆ −1 [i] ln lnn. Furthermore, ∆ −2 [2] ln ln∆ −1 [2] < c1 lnn · ∑n i=2∆ −1 [i] ln lnn.\nIn fact, in the lower bound instances, there are log n nonempty groups Gi and they have almost the same weight Hi (hence, Ent(I) = Θ(ln lnn)). Combining with the MT lower bound, we have covered the two extreme ends of Conjecture 3.5.\nMoreover, it is possible to extend our current technique to construct many instances IS such that any algorithm A requires at least Ω(H(IS) · Ent(IS)) samples. This strongly suggests Ω(H(I) · Ent(I)) is the right lower bound. However, a complete resolution of Conjecture 3.5 seems to require new techniques."
