      "text" : "In large-scale machine learning application fields such as computer vision, or metagenomics, learning similarity-preserving binary codes is critical in order to perform efficient indexing of large-scale highdimensional data. Storage requirements can be reduced and similarity search sped up by embedding high-dimensional data into a compact binary code.\nA classical method is Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) (Andoni and Indyk [2008]) for nearest neighbors search: 1) input data with high dimension d are projected onto a lower c-dimensional space through a c×d random projection with i.i.d. Gaussian entries, 2) then a hashing function is applied to the resulting projected vector to obtain the final binary codes. Two examples for the hashing function are crosspolytope LSH (Terasawa and Tanaka [2007]) which returns the closest vector from the set {±1ei}1≤i≤c where {ei}1≤i≤c stands for the canonical basis, and hyperplane LSH (Andoni et al. [2015]) corresponding to the sign function applied pointwise. For reducing the storage cost of the projection and the computation time of the matrix-vector products (O(c×d)), a pseudo-random matrix with structure can be used instead (Andoni et al. [2015], Bojarski et al. [2017]) leading to a reduced time complexity of O(d log c) thanks to fast Hadamard and Fourier transforms.\nIn order to increase the accuracy of the data sketches in the context of nearest neighbors search or classification, this projection can be also learned from data (Weiss et al. [2008], Wang et al. [2012], Gong\n∗To whom correspondence should be adressed: anne.morvan@cea.fr.

[2013], Kong and Li [2012], Yu et al. [2014]). As Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a common tool for reducing data dimensionality, PCA is often performed: data are then projected onto the first c principal components. But the PCA alone is not sufficient. Indeed, the c first principal components are chosen with a decreasing order of explained variance. It means that principal directions with higher variance carry more information. Consequently, associating each of the c directions to one of the c bits is equivalent to giving more weights to less informative directions and will lead to poor performance of the obtained sketches.\nTo remedy this problem, after data have been projected on the first principal components of the covariance matrix, a solution consists in applying a suitable rotation on the projected data before performing the hashing function, in order to balance variance over the principal components. In work from Jégou et al. [2010], a random rotation is successfully applied giving quite good results. In ITerative Quantization (ITQ) (Gong and Lazebnik [2011], Gong et al. [2013]) or in Isotropic Hashing (IsoHash) (Kong and Li [2012]), the rotation is rather learned. In ITQ, the rotation is iteratively computed by an alternating minimization algorithm corresponding to an orthogonal Procrustes problem. This technique is currently the state-of-the-art for computing similarity-preserving binary codes.\nITQ method comes with some drawbacks, though. First, the convergence guarantees are only empirical. The method needs a parameter for the number of iterations required to compute the rotation. Second, the alternative optimization process relies on the computation of the SVD of a c× c matrix at each iteration, which even if c is small in comparison with d, corresponds to a time complexity of O(c3). Finally, ITQ is a completely offline process since 1) the whole dataset needs to be stored for computing the c principal components, 2) the computation of the rotation is based on the whole c × n projected dataset onto the principal components where n is the number of instances. This can be prohibitive when dealing with lots of high-dimensional data.\nContributions In this paper, our contributions are two-fold: 1) We provide an offline algorithm outperforming ITQ from the following points of view: accuracy, computation time and spatial complexities, and convergence guarantees. 2) We also introduce a streaming adaptation of the algorithm where data is seen only once and principal subspace plus the balancing rotation are updated as new data is seen. Besides the c× d principal subspace to return, this requires only the storage of two c× c matrices -one is the covariance matrix of the projected data onto the c principal components- instead of the whole initial and projected datasets as it is the case for ITQ. Depending on the availability of data and the expected accuracy of the sketches, the binary compact codes can be computed from one, two or three passes over the data. In any case, for only one pass over the data, our online algorithm gives better results than OSH (Leng et al. [2015a]) while being far less computationally demanding."

[2016]): data-independent (Andoni and Indyk [2008], Raginsky and Lazebnik [2009], Grauman and Kulis [2011]) and data dependent methods. The latter ones learn the hash codes from a training set and perform better. The learning can be unsupervised (Weiss et al. [2008], Liu et al. [2011], Gong and Lazebnik [2011], Gong et al. [2013], Kong and Li [2012], Lee [2012], Liu et al. [2014], Yu et al.

[2012], Liu et al. [2012]). Some recent hashing functions involve deep learning (Lai et al. [2015], Chen et al. [2015]). When the dataset is too large to be loaded into memory, distributed (Leng et al. [2015b]) and online hashing techniques (Huang et al. [2013], Leng et al. [2015a]) have been developed. Online Hashing (OKH) (Huang et al. [2013]) learns the hash functions from a stream of pair of data with a ”Passive-Aggressive” method. In Online Sketching Hashing (OSH) (Leng et al. [2015a]), the binary embeddings are learned from a maintained sketch of the dataset with a smaller size but preserving the property of interest. The proposed algorithm belongs to this latter category of online unsupervised hyperplanes-based hashing methods."

Our goal is to learn a binary code matrix B ∈ {−1, 1}c×n where c denotes the code length such that for each bit k = 1... c, the binary encoding function is defined by hk(xt) = sign(w̃ T k xt) where w̃k are column vectors of hyperplane coefficients and sign(x) = 1 if x ≥ 0 and −1 otherwise which is applied component-wise on coefficients of vectors. B = sign(W̃X) where each row k of W̃ is w̃Tk , with W̃ ∈ Rc×d.\nIn ITQ and our model, W̃ = RW where R is a suitable c×c orthogonal matrix and the c×d matrix W represents the linear dimensionality reduction method applied to data. For instance, W can be the matrix whose row vectors wTk correspond to the c first principal components of the covariance matrix C = XX T (an other supervised approach is to perform Canonical Correlation Analysis (Gong et al. [2013])). So the challenge is rather in defining an appropriate orthogonal matrix.\nFor ITQ, R is obtained through the optimization process minimizing the following quantization loss: Q(B,R) = ||B−W̃X||2F = ||B−RWX||2F = ||B−RV ||2F where V = WX and ||.||F denotes the Froebenius norm.\nAfter having initialized R with a random orthogonal matrix thanks to a QR decomposition with time complexity O(c3), ITQ alternatively computes B after freezing R and optimizes R according to B by performing the SVD of V TB.

Let us consider the c diagonal coefficients of CovV : σ21 , ..., σ 2 c s.t. σ 2 1 ≥ ... ≥ σ2c\n2. As CovV is symmetric, Tr(CovV ) = ∑c i=1 σ 2 i = ∑c i=1 λi where Tr stands for the Trace application and λ1, ..., λc are the c first eigenvalues of C s.t. λ1 ≥ ... ≥ λc. Balancing variance over the c directions can be seen as equalizing the diagonal coefficients of CovV such that σ21 = ... = σ 2 c def = τ . Figure 1 shows the covariance matrices for CIFAR-10 training set (n = 59000, d = 960, c = 32) corresponding to (a) projected data V after basic PCA, (b) rotated and projected data RV with ITQ, and (c) with our algorithm uniformizing the diagonal. One can note that diagonal coefficients for ITQ tend to be identical. So it makes sense to uniformize the diagonal.\nLemma 1. If R is an orthogonal matrix i.e. RRT = RTR = I where I stands for the identity matrix and M is a symmetric matrix, then Tr(R MRT ) = Tr(M). In particular R can be a rotation.\nAccording to Lemma 1, since CovV is symmetric, Tr(R CovV RT ) = Tr(CovV ). So in order to have R CovV RT with equal diagonal coefficients, we should set τ = Tr(CovV )/c.\nSo, similarly to IsoHash from work in (Kong and Li [2012]), we formulate the problem of finding R as the problem of equalizing the diagonal coefficients of CovV to the value τ = Tr(CovV )/c."

The two updated diagonal coefficients (i, i) and (j, j) only depend on CovVi,j , CovVj,j , CovVj,i and θ which reduces the optimization of θ to a 2-dimensional problem, a classical trick when using Givens rotations (Golub and van der Vorst [2000]).

At most c− 1 Givens rotations are computed, each implying four column or row multiplications i.e. 4c flops. So the final time complexity is O(c2).\nSpatial complexity ITQ requires the storage of two c× n matrices: the after-PCA projected dataset V and the corresponding binary encoding matrix B. As ITQ is dependent on the number of training data, it scales poorly w.r.t the size of the datasets and is of limited use for larger-than-memory datasets.\nTime complexity Learning R with our model is computationally cheaper than taking a random rotation as it implies a QR decomposition with a cost of O(c3).\nThis is also the case for ITQ where for a certain number of iterations, the c× c product BTV should be computed (O(c2n)), followed by an SVD (O(c3)) corresponding to a final cost: O(Kc2n+Kc3) where K is the number of iterations and set in practice to 50. Moreover, one can remark that in the proposed model, the computation time for R does not depend on the size of the training set which makes it scalable.\nIn IsoHash (Kong and Li [2012]), authors have already formulated the problem as a variance-uniformization one. Two algorithms were proposed: Lift and projection and Gradient Flow, both looking for an orthogonal matrix R corresponding to a matrix with a uniform diagonal and the same eigenvalues as CovV . Lift and projection (LP) consists in alternative projections on the space of matrices with uniform diagonal and the space of matrices with the same eigenvalues as CovV . This costs niter SVD of a c × c matrix. So the corresponding time complexity is O(c3 × niter) with niter in practice set to 100. Gradient Flow (GF) involves an integration of a differential equation using Adams-Bashforth-Moulton PECE solver, with a cost equal to O(c3). So LP is very slow while GF barely faster. In both cases, even if c is small in comparison to d and the complexities do not either depend on n, our model has the great advantages 1) to have a lower time complexity cost, 2) to be much more simpler than IsoHash."

[2000]), also named OPAST, is a method to quickly estimate and track the principal subspace of a data stream, corresponding to matrix W . At each iteration t, OPAST guarantees the orthonormality of Wt rows and costs only 4dc + O(c\n2) flops while storing only W and a c× c matrix. The pseudo-code is given by algorithm 3 in appendix.\nOnline update of a suitable rotation The procedure to compute Rt relies exclusively on the c × c covariance matrix of projected data CovVt and not on the whole V as for ITQ. CovVt is easy to update dynamically and this is performed while computing Wt with OPAST algorithm, so no need of adaptation for the Rt learning in the streaming setting.\nRemark also that this stage is completely independent from the first one to compute the principal subspace. One interest of UnifDiag algorithm for learning the rotation is the freedom to plug any other method for online PCA (Feng et al.

Should we perform a first pass over the data in order to work on a reliable Wt?\nOne pass over the data will give poorer performance relatively to the other approaches with two or three passes since data are directly projected onto Wt which is not properly estimated during the first iterations. Consequently, Rt is also learned from an approximate estimation of projected data covariance at step t: CovVt.\nIf three passes are possible over the data, results will be optimal and far more better than only one pass. One pass can be used for obtaining W and a second for CovV . Then, R can be correctly computed and a third pass is used for getting the final binary embedding: xt is projected onto RtWt and the function sign is applied. This is still a streaming algorithm which reduces the memory storage requirements in comparison to ITQ and there is no loss of accuracy.\nAlternatively, two passes can be done: one for W and CovV and a second for the encoding -rotation and sign applications- leading to results with intermediate quality in comparison with the one and three passes approaches."

Despite what is announced, OSH is fundamentally mini-batch: the stream is divided into chunks of data for which a matrix S ∈ Rd×l as a sketch of the whole dataset X ∈ Rd×n is maintained. Then the principal components are computed from the updated sketch S. The projection of data followed by the random rotation can be applied only after this step. Therefore there are actually two passes over the data by reading twice data of each chunk.\nSpatial complexity Without counting the projection matrix and the rotation, OSH needs spatially to maintaining the sketch S which costs O(d× l) with l d. The SVD decomposition then needs O(ld+ l2). In comparison, we only need O(c2) with c l.\nTime complexity For each round, OSH takes O(dl2 + l3) to learn the principal components.

Our approach shows promising results for both offline and online settings, as evidenced by the experimental part. It can achieve accuracy at least similar to if not better than state-of-theart methods while saving considerable computation time and spatial requirements. Further work would be to investigate whether another rotation, not uniformizing the diagonal of the covariance matrix of the projected data, could be more optimal. Another interesting perspective would be to evaluate the performance of the compact binary codes in other machine learning applications: instead of using the original data, one could use directly these binary embeddings to perform unsupervised or supervised learning hopefully without downgrading the accuracy."

      "text" : "In this section Theorem 2 is proven. Theorem 2 If min(a, d) ≤ τ ≤ max(a, d) (sufficient condition5) then there exists one θ ∈ [pi/2;π/2]\nsuch that a′ = τ with cos(θ) = √\n1+c1c2−s1s2 2 and sin(θ) = − c1s2+c2s1 2 cos θ , c1 = ( a−d 2 ) / √( a−d 2 )2 + b2,\ns1 = b/ √( a−d 2 )2 + b2, c2 = (τ − a+d2 )/ √( a−d 2 )2 + b2 and s2 = √ 1− c22 ∈ R+.\nProof. As stated in equation 3, the problem of finding a suitable angle θ to uniformize the diagonal of CovV can be reduced to the following 2-dimensional problem:(\na′ b′ b′ d′\n) def = ( c −s s c )( a b b d )( c s −s c ) (4)\nwhere a def = CovVj,j , d def = CovVi,i, b def = CovVj,i = CovVi,j . This implies :\na′ = a+ d 2 + ( a−d 2 b ) . ( cos(2θ) − sin(2θ) ) (5)\nd′ = a+ d 2 − ( a−d 2 b ) . ( cos(2θ) − sin(2θ) ) (6)\nb′ = ( a−d 2 b ) . ( sin(2θ) cos(2θ) ) (7)\nAs, the Givens angle θ should be parameterized so that the diagonal coefficients are set to a same value τ , the following holds: (\na−d 2 b\n) . ( cos(2θ) − sin(2θ) ) = τ − a+ d 2 (8)\n5This theorem uses only a sufficient condition. A weaker necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee |c2| < 1 and s2 ∈ R+ is a+d2 − √( a−d 2 )2 + b2 ≤ τ ≤ a+d 2 + √( a−d 2 )2 + b2 (proof by setting b = 0).\nRecall that:\nc1 def = cos(θ1) =\n( a− d\n2\n) / √( a− d\n2\n)2 + b2 (9)\ns1 def = sin(θ1) = b/\n√( a− d\n2\n)2 + b2 (10)\nc2 def = cos(θ2) = ( τ − a+ d\n2\n) / √( a− d\n2\n)2 + b2 (11)\ns2 def = sin(θ2) = √ 1− c22. (12)\nRemark that the condition min(a, d) < τ < max(a, d) guarantees c2 to be well defined i.e. |c2| ≤ 1 and s2 ∈ R+. Then, equation 8 becomes: (\nc1 s1 )( cos(2θ) − sin(2θ) ) = c2. (13)\nThis is clear that a solution of equation 13 is:( cos(2θ) − sin(2θ) ) = ( c1c2 − s1s2 c1s2 + c2s1 ) . (14)\nIn that case, one can take:\ncos(θ) =\n√ 1 + cos(2θ)\n2 =\n√ 1 + c1c2 − s1s2\n2 (15)\nsin(θ) = sin(2θ) 2 cos(θ) = −c1s2 + c2s1 2 cos θ (16)\nand the corresponding Givens rotation gives:\na′ = τ (17) d′ = a+ d− τ (18)\nb′ = ( a−d 2 b )(sin(2θ) cos(2θ) ) (19)\n=\n√( a− d\n2\n)2 + b2 ( c1 s1 )(−c1s2 − c2s1 c1c2 − s1s2 ) (20)\n= −s2\n√( a− d\n2\n)2 + b2 (21)\nwith s2 completely defined by equations 12 and 11."

As Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a common tool for reducing data dimensionality, PCA is often performed: data are then projected onto the first c principal components. But the PCA alone is not sufficient. Indeed, the c first principal components are chosen with a decreasing order of explained variance. It means that principal directions with higher variance carry more information. Consequently, associating each of the c directions to one of the c bits is equivalent to giving more weights to less informative directions and will lead to poor performance of the obtained sketches. To remedy this problem, after data have been projected on the first principal components of the covariance matrix, a solution consists in applying a suitable rotation on the projected data before performing the hashing function, in order to balance variance over the principal components. In work from Jégou et al. [2010], a random rotation is successfully applied giving quite good results.",

    "abstractText" : "In this paper, we address the problem of learning compact similarity-preserving embeddings for massive high-dimensional streams of data in order to perform efficient similarity search. We present a new method for computing binary compressed representations -sketchesof high-dimensional real feature vectors. Given an expected code length c and high-dimensional input data points, our algorithm provides a binary code of c bits aiming at preserving the distance between the points from the original high-dimensional space. Our offline version of the algorithm outperforms the offline state-of-the-art methods regarding their computation time complexity and have a similar quality of the sketches. It also provides convergence guarantees. Moreover, our algorithm can be straightforwardly used in the streaming context by not requiring neither the storage of the whole dataset nor a chunk. We demonstrate the quality of our binary sketches through extensive experiments on real data for the nearest neighbors search task in the offline and online settings.",
