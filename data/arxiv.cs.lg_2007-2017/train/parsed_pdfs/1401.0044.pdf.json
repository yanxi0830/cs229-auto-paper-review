However, it may converge only to a local optimum or may not converge at all. An algorithm was recently introduced for attractive binary pairwise MRFs which is guaranteed to return an ǫ-approximation to the global minimum of F in polynomial time provided the maximum degree ∆ = O(log n), where n is the number of variables. Here we significantly improve this algorithm and derive several results including a new approach based on analyzing first derivatives of F , which leads to performance that is typically far superior and yields a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for attractive models without any degree restriction. Further, the method applies to general (non-attractive) models, though with no polynomial time guarantee in this case, leading to the important result that approximating log of the Bethe partition function, logZB = −minF , for a general model to additive ǫaccuracy may be reduced to a discrete MAP inference problem. We explore an application to predicting equipment failure on an urban power network and demonstrate that the Bethe approximation can perform well even when BP fails to converge."

      "text" : "Undirected graphical models, also termed Markov random fields (MRFs), are flexible tools used in many areas including speech recognition, systems biology and computer vision. A set of variables and a score function is specified such that the probability of a configuration of variables is proportional to the value of the score function, which typi-\nColumbia University CUCS Technical Report.\ncally factorizes into sub-functions over subsets of variables in a way that defines a topology on the variables.\nThree central problems are:\n1. To evaluate the partition function Z , which is the sum of the score function over all possible settings, and hence is the normalization constant for the probability distribution.\n2. Marginal inference, which is computing the probability distribution of a given subset of variables.\n3. Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference, which is the task of identifying a setting of all the variables which has maximum probability.\nThe first two problems are related (marginals are a ratio of two partition functions). Computing Z belongs to the class of counting problems #P (Valiant, 1979). Further, exact marginal inference is NP-hard (Cooper, 1990). The MAP problem is typically easier, yet is still NP-hard (Shimony, 1994), even to approximate (Abdelbar & Hedetniemi, 1998). Much work has focused on trying to find good approximate solutions, or restricted domains where exact solutions may be found efficiently. One popular method is to use a message-passing algorithm called belief propagation (Pearl, 1988), which returns an exact solution in linear time in n, the number of variables, if the topology of the model is a tree. If this method is applied to general topologies, termed loopy belief propagation (LBP), results are sometimes strikingly good (McEliece et al., 1998; Murphy et al., 1999), though in general it may not converge at all, and if it does, it may not be to a global optimum.\n(Yedidia et al., 2001) showed a remarkable connection between LBP and an earlier approach from statistical physics (Bethe, 1935; Peierls & Born, 1936), in that any fixed point of LBP corresponds to a stationary point of a function of the system, termed the Bethe free energy F . In fact, LBP can be seen as an iteration of the fixed point equations of the Bethe free energy. Variational approaches led to a better understanding of this relationship, showing that the negative of the global minimum of the Bethe free energy is the log of the Bethe partition function ZB. Thus, ZB should yield a good approximation to the true partition function Z , though this is not a formal result - there are cases where\n2 it performs poorly, typically when there are many short cycles with strong edge interactions (Wainwright & Jordan, 2008, § 4.1). Even then, however, it can still be remarkably effective and in practice, LBP is widely used, often with excellent results. One motivation for our algorithm is to allow exploration of the limits for when ZB performs well, even when LBP or other local optimization approaches fail, which has not previously been possible. We demonstrate this application in Experiments §6. Another interesting example is the demonstration (Chandrasekaran et al., 2011) that the Bethe approximation is very useful to count independent sets of a graph. Further, it was shown that if the shortest cycle cover conjecture of Alon and Tarsi (Alon & Tarsi, 1985) is true, then the Bethe approximation is very good indeed for a random 3-regular graph.\nExtensive analysis has focused on understanding conditions under which LBP is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum (Heskes, 2004; Mooij & Kappen, 2007; Watanabe, 2011), but outside these restricted settings, until recently, there were no polynomial time methods even to approximate ZB . One major area of study is the important subclass of models which are binary, i.e. each variable takes one of just two possible values, and pairwise, i.e. all score sub-functions are evaluated over at most two variables. These play a key role in areas such as computer vision, both directly and as critical subroutines in solving more complex problems (Pletscher & Kohli, 2012). Further, it is possible to convert a general MRF into an equivalent binary pairwise model (Yedidia et al., 2001), though potentially with a much enlarged state space.\nAn algorithm was introduced in (Shin, 2012) guaranteed to return an approximately stationary point of F in polynomial time for such binary pairwise models, though with a bound on the maximum degree, ∆ = O(log n). (Weller & Jebara, 2013a) then used a discretizing approach to derive a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for logZB for the significant subclass of attractive1 binary pairwise models, also with ∆ = O(log n). Interestingly, (Ruozzi, 2012) recently proved that ZB ≤ Z for attractive models. Similarly, for graphical models whose partition function is the permanent of a non-negative matrix, ZB is recoverable via convex optimization and, here too, ZB ≤ Z (Huang & Jebara, 2009; Vontobel, 2010; Watanabe & Chertkov, 2010; Gurvits, 2011). Otherwise, beyond trivial cases where the graph is acyclic, efficiently computing or approximating ZB remains an active research topic.\n1An attractive model has all pairwise relationships of the type that tend to pull adjacent variables toward the same value (see §2 for a more precise definition). Equivalent terms used are associative, regular or ferromagnetic."

      "text" : "We obtain important new results for binary pairwise MRFs as described in the Abstract. We adopt ideas from (Weller & Jebara, 2013a) but go significantly further to derive much stronger results. The overall approach is to construct a sufficient mesh of discretized points in such a way that the optimum mesh point q∗ is guaranteed to have F(q∗) within ǫ of the true optimum. The new, first derivative approach, generally results in a much coarser, yet still sufficient mesh, and also admits adaptive methods to focus points in regions where F may vary rapidly. Separately, we also refine the second derivative method of (Weller & Jebara, 2013a) to derive a method that performs well for very small ǫ. We then consider how best to solve the resulting discrete optimization problem, which may be framed as multi-label MAP inference, and for which many techniques are available, some of which are efficient for sub-classes of problem.2\nIn §2, we establish notation and present various preliminary results, then apply these in §3 to present our new approach for mesh construction based on analyzing first derivatives of F . This leads to much improved performance (often by orders of magnitude), immediately admits general (nonattractive) models, and in the attractive setting yields a FPTAS for models with no restriction on topology.\nIn §4 we revisit the second derivative approach of (Weller & Jebara, 2013a). We show how this method can be refined and extended to yield better performance and also to admit non-attractive models, though for most cases of interest, unless ǫ is very small, the method of §3 will be superior. In §5, we discuss the derived discrete optimization problem, which may be viewed as a multi-label MAP inference problem. In certain settings the problem is tractable, and in general we mention several features that can make it easier to find a satisfactory solution, or at least to bound its value. Experiments are described in §6 demonstrating practical application of the algorithm. Finally, we present conclusions in §7."

In earlier work, a fully polynomial-time randomized approximation scheme (FPRAS) for the true partition function was derived (Jerrum & Sinclair, 1993), but only when singleton potentials are uniform (i.e. a uniform external field) and the resulting runtime is high at O(ǫ−2m3n11 logn). It was recently shown (Heinemann & Globerson, 2011) that models exist such that the true marginal probability cannot possibly be the location of a minimum of the Bethe free energy.

      "text" : "Our notation is similar to (Weller & Jebara, 2013a) and (Welling & Teh, 2001). We focus on a binary pairwise model with n variables X1, . . . , Xn ∈ B = {0, 1} and graph topology (V , E) with m = |E|; that is V contains nodes {1, . . . , n} where i corresponds to Xi, and E ⊆ V × V contains an edge for each pairwise score relationship. Let N(i) be the neighbors of i. Let x = (x1, . . . , xn) be one particular configuration, and introduce the notion of energy E(x) through3\np(x) = e−E(x)\nZ , E = −\n∑ i∈V θixi − ∑ (i,j)∈E Wijxixj , (1)\nwhere the partition function Z = ∑ x e −E(x) is the normalizing constant.\nGiven any joint probability distribution p(X1, . . . , Xn) over all variables, the (Gibbs) free energy is defined as FG(p) = Ep(E) − S(p), where S(p) is the (Shannon)\n3The probability or score function can always be reparameterized in this way, with finite θi and Wij terms provided p(x) > 0 ∀x, which is a requirement for our approach. There are reasonable distributions where this does not hold, i.e. distributions where ∃x : p(x) = 0, but this can often be handled by assigning such configurations a sufficiently small positive probability ǫ.\nentropy of the distribution. Using variational methods, a remarkable result is easily shown (Wainwright & Jordan, 2008): minimizing FG over the set of all globally valid distributions (termed the marginal polytope) yields a value of − logZ , exactly at the true marginal distribution, given in (1).\nMinimizing FG is, however, computationally intractable, hence the approach of minimizing the Bethe free energy F makes two approximations: (i) the marginal polytope is relaxed to the local polytope, where we require only local consistency, that is we deal with a pseudo-marginal distribution q, which in our context may be considered {qi = q(Xi = 1) ∀i ∈ V , µij = q(xi, xj) ∀(i, j) ∈ E} subject to qi = ∑\nj µij ∀i ∈ V , j ∈ N(i); and (ii) the entropy S is approximated by the Bethe entropy SB = ∑\n(i,j)∈E Sij + ∑ i∈V(1 − di)Si, where Sij is the entropy of µij , Si is the entropy of the singleton distribution and di = |N(i)| is the degree of i. We assume the model is connected so di ≥ 1 ∀i (else each component may be analyzed independently), and take x log x = 0 for x = 0. Hence, the global optimum of the Bethe free energy,\nF(q) = Eq(E)− SB(q) (2) = ∑\n(i,j)∈E\n− ( Wijξij + Sij(qi, qj) )\n+ ∑\ni∈V\n( − θiqi + (zi − 1)Si(qi) ) ,\nis achieved by minimizing F over the local polytope, with ZB defined s.t. the result obtained equals − logZB. See (Wainwright & Jordan, 2008) for details.\nConsidering the local polytope, given qi and qj , we must have\nµij =\n(\n1 + ξij − qi − qj qj − ξij qi − ξij ξij\n)\n(3)\nfor some ξij ∈ [0,min(qi, qj)], where µij(a, b) = q(Xi = a,Xj = b). Let αij = eWij − 1. αij = 0 ⇔ Wij = 0 may be assumed not to occur else the edge (i, j) may be deleted. αij has the same sign as Wij , if positive then the edge (i, j) is attractive; if negative then the edge is repulsive. The MRF is attractive if all edges are attractive. As in (Welling & Teh, 2001), one can solve for ξij explicitly in terms of qi and qj by minimizing F , leading to a quadratic equation with real roots,\nαijξ 2 ij − [1 + αij(qi + qj)]ξij + (1 + αij)qiqj = 0. (4)\nFor αij > 0, ξij(qi, qj) is the lower root, for αij < 0 it is the higher. Collecting the pairwise terms of F from (2) for one edge, define\nfij(qi, qj) = −Wijξij(qi, qj)− Sij(qi, qj). (5)\nThus we may consider the minimization of F over q = (q1, . . . , qn) ∈ [0, 1]n.\n4 We are interested in discretized pseudo-marginals where for each qi, we restrict its possible values to a discrete mesh Mi of points in [0, 1], which may be spaced unevenly. We allow Mi 6= Mj . Write M for the entire mesh. Let Ni = |Mi| and define N = ∑ i∈V Ni and Π = ∏\ni∈V Ni, the sum and product respectively of the number of mesh points in each dimension. Let q̂ be the location of a global optimum of F . We say that a mesh construction M(ǫ) is sufficient if, given ǫ > 0, it can be guaranteed that ∃ a mesh point q∗ ∈ ∏\ni∈V Mi s.t. F(q∗)−F(q̂) ≤ ǫ. We shall make use of the standard sigmoid function, σ(x) = 1/(1 + exp(−x)) for various bounds."

This yields several attractive features:\n• For attractive models, we obtain a FPTAS with worst case runtime O(ǫ−3n3m3W 3) and no restriction on topology, as was required in (Weller & Jebara, 2013a).\n• Our sufficient mesh is typically dramatically coarser than the earlier method of (Weller & Jebara, 2013a), leading to a much simpler subsequent MAP problem unless ǫ is very small. Here, the sum of the number of discretizing points in each dimension, N = O (\nnmW ǫ\n)\n. For comparison, the earlier method, even after our improvements in §4, forms a mesh with N = O ( ǫ−1/2n7/4∆3/4 exp [\n1 2 (W (1 + ∆/2) + T )\n])\n. As an example, for the model in the experiments of §6, our new approach with the adaptive minsum method (see §3.1.2), yields a mesh with N that is 8 orders of magnitude smaller than the earlier method.\n• Our approach immediately handles a general model with both attractive and repulsive edges. Hence approximating logZB may be reduced to a discrete multilabel MAP inference problem. This is valuable due to the availability of many MAP techniques. We discuss this in §5, where we consider when the MAP problem is tractable and examine approaches which may be tried in general.\nFirst assume we have a model which is fully attractive around variable Xi, i.e. Wij > 0 ∀j ∈ N(i). From (8) and Lemma 3, we obtain\n∂F ∂qi = −θi + logQi ≤ −θi + log qi 1− qi . (10)\n6 Flip all variables (see §2.3.1). Write ′ for the parameters of the new flipped model, which is also fully attractive, then using (6) and (10),\n∂F ′ ∂q′i ≤ −θ′i + log q′i\n1− q′i ⇔ −θi −Wi + log\nqi 1− qi ≤ ∂F ∂qi .\nCombining this with (10) yields the sandwich result\n−θi −Wi + log qi 1− qi ≤ ∂F ∂qi ≤ −θi + log qi 1− qi .\nNow generalize to consider the case that i has some neighbors R to which it is adjacent by repulsive edges. In this case, flip those nodes R (see §2.3.2) to yield a model, which we denote by ′′, which is fully attractive around i, hence we may apply the above result. By (7) we have θ′′i = θi −Vi, and using W ′′i = Wi +Vi, we obtain that for a general model,\n−θi −Wi + log qi 1− qi ≤ ∂F ∂qi ≤ −θi + Vi + log qi 1− qi .\n(11)\nThis bounds each first derivative ∂F∂qi within a range of width Vi + Wi = ∑\nj∈N(i) |Wij |, which will be sufficient for the main theoretical result to come in (15). We take the opportunity, however, to narrow this range, thereby improving the result in practice, by using just one step of the belief propagation algorithm (BBP) of (Weller & Jebara, 2013a).\nFollowing the derivation of BBP in the Supplement of (Weller & Jebara, 2013a), where better bounds are derived on the qi location of stationary points by taking account of [Aj , 1−Bj ] bounds on neighbors j ∈ N(i), we may refine the result of (11) to yield\nfLi (qi) ≤ ∂F ∂qi ≤ fUi (qi), where\nfLi (qi) = −θi −Wi + logUi + log qi 1− qi fUi (qi) = −θi + Vi − logLi + log\nqi 1− qi .

We make the following observations:\n• The upper bound is equal to the lower bound plus the constant Di = Vi +Wi − logLi − logUi ≥ 0.\n• The bound curves are monotonically increasing with qi, ranging from −∞ to +∞ as qi ranges from 0 to 1.\n• A necessary condition to be within the Bethe box is that the upper bound is ≥ 0 and the lower bound is ≤ 0.

Using the BoykovKolmogorov algorithm (Boykov & Kolmogorov, 2004), performance is typically much faster, sometimes approaching O(N). This submodular setting is the only known class of problem which is solvable for any topology.\nAlternatively, the topological restriction of bounded treewidth allows tractable inference (Pearl, 1988). Further, under mild assumptions, this was shown to be the only restriction which will allow efficient inference for any cost functions (Chandrasekaran et al., 2008). We note that if the problem has bounded tree-width, then so too does the original binary pairwise model, hence exact inference (to yield the true marginals or the true partition function Z) on the original model is tractable, making our approximation result less interesting for this class. In contrast, although MAP inference is tractable for any attractive binary pairwise model, marginal inference and computing Z are not (Jerrum & Sinclair, 1993).\nA recent approach reducing MAP inference to identifying a maximum weight stable set in a derived weighted graph ((Jebara, 2013), (Weller & Jebara, 2013b)) shows promise, allowing efficient inference if the derived graph is perfect.

Since the real data is sensitive, our experiments use synthetic data. Let Xi ∈ {0, 1} indicate if transformer i has failed or not. Each transformer has a probability of failure on its own which is represented by a singleton potential θi. However, when connected in a network, a transformer can propagate its failure to nearby nodes (as in viral contagion) since the edges in the network form associative dependencies. We assume that homogeneous attractive pairwise potentials couple all transformers that are connected by an edge, i.e. Wij = W ∀(i, j) ∈ E . The network topology creates a Markov random field specifying the distribution p(X1, . . . , Xn). Our goal is to compute the marginal probability of failure of each transformer within the network (not simply in isolation as in (Rudin et al., 2012)). Since recovering p(Xi) is hard, we estimate Bethe pseudo-marginals qi = q(Xi = 1) through our algorithm, which emerge as the argmin when optimizing the Bethe free energy.\nA simulated sub-network of 55 connected transformers with average degree 2 was generated using a random preferential attachment model. Typical settings of θi = −2 and W = 4 were specified (using the input model specification of §2.1). We attempted to run BP using the libDAI package (Mooij, 2010) but were unable to achieve convergence, even with multiple initial values, using various sequential or parallel settings and with damping. However, running our algorithm with ǫ = 1 achieved reasonable results as shown in Table 1, where true values were obtained with the junction tree algorithm.\nGeneral folklore has suggested that the Bethe approximation is poor when BP fails to converge, thus this initial result suggests further work, which is now feasible using our algorithm."

However, it may converge only to a local optimum or may not converge at all. An algorithm was recently introduced for attractive binary pairwise MRFs which is guaranteed to return an ǫ-approximation to the global minimum of F in polynomial time provided the maximum degree ∆ = O(log n), where n is the number of variables. Here we significantly improve this algorithm and derive several results including a new approach based on analyzing first derivatives of F , which leads to performance that is typically far superior and yields a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for attractive models without any degree restriction. Further, the method applies to general (non-attractive) models, though with no polynomial time guarantee in this case, leading to the important result that approximating log of the Bethe partition function, logZB = −minF , for a general model to additive ǫaccuracy may be reduced to a discrete MAP inference problem. We explore an application to predicting equipment failure on an urban power network and demonstrate that the Bethe approximation can perform well even when BP fails to converge.",
