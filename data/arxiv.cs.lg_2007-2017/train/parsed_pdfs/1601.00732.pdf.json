      "text" : "In machine learning it is common to interpret each data point as a vector in Euclidean space [3]. Such a discretisation is chosen because it allows for easy closed form solutions and fast computation, even with large datasets. However these methods ignore the fact that the data may not naturally fit into this assumption. In fact much of the data collected for practical machine learning are actually functions i.e. curves. For example financial data such as stock or commodity prices are functions of monetary value over time. Functional data have become increasingly important in many scientific and engineering research areas such as ECG (electrocardiogram) or EEG (Electroencephalography) in healthcare, biology data analysis, weather or climate data and motion trajectories from computer vision.\nAnalyzing functional data has been an emerging topic in statistical research [7, 13, 20, 21] and has attracted great attention from machine learning community in recent years [2, 15]. One of important challenges in analyzing functional data for machine learning is to efficiently cluster and\nto learn better representations for functional data. Theoretically the underlying process for functional data is of infinite dimension, thus it is difficult to work with them with only finite samples available. A desired model for functional data is expected to properly and parsimoniously characterize the nature and variability hidden in the data. The classic functional principal component analysis (fPCA) [17] is one of such examples to discover dominant modes of variation in the data. However fPCA may fail to capture patterns if the functional data are not well aligned in its domain. For time series, a special type of functional data, dynamic time warping (DTW) has long been proposed to compare time series based on shape and distortions (e.g., shifting and stretching) along the temporal axis [16, 24].\nAnother important type of functional data is shape [23, 20]. Shape is an important characterizing feature for objects and in computer vision shape has been widely used for the purpose of object detection, tracking, classification, and recognition. In fact, a natural and popular representation for shape analysis is to parametrize boundaries of planar objects as 2D curves. In object recognition, images of the same object should be similar regardless of resolution, lighting, or orientation. Hence an efficient shape representation or shape analysis scheme must be invariant to scale, translation and rotation. A very useful shape representation is the square-root velocity function (SRVF) representation [9, 20]. In general, the resulting SRVF of a continuous shape is square integrable, a well-defined Hilbert space where appropriate measurement can be applied, refer to Section 2 for more details. By acknowledging the true nature of the data we can develop more powerful methods that exploit features that would otherwise be ignored or lead to erroneous results with simple linear models.\nOur intention in this study is to consider functional data clustering by accounting for the possible invariance in scaling/stretching, translation and rotation of functional data to help maintain shape characteristics. The focus of this paper is upon functional data where data sets consist of continu-\n1\nar X\niv :1\n60 1.\n00 73\n2v 2\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 6\nJ an\n2 01\nous real curves including shapes in Euclidean spaces. More specifically we propose a method of subspace analysis for functional data based on the idea developed in recent subspace clustering. The idea is to apply a feature mapping such as the aforementioned SRVF to the curves so that they are transformed onto the curve manifold, where the subspace analysis can be conducted based on the geometry on the manifold. In particular, we adapt the well known lowrank representation (LRR) framework [12] to deal with data that lie on the manifold of open curves by implementing the classical LRR in tangent spaces of the manifold [8, 25, 29].\nLRR on Euclidean spaces [12] is closely related to several state-of-the-art subspace analysis approaches such as Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) [6], Robust PCA (RPCA) [5] and low-rank Matrix Completion (MC) [28] methods. This mixture of subspaces model has naturally led to the development of subspace segmentation methods. Such methods aim to segment the data into clusters with each cluster corresponding to a unique subspace. More formally, given a data matrix of observed column-wise data samples A = [a1,a2, . . . ,aN] ∈ RD×N , the objective of subspace clustering is to assign each data sample to its underlying subspace. The basic assumption is that the data within A is drawn from a union of c subspaces {Si}ci=1 of dimensions {di}ci=1.\nThe core of both SSC and LRR is to learn an affinity matrix for the given dataset and the learned affinity matrix will be pipelined to a spectral clustering method like nCUT [19] to obtain the final subspace labels. To learn the affinity matrix, SSC relies on the self expressive property [6], which is that\neach data point in a union of subspaces can be efficiently reconstructed by a linear combination of other points in the data.\nIn other words, each point can be written as a linear combination of the other points i.e. A = AZ, where Z ∈ RN×N is a matrix of coefficients. Most methods however assume the data generation model X = A + N, where X is the observed data and N is noise. Since it is difficult to separate the noise from the data the solution is to relax the selfexpressive model to X = XZ + E, where E is a fitting error and is different from N.\nSimilarly LRR [12] exploits the self expressive property but attempts to learn the global subspace structure by computing the lowest-rank representation of the set of data points. In other words, data points belonging to the same subspace should have similar coefficient patterns. In the presence of noise LRR attempts to minimise the following objective\nmin Z,E\n1 2 ‖E‖` + rank(Z), s.t. X = XZ + E. (1)\nHowever rank minimisation is an intractable problem. Therefore LRR actually uses the nuclear norm ‖·‖∗ (sum of the matrix’s singular values) as the closest convex relation\nmin Z,E\n1 2 ‖E‖` + ‖Z‖∗, s.t. X = XZ + E, (2)\nwhere ‖ · ‖` is a placeholder for the norm most appropriate to the expected noise type. For example in the case of Gaussian noise the best choice is the `2 norm i.e. ‖ · ‖2F and for sparse noise the `1 norm should be used.\nBoth SSC and LRR rely on the linear self expressive property. This property is no longer available in the nonlinear manifold, e.g. the manifold of open curves as mentioned previously. To generalize LRR or SSC for data in the manifold space, we explicitly explore the underlying nonlinear data structure and utilize the techniques of exponential and logarithm mappings to bring data to a local linear space.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the preliminaries about the manifold of open curves and introduce the curve Low-Rank Representation (cLRR) model. Section 3 is dedicated to explaining an efficient algorithm for solving the optimization proposed in cLRR based on the linearized alternative direction method with adaptive penalty (LADMAP) and the algorithm convergence and complexity are also analyzed. In Section 4, the proposed model is assessed on both synthetic and real world databases against several state-of-the-art methods. Finally, conclusions are discussed in Section 5."

      "text" : "As previously discussed LRR is limited to a linear model and its current version can only be applied to vector data from a Euclidean space. Matrix Z in (1) or (2) encodes the affinity/similarity between data points. However this assumption is often unnatural and quite limiting. Much of the data encountered in real world is functional. In other words it exhibits a curve like structure over a domain. Euclidean linear models are unable to capture the nonlinear invariance embedded in each data point. For example in thermal infra-red data of geological substances a curve may contain a key identifying feature such as a dip near a particular frequency. This dip may shift or vary position over time even for the same substance due to impurities. Under a linear vector model this variation may cause the vector to drastically move in the ambient Euclidean space and cause poor results. Or in other cases the feature may be elongated, shrunk or be subject to some non-uniformly warping or scaling. In all these cases the linear model will fail to accurately represent the non-linear affinity in the data.\nExploring these unique non-linear invariance in functional data is the focus of this paper. We now discuss how to adapt LRR (similar approach appliable to SSC) such that it\neasily accepts curve data and nonlinear relationships within clusters can be easily discovered."

      "text" : "Given a smooth parameterized n-dimension curve β : D = [0, 1] → Rn, we represent it using he square-root velocity function (SRVF) representation [9, 20], which is given by\nq(t) = β̇(t)√ ‖β̇(t)‖ .\nThe SRVF mapping transforms the original curve β(t) into a gradient based representation, which facilitates the comparing of the shape information.\nIn this paper, we focus on the set of open curves, e.g. the curves do not form a loop (β(0) 6= β(1)). For handling general curves, we refer readers to [20]. The SRVF facilitates a measure and geometry bearing invariance to scaling, shifting and reparameterization in the curves domain. For example, all the translated curves from a curve β(t) will have the same SRVF. Robinson [18] proved that if the curve β(t) is absolutely continuous, then its SRVF q(t) is square-integrable, i.e., q(t) is in a functional Hilbert space L2(D,Rn) . Conversely for each q(t) ∈ L2(D,Rn), there exists a curve β(t) whose SRVF corresponds to q(t). Thus the set L2(D,Rn) is a well-defined representation space of all the curves. The most important advantage offered by the SRVF framework is that the natural and widely used L2-measure on L2(D,Rn) is invariant to the reparameterization. That is, for any two SRVFs q1 and q2 and a randomly chosen reparametrization function (non-decreasing) t = γ(τ), we have\n‖q1(t)− q2(t)‖L2 = ‖q1(γ(τ))− q2(γ(τ))‖L2 .\nThis property has been exploited in [2] for functional data clustering under the subspace clustering framework. Different from the work proposed in [2], we will adopt the newly developed LRR on manifolds framework to the model of curves LRR, see [8, 25, 29]. To see this, we introduce some more notation. Let Γ be the set of all diffeomorphisms from D = [0, 1] to D = [0, 1]. This set collects all the reparametrization mappings. Γ is a Lie group with the composition as the group operation and the identity mapping as the identity element. Then all the orbits [q] = {q ◦ γ = q(γ(t)) | ∀γ ∈ Γ} together define the quotient manifold L2(D,Rn)/Γ.\nWithout loss of generality, all curves are normalized to have unit length, i.e., ∫ D ‖β̇(t)‖dt = 1. The SRVFs associated with these curves are elements of a unit hypersphere in the Hilbert space L2(D,Rn), i.e., ∫ D ‖q(t)‖2dt = 1. Therefore, under the curve normalization assumption, in-\nstead of L2(D,Rn), we consider the following unit hypersphere manifold\nCo = { q ∈ L2(D,Rn) : ∫ D ‖q(t)‖2dt = 1 } .\nThe manifold Co has some nice properties, see [1]. For any two points q0 and q1 in Co, a geodesic connecting them is given by α : [0, 1]→ Co,\nα(τ) = 1\nsin(θ) (sin(θ(1− τ))q0 + sin(θτ)q1), (3)\nwhere θ = cos−1(〈q0, q1〉) is the length of the geodesic. If we take derivative of α w.r.t to q1, the tangent vector at q0 is\nv = θ\nsin(θ) [q1 − 〈q0, q1〉q0]. (4)\nThe above formula is regarded as the Logarithm mapping logq0(q1) on the manifold C\no. As we are concerned with the shape invariance, i.e., we need to additionally remove the shape-preserving transformations: rotation and curve reparametrization. The manifold concerning us is the quotient space of the manifold So = Co/(SO(n)×Γ), where SO(n) is the rotation group. Each element [q] ∈ So is an equivalent class defined by\n[q] = { Oq(γ(t)) √ γ̇(t) | O ∈ SO(n) and γ ∈ Γ } .\nGiven any two points [q0] and [q1] in So, a tangent representative [1] in the tangent space T[q0](So) can be calculated in the following way, as suggested in [31, 22] based on (4),\nṽ = logq0(q̃1) = θ̃\nsin(θ̃) [q̃1 − 〈q0, q̃1〉q0]. (5)\nwhere q̃1 is the representative of [q1] given by the welldefined algorithm in [31, 22] and θ̃ = cos−1(〈q0, q̃1〉). In fact, ṽ is the lifting representation of abstract tangent vector log[q0]([q1]) on T[q0](S o) at q1."

      "text" : "Given a set of N unit-length curves {β1(t), ..., βN (t)}, denote their SRVFs by {q1(t), ..., qN (t)} such that [qi] ∈ So and qi(t) is a representative of the equivalent class [qi]. We cannot apply the standard LRR model (2) directly on the quotient manifold So. This is because (2) indeed relies on the following individual linear combination\nxi = N∑ j=1 zijxj + ei, (6)\nwhich is invalid for [qi]’s on So. Note that zij can be explained as the affinity or similarity between data points xi and xj .\nOn any manifold, the tangent space at a given point is linearly local approximation to the manifold around the point and the linear combination is valid in the tangent space. This prompts us to replace the affinity relation in (6) by the following\nlog[qi]([qi]) = N∑ j=1 wij log[qi]([qj ]) + ei (7)\nwith the constraint ∑N j=1 wij = 1, i = 1, 2, . . . , N to maintain consistency at different locations. The meaning of wij in (7) is the similarity between curves βi(t) and βj(t) via the “affinity” between tangent vectors log[qi]([qi]) and log[qi]([qj ]) at the first order approximation accuracy. Each log[qi]([qj ]) can be calculated by (5) and it is obvious that log[qi]([qi]) = 0 for any i.\nWith all the ingredients at hand, we are fully equipped to propose the curve LRR (cLRR) model as follows\nmin W λ‖W‖∗ + N∑ i=1 1 2 ‖ N∑ j=1 wij log[qi]([qj ])‖ 2 [qi] ,\ns.t. N∑ j=1 wij = 1, i = 1, 2, . . . , N.\n(8)\nwhere ‖ · ‖[q] is the metric defined on the manifold, which is defined by the classic L2 Hilbert metric on the tangent space.\nDenote wi the i-th row of matrix W and define\nBijk = 〈log[qi]([qj ]), log[qi]([qk])〉. (9)\nThen with some algebraic manipulation we can re-write the model (8) into the following simplified form,\nmin W λ‖W‖∗ + N∑ i=1 wiB iwTi ,\ns.t. N∑ j=1 wij = 1, i = 1, 2, . . . , N.\n(10)\nwhere Bi = (Bijk). Effectively this objective allows for similarity between curves to be measured in their tangent spaces. Our highly accurate segmentation results in Section 4 have demonstrated that this is an effective way to learn non-linear similarity."

In terms of the formula (9) through (4) and (5), the computational complexity of Log algorithm is O(T 2) where T is the number of terms in a discretized curves; therefore, the complexity of Bijk is at most O(T 2) and Bi’s computational complexity is O(N2T 2).

In this test three clusters were created consisting of twenty 1-D curves of length 100. The curves in each cluster were sine waves, with each cluster corresponding to a unique frequency. Within each cluster progressive amounts of warping were applied. See Figure 1 for\nan example of data from three syntheticly generated clusters. Clustering was then performed on the data by applying curve LRR and segmenting the affinity matrix with nCUT.

These\n2-D trajectory curves are normalised such that the mean of each curve is close to zero. See Figure 5 for some examples of this data. Figure 6 shows the example plots of curves used in the character classification experiment.\nTo evaluate performance twenty characters were randomly selected from three character classes. The data as originally released has been carefully produced and processed so that trajectories for each characters are extremely similar. Far more so than is realistic. For example the start time for each character has been aligned furthermore the writing speed, character size and variance in velocity over time is extremely consistent. Therefore to make the data more realistic we randomly globally shift each character so that their start times vary. Furthermore we randomly glob-\nally stretch and shrink each trajectory to account for different writing speeds, we also scale the trajectories by applying constant factors to account for character size and we lastly perform local warping (as done in the semi-synthetic experiment) to account for variance in speed over time.\nSince the data consists of multidimensional curves the X and Y trajectory curves were concatenated to form data usable for conventional LRR since it can only handle vectors.

However the data may actually be functional i.e. each data point is a function of some variable such as time and the function is discretely sampled. The naive treatment of functional data as traditional multivariate data can lead to poor performance since the algorithms are ignoring the correlation in the curvature of each function. In this paper we propose a method to analyse subspace structure of the functional data by using the state of the art Low-Rank Representation (LRR). Experimental evaluation on synthetic and real data reveals that this method massively outperforms conventional LRR in tasks concerning functional data.",
