      "text" : "Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) have proved to be a versatile tool for a wide variety of machine learning tasks and as a building block for deep architectures [12, 24, 28]. The original proposals mainly handle binary visible and hidden units. Whilst binary hidden units are broadly applicable as feature detectors, non-binary visible data requires different designs. Recent extensions to other data types result in type-dependent models: the Gaussian for continuous inputs [12], Beta for bounded continuous inputs [16], Poisson for count data [9], multinomial for unordered categories [25], and ordinal models for ordered categories [37, 35].\nThe Boltzmann distribution permits several types to be jointly modelled, thus making the RBM a good tool for multimodal and complex social survey analysis. The work of [20, 29, 40] combines continuous (e.g., visual and audio) and discrete modalities (e.g., words). The work of [34] extends the idea further to incorporate ordinal and rank data. However, there are conceptual drawbacks: First, conditioned on the hidden layer, they are still separate type-specific models; second, handling ordered categories and ranks is not natural; and third, specifying direct correlation between these types remains difficult.\nThe main thesis of this paper is that many data types can be captured in one unified model. The key observations are that (i) type-specific properties can be modelled using\nar X\niv :1\n40 8.\n00 55\nv1 [\nst at\n.M L\n] 1\nA ug\none or several underlying continuous variables, in the spirit of Thurstonian models1 [31], and (ii) evidences be expressed in the form of one or several inequalities of these underlying variables. For example, a binary visible unit is turned on if the underlying variable is beyond a threshold; and a category is chosen if its utility is the largest among all those of competing categories. The use of underlying variables is desirable when we want to explicitly model the generative mechanism of the data. In psychology and economics, for example, it gives much better interpretation on why a particular choice is made given the perceived utilities [2]. Further, it is natural to model the correlation among type-specific inputs using a covariance structure on the underlying variables.\nThe inequality observation is interesting in its own right: Instead of learning from assigned values, we learn from the inequality expression of evidences, which can be much more relaxed than the value assignments. This class of evidences indeed covers a wide range of practical situations, many of which have not been studied in the context of Boltzmann machines, as we shall see throughout the paper.\nTo this end, we propose a novel class of models called Thurstonian Boltzmann Machine (TBM). The TBM utilises the Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machine (GRBM): The top layer consists of binary hidden units as in standard RBMs; the bottom layer contains a collection of Gaussian variable groups, one per input type. The main difference is that TBM does not require valued assignments for the bottom layer but a set of inequalities expressing the constraints imposed by the evidences. Except for a limiting case of point assignments where the inequalities are strictly equalities, the Gaussian layer is never fully observed. The TBM supports more data types in a unified manner than ever before: For any combination of the point assignments, intervals, censored values, binary, unordered categories, multi-categories, ordered categories, (in)-complete ranks with and without ties, all we need to do is to supply relevant subset of inequalities.\nWe evaluate the proposed model on three applications of very different natures: handwritten digit recognitions, collaborative filtering and complex survey analysis. For the first two applications, the performance is competitive against methods designed for those data types. On the last application, we believe we are among the first to propose a scalable and generic machinery for handle those complex data types."

      "text" : "Categorical observations. This refers to the situation where out of an unordered set of categories, we observe only one category at a time. This can be formulated as follows. Each category is associated with a “utility” variable. The category l is observed (i.e., ei = m) if it has the largest utility, that is xil ≥ maxm 6=l xim. Thus, xil is the upperthreshold for all other utilities. On the other hand, maxm 6=l xim is the lower-threshold for xil. This suggests an EM-style procedure: (i) fix xil (or treat it as a threshold) and learn the model under the intervals xim ≤ xil for all m 6= l, and (ii) fix all categories other than l, learn the model under the interval xil ≥ maxm6=l xim. This offers an alternative4 to the multinomial logit treatment in [26].\nTo illustrate the point, suppose there are only four variables z1, z2, z3, z4, and z1 is observed, then we have z1 ≥ max {z2, z3, z4}. This can be expressed as z1 − z2 ≥ 0; z1 − z3 ≥ 0 and z1 − z4 ≥ 0. These are equivalent to〈\nA =  1 −1 0 01 0 −1 0 1 0 0 −1  ; b = 0; c = +∞〉\nImprecise categorical observations.

For instance, suppose the subset is {z1, z2}, then min {z1, z2} ≥ max{z3, z4}, which can be expressed as z1 − z3 ≥ 0; z2 − z3 ≥ 0, z1 − z4 ≥ 0 and z2 − z4 ≥ 0. This translates to the following triple\n〈 A =  1 0 −1 0 1 0 0 −1 0 1 −1 0 0 1 0 −1  ; b = 0; c = +∞ 〉\nRank (with Ties) observations. This generalises the imprecise categorical cases: Here we have a (partially) ranked set of categories. Assume that the rank is produced in a stagewise manner as follows: The best category subset is selected out of all categories, the second best is selected out of all categories except for the best one, and so on. Thus, at each stage we have an imprecise categorical setting, but now the utilities of middle categories are constrained from both sides – the previous utilities as the upper-bound, and the next utilities as the lower-bound.\nAs an illustration, suppose there are four variables z1, z2, z3, z4 and a particular rank (with ties) imposes that min {z1, z2} ≥ z3 ≥ z4.

This chain will be discarded after each parameter update. This is particular useful when the models are instance-specific, e.g., in collaborative filtering, it is much cheaper to build one model per user, all share the same parameters.

      "heading" : "6 Applications",
      "text" : "In this section, we describe applications of the TBM for three realistic domains, namely handwritten digit recognition, collaborative filtering and worldwide survey analysis. Before going to the details, let us first address key implementation issues (see Supplement for more details).\nOne observed difficulty in training the TBM is that the hidden samples can get stuck in one of the two ends and thus learning cannot progress. The reasons might be the large mapping parameters or the unbounded nature of the underlying Gaussian variables, which can saturate the hidden units. We can control the norm of the mapping parameters, either by using the standard `2-norm regularisation, or by rescaling the norm of the parameter vector for each hidden unit. To deal with the non-boundedness of the Gaussian variables, then we can restrict their range, making the model bounded.\nAnother effective solution is to impose a constraint on the posteriors by adding the\nregularising term to the log-likelihood, e.g.,\nλ {∑ k [ ρ logP (h1k | e) + (1− ρ) log ( 1− P (h1k | e) )]}\nwhere ρ ∈ (0, 1) is the expected probability that a hidden unit will turn on given the evidence and λ > 0 is the regularisation weight. Maximising this quantity is essentially minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the expected posteriors and the true posteriors. In our experiments, we found ρ ∈ (0.1, 0.3) and λ ∈ (0.1, 1) gave satisfying results.\nThe main technical issue is that P (h1k | e) does not have a simple form due to the integration over all the constrained Gaussian variables. Approximation is thus needed. The use of mean-field methods will lead to the simple sigmoid form, but it is only applicable for boxed constraints since it breaks down deterministic constraints among variables (Section 4.3). However, we can estimate the “mean” truncated Gaussian µ̂i by averaging the recent samples of the Gaussian variables in the data-dependent phase.\nOnce these safeguards are in place, learning can greatly benefit from quite large learning rate and small batches as it appears to quickly get the samples out off the local energy traps by significantly distorting the energy landscape. Depending on the problem sizes, we vary the batch sizes in the range [100, 1000]."

The threshold θi for each visible unit i is chosen so that under the zero mean, the probability of generating a binary evidence equals the empirical probability, i.e., 1−Φ(θi) = ēi, and thus θi = Φ−1(1− ēi). Since any mismatch in thresholds can be corrected by shifting the corresponding biases, we do not need to update the thresholds further.\nWe report here the result of the mean-field method for computing data-dependent statistics, which are averaged over a random batch of 500 images. For the data-independent statistics, 500 persistent chains are run in parallel with samples collected after every 5 Gibbs steps. The sparsity level ρ is set to 0.3 and the sparseness weight λ is set to 0.5. Once the model has been learned, mean-field is used to estimate the hidden posteriors. Typically this mean-field is quite fast as it converges in a few steps.\nWe take the data from MNIST and binarize the images using a mid-intensity threshold. The learned representation is shown in Figure 2. Most digits are well separated in 2D except for digits 4 and 9. The learned representation can be used for classifications, e.g., by feeding to the multiclass logistic classifier. For 500 hidden units, the Probit RBM achieves the error rate of 3.28%, comparable with those obtained by the RBM trained with CD-1 (3.02%), and much better than the raw pixels (8.46%). The features discovered by the Probit RBM and RBM with CD-1 are very different (Figure 1), and this is expected because they operate on different input representations.

Until very recently, the majority in the area, on the other hand, focused on predicting the ratings, which are then used for ranking items. It can be arguably more efficient to learn a rank model directly instead of going through the intermediate steps.\nWe build one TBM for ranking with ties (i.e., inequality constraints, see Section 3.2) per user due to the variation in item choices but all the TBMs share the same parameter set. The handling of ties is necessary because during training, many items share the same rating. Unseen items are simply not accounted for in each model: We only need to compare the utilities between the items seen by each person. The result is that the models are very sparse and fast to run. For the data-dependent statistics, we maintain one Markov chain per user. Since there is no single model for all data instances, the dataindependent statistics cannot be estimated from a small set of Markov chains. Rather we also maintain a data-independent chain per data instance, which can be persistent on their own, or restarted from the data-dependent chains after every parameter updating step. The latter case, which is reported here, is in the spirit of the Hinton’s Contrastive Divergence, where the data-independent chain is just a few steps away from the datadependent chain.\nOnce the model has been trained, the hidden posterior vector ĥ = ( ĥ1, ĥ2, ..., ĥK ) ,\nwhere ĥk = P (hk = 1 | eu), is used as the new representation of the tastes of user u. The rank of unseen movies is the mode of the distribution P (e∗ | ĥ), where e∗ are the rankbased evidences (see Section 4.4). For fast computation of P (e∗ | ĥ), we approximate the Gaussian by a Gumbel distribution, which leads to a simple way of ranking movies using the mean “utility” µui = αi +Wi•ĥu for user u (see the Supplement for more details).\nThe data used in this experiment is the MovieLens, which contains 1M ratings by approximately 6K users on 4K movies. To encourage diversity in the rank lists, we remove the top 10% most popular movies. We then remove users with less than 30 ratings on the\nremaining movies. The most recently rated 10 movies per user are held out for testing, the next most recent 5 movies are used for tuning hyper-parameters, and the rest for training.\nFor comparison, we implement a simple baseline using item popularity for ranking, and thus offering a naive non-personalized solution. For personalized alternatives, we implement two recent rank-based matrix factorisation methods, namely ListRank.MF [27] and PMOP [36]. Two ranking metrics from the information retrieval literature are used: the ERR [3] and the NDCG@T [13]. These metrics place more emphasis on the top-ranked items. Table 1 reports the movie ranking results on test subset (each user is presented with a ranked list of unseen movies), demonstrating that the TBM is a clear winner in all metrics."

The data is from the survey analysis domain, which mostly consists of multiple questions of different natures such as basic facts (e.g., ages and genders) and opinions (e.g., binary choices, single choices, multiple choices, ordinal judgments, preferences and ranks). The standard approach to deal with such heterogeneity is to perform the so-called “coding”, which converts types into some numerical representations (e.g., ordinal scales into stars, ranks into multiple pairwise comparisons) so that standard processing tools can handle. However, this coding process breaks the structure in the data and thus significant information will be lost. Thus our TBM offers a scalable and generic machinery to process the data in its native format and then convert the mixed types into a more homogeneous posterior vector.\nWe use the global attitude survey dataset collected by the PewResearch Centre7. The survey was conducted on 24, 717 people from 24 countries during the period of March 17 – April 21, 2008 on a variety of topics concerning people’s life, opinions on issues in their countries and around the world as well as future expectations.

Learning with the underlying Gaussian model is notoriously difficult for large-scale setting: independent sampling costs cubic time due to the need of inverting the covariance matrix, while MCMC techniques such as Gibbs sampling can be very slow if the graph is dense and the interactions between variables are strong. This can be partly overcome by adding one more layer of latent variables as in factor analysis [39, 14] and probabilistic principle component analysis [33]. The main difference from our TBM is that those models are directed with continuous factors while ours is undirected with binary factors.\nGaussian RBMs have been used for modelling continuous data such as visual features [12], where the evidences are the value assignments, and thus a limiting case of our evidence system. Some restrictions to the continuous Boltzmann machines have been studied: In [5], Gaussian variables are assumed to be non-negative, and in [41], continuous variables are bounded. However, we do not make these restrictions on the model but rather placing restrictions during the training phase only. GRBMs that handle ordinal evidences have been studied in [35], which is an instance of the boxed-constraints in our TBM."

      "text" : "Since the underlying variables of the TBM are Gaussian, various extensions can be made without much difficulty. For example, direct correlations among variables, regardless of their types, can be readily modelled by introducing the non-identity covariance matrix [22]. This is clearly a good choice for image modelling since nearby pixels are strongly correlated. Another situation is when the input units are associated with their own attributes. Each unit can be extended naturally by adding a linear combination of attributes to the mean structure of the Gaussian.\nThe additive nature of the mean-structure allows the natural extension to matrix modelling (e.g., see [37, 35]). That is, we do not distinguish the role of rows and columns, and thus each row and column can be modelled using their own hidden units (the row parameters and columns parameters are different). Conditioned on the row-based hidden units, we return to the standard TBM for column vectors. Inversely, conditioned on the column-based hidden units, we have the TBM for row vectors.\nTo sum up, we have proposed a generic class of models called Thurstonian Boltzmann machine (TBM) to unify many type-specific modelling problems and generalise them\n8This is often known as multivariate probit models.\nto the general problem of learning from multiple groups of inequalities. Our framework utilises the Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machines, but the Gaussian variables are never observed except for one limiting case. Rather, those variables are subject to inequality constraints whenever an evidence is observed. Under this representation, the TBM supports a very wide range of evidences, many of which were not possible before in the Boltzmann machine literature, without the need to specify type-specific models. In particular, the TBM supports any combination of the point assignments, intervals, censored values, binary, unordered categories, multi-categories, ordered categories, (in)-complete ranks with and without ties.\nWe demonstrated the TBM on three applications of very different natures, namely handwritten digit recognition, collaborative filtering and complex survey analysis. The results are satisfying and the performance is competitive with those obtained by typespecific models."

Our motivation rests in the Thurstonian view that many discrete data types can be considered as being generated from a subset of underlying latent continuous variables, and in the observation that each realisation of a discrete type imposes certain inequalities on those variables. Thus learning and inference in TBM reduce to making sense of a set of inequalities. Our proposed TBM naturally supports the following types: Gaussian, intervals, censored, binary, categorical, muticategorical, ordinal, (in)-complete rank with and without ties. We demonstrate the versatility and capacity of the proposed model on three applications of very different natures; namely handwritten digit recognition, collaborative filtering and complex social survey analysis.",
