First, we recover theMirror Prox algorithm for offline optimization, prove an extension to Hölder-smooth functions, and apply the results to saddle-point type problems. Next, we prove that a version of Optimistic Mirror Descent (which has a close relation to the Exponential Weights algorithm) can be used by two strongly-uncoupled players in a finite zero-summatrix game to converge to the minimax equilibrium at the rate ofO((logT )/T ). This addresses a question of Daskalakis et al [6]. Further, we consider a partial information version of the problem. We then apply the results to convex programming and exhibit a simple algorithm for the approximateMax Flow problem.\n1 Introduction\nRecently, no-regret algorithms have received increasing attention in a variety of communities, including theoretical computer science, optimization, and game theory [3, 1]. The wide applicability of these algorithms is arguably due to the black-box regret guarantees that hold for arbitrary sequences. However, such regret guarantees can be loose if the sequence being encountered is not “worst-case”. The reduction in “arbitrariness” of the sequence can arise from the particular structure of the problem at hand, and should be exploited. For instance, in some applications of online methods, the sequence comes from an additional computation done by the learner, thus being far from arbitrary.\nOne way to formally capture the partially benign nature of data is through a notion of predictable sequences [11]. We exhibit applications of this idea in several domains. First, we show that the Mirror Prox method [9], designed for optimizing non-smooth structured saddle-point problems, can be viewed as an instance of the predictable sequence approach. Predictability in this case is due precisely to smoothness of the inner optimization part and the saddle-point structure of the problem. We extend the results to Hölder-smooth functions, interpolating between the case of well-predictable gradients and “unpredictable” gradients.\nSecond, we address the question raised in [6] about existence of “simple” algorithms that converge at the rate of Õ(T−1)when employed in an uncoupled manner by players in a zero-sum finite matrix game, yet maintain the usualO(T−1/2) rate against arbitrary sequences. We give a positive answer and exhibit a fully adaptive algorithm that does not require the prior knowledge of whether the other player is collaborating. Here, the additional predictability comes from the fact that both players attempt to converge to theminimax value. We also tackle a partial information version of the problemwhere the player has only access to the real-valued payoff of themixed actions played by the two players on each round rather than the entire vector.\nOur third application is to convex programming: optimization of a linear function subject to convex constraints. This problem often arises in theoretical computer science, and we show that the idea of predictable sequences can be used here too. We provide a simple algorithm for ǫ-approximateMax Flow for a graphwith d edges with time complexity Õ(d3/2/ǫ), a performance previously obtained through a relatively involved procedure [8].\n2 Online Learning with Predictable Gradient Sequences\nLet us describe the online convex optimization (OCO) problem and the basic algorithm studied in [4, 11]. Let F be a convex set of moves of the learner. On round t = 1, . . . ,T , the learner makes a prediction ft ∈F and observes a convex function Gt onF . The objective is to keep regret\n1\nT T∑ t=1 Gt ( ft)−Gt ( f ∗) small for any f ∗ ∈F . LetRbe a 1-strongly convex functionw.r.t. somenorm ∥⋅∥onF , and let g0 = argming∈F R(g). Suppose that at the beginning of every round t , the learner has access to Mt , a vector computable based on the past observations or side information. In this paper we study the Optimistic Mirror Descent algorithm, defined by the interleaved sequence\nft = argmin f ∈F ηt ⟨ f ,Mt ⟩+DR( f ,gt−1) , gt = argmin g∈F ηt ⟨g ,∇Gt( ft )⟩+DR(g ,gt−1) (1) where DR is the Bregman Divergence with respect to R and {ηt} is a sequence of step sizes that can be chosen adaptively based on the sequence observed so far. The method adheres to the OCO protocol since Mt is available at the beginning of round t , and ∇Gt ( ft ) becomes available after the prediction ft is made. The sequence { ft} will be called primary, while {gt} – secondary. This method was proposed in [4] for Mt = ∇Gt−1( ft−1), and the following lemma is a straightforward extension of the result in [11] for general Mt : Lemma 1. Let F be a convex set in a Banach space B. Let R ∶ B → R be a 1-strongly convex function on F with respect to some norm ∥ ⋅∥, and let ∥ ⋅∥∗ denote the dual norm. For any fixed step-size η, the Optimistic Mirror Descent Algorithm yields, for any f ∗ ∈ F ,\nT∑ t=1 Gt( ft )−Gt( f ∗) ≤ T∑ t=1 ⟨ ft − f ∗,∇t ⟩ ≤ η−1R2 + T∑ t=1 ∥∇t −Mt ∥∗ ∥gt − ft ∥− 12η T∑ t=1 (∥gt − ft ∥2+∥gt−1 − ft ∥2) (2) where R ≥ 0 is such thatDR( f ∗,g0) ≤R2 and∇t =∇Gt ( ft ).\nWhen applying the lemma, we will often use the simple fact that\n∥∇t −Mt ∥∗ ∥gt − ft ∥ = inf ρ>0 {ρ 2 ∥∇t −Mt ∥2∗+ 12ρ ∥gt − ft ∥2} . (3)\nIn particular, by setting ρ = η, we obtain the (unnormalized) regret bound of η−1R2+(η/2)∑Tt=1 ∥∇t −Mt ∥2∗, which is R √ 2∑Tt=1 ∥∇t −Mt ∥2∗ by choosing η optimally. Since this choice is not known ahead of time, one may either employ the doubling trick, or choose the step size adaptively:\nCorollary 2. Consider step size\nηt =Rmaxmin ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎩ ⎛ ⎝ ¿ÁÁÀt−1∑ i=1 ∥∇i −Mi ∥2∗+ ¿ÁÁÀt−2∑ i=1 ∥∇i −Mi ∥2∗⎞⎠ −1 ,1 ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎬⎪⎪⎪⎭ with R2max = sup f ,g∈F DR( f ,g). Then regret of the Optimistic Mirror Descent algorithm is upper bounded by\n3.5Rmax √∑Tt=1 ∥∇t −Mt ∥2∗+1 T .\nThese results indicate that tighter regret bounds are possible if one can guess thenext gradient∇t by computing Mt . One such case arises in offline optimization of a smooth function, whereby the previous gradient turns out to be a good proxy for the next one. More precisely, suppose we aim to optimize a function G( f ) whose gradients are Lipschitz continuous: ∥∇G( f )−∇G(g)∥∗ ≤H∥ f − g∥ for some H > 0. In this optimization setting, no guessing of Mt is needed: we may simply query the oracle for the gradient and set Mt =∇G(gt−1). The Optimistic Mirror Descent then becomes\nft = argmin f ∈F ηt ⟨ f ,∇G(gt−1)⟩+DR( f ,gt−1) , gt = argmin g∈F ηt ⟨g ,∇G( ft )⟩+DR(g ,gt−1) which can be recognized as the Mirror Prox method, due to Nemirovski [9]. By smoothness, ∥∇G( ft )−Mt ∥∗ =∥∇G( ft )−∇G(gt−1)∥∗ ≤H∥ ft − gt−1∥. Lemma 1 with Eq. (3) and ρ = η = 1/H immediately yields a bound\nT∑ t=1 G( ft)−G( f ∗) ≤HR2 , which implies that the average f̄T = 1T ∑Tt=1 ft satisfies G( f̄T )−G( f ∗) ≤ HR2/T , a known bound for Mirror Prox. We now extend this result to arbitrary α-Hölder smooth functions, that is convex functions G such that ∥∇G( f )− ∇G(g)∥∗ ≤H∥ f − g∥α for all f ,g ∈F . Lemma 3. Let F be a convex set in a Banach space B and let R ∶ B→ R be a 1-strongly convex function on F with respect to some norm ∥ ⋅∥. Let G be a convex α-Hölder smooth function with constant H > 0 and α ∈ [0,1]. Then the average f̄T = 1T ∑Tt=1 ft of the trajectory given by Optimistic Mirror Descent Algorithm enjoys\nG( f̄T )− inf f ∈F G( f ) ≤ 8HR1+α T 1+α 2\nwhere R ≥ 0 is such that sup f ∈F DR( f ,g0) ≤R. This result provides a smooth interpolation between the T−1/2 rate at α = 0 (that is, no predictability of the gradient is possible) and the T−1 rate when the smoothness structure allows for a dramatic speed up with a very simple modification of the original Mirror Descent.\n3 Structured Optimization\nIn this section we consider the structured optimization problem\nargmin f ∈F G( f ) whereG( f ) is of the formG( f ) = supx∈X φ( f ,x) with φ(⋅,x) convex for every x ∈ X and φ( f , ⋅) concave for every f ∈F . BothF andX are assumed to be convex sets. WhileG itself need not be smooth, it has been recognized that the structure can be exploited to improve rates of optimization if the function φ is smooth [10]. From the point of view of online learning, wewill see that the optimization problem of the saddle point type can be solved by playing two online convex optimization algorithms against each other (henceforth called Players I and II).\nSpecifically, assume that Player I produces a sequence f1, . . . , fT by using a regret-minimization algorithm, such\nthat\n1\nT T∑ t=1 φ( ft ,xt )− inf f ∈F 1 T T∑ t=1 φ( f ,xt ) ≤Rate1(x1, . . . ,xT ) (4) and Player II produces x1, . . . ,xT with\n1\nT T∑ t=1 (−φ( ft ,xt ))− inf x∈X 1 T T∑ t=1 (−φ( ft ,x)) ≤Rate2( f1, . . . , fT ) . (5)\nBy a standard argument (see e.g. [7]),\ninf f\n1\nT T∑ t=1 φ( f ,xt ) ≤ inf f φ( f , x̄T ) ≤ sup x inf f φ( f ,x) ≤ inf f sup x φ( f ,x) ≤ sup x φ( f̄T ,x) ≤ sup x 1 T T∑ t=1 φ( ft ,x) where f̄T = 1T ∑Tt=1 ft and x̄T = 1T ∑Tt=1 xt . By adding (4) and (5), we have\nsup x∈X\n1\nT T∑ t=1 φ( ft ,x)− inf f ∈F 1 T T∑ t=1 φ( f ,xt ) ≤Rate1(x1, . . . ,xT )+Rate2( f1, . . . , fT ) (6) which sandwiches the previous sequence of inequalities up to the sum of regret rates and implies near-optimality of f̄T and x̄T .\nLemma 4. Suppose both players employ the Optimistic Mirror Descent algorithm with, respectively, predictable sequences M1t and M 2 t , 1-strongly convex functions R1 on F (w.r.t. ∥ ⋅ ∥F ) and R2 on X (w.r.t. ∥ ⋅ ∥X ), and fixed\nlearning rates η and η′. Let { ft} and {xt} denote the primary sequences of the players while let {gt},{yt} denote the secondary. Then for any α,β > 0,\nsup x∈X φ( f̄T ,x)− inf f ∈F sup x∈X φ( f ,x) (7) ≤ R21 η + α 2 T∑ t=1 ∥∇ f φ( ft ,xt )−M1t ∥2F∗ + 12α T∑ t=1 ∥gt − ft ∥2F − 12η T∑ t=1\n(∥gt − ft ∥2F +∥gt−1 − ft ∥2F) + R22 η′ + β 2 T∑ t=1 ∥∇xφ( ft ,xt )−M2t ∥2X∗ + 12β T∑ t=1 ∥yt − xt ∥2X − 12η′ T∑ t=1\n(∥yt − xt ∥2X +∥yt−1 − xt ∥2X ) where R1 and R2 are such thatDR1( f ∗,g0) ≤R21 andDR2(x∗, y0) ≤R22 , and f̄T = 1T ∑Tt=1 ft .\nThe proof of Lemma 4 is immediate from Lemma 1. We obtain the following corollary:\nCorollary 5. Suppose φ ∶F ×X ↦R is Hölder smooth in the following sense: ∥∇ f φ( f ,x)−∇f φ(g ,x)∥F∗ ≤H1∥ f − g∥αF , ∥∇ f φ( f ,x)−∇ f φ( f , y)∥F∗ ≤H2∥x− y∥α′X and ∥∇xφ( f ,x)−∇xφ(g ,x)∥X∗ ≤H4∥ f − g∥βF , ∥∇xφ( f ,x)−∇xφ( f , y)∥X∗ ≤H3∥x− y∥β′X . Let γ = min{α,α′,β,β′}, H = max{H1,H2,H3,H4}. Suppose both players employ Optimistic Mirror Descent with M1t =∇ f φ(gt−1, yt−1) and M2t =∇xφ(gt−1, yt−1), where {gt} and {yt} are the secondary sequences updated by the two algorithms, and with step sizes η = η′ = (R21 +R22) 1−γ2 (2H)−1 (T2 ) γ−12 . Then\nsup x∈X φ( f̄T ,x)− inf f ∈F sup x∈X φ( f ,x) ≤ 4H(R21 +R22) 1+γ2 T 1+γ 2\n(8)\nAs revealed in the proof of this corollary, the negative terms in (7), that come from an upper bound on regret of Player I, in fact contribute to cancellations with positive terms in regret of Player II, and vice versa. Such a coupling of the upper bounds on regret of the two players can be seen as leading to faster rates under the appropriate assumptions, and this idea will be exploited to a great extent in the proofs of the next section.\n4 Zero-sum Game and Uncoupled Dynamics\nThe notions of a zero-sum matrix game and a minimax equilibrium are arguably the most basic and important notions of game theory. The tight connectionbetween linear programming andminimax equilibrium suggests that theremight be simple dynamics that can lead the two players of the game to eventually converge to the equilibrium\nvalue. Existence of such simple or natural dynamics is of interest in behavioral economics, where one asks whether agents can discover static solution concepts of the game iteratively and without extensive communication.\nMore formally, let A ∈ [−1,1]n×m be a matrix with bounded entries. The two players aim to find a pair of nearoptimal mixed strategies ( f̄ , x̄) ∈ ∆n ×∆m such that f̄ TAx̄ is close to the minimax value min f ∈∆n maxx∈∆m f TAx, where ∆n is the probability simplex over n actions. Of course, this is a particular form of the saddle point problem\nconsidered in the previous section, with φ( f ,x) = f TAx. It is well-known (and follows immediately from (6)) that the players can compute near-optimal strategies by simply playing no-regret algorithms [7]. More precisely, on round t , the players I and II “predict” the mixed strategies ft and xt and observe Axt and f T t A, respectively. While\nblack-box regretminimization algorithms, such as Exponential Weights, immediately yieldO(T−1/2) convergence rates, Daskalakis et al [6] asked whether faster methods exist. To make the problem well-posed, it is required that the two players are strongly uncoupled: neither A nor the number of available actions of the opponent is known to either player, no “funny bit arithmetic” is allowed, and memory storage of each player allows only for constant number of payoff vectors. The authors of [6] exhibited a near-optimal algorithm that, if used by both players, yields a pair of mixed strategies that constitutes anO( log(m+n)(logT+(log(m+n))3/2) T\n)-approximate minimax equilibrium. Furthermore, the method has a regret bound of the same order as Exponential Weights when faced with an arbitrary sequence. The algorithm in [6] is an application of the excessive gap technique of Nesterov, and requires careful choreography and interleaving of rounds between the two non-communicating players. The authors, therefore, asked whether a simple algorithm (e.g. a modification of Exponential Weights) can in fact achieve the same result. We answer this in the affirmative. While a direct application of Mirror Prox does not yield the result (and also does not provide strong decoupling), belowwe show that amodification of Optimistic Mirror Descent achieves the goal. Furthermore, by choosing the step size adaptively, the same method guarantees the typicalO(T−1/2) regret if not faced with a compliant player, thus ensuring robustness.\nIn Section 4.1, we analyze the “first-order information” version of the problem, as described above: upon play-\ning the respective mixed strategies ft and xt on round t , Player I observes Axt and Player II observes f T t A. Then, in Section 4.2, we consider an interesting extension to partial information, whereby the players submit their moves ft ,xt but only observe the real value f T t Axt . Recall that in both cases the matrix A is not known to the players.\n4.1 First-Order Information Consider the following simple algorithm. Initialize f0 = g ′0 ∈ ∆n and x0 = y ′0 ∈ ∆m to be uniform distributions, set β = 1/T 2 and proceed as follows:\nOn round t, Player I performs\nPlay ft and observe Axt Update gt(i)∝ g ′t−1(i)exp{−ηt [Axt ]i}, g ′t = (1−β)gt +(β/n)1n ft+1(i)∝ g ′t(i)exp{−ηt+1[Axt ]i}\nwhile simultaneously Player II performs\nPlay xt and observe f ⊺ t A Update yt(i)∝ y ′t−1(i)exp{−η′t [ f Tt A]i}, y ′t = (1−β) yt +(β/m)1m xt+1(i)∝ y ′t (i)exp{−η′t+1[ f Tt A]i}\nHere, 1n ∈ Rn is a vector of all ones and both [b]i and b(i) refer to the i -th coordinate of a vector b. Other than the “mixing in” of the uniform distribution, the algorithm for both players is simply the Optimistic Mirror Descent with the (negative) entropy function. In fact, the step of mixing in the uniform distribution is only needed when some coordinate of gt (resp., yt ) is smaller than 1/(nT 2). Furthermore, this step is also not needed if none of the players deviate from the prescribed method. In such a case, the resulting algorithm is simply the constant step-\nsize Exponential Weights ft (i)∝ exp{−η∑t−2s=1[Axs−1]i +2η[Axt−1]i}, but with a factor 2 in front of the latest loss vector! Proposition 6. Let A ∈ [−1,1]n×m , F = ∆n , X = ∆m . If both players use above algorithm with, respectively, M1t = Axt−1 and M2t = f Tt−1A, and the adaptive step sizes ηt =min{log(nT )(√∑t−1i=1 ∥Axi − Axi−1∥2∗+√∑t−2i=1 ∥Axi − Axi−1∥2∗)−1 , 111} and\nη′t =min{log(mT )(√∑t−1i=1 ∥ f Ti A− f Ti−1A∥2∗+ √∑t−2i=1 ∥ f Ti A− f Ti−1A∥2∗)−1 , 111}\nrespectively, then the pair ( f̄T , x̄T ) is an O ( logm+logn+logTT )-approximate minimax equilibrium. Furthermore, if only one player (say, Player I) follows the above algorithm, her regret against any sequence x1, . . . ,xT of plays is\nO⎛⎝ log(nT )T ⎛⎝ ¿ÁÁÀ T∑ t=1 ∥Axt − Axt−1∥2∗+1⎞⎠⎞⎠ . (9)\nIn particular, this implies the worst-case regret ofO( log(nT)√ T ) in the general setting of online linear optimization. We remark that (9) can give intermediate rates for regret in the case that the second player deviates from the prescribed strategy but produces “stable” moves. For instance, if the second player employs a mirror descent algorithm (or Follow the Regularized Leader / Exponential Weights method) with step size η, one can typically show stability ∥xt − xt−1∥ =O(η). In this case, (9) yields the rateO(η logT√ T\n) for the first player. A typical setting of η∝ T−1/2 for the second player still ensures theO(logT /T ) regret for the first player.\nLet us finish with a technical remark. The reason for the extra step of “mixing in” the uniform distribution stems from the goal of having an adaptive and robust method that still attainsO(T−1/2) regret if the other player deviates from using the algorithm. If one is only interested in the dynamics when both players cooperate, this step is not necessary, and in this case the extraneous logT factor disappears from the above bound, leading to the O ( logn+logm T\n) convergence. On the technical side, the need for the extra step is the following. The adaptive step size result of Corollary 2 involves the term R2max ≥ supg DR1( f ∗,g) which is potentially infinite for the negative entropy function R1. It is possible that the doubling trick or the analysis of Auer et al [2] (who encountered the same problem for the Exponential Weights algorithm) can remove the extra logT factor while still preserving the regret minimization property. We also remark that Rmax is small when R1 is instead the p-norm; hence, the use of this regularizer avoids the extraneous logarithmic in T factor while still preserving the logarithmic dependence on n andm. However, projection onto the simplex under the p-norm is not as elegant as the Exponential Weights update.\n4.2 Partial Information\nWe now turn to the partial (or, zero-th order) information model. Recall that the matrix A is not known to the players, yet we are interested in finding ǫ-optimal minimax strategies. On each round, the two players choose mixed strategies ft ∈∆n and xt ∈∆m , respectively, and observe f Tt Axt . Now the question is, howmany such observations do we need to get to an ǫ-optimal minimax strategy? Can this be done while still ensuring the usual no-regret rate?\nThe specific setting we consider below requires that on each round t , the two players play four times, and that these four plays are δ-close to each other (that is, ∥ f it − f jt ∥1 ≤ δ for i , j ∈ {1, . . . ,4}). Interestingly, up to logarithmic factors, the fast rate of the previous section is possible even in this scenario, but we do require the knowledge of the number of actions of the opposing player (or, an upper bound on this number). We leave it as an open problem the question of whether one can attain the 1/T -type rate with only one play per round.\nPlayer I u1, . . . ,un−1 : orthonormal basis of ∆n Initialize g1 , f1 = 1 n 1n ; Draw i0 ∼Unif([n−1]) At time t = 1 to T Play ft Draw it ∼Unif([n−1]) Observe :\nr+t = ( ft +δuit−1 ) ⊺Axt r−t = ( ft −δuit−1 ) ⊺Axt r̄ + t = ( ft +δuit ) ⊺ Axt r̄−t = ( ft −δuit ) ⊺Axt\nBuild estimates :\nât = n 2δ (r+t − r−t )uit−1 āt =\nn 2δ (r̄+t − r̄−t )uit Update :\ngt (i)∝ g ′t−1(i)exp{−ηt ât (i)} g ′t = (1−β) gt +(β/n)1 ft+1(i)∝ g ′t (i)exp{−ηt+1 āt (i)}\nEnd\nPlayer II v1, . . . ,vm−1 : orthonormal basis of ∆m Initialize y1,x1 = 1 m 1m ; Draw j0 ∼Unif([m−1]) At time t = 1 to T Play xt Draw jt ∼Unif([m−1]) Observe :\ns+t = − f ⊺t A(xt +δv jt−1) s−t = − f ⊺t A(xt −δv jt−1) s̄+t = − f ⊺t A(xt +δv jt ) s̄−t = − f ⊺t A(xt −δv jt )\nBuild estimates :\nb̂t = m 2δ (s+t − s−t )v jt−1 b̄t =\nm 2δ (s̄+t − s̄−t )v jt Update :\nyt (i)∝ y′t−1(i)exp{−η′t b̂t (i)} y ′ t = (1−β) yt +(β/m)1\nxt+1(i)∝ y′t (i)exp{−η′t+1b̄t (i)} End\nLemma 7. Let A ∈ [−1,1]n×m , F = ∆n , X = ∆m , let δ be small enough (e.g. exponentially small in m,n,T ), and let β = 1/T 2.

We hypothesize a rate better than T−1/2 is not possible in this scenario.\n5 Approximate Smooth Convex Programming\nIn this section we show how one can use the structured optimization results from Section 3 for approximately solving convex programming problems. Specifically consider the optimization problem\nargmax f ∈G\nc⊺ f (10)\ns.t. ∀i ∈ [d], Gi( f ) ≤ 1\nwhere G is a convex set and eachGi is anH-smooth convex function. Let the optimal value of the above optimization problem be given by F∗ > 0, and without loss of generality assume F∗ is known (one typically performs binary search if it is not known). Define the sets F = { f ∶ f ∈ G,c⊺ f = F∗} and X =∆d . The convex programming problem in (10) can now be reformulated as\nargmin f ∈F max i∈[d] Gi( f ) = argmin f ∈F sup x∈X d∑ i=1 x(i)Gi( f ) . (11) This problem is in the saddle-point form, as studied earlier in the paper. Wemay think of the first player as aiming to minimize the above expression over F , while the second player maximizes over a mixture of constraints with the aim of violating at least one of them. Lemma 8. Fix γ,ǫ > 0. Assume there exists f0 ∈ G such that c⊺ f0 ≥ 0 and for every i ∈ [d], Gi ( f0) ≤ 1−γ. Suppose each Gi is 1-Lipschitz overF . Consider the solution f̂T = (1−α) f̄T +α f0 whereα = ǫ\nǫ+γ and f̄T = 1T ∑Tt=1 ft ∈F is the average of the trajectory of the procedure in Lemma4 for the optimization problem (11). Let R1(⋅) = 12 ∥⋅∥22 and R2 be the entropy function. Further let B be a known constant such that B ≥∥ f ∗− g0∥2 where g0 ∈ F is some initialization and f ∗ ∈F is the (unknown) solution to the optimization problem. Set η = argmin\nη≤H−1 {B2 η + η logd 1−ηH }, η′ = 1η −H, M1t =∑di=1 yt−1(i)∇Gi(gt−1) and M2t = (G1(gt−1), . . . ,Gd(gt−1)). Let number\nof iterations T be such that\nT > 1 ǫ inf η≤H−1 {B2 η + η logd 1−ηH }\nWe then have that f̂T ∈ G satisfies all d constraints and is ǫγ -approximate, that is c⊺ f̂T ≥ (1− ǫ\nγ )F∗ .\nLemma 8 tells us that using the predictable sequences approach for the two players, one can obtain an ǫ γ -\napproximate solution to the smooth convex programming problem in number of iterations at most order 1/ǫ. If T1 (reps. T2) is the time complexity for single update of the predictable sequence algorithm of Player I (resp. Player\n2), then time complexity of the overall procedure isO(T1+T2 ǫ ) 5.1 Application to Max-Flow\nWe now apply the above result to the problem of finding Max Flow between a source and a sink in a network, such that the capacity constraint on each edge is satisfied. For simplicity, consider a network where each edge has capacity 1 (the method can be easily extended to the case of varying capacity). Suppose the number of edges d in the network is the same order as number of vertices in the network. The Max Flow problem can be seen as an instance of a convex (linear) programming problem, and we apply the proposed algorithm for structured optimization to obtain an approximate solution.\nFor the Max Flow problem, the sets G and F are given by sets of linear equalities. Further, if we use Euclidean norm squared as regularizer for the flow player, then projection step can be performed in O(d) time using conjugate gradient method. This is because we are simply minimizing Euclidean norm squared subject to equality constraints which is well conditioned. Hence T1 =O(d). Similarly, the Exponential Weights update has time complexityO(d) as there are order d constraints, and so overall time complexity to produce ǫ approximate solution is given byO(nd), where n is the number of iterations of the proposed procedure.\nOnce again, we shall assume that we know the value of themaximum flow F∗ (for, otherwise, we can use binary search to obtain it).\nCorollary 9. Applying the procedure for smooth convex programming from Lemma 8 to the Max Flow problemwith f0 = 0 ∈ G the 0 flow, the time complexity to compute an ǫ-approximate Max Flow is bounded by O(d3/2 √ logd\nǫ ) .\nThis time complexity matches the known result from [8], but with amuch simpler procedure (gradient descent for the flow player and Exponential Weights for the constraints). It would be interesting to see whether the techniques presented here can be used to improve the dependence on d to d4/3 or better while maintaining the 1/ǫ dependence. While the result of [5] has the improved d4/3 dependence, the complexity in terms of ǫ ismuchworse.\n6 Discussion\nWe close this paper with a discussion. As we showed, the notion of using extra information about the sequence is a powerful tool with applications in optimization, convex programming, game theory, to name a few. All the applications considered in this paper, however, used some notion of smoothness for constructing the predictable processMt . An interesting direction of further research is to isolate more general conditions under which the next gradient is predictable, perhaps even when the functions are not smooth in any sense. For instance one could use techniques from bundle methods to further restrict the set of possible gradients the function being optimized can have at various points in the feasible set. This could then be used to solve for the right predictable sequence to use so as to optimize the bounds. Using this notion of selecting predictable sequences one can hope to derive adaptive optimization procedures that in practice can provide rapid convergence.\nAcknowledgements: We thank Vianney Perchet for insightful discussions.

Let R1( f ) = ∑ni=1 f (i) ln f (i) and, respectively, R2(x) = ∑mi=1 x(i) lnx(i). These functions are strongly convex with respect to ∥ ⋅ ∥1 norm on the respective flat simplex. We first upper bound regret of Player I, writing ∇t as a generic observation vector, later to be chosen as Axt , and Mt as a generic predictable\nsequence, later chosen to be Axt−1. Observe that ∥g ′t − gt∥1 ≤ 1/T 2. Let f ∗ = ei∗ be a vertex of the simplex. Then ⟨ ft − f ∗,∇t ⟩ = ⟨ ft − gt ,∇t −Mt ⟩+ ⟨ ft − gt ,Mt ⟩+ ⟨gt − f ∗,∇t ⟩\nBy the update rule,\n⟨ ft − gt ,Mt ⟩ ≤ 1 ηt (DR1(gt ,g ′t−1)−DR1(gt , ft )−DR1( ft ,g ′t−1)) and\n⟨gt − f ∗,∇t ⟩≤ 1 ηt (DR1( f ∗,g ′t−1)−DR1( f ∗,gt)−DR1(gt ,g ′t−1)) . We conclude that ⟨ ft − f ∗,∇t ⟩ is upper bounded by\n∥∇t −Mt ∥∗ ∥ ft − gt∥+ 1ηt (DR1(gt ,g ′t−1)−DR1(gt , ft )−DR1( ft ,g ′t−1)) + 1\nηt (DR1( f ∗,g ′t−1)−DR1( f ∗,gt )−DR1(gt ,g ′t−1)))\n= ∥∇t −Mt ∥∗ ∥ ft − gt∥+ 1ηt (DR1( f ∗,g ′t−1)−DR1( f ∗,gt )−DR1(gt , ft )−DR1( ft ,g ′t−1))\nUsing strong convexity, the term involving the four divergences can be further upper bounded by\n1 ηt (DR1( f ∗,g ′t−1)−DR1( f ∗,gt)− 12 ∥gt − ft ∥2 − 12 ∥g ′t−1 − ft ∥2) = 1 ηt\n(DR1( f ∗,g ′t−1)−DR1( f ∗,g ′t)− 12 ∥gt − ft ∥2 − 12 ∥g ′t−1 − ft ∥2) + 1\nηt (DR1( f ∗,g ′t )−DR1( f ∗,gt))\n= 1 ηt (DR1( f ∗,g ′t−1)−DR1( f ∗,g ′t)− 12 ∥gt − ft ∥2 − 12 ∥g ′t−1 − ft ∥2)+ 1ηt ln gt(i ∗)\ng ′t(i∗) where f ∗ is 1 on coordinate i∗ and 0 everywhere else, and the norm is the ℓ1 norm. Now let us bound the last term. First, whenever g ′t(i∗) ≥ gt(i∗) the term is negative. Since g ′t(i∗) = (1−1/T 2)gt(i∗)+1/(nT 2) this happens whenever gt(i∗) ≤ 1/n. On the other hand, for gt(i∗) > 1/n we can bound\nln gt(i∗) g ′t(i∗) = ln gt(i∗)(1−1/T 2)gt(i∗)+1/(nT 2) ≤ 2T 2 . Using the above in the bound on ⟨ ft − f ∗,∇t ⟩ and summing over t = 1, . . . ,T , and using the fact that the step size are non-increasing, we conclude that\nT∑ t=1 ⟨ ft − f ∗,∇t ⟩≤ η−11 DR1( f ∗,g0)+ T∑ t=2 DR1( f ∗,g ′t−1)( 1ηt − 1ηt−1 )+ T∑ t=1 ∥∇t −Mt ∥∗ ∥gt − ft ∥ −\nT∑ t=1 1 2ηt (∥gt − ft ∥2+∥g ′t−1− ft ∥2)+ 2 T 2 T∑ t=1 1 ηt\n≤ (η−11 +η−1T )R21,max+ T∑ t=1 ∥∇t −Mt ∥∗ ∥gt − ft ∥− 12 T∑ t=1 η−1t (∥gt − ft ∥2+∥g ′t−1 − ft ∥2) + 2\nT 2 T∑ t=1 1 ηt . (26)\nwhere R21,max is an upper bound on the largest KL divergence between f ∗ and any g ′ that has all coordinates at least 1/(nT 2). Since f ∗ is a vertex of the flat simplex, we may take R21,max ≜ log(nT 2). Also note that 1/ηt ≤ c√T and so 2\nT 2 ∑Tt=1 1ηt ≤ cT 1/2 ≤ 1 for T large enough. Hence we conclude that a bound on regret of Player I is given by T∑ t=1 ⟨ ft − f ∗,∇t ⟩ ≤ (η−11 +η−1T )R21,max+ T∑ t=1 ∥Axt − Axt−1∥∗ ∥gt − ft ∥− 12 T∑ t=1\nη−1t (∥g ′t − ft ∥2+∥g ′t−1− ft ∥2)+1 (27) Observe that\nηt =min ⎧⎪⎪⎪⎨⎪⎪⎪⎩R 2 1,max √∑t−1i=1 ∥Axi − Axi−1∥2∗−√∑t−2i=1 ∥Axi − Axi−1∥2∗∥Axt−1 − Axt−2∥2∗ , 1 11 ⎫⎪⎪⎪⎬⎪⎪⎪⎭ and\n11 ≤ η−1t ≤max{2R−21,max√∑t−1i=1 ∥Axi − Axi−1∥2∗,11} With this, the upper bound on Player I’s unnormalized regret is\n1+22R21,max +2 ¿ÁÁÀT−1∑ t=1 ∥Axt − Axt−1∥2∗+ T∑ t=1 ∥Axt − Axt−1∥∗ ∥gt − ft ∥− 112 T∑ t=1 (∥gt − ft ∥2+∥g ′t−1− ft ∥2)\nAdding the regret of the second player who uses step size η′t , the overall bound on the suboptimality, as in Eq.

(28) we conclude that the overall bound on the suboptimality is\n6+22R21,max +22R 2 2,max +\n40 T = 6+22log(nT 2)+22log(mT 2)+ 40 T\n= 6+22log(nmT 4)+ 40 T .\nThis proves the result for the case when both players adhere to the prescribed algorithm. Now, consider the case when Player I adheres, but we do not make any assumption about Player II. Then, from Eq. (27) and Eq.

We start with the observation that ât and āt−1 are unbiased estimates of Axt and Axt−1 respectively. Thats is Eit−1 [ât ]= Axt and Eit−1 [āt−1] = Axt−1. Hence we have\nE[ T∑ t=1 f ⊺t Axt − inf f ∈∆n T∑ t=1 f ⊺Axt] ≤ E[ T∑ t=1 ⟨ ft , ât ⟩− inf f ∈∆n T∑ t=1 ⟨ f , ât ⟩]\nUsing the same line of proof as the one used to arrive at Eq.

In this case, a similar regret bound holds for Player II. Adding the regret of the second player who uses step size η′t , the overall bound on the suboptimality, as in Eq.

In this case, note that starting from Eq. (30) and simply dropping the negative termwe get,\nE[ T∑ t=1 f ⊺t Axt − inf f ∈∆n T∑ t=1 f ⊺Axt]≤ 56mR2,maxR21,max+1+ 7 2 R1,max ¿ÁÁÀ T∑ t=1 ∥ât − āt−1∥2∗\nAs we noted earlier, ∥ât − āt−1∥∗ ≤ n ∥xt − xt−1∥ and so, E[ T∑\nt=1 f ⊺t Axt − inf f ∈∆n T∑ t=1 f ⊺Axt] ≤ 56mR2,maxR21,max +1+ 7 2 nR1,max ¿ÁÁÀ T∑ t=1\n∥xt − xt−1∥2 Further noting that R1,max ≤ √ log(nT ) and R2,max ≤√log(mT )we conclude that\nE[ T∑ t=1 f ⊺t Axt − inf f ∈∆n T∑ t=1 f ⊺Axt] ≤ 56m√log(mT ) log(nT )+1+ 7 2 n ¿ÁÁÀlog(nT ) T∑ t=1\n∥xt − xt−1∥2 This concludes the proof.\nProof of Lemma 8. Noting that the constraints are all H-strongly smooth and that the objective is linear for the maximizing player, we can apply Lemma 4 to the optimization problem with R1(⋅) = 12 ∥⋅∥22 and R2 the entropy function to obtain that\nT (max i∈[d] Gi ( f̄T )− inf f ∈F max i∈[d] Gi ( f )) ≤ ∥ f ∗− g0∥22\nη + T∑ t=1 ⟨ d∑ i=1 xt (i)∇Gi( ft)− d∑ i=1 yt−1(i)∇Gi(gt−1),gt − ft⟩− 1 2η T∑ t=1 (∥gt − ft ∥22+∥gt−1 − ft ∥22) + logd\nη′ + β 2 T∑ t=1 ∥G( ft )−G(gt−1)∥2∞+ 12β T∑ t=1 ∥yt − xt ∥21− 12η′ T∑ t=1 (∥yt − xt ∥21+∥yt−1 − xt ∥21) (Strictly speaking we have used a version of Lemma 4 where the first term coming from (12) in Lemma 1 is kept as a linear term.) Here, G( f ) is the vector of the values of the constraints for f . We then write T∑ t=1 ⟨ d∑ i=1 xt (i)∇Gi( ft)− d∑ i=1\nyt−1(i)∇Gi(gt−1),gt − ft⟩ = T∑\nt=1 ⟨ d∑ i=1 xt (i)∇Gi( ft )− d∑ i=1 yt−1(i)∇Gi( ft),gt − ft⟩+ T∑ t=1 ⟨ d∑ i=1 yt−1(i)∇Gi( ft )− d∑ i=1 yt−1(i)∇Gi(gt−1),gt − ft⟩ = T∑\nt=1 d∑ i=1 (xt (i)− yt−1(i))⟨∇Gi( ft ),gt − ft ⟩+ T∑ t=1 d∑ i=1 yt−1(i)⟨∇Gi ( ft )−∇Gi (gt−1),gt − ft ⟩ ≤\nT∑ t=1 ∥xt − yt−1∥1max i∈[d] ∣⟨∇Gi( ft ),gt − ft ⟩∣+ T∑ t=1 d∑ i=1 yt−1(i)∥∇Gi ( ft )−∇Gi(gt−1)∥2 ∥gt − ft ∥2 ≤\nT∑ t=1 ∥xt − yt−1∥1 ∥gt − ft ∥2+H T∑ t=1 ∥ft − gt−1∥2 ∥gt − ft ∥2 where we used the fact that each ∥∇Gi ( f )∥ ≤ 1.

Therefore, picking η′ = 1 η −H\nand η ≤ 1/H we obtain max i∈[d] Gi ( f̄T )− inf f ∈F max i∈[d] Gi ( f ) ≤ 1 T inf η≤H−1 {B2 η + η logd 1−ηH }\nNow since T is such that T ≥ 1 ǫ infη≤H−1 {B2η + η logd1−ηH }we can conclude that\nmax i∈[d] Gi( f̄T )−argmin f ∈F max i∈[d] Gi( f ) ≤ ǫ Observe that for an optimal solution f ∗ ∈ G to the original optimization problem (10) we have that f ∗ ∈F and\n∀i ,Gi( f ∗) ≤ 1. Thus, max i∈[d]\nGi ( f̄T ) ≤ 1+ǫ We conclude that f̄T ∈F is a solution that attains the optimum value F∗ and almost satisfies the constraints. Now we have from the lemma statement that f0 ∈ G is such that c⊺ f0 ≥ 0 and for every i ∈ [d], Gi ( f0) ≤ 1−γ. Hence by convexity ofGi , we have that for every i ∈ [d], Gi (α f0 +(1−α) f̄T )≤αGi ( f0)+(1−α)Gi ( f̄T ) ≤α(1−γ)+(1−α)(1+ǫ) ≤ 1 Thus for α = ǫ\nǫ+γ and f̂T = (1−α) f̄T +α f0 we can conclude that f̂T ∈ G and that all the constraints are satisfied. That is for every i ∈ [d],Gi( f̂T ) ≤ 1. Also note that\nc⊺ f̂T = (1−α)c⊺ f̄T +αc⊺ f0 = (1−α)F∗ = γF∗ ǫ+γ\nand, hence, f̂T is an approximate maximizer, that is\nc⊺( f ∗− f̂T ) ≤ F∗− γF∗ ǫ+γ = F∗ǫ+F∗γ−γF∗ ǫ+γ = ǫ( F∗ ǫ+γ) ≤ ǫγF∗\nThus we obtain a (1+ ǫ γ )-optimal solution in the multiplicative sense which concludes the proof.\nProof of Corollary 9. As mentioned, for both players, the time to perform each step of the optimistic mirror descent in the Max Flow problem isO(d). Now further note that Max Flow is a linear programming problem and so we are ready to apply Lemma 8. Specifically for f0 we use the 0 flow which is in G (though not inF ) and note that for f0 we have that γ = 1. Applying Lemma 8 we get that number of iterations T we need to reach an ǫ approximate solution is given by\nT ≤ 1\nǫ inf η≤H−1 {B2 η + η logd 1−ηH }\nNowwe can use g0 = argmin g∈F ∥g∥2 which can be computed inO(d) time. Observe that ∥ f ∗− g0∥2 ≤ ∥ f ∗∥2+∥g0∥2 ≤ 2 √ d =∶ B . Also note that for linear constraints we have H = 0. Hence, the number of iterations is at most\nT ≤ 1 ǫ inf η {B2 η +η logd} =\n√ d logd\nǫ\nSince each iteration has time complexityO(d), the overall complexity of the algorithm is given by O(d3/2 √ logd\nǫ )\nthis concludes the proof."
