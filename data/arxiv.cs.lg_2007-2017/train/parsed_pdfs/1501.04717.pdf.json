      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nDeveloping a reliable and practical face recognition system is a long-standing goal in computer vision research. A tremendous amount of works have been done in the past three decades, however, most of them can only work well in controlled scenarios. In more practical scenarios, performance of these existing methods degrades drastically due to face variations caused by illumination, pose, and/or expression changes [1].\nTo handle the variation caused by illumination change, the methods of Lee et al. [2], Wagner et al. [3], motivated by the illumination cone model [4, 5], used multiple carefully chosen face images of varying illuminations per subject as gallery. Given a probe face of unknown subject under arbitrary illumination, face images under this specific illumination can be generated in the gallery to match with the probe face. When multiple gallery images of such kind are not available,\nY. Zhang and G. Pan are with the Department of Computer Science, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou 310027, P. R.

(email: yima@uiuc.edu)\nalternative methods [6, 7] considered extracting illumination invariant features for face recognition.\nTo address pose or expression variations, earlier approaches extend classic subspace or template based face recognition methods [8, 9]. The use of these methods is rather restricted due to their dependence on the availability of gallery images of multiple facial poses or expressions. Recent approaches consider more practical scenarios where only face images under the normal condition (frontal view and neutral expression) are assumed to be available in the gallery. To recognize a probe face with pose or expression changes, they either identified an implicit identity feature/representation of the probe face [10, 11, 12], which is pose- and expression-invariant, or explicitly estimate global or local mappings of facial appearance so that a virtual face under the normal condition can be synthesized for recognition [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. However, most of these methods are still far from practice since they assume both gallery and probe face images have been manually aligned into some canonical form, and they cannot generally cope with illumination variation either.\nIn literature, the most popular approaches for automatic face alignment across pose or expression are based on facial landmark localization, e.g., the Active Appearance Models (AAMs) [18, 19] and elastic graph matching (EGM) [20]. AAMs and EGM used densely-connected elastic graphs, which however, are difficult to optimize in that the solutions are likely to be trapped into undesirable local minima. Consequently, localized landmarks using these methods are often not accurate enough, especially when applied to unseen face images. To improve the localization accuracy, an explicit shape constraint for graph nodes was considered in the constrained local models (CLMs) [21]. CLMs [21, 22, 23] are still based on densely-connected graph models, and their shape constraints are over-simplified so that the dependency among different graph nodes is ignored. Recently, deformable part-based models (DPMs) show their promise in many applications such as object detection [24] and facial landmark localization [25]. In particular, Zhu and Ramanan [25] adopted a tree-structured part model, which encodes node dependency while admitting efficient solutions. Such a tree model was used by Zhu and Ramanan [25] for facial landmark localization. Nevertheless, it cannot be readily extended for pixel-wise face alignment, and consequently for face recognition across pose or expression.\nWith the aim of developing a system that can simultaneously handle illumination variation and minor changes of pose and expression, Wagner et al. [3] recently leveraged sparsity optimization and a carefully prepared gallery set (multiple images of varying illuminations per subject), to align probe\nar X\niv :1\n50 1.\n04 71\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n0 Ja\nn 20\n15\n2 face images into a canonical form for better recognition. In particular, they assumed human face as a planar surface and chose a global similarity transformation for face alignment. This may be valid when probe faces are close to the normal condition. It is however a rather simplified assumption when there exist pose and/or expression changes. Indeed, a human face has non-planar geometry and non-rigid deformation. Some portions of the face (e.g., the nose region) undergo significant appearance changes as the pose varies, while other portions (e.g. the mouth region) deform significantly as expression changes. It is thus more appropriate to approximate a human face as a piece-wise planar surface, and correspondingly use piece-wise geometric transformation for face alignment.\nImproving performance using enriched models is not an easy task in computer vision research. In fact, opposite effects often happen. As to the problems considered in this paper, we will show that by partitioning a human face as a collection of parts, and carefully characterizing the deformation relations among different parts, performance of face recognition across pose or expression can be significantly improved. In particular, we propose a Constrained Part-based Alignment (CPA) method for this task. Our method is partially motivated by the promise of piece-wise planar formulation and the explicit shape constraints used in CLMs [21, 22, 23] and DPMs [24, 25].\nCPA partitions the object of interest, e.g., a human face, as a constellation of parts, and uses a similarity transformation to model the deformation of each part. A tree-structured shape model is used in CPA to constrain the relations among the deformations of different parts. A CPA model also has a batch of registered face images serving as the appearance evidence of each part. For a probe face image, all its parts are simultaneously aligned towards the registered model, by fitting them to the appearance evidence and penalizing the cost of violating the constraint from the tree-structured shape model. We formulate this objective as a norm minimization problem regularized by graph likelihoods, which is solved by an alternating method composed of two steps: one for aligning the parts, and the other for adjusting the configuration of the tree-structured model. The former can be reduced into a sequence of convex problems, while the latter admits efficient solutions by gradient decent methods. In this paper, we use the proposed CPA model for face recognition, where registered gallery images are taken as the appearance evidence, and a probe image is aligned using the CPA model. After alignment, most of the off-the-shelf face recognition methods can be readily used for part recognition.The overall decision is made by aggregating predictions from different parts by a plurality voting scheme. Robustness against illumination variation can also be achieved by choosing specific face recognition methods, e.g., [3, 26].\nRicher models are often more difficult to train. For the proposed CPA model, both the appearance model and the treestructured shape model need to be automatically learned. On the one hand, the appearance model is obtained by aligning the gallery images in batch with the constraint from a given shape model. In particular, we use low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition as the criteria to optimize batch alignment of each part, and globally regularize these individual problems of\npart alignment by graph likelihoods. On the other hand, the shape model is learned by the probabilistic inference based on given part constellations, where the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation is performed with the graph likelihoods and the given conjugate priors of the likelihoods. As the two problems are coupled, we solve them in a joint way. Moreover, we generalize our learning method to train a mixture of CPA models (mCPA) for better handling pose and expression variations.\nPart-based face recognition methods [27, 28, 29, 30, 31] have shown improved performance over more standard approaches using holistic faces. However, existing part-based methods can only be applied when gallery and probe face images have been manually registered to each other. Our proposed CPA method enables this promising part-based strategy to be applicable in more practical scenarios, by automatically registering the gallery and probe face images in terms of deformable parts. In this paper, we present experiments on the Multi-PIE [32] and MUCT [33] datasets and show that our proposed CPA method can simultaneously and effectively handle illumination, pose, and/or expression variations.\n• Comparing with the natural alternative methods that holistically align face images, followed by either holistic face recognition or part-based recognition, our method gives significantly improved performance. • State-of-the-art pose-invariant face recognition method [34] relies on model learning using a large number of 3D face shapes, while training of our proposed CPA only requires 2D face images of a few subjects. Nevertheless, our method outperforms that of Li et al. [34]. when the degrees of pose change are within ±15◦. This range of pose change is often encountered in practical access control scenarios, where test subjects would be cooperative with face recognition systems. • Notably, while CPA is motivated to address the challenges of face recognition across pose/expression, it performs surprisingly well when probe face images are at frontal view and with neural expression. Our results in the frontalview, neutral-expression, varying-illumination, and acrosssession setting of Multi-PIE dataset are better than all existing methods, and as high as 99.6%. This confirms that considering human face as a piece-wise planar surface and aligning it part-wisely are very effective for high-accuracy face recognition. • We also empirically investigate the discriminative power of individual facial parts, and the robustness of our method against partial occlusion.\nDetails of these investigations are presented in Section VI. The rest of this paper are organized as follows. Section II reviews more related work in addition to those discussed in Section I. Section III presents our proposed CPA model and how to use it for alignment of probe face images. Section IV combines CPA with existing methods for part-based face recognition. Details of CPA model learning are presented in Section V, where we also extend CPA to a mixture of CPA for better handling pose or expression variations. Intensive experiments are finally reported in Section VI to show the\nefficacy of our proposed method.\nII. RELATED WORK\nAs discussed in Section I, most of existing methods for face recognition across pose or expressions assume gallery and probe face images have been manually registered, and they can only be applied to controlled scenarios. In particular, Chai et al. [13] learned local patch based mapping relations from nonfrontal pose to frontal pose by locally linear regression. Jorstad et al. [15] estimated pixel-wise registration from non-neutral expression to neutral expression by optical flow. Arashloo and Kittler [16] considered a Markov random field (MRF) model to regularize 2D displacements of local patches across different poses. For automatic face recognition across pose, given a probe face image, AAMs [18, 19] optimized localization of a set of facial landmarks to realize face alignment of pixel-level accuracy. However, the landmarks localized by AAMs are usually not accurate enough, and also the pixelwise correspondence induced by matched landmarks are not consistent enough across different poses and expressions [35]. Among existing methods, maybe the most successful ones across pose and/or expression are based on 3D models [36, 35, 34]. In spite of their promise, their relying on 3D data makes them less relevant to the 2D techniques considered in this paper. However, we will show that our proposed CPA method compares favorably with them when the pose variations are in a reasonably confined range.\nDeformable part models (DPM) have shown their success in object detection [24], facial landmark localization [25], and human pose estimation [37]. In particular, these methods optimize an objective function that scores both the appearance evidence and spatial constellation of the parts, where the former is scored by part detectors, and the latter is scored by a staror tree-structured shape model, which constrain the pair-wise offsets of different parts. Our use of part-based models is different from the DPM based methods [24, 25, 37]. Our\nCPA method aims at pixel-wise image alignment rather than finding the bounding box of an object/part or locating a small amount of landmarks. We measure the appearance evidence of parts by their similarity to aligned galleries, and constrain the part deformation relations by a tree-structured shape model. Compared with shape constraints in DPMs [25, 37], our proposed one models more complex relations with the part constellation and holds strict probabilistic properties that are beneficial to the model learning.\nOur method is also closely related to the work of Wagner et al. [3]. To cope with illumination variation, they used multiple gallery images of varying illuminations per subject. Our method also follows this strategy. However, we take a human face as a collection of parts rather than assuming it as a planar surface as in the method of Wagner et al. [3]. The piece-wise planar assumption used in our CPA model can handle much more complex facial appearance variations such as large pose and/or facial expression changes. Furthermore, we regularize the deformations of individual parts by a shape constraint in order to prevent the alignment from degenerated solutions. Such regularization term is absent in the method of Wagner et al. [3].\nIII. CPA: CONSTRAINED PART-BASED ALIGNMENT\nAssume we have face images of multiple subjects in a database, and these images have been registered into some canonical form, i.e., aligned to some template. The template we consider in this paper is composed of a collection of parts. These parts of varying sizes are spatially arranged in a proper manner so that overall they define our face template (Fig. 1-i). Suppose there are m parts in the template. Each of the m parts has its associated face region in each image in the database. We call these face regions associated with every ith part a part dictionary, which is denoted as D〈i〉 (Fig. 1-v). Let y be a test face image that is not generally in the canonical form (e.g, due to pose change or misalignment). As the name of CPA suggests,\nconstrained part-based alignment aims to align y to the face template so that different face regions of y are respectively registered with the corresponding parts of the face template. This part-based alignment can be realized by pursuing a set of transformations ν = (ν〈1〉, ν〈2〉, . . . , ν〈m〉) that act on the image domain of y by y ◦ ν〈i〉, i = 1, . . . ,m. 1\nTo pursue ν, we consider techniques used in [26, 3]. In particular, Wright et al. [26], Wagner et al. [3] assumed there exist multiple registered face images of varying illuminations per subject in the database. A well-aligned test image could be represented by a linear combination of registered training images, plus a sparse error term to compensate for data corruption or various intra-subject variations. By leveraging the error sparsity assumption, Wagner et al. [3] optimized a holistic similarity transformation by solving a `1-norm minimization problem. Extending techniques in [3] directly to part-based alignment gives the following objective\nmin x〈i〉,e〈i〉,ν i=1,2,...,m m∑ i λ〈i〉‖e〈i〉‖1\ns.t. y ◦ ν〈i〉 = D〈i〉x〈i〉 + e〈i〉, (2)\nwhere ‖·‖1 is the `1-norm that encourages the sparsity of errors {e〈i〉}mi=1. y ◦ν〈i〉 aligns the ith part of y, and {λ〈i〉 ∈ R+}mi=1 balances the alignment errors of the m parts. The matrix D〈i〉 is the ith part dictionary, whose columns represent the aligned regions of face images in the database, and x〈i〉 denotes the reconstruction coefficient.\nThe above direct extension of [3] essentially aligns the m parts independently. Unfortunately, it empirically appears to be\n1Let {(u, v)} denote image coordinates of y, and ν〈i〉 be a 2-D coordinate transformation function. Then, image transformation is realized by y ◦ ν〈i〉(u, v) = y(ν〈i〉(u, v)), and we also use y ◦ ν〈i〉 denotes the transformed image (the ith part). {ν〈i〉}mi=1 belong to a d-dimensional transformation group G, e.g. the similarity group or affine group. In this paper, we assume G to be the 2-D similarity group and parameterize the similarity transformation mapping (u, v) to (u′, v′) as (tu, tv , s, θ)T ∈ R4 that satisfies(\nu′ v′\n) = exp(s) ( cos θ − sin θ sin θ cos θ )( u v ) + ( tu tv ) . (1)\nWith a little abuse of notation, we simultaneously take ν〈i〉 as a transform function and a column vector composed of the d parameters of G (d = 4). Accordingly, ν ∈ Rd×m.\nvery unstable for facial part alignment. As shown in Fig. 2b, the parts may often drift away from their initialization to some more “flat” face regions. Indeed, alignment by optimizing ν〈i〉 in y◦ν〈i〉 is a non-convex procedure (as explained in more details in Section III-B1). Compared with an entire face, individual parts contain less visual structure and thus alignment of them is prone to meaningless local minima. To overcome this problem, we consider in this paper incorporating some sort of global information of facial structure to regularize the deformations of individual parts. In particular, we are motivated by [25] to use a tree-structured shape model to constrain the difference of transformation parameters of different parts. We write g (ν,Z) for the regularization term determined by the tree-structured shape model, where Z denotes model parameters in the form of a tuple. The tree-structured shape model is illustrated in Fig. 1 i - iii and will be elaborated in Section III-A. With consideration of the tree-structured shape constraint, we revise (2) to formulate the alignment objective of our proposed CPA model as\nmin x〈i〉,e〈i〉,ν i=1,2,...,m m∑ i λ〈i〉‖e〈i〉‖1 + ηg (ν,Z)\ns.t. y ◦ ν〈i〉 = D〈i〉x〈i〉 + e〈i〉, (3)\nwhere η ∈ R+ weights the regularization term. The choice of {λ〈i〉}mi=1 will be addressed when we learn the CPA model in Section V. As shown in Fig. 2c, our proposed CPA method can produce very stable alignment results using the same part dictionaries (Fig. 2a) as independent part alignment does. In Fig. 3, we give all the part instances of the CPA model that are fitted to real face images. We note that CPA is not designed to produce a seamless face constituted by deformed individual parts, as AAMs [18, 19] can do. Instead, it aims to establish correspondence of facial parts across pose or expression so that face images with intra-subject variations can be matched at the part level to improve face recognition."

      "text" : "Let (V, E) denote the tree, where V = {0, 1, 2, . . . ,m} is the vertex set, and E is the set of directed edges. V is composed of the nodes of the m facial parts and a root node (the node “0”)\n5\ncorresponding to the holistic face. Every ith node takes ν〈i〉 as its variables corresponding to the transformation parameters of the facial part. For the root node, we use ν〈0〉 = (0, 0, 0, 0)T when assuming the face at the global level has been registered into the canonical form, which suggests (u, v) = ν〈0〉(u, v). We consider this simplified case in the following derivation of the tree-structured shape model.\nIn order to build a model on the tree, we first associate with each edge the difference of transformation parameters of its two end nodes. We then concretize g (ν,Z) as follows. In particular, for the edge (j, i) ∈ E with parent node j and child node i, we use a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean µ〈i〉 ∈ Rd and precision Λ〈i〉 ∈ Rd×d to model the transformation difference ν〈i〉δ = ν\n〈i〉 − ν〈j〉 ∈ Rd, i.e., p(ν 〈i〉 δ |z〈i〉) = N (ν 〈i〉 δ ;µ 〈i〉,Λ〈i〉 −1\n) with z〈i〉 = (µ〈i〉,Λ〈i〉), where the Gaussian probability distribution function (PDF) is\nN (νδ;µ,Λ−1) = |Λ|1/2\n(2π)d/2 exp\n{ −1\n2 (νδ − µ)TΛ(νδ − µ)\n} .\n(4) Thus, let Z = (z〈1〉, z〈2〉, . . . , z〈m〉) be a tuple of Gaussian parameters.\nSince the definition of p(ν〈i〉δ |z〈i〉) is free of ν〈j〉 for (j, i) ∈ E , we have essentially assumed the independence between ν 〈i〉 δ and ν\n〈j〉, which suggests p(ν〈i〉|ν〈j〉, z〈i〉) = p(ν〈i〉δ |z〈i〉). Thus, we take our tree-structured shape model as a Bayesian network, whose joint probability is\np({ν〈i〉}mi=0|Z) = p(ν〈0〉) · ∏\n(j,i)∈E\np(ν〈i〉|ν〈j〉, z〈i〉)\n= m∏ i=1 p(ν 〈i〉 δ |z 〈i〉). (5)\nwhere p(ν〈0〉) ≡ 1. Finally, taking the negative logarithm of the joint probability gives the regularization term g (ν,Z) in (3) as\ng (ν,Z) =− ln p({ν〈i〉}mi=0|Z)\n= 1\n2 m∑ i=1 (ν 〈i〉 δ − µ 〈i〉)TΛ〈i〉(ν 〈i〉 δ − µ 〈i〉) + b, (6)\nwhere b = dm2 ln(2π)− 1 2 ∑m i=1 ln |Λ〈i〉| is the term independent of {ν〈i〉δ }mi=1.\nSimilar tree-structured shape model and quadratic regularization term were also used in [25] for face detection and facial landmark localization. However, they ignored the dependency among variables of the difference of transformation parameters associated with any pair of facial parts connected by an edge in the tree, which, in our case, equals to constrain Λ〈i〉 to be diagonal. Compared to [25], our shape constraint is derived from a Bayesian network formulation, which not only interprets the underlying probabilistic properties of treestructured shape models, but also enables maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the model parameters Z in the training stage of CPA. We will show later that the probabilistic prior introduced for MAP estimation prevents the CPA training from degenerate solutions when image alignment and tree-model learning are jointly formulated in an unsupervised way. This scenario is different from [25], as their tree-structured shape model is integrated in a classification problem, which is strongly supervised.\nIn fact, parametrization of AAMs and CLMs [21, 23] is also based on a joint Gaussian model, which seems to be similar to (6) derived from a tree model. To see the difference, if we concatenate the variables {ν〈i〉}mi=1 as vec(ν) and model it as a Gaussian distribution, the corresponding precision matrix, denoted as Λ ∈ Rdm×dm, will have a block sparse structure with at most d2(m+ |{(j, i) ∈ E : j 6= 0}|) non-zero entries. The assumption on the independence between ν〈i〉δ and ν\n〈j〉 for (i, j) ∈ E , which constrains Λ’s degree of freedom to be d2m, distinguishes the tree-structured shape model from a general joint Gaussian model with block diagonal precision.\nUp to now we have assumed the face at the global level has been registered into the canonical form. In practice, however, observed face images are not generally in this canonical form. Consequently, the learned tree-structured shape model for a globally canonical face will not apply directly. To mitigate this problem, we consider optimizing an additional holistic transformation σ, so that the learned tree-structured shape model can still be useful to constrain the optimization of ν. The CPA objective (3) is then rewritten as\nmin x〈i〉,e〈i〉,ν,σ i=1,2,...,m m∑ i λ〈i〉‖e〈i〉‖1 + ηg (ν,Z)\ns.t. y ◦ σ ◦ ν〈i〉 = D〈i〉x〈i〉 + e〈i〉. (7)\nWe call σ the holistic deformation, and keep calling ν〈i〉 the ith part deformation."

      "text" : "Given a learned tree-structured shape model, we present algorithms to solve our CPA objective (7) in this subsection. The main difficulty of solving (7) comes from the non-convexity of its constraints y ◦ σ ◦ ν〈i〉 = D〈i〉x〈i〉 + e〈i〉, i = 1, . . . ,m, which couples the nonlinear operations of holistic deformation σ and part deformations {ν〈i〉}mi=1 on the image domain.

These two steps are alternately applied until the algorithm converges. Note that this alternating strategy requires relatively good initialization of σ and ν, so that the learned tree-structured shape model can be effective to constrain the optimization of ν. We defer the discussion of this issue in Section III-B3 while assuming at this moment that the initial σ and ν are good enough to start the alternating process.\n1) Solving Part Deformations : Given fixed σ, we update each ν〈i〉 by a generalization of the Gauss-Newton method. More specifically, for a linear update from ν〈i〉 to ν〈i〉+∆ν〈i〉, the left-hand side of the equality constraint in (7) can be approximated by its first-order Taylor expansion at ν〈i〉, i.e., y ◦ σ ◦ (ν〈i〉 + ∆ν〈i〉) ≈ y ◦ σ ◦ ν〈i〉 + J〈i〉∆ν〈i〉, where J〈i〉 . = ∂(y ◦ σ ◦ ν〈i〉)/∂ν〈i〉 is the Jacobian with respect to (w.r.t.) ν〈i〉.

Similar iterative techniques have also been used in related works [38, 3], and showed good behaviors of convergence.\nWe solve the convex problem (8) by adapting the Augmented Lagrange Multiplier (ALM) method [39]. Let\nh(x〈i〉, e〈i〉,∆ν〈i〉) =\ny ◦ σ ◦ ν〈i〉 + J〈i〉∆ν〈i〉 −D〈i〉x〈i〉 − e〈i〉.

Instead of directly solving the constrained problem (8), ALM searches for a saddle point of (10).

Details of the approach will be presented in Section III-B2.\nwhere l is the iteration number, and {βl}l=1,2,... is an increasing sequence. ALM is proven to converge to the optimum of the original problem as βl becomes sufficient large [40].\nIt is still difficult to directly solve (11) w.r.t. all the three groups of variables: {x〈i〉}mi=1, {e〈i〉}mi=1, and ∆ν. Instead, we consider updating them in an alternating manner. And it turns out that each subproblem associated with any one group of variables has a closed form solution. More specifically, let\nSα(x) = sign(x) ·max{|x| − α, 0} (12)\nbe the soft thresholding operator. For i = 1, 2, . . . ,m, we update x〈i〉 and e〈i〉 sequentially by\nr〈i〉 ← y〈i〉 ◦ σ ◦ ν〈i〉 + (1/βl)γ〈i〉, x〈i〉 ← ( D〈i〉 T D〈i〉 )−1 D〈i〉 T (r〈i〉 + J〈i〉∆ν〈i〉 − e〈i〉),\ne〈i〉 ← Sλ〈i〉/βl(r 〈i〉 + J〈i〉∆ν〈i〉 −D〈i〉x〈i〉),\nwhere r〈i〉 is an auxiliary variable used for notation convenience only.

Here, G〈i〉 = βlJ 〈i〉TJ〈i〉, and the ith column of Q is βlJ〈i〉 T (D〈i〉x〈i〉 + e〈i〉 − r〈i〉). As g(ν + ∆ν,Z) has the form of the summation of the quadratics of {∆ν〈i〉}mi=1, (15) is a linear system. It is usually sparse due to the tree structure of the shape model. Hence, even a large number of facial parts are present, we can still simultaneously and efficiently solve {∆ν〈i〉}mi=1 with high precision. We describe the expanded form of (15) in Appendix A.\nInstead of solving (11) exactly by converged iterations of alternating optimization of {x〈i〉}mi=1, {e〈i〉}mi=1 and ∆ν, we use inexact ALM that updates the three groups of variables alternately for only once in each iteration of the ALM method. Compared to exact ALM, inexact ALM shows better practical performance in terms of optimization efficiency [39]. In summary, we solve (7) by repeatedly solving the linearized problem (8), which itself can be efficiently solved by inexact ALM.\n2) Solving Holistic Deformation : Given fixed ν in (7), the most straightforward way to optimize σ, together with {x〈i〉}mi=1 and {e〈i〉}mi=1, is to use similar techniques as in Section III-B1, i.e., linearizing the constraint in (7) w.r.t. σ and using ALM to solve the linearized problem. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach that involves the variables σ and ν only, without performing the actual image\n7 Algorithm 1 Outer loop for CPA – Default Option 1: Initialize ν and σ 2: while NOT converged do 3: ν← arg min\nν min\nx〈i〉,e〈i〉 i=1,2,...,m\n∑m i ‖e〈i〉‖1 + ηg (ν,Z) s.t.

More specifically, given fixed {x〈i〉}mi=1 and {e〈i〉}mi=1 obtained in the previous iteration of part deformations, the right-hand side of the equality constraint in (7) is also fixed. If we keep it unchanged in the update of σ, it indicates that σ ◦ ν〈i〉 for a combined deformation will not change. Denote ζ〈i〉 = σ ◦ ν〈i〉 for this fixed combined deformation, we propose to update σ and ν jointly by optimizing\nmin ν,σ\ng (ν,Z) s.t. σ ◦ ν〈i〉 = ζ〈i〉, (16)\nwhich does not involve any actual image deformation and can thus be efficiently solved. For similarity transformation considered in this paper, we present in Appendix B the associated parametrization of (16) and the optimization algorithm.\nAlgorithm 1 gives the outer loop of the algorithms presented in Sections III-B1 and III-B2 for the proposed constrained part-based alignment.\n3) Initializing Holistic and Part Deformations: Algorithms in Sections III-B1 and III-B2 require relatively good initialization of σ and ν. In practice, we rely on off-the-shelf face detectors [41, 25], which provide a rough bounding box of the face or the holistic pose and locations of facial parts [25]. We initialize σ using the bounding box provided by face detectors. If locations of facial parts are available, we also use them to initialize ν. Otherwise, we choose the initial ν as the part deformations that maximize the likelihood of the tree-structured shape model. This initialization acts as the average template of the shape constraint, which is independent of any probe image.\nThe initialization based on face detectors is generally not accurate enough for face recognition. Fortunately, in most cases they are good enough for automatic alignment. Fig. 3 present examples that illustrate the converged solutions of our CPA algorithm.\nIn some cases when face detectors give worse outputs, our CPA algorithm might take a longer time to converge or might converge to an inconvenient solution. To handle this situation, we use the holistic alignment method of Wagner et al. [3] to initialize the holistic transformation σ. Their method is not able to align non-frontal faces well due to its holistic planar surface assumption, however, it is good enough to be used as our initialization.\nIV. CPA BASED FACE RECOGNITION\nIn this section, we propose a CPA based face recognition method. Suppose there are N subjects in the gallery set, and each of them has multiple face images. Suppose these face\nimages have been aligned at the part level to form the part dictionaries, which are denoted as D〈i〉 = [D〈i〉1 , . . . , D 〈i〉 N ] for i = 1, . . . ,m. Given a probe face y, CPA suggests aligning facial parts of y to {D〈i〉}mi=1 by solving (7) for a part-based face recognition. However, similar to the situation of holistic face alignment in [3], the presence of facial parts of multiple subjects in {D〈i〉}mi=1 makes (7) have many local minima, corresponding to aligning y to the facial parts of different subjects. Instead, one can perform CPA in a subject-wise manner by optimizing\nmin x 〈i〉 s ,e 〈i〉 s ,νs,σs\ni=1,2,...,m\nm∑ i λ〈i〉‖e〈i〉s ‖1 + ηg (νs,Z)\ns.t. y ◦ σs ◦ ν〈i〉s = D〈i〉s x〈i〉s + e〈i〉s , (17)\nwhere νs = [ν 〈1〉 s , . . . , ν 〈m〉 s ], σs, and {e〈i〉s }mi=1 are variables of part deformations, holistic deformation, and the alignment residuals w.r.t. the sth subject respectively. After solving (17) for all the N subjects, for every ith part we sort the subjectwise alignment residuals {‖e〈i〉s ‖1}Ns=1 and select the top C subjects with the smallest alignment residuals. Part dictionaries of these C selected subjects are then put together to form a pruned gallery of facial parts. To make the facial parts in the pruned gallery all aligned to the ith part of y, we transform D 〈i〉 s by (σs ◦ν〈i〉s )−1 instead of transforming y by σs ◦ν〈i〉s for each selected subject s. For part-based face recognition, many existing methods such as SRC [26], LBP [42] and LDA [43] can be used at the part level, based on the pruned gallery. Final recognition can be performed by aggregating the part-level decisions using the basic plurality voting scheme.\nFor obtaining better performance, we may adapt advanced aggregating schemes, such as the kernelized plurality voting [29], and joint recognition method for multiple observations, such as the joint dynamic sparse representation [30]. Nonetheless, we consider only the basic choice to keep our work from obesity.\nAlgorithm 2 gives a summary of our proposed CPA based face recognition method. An illustrative procedure with 6 sequential modules is also shown in Fig. 4. Note that there are a few technical details in Algorithm 2 that can make a difference to recognition performance. In particular, as the selected subjects are probably inconsistent for different parts, we combine them together to substitute the selected subject set for each part (Line 13) so that the groundtruth subject has a higher possibility to be included for part recognition. Further, to control the number of overall selected subjects, we set C to the smallest integer making the pruned gallery size no less than a given parameter P (Line 13). We also adjust the ith part of y by the averaged transform of the ith part dictionaries of the selected subjects before aligning them to it (Line 15,16).\nV. MODEL LEARNING FOR CPA\nAlgorithms in the preceding sections assume that the CPA model, i.e., the tree-structured shape model and its associated part dictionaries, have been given. In this section, we present how to learn them from a training gallery of face images. Note that each part dictionary is composed of a set of registered\nAlgorithm 2 CPA based face recognition Require: Subject-wise part dictionaries { {D〈i〉s }mi=1 }N s=1\nfor the m parts and N subjects; the transformation group G; the parameter tuple Z of tree-structured shape model ; the probe image y; and, the chosen subject number P Ensure: identity(y) .

For some facial parts, e.g., those around the chin position, it is even difficult to manually annotate facial landmarks in order to align them with high precision. To realize the automatic alignment of facial parts to form the part dictionaries, we propose an approach that couples the learning of a tree-structured shape model and that of part dictionaries. Indeed, the relational constraints among deformations of different parts provided by the tree-structured shape model make alignment of part dictionaries become stable, and the deformation parameters of facial parts of the training images also give statistical evidence to learn the parameters Z in the CPA model. Learning them in a coupled way is thus a natural choice. In the following, before presenting algorithmic details of this coupled CPA model learning, we first present how to align and form the part dictionaries given the constraint from a known tree-structured shape model, which will serve as one of the alternating steps in the coupled CPA model learning algorithm."

      "heading" : "A. Learning Part Dictionaries with Constraint from Known",
      "text" : "Tree-structured Shape Model\nWe learn the part dictionaries from a training gallery of n face images, denoted as D = [d1, d2, . . . , dn]. Every kth column dk in D represents a stacked vector form of face image in the gallery. Learning part dictionaries is concerned with optimizing the d-dimensional {σk ∈ G}nk=1 for holistic deformations and {ν〈i〉k ∈ G}nk=1, i = 1, . . . ,m, for part deformations, so that after part-based alignment every ith part dictionary, denoted as D〈i〉 = [d〈i〉1 , d 〈i〉 2 , . . . , d 〈i〉 n ] with d 〈i〉 k . = dk ◦ σk ◦ ν〈i〉k , contains facial parts that have been registered into some canonical form, as shown in Fig. 5b. We observe that the registered facial parts in each part dictionary correspond to appearance of different subjects at the same facial region. These registered facial parts will ideally resemble each other if nuisances due to inter-subject, illumination3, expression, and/or pose variations can be decomposed out. In other words, the part dictionary D〈i〉 would be low-rank after decomposing out the aforementioned nuisances, which can be modeled as a sparse error matrix. This sparse and low-rank decomposition was used by Peng et al. [38] to align a batch of linearly correlated images, such as frames in a video sequence or face images of a same subject. Motivated\n3If sufficient number of illumination conditions exist, illumination variations may not be classified as a nuisance in that they can be linearly modeled for low-rankness.\n9 Left eye Left ear Right corner of mouth Jaw D E A\n(a) Independent learning by Peng et al.

Parts are initialized at dashed red boxes, and aligned in batch. The solid green boxes denote the obtained domains of the parts. D is a learned part dictionary (images cropped from the obtained domains), and A+E is its best low-rank and sparse decomposition, where A is the lowrank component, and E is the sparse error. The cropped images are normalized in terms of intensity for display convenience.\nby [38], in this paper, we leverage the very similar low-rank (matrices of part dictionaries without nuisances) and sparsity (error matrices modeling various variations) properties to align and form the part dictionaries. However, if we directly apply techniques of Peng et al. [38] to perform independent partbased alignment, the alignment process often converges to less meaningful solutions as shown in Fig. 5a. The reason is similar to that causing failure of applying the method of Wagner et al. [3] in the case of aligning parts of a probe face to the gallery set, as we explained in Section III. Instead, we constrain part-based alignment for learning part dictionaries by the tree-structured shape model. .\nTo simplify the notations, we write σ = [σ1, . . . , σm] ∈ Rd×n, and combine {ν〈i〉k } i=1,2,...,m k=1,2,...,n into a third-order tensor\nν̌ ∈ Rd×m×n. We define two operators that apply on ν̌ as T 〈i〉(ν̌) = [ ν 〈i〉 1 , ν 〈i〉 2 , . . . , ν 〈i〉 n ] ∈ Rd×n,\nTk(ν̌) = [ ν 〈1〉 k , ν 〈2〉 k , . . . , ν 〈m〉 k ] ∈ Rd×m,\nwhere T 〈i〉(·) extracts deformation parameters of the ith part of the n face images, and Tk(·) extracts those of m facial parts of the kth image. We then write D〈i〉 .= D ◦σ ◦T 〈i〉(ν̌), where “◦” applies column-wisely. With these definitions our objective for learning part dictionaries can be written as\nmin A〈i〉,E〈i〉,ν̌,σ i=1,2,...,m { m∑ i=1 ( ‖A〈i〉‖∗ + λ〈i〉‖E〈i〉‖1 )\n+ η n∑ k=1 g (Tk(ν̌),Z)\n}\ns.t. D ◦ σ ◦ T 〈i〉(ν̌) = A〈i〉 + E〈i〉, (18)\nwhere ‖ · ‖∗ is the nuclear norm, which is a convex surrogate function of matrix rank. As shown by Peng et al. [38], Candès et al. [44], the penalty parameters {λ〈i〉}mi=1 can be set as the reciprocal of the square root of E〈i〉’s row number, denoted as ω〈i〉. In this paper, we set λ〈i〉 = λ̂/ √ ω〈i〉 with the constant\nλ̂ = 1. We accordingly set η = η̂ · ∑m i=1(ω\n〈i〉)−1/2 with η̂ chosen as 0.02. To solve (18), we use a similar alternating strategy as in Section III-B. Appendix C gives details of the algorithmic procedure. It requires the initialization of ν̌, which can be obtained using the same method as in Session III-B3. Fig. 5b shows example images of learned part dictionaries by solving (18). Compared with independent part-based alignment (example results shown in Fig. 5a), the proposed alignment method with the constraint from a tree-structured model gives much more meaningful results."

      "heading" : "B. Learning the Tree-structured Shape Model Jointly with Part Dictionaries",
      "text" : "To jointly learn the tree-structured shape model and part dictionaries, it is natural to take Z in (18) as the additional variables to optimize. To solve this revised problem, one can alternately update part dictionaries using the algorithms in Appendix C, which involves the variables {A〈i〉}mi=1, {E〈i〉}mi=1, ν̌, and σ, and estimate Z by maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, which fits parameters {z〈i〉 = (µ〈i〉,Λ〈i〉)}mi=1 of Gaussian distributions with the updated {Tk(ν̌)}nk=1. Unfortunately, this approach empirically appears to give degenerate solutions corresponding to a “non-elastic” shape model, where the Gaussian distributions modeling the deformation differences of connected nodes in the tree have variances of almost zero magnitude. Fig. 6a illustrates this phenomenon, where we measure the determinant and nuclear norm4 of the covariance matrices {Λ〈i〉−1}mi=1, which are iteratively updated in an alternating optimization process.\n4For a Gaussian distribution, the determinant of its covariance matrix is the product of the standard deviations in its principle directions; and, the nuclear norm is the sum of the variances in those directions. Both of the two indicates the overall strength of its variances.\n10\nTo remedy this problem, we consider imposing a prior on Z to regularize the learning of tree-structured shape model. Denote h(Z,Φ) = − ln p(Z|Φ) with Φ as the hyperparameters. Incorporating h(Z,Φ) into (18) results in the following new objective for joint learning of Z and part dictionaries\nmin A〈i〉,E〈i〉,ν̌,σ,Z\ni=1,2,...,m\n{ m∑ i=1 ( ‖A〈i〉‖∗ + λ〈i〉‖E〈i〉‖1 )\n+η ( n∑ k=1 g (Tk(ν̌),Z) + h(Z,Φ) )}\ns.t. D ◦ σ ◦ T 〈i〉(ν̌) = A〈i〉 + E〈i〉. (19)\nLet ν〈i〉δ,k = ν 〈i〉 k − ν 〈j〉 k . Based on (5) we have\nn∑ k=1 g (Tk(ν̌),Z) = − m∑ i=1 ln p({ν〈i〉δ,k} n k=1|z〈i〉), (20)\nwhere z〈i〉 = (µ〈i〉,Λ〈i〉), and ν〈i〉δ,k is drawn from the Gaussian distribution with mean µ〈i〉 and precision Λ〈i〉. We impose prior on {µ〈i〉,Λ〈i〉} using Gaussian-Wishart distribution, which is the conjugate prior of the Gaussian distribution. Denote φ〈i〉 as the parameters of the Gaussian-Wishart prior for z〈i〉. We\nhave\nh(Z,Φ) = − m∑ i=1 ln p(z〈i〉|φ〈i〉). (21)\nwhere Φ = (φ〈1〉, φ〈2〉, . . . , φ〈m〉) is the tuple of the hyperparameters.\nGiven Φ, we solve (19) by alternately updating the following two steps:\n1) Update Z by solving minZ ∑n k=1 g (Tk(ν̌),Z) +\nh(Z,Φ); 2) Update {A〈i〉}mi=1, {E〈i〉}mi=1, ν̌,σ by solving (18).\nTo update the first step, note that by Bayes’ rule, n∑ k=1 g (Tk(ν̌),Z) + h(Z,Φ) (22)\n=− m∑ i=1 { ln p(z〈i〉|{ν〈i〉δ,k} n k=1, φ 〈i〉) + ln p({ν〈i〉δ,k} n k=1) } ,\nwhere p({ν〈i〉δ,k}nk=1) does not change with z〈i〉, and the terms of the summation have no overlap variables.

The maximum point of a Gaussian-Wishart PDF can be derived in closed form in terms of its parameters. Please refer to Appendix D for details of the Gaussian-Wishart prior and inference problems relevant to it. For the above second step, it is the problem of learning part dictionaries given a fixed Z , which is addressed in the previous subsection.\nNow, it comes the problem: how to set hyper-parameters {φ〈i〉}mi=1 properly? Since the initialization of ν̌ gives rough evidence on how the tree-structured shape model should be, we set φ〈i〉 to be consistent with the ML estimation on z〈i〉 with the initial ν̌ for i = 1, 2, . . . ,m. Thus, the trained CPA model will not deviate much from its rough estimation. Meanwhile, we also set φ〈i〉 properly to control the prior’s weight, i.e., to make the prior contribute to the MAP estimation as much as ϑn training samples, where ϑ > 0. Still, please refer to Appendix D for how to set φ with explicit physical meaning. The above learning procedure for a CPA model is summarized in Algorithm 3.\nThe above algorithms for CPA model learning require a careful initialization on σ and ν̌, which can be done either by detectors [41, 25] or by manual annotations. In particular, for every kth training image, we localize the two eye corners to determine the similarity transform σk. We then localize the facial landmarks at the centers of the facial parts5, and initialize ν〈i〉k to satisfy that the i\nth part has the pre-defined orientation and size relative to the canonical form of the entire face that is determined by σk. Although this initialization scheme is very exercisable, but it makes the part transformation differences between linked parts identical for all the n training images. Consequently, we cannot get statistical evidence to learn Z . To overcome this difficulty, we propose a heuristic initialization scheme for learning the CPA model. In particular, we start with the part dictionary learning (18) by setting η = 0, i.e., without any shape constraint, and run it for only a few (here, 5) iterations of the generalized Gaussian method composed of the repeats of the linearized problem (32) (in the Appendix C). The updated part transformations are used for the actual initialization of the CPA model learning.\nFig. 6b shows the effect of our proposed objective (19) for joint learning of the CPA model, where we investigate the covariance matrices {Λ〈i〉−1}mi=1 of the Gaussian distributions obtained in each iteration of our algorithm. Compared with\n5We always design the parts to center at the facial landmarks that are easy to annotate.\nFig. 6a, the stability of their determinant and nuclear norm values suggests that a better tree-structured shape model is obtained.\nUp to now we have assumed that the configuration of the tree, i.e., how the nodes (facial parts) are connected to form the tree, is given. To learn the configuration of a tree, Zhu and Ramanan [25] used Chow and Liu [45] algorithm for the application of facial landmark localization. Chow-Liu algorithm finds the configuration of a Bayesian network that best approximates the joint distribution of all the variables. However, for a node with children, our tree-structured shape model (as well as Zhu and Ramanan [25]’s shape model) assumes the independence between its part transformation and its part transformation differences with its children (refer to Section III-A), which is not an assumption for Chow-Liu algorithm.\nInstead, we take the tree configuration that minimizes the objective function for learning the CPA model, which can be reduced to ∑n k=1 g (Tk(ν̌),Z) + h(Z,Φ) as (22). According to (20) and (21), we can decomposed it into the summation of part-wise scores, where each term associates only with the edge linking one node and its parent. In view of this, we first link the (m+1) nodes (recall the node of “0”) into a complete directed graph, compute the score associating with each of the (m+ 1)m edges, and take the minimum spanning tree rooted at “0” to be the optimal configuration of the tree."

Each component of the mCPA is parameterized the same as that of a standard CPA model, but it may have a different number of facial parts, since some facial parts may be occluded under pose changes.\nFor an mCPA model with c components, Iι ⊆ {1, 2, . . . ,m} denotes the index set of available parts for the ιth component. Correspondingly, we also use {D〈i〉ι }mi=1 to denote the part dictionaries and Zι = {z〈1〉ι , z〈2〉ι , . . . , z〈m〉ι } to denote the parameters of tree-structured shape models. If the ιth component does not has the ith part, i.e. i /∈ Iι, D〈i〉ι and z〈i〉ι would just be treated as void notations and would not be used.\nLearning an mCPA model is based on the formulation (19) for the standard CPA model learning. The difference is that we consider learning models of the c components altogether, so that the low-rank and sparse properties of corresponding part dictionaries belonging to different components can be overall leveraged, resulting in consistent part dictionaries across the c components. Given n training face images, we write Dι for the nι face images assigned to the ιth components, σι ∈ Rd×nι for their holistic deformations, and ν̌ι ∈ Rd×m×nι for their part deformations.

Given a gallery set, ideally an mCPA model should be learned from face images of this gallery. However, in some cases the gallery does not contain non-frontal/non-neural face images to learn the corresponding component models of the mCPA. To remedy this problem, we first learn an mCPA model using a separate training set that contains face images of all the interested poses and expressions of a few subjects, and then learn the part dictionaries on the gallery set of interest while fixing the learned tree-structured shape model from that separate training set.\nWith a learned mCPA model, we use the same method as that of the standard CPA model to recognize a probe face, which requires us to select the correct component corresponding to its pose and expression before hand. In a fully automatic face recognition system, we may figure out the pose and expression by off-the-shelf methods, which, we will discuss in Section VI-D.\nVI. EXPERIMENTS\nIn this section, we present experiments to evaluate the proposed CPA method in the context of face recognition across illuminations, poses, and expressions. We used images of frontal face with neutral expression as the gallery, and face images with illumination, pose, and expression variations as the probes. We used the CMU Multi-PIE [32] and MUCT [33] datasets to conduct our experiments. The CMU Multi-PIE dataset contains face images with well controlled illumination, pose, and expression variations, and is thus intensively used for controlled experiments.\nWe designed an mCPA model whose component for frontal view and neutral expression consists of 21 facial parts of varying sizes. The basic constellation of the 21 parts is listed in Table I. For the other components, the availability of a part is determined by its visibility. The parameters used for the mCPA learning are set as λ̂ = 1, η̂ = 0.02, and ϑ = 0.25 for all the experiments reported in this section.\nWith learned mCPA models, we first evaluated our method in Section VI-A in the scenario of face recognition across pose and expression with illumination variation. In particular, we show the advantages of our CPA method over other alternatives, such as the methods of a holistic face alignment followed by a holistic or part-based face recognition. We then demonstrate in Section VI-B the effectiveness of our CPA method when using part-based face recognition strategy.

Under this setting, we compare CPA with the following three baseline alternatives.\n1) The first one manually aligns probe face images using labeled eye-corner points. After manual alignment, face recognition is conducted in a holistic manner. This alternative method is termed as “manual+holistic”. 2) The second one automatically aligns probe face images using the holistic alignment algorithm of Wagner et al. [3]. After alignment, face recognition is again conducted in a holistic manner. This alternative is termed as “holistic+holistic”. If using SRC [26] as a classifier, this alternative is essentially the same as in [3], which is\n13\nsimilar to our CPA method in the way that the gallery is pruned to a subset before being used for recognition. For a fair comparison, we also made the subset consist of P subjects for the alignment algorithm of Wagner et al.

However, after alignment, a part-based face recognition strategy is used where positions of local parts are pre-defined and fixed relative to the global face.

Face images in Multi-PIE are with 6 well controlled facial expressions, including the neutral one and 5 non-neutral ones.\nIn our experiments, we used face images of 7 different illuminations (illumination id: {0, 1, 7, 13, 14, 16, 18}) in the training and gallery sets, and those of a novel illumination (illumination id: 10) in the probe set. We used 9 subjects (subject id: {267, 272, 273, 274, 276, 277, 278, 286, 289}), who appear in all the 2nd, 3rd, 4th sessions, for training of the tree-structured shape model. The 249 subjects that appear in Session 1 (subject id: 1 ~ 249) were used for testing. Their face images in Session 1 constituted the gallery set, and those in the other sessions were the probes. Table IIa gives more specifications on the probes.\nFor experiments of face recognition across pose on the MultiPIE dataset, we used the neutral-expression face images of 5 viewpoints of yaw angles at 0◦, ±15◦, and ±30◦. For those across expression, we used face images of all the 5 available non-neutral expressions under the frontal viewpoint. We built a 10-component mCPA model as shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. Unless otherwise mentioned, these experiment settings were also used in Section VI-B, VI-C, and VI-D.\nTable IIb reports recognition results of different alternative methods on face images with varying degrees of pose changes. Compared with “manual+holistic”, “holistic+holistic” gives improved performance, which suggests that automatic alignment can improve face registration accuracy and consequently help for face recognition across pose, even in a holistic alignment manner. The performance of “holistic+parted” is unstable, which tells that simple part-based recognition without part alignment is not a feasible approach. Our CPA method significantly outperforms all these baselines. For the 4 nonfrontal viewpoints, CPA improves over the best alternative method “holistic+holistic” approximately by 15% ~ 40% in terms of recognition rate.\nAn interesting observation from Table IIb is that our CPA method can almost perfectly perform face recognition under the across-session setting of Multi-PIE, where probe face images of frontal viewpoint and neutral expression are from Sessions 2, 3 ,4 of Multi-PIE and gallery face images are from Session 1. Under this setting, our method gives 99.60% recognition rate, about 5% higher than that of “holistic+holistic”, i.e., the method in [3]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the best publicly known result under this setting. Note that the challenges of face recognition across sessions are mostly due to appearance change of human faces after a certain period of time, since illumination variation should have ideally been compensated by the multiple images of varying illuminations in the gallery. Nevertheless, our method suggests that by assuming human face as a piece-wise planar surface and using part-wise alignment, the problem of face recognition across sessions can to a large extent be overcome.\nTable IIc reports recognition results on frontal-view face images of varying expressions. Comparative performance of different alternative methods is very similar to that reported in Table IIb for face recognition across pose. Our CPA method outperforms the second best “holistic+holistic” method by 12% ~ 21% in terms of recognition rate.\n2) Evaluation on the MUCT Dataset: In practical face recognition scenarios, illumination usually show various levels of strength, and people often present near-neutral expressions. The MUCT dataset is a good simulation of such scenarios, where face images of natural expressions like frowns and minor smiles are captured under frontal lighting of 3 strength levels. We used the first 10 subjects (subject id: 0 ~ 9) of MUCT for\n14\ntraining the tree-structured shape model, and the rest 265 for testing. Frontal-view face images (labeled as “a”) were used as gallery, and those of the 4 available non-frontal viewpoints (labeled as “b,c,d,e”) were used as probes.\nTable III reports recognition results of different alternative methods. Consistent to the results reported in Section VI-A1, our CPA method outperforms all the other 3 alternatives. It in fact performs almost perfectly for all the 4 degrees of pose change."

      "text" : "The CPA method integrates part alignment with part-based recognition in a cohesive way. Part-based face recognition fuses weaker predictions from individual parts to make a stronger final decision, where a variety of methods can be used for recognition of individual parts. In this section, we investigate the varying discriminative power of individual parts, and also\nhow existing representative face recognition methods perform for part recognition in CPA. We also present experiments to show the efficacy of the proposed pruning scheme in Algorithm 2. These investigations were conducted on the MultiPIE dataset under the setting of face recognition across pose with different illumination for the gallery and probe (the setting in Section VI-A1 for producing Table IIb).\n1) Part Discriminativeness: Fig. 9 reports results obtained by recognizing each of the 21 parts that are jointly aligned by our CPA method. The recognition rates on most of the 21 parts are around 60% ~ 90% for the frontal pose and 40% ~ 80% for the ±15◦ poses. These results suggest that the discriminativeness of individual parts is good, but not strong enough for a high-accuracy recognition performance. By fusing the predictions from individual parts, a high-accuracy final recognition (“ALL” in Fig. 9) can be achieved for pose change of within −15◦ ~ +15◦ yaw angles. Even for a larger pose change of ±30◦ yaw angles, our CPA method by fusing predictions from aligned individual parts performs fairly well, while recognition rates for most of individual parts are below 20%. This again demonstrates the efficacy of our proposed CPA method that integrates part-based recognition with part alignment.\n2) Integrated with Different Recognition Methods: Recognition of aligned individual parts in CPA is realized by off-the-shelf face recognition methods. Representatives of these methods include Nearest Subspace (NS) [2], Linear Discriminate Analysis (LDA) [43], and Local Binary Pattern\n15\n(LBP) [42]. In this section, we investigate how these different choices of recognition methods perform when integrated into our CPA method. Here we compared the CPA method (“mCPA+parted”) with only “holistic+holistic”.\nFor LDA, we learned its projection matrix after pruning candidate subjects and aligning gallery images, both of which are necessary steps for “holistic+holistic” and our CPA method. For LBP, we also extracted LBP features in the same stage, i.e., after the preparation of aligned gallery subsets. All the experimental settings were the same as those used in preceding sections, expect replacing the previously used SRC with NS, LDA, or LBP. Considering the promise of LBP for one-shot face recognition where only a single image per subject is available in gallery, we also conducted experiments under this one-shot setting, where probe and gallery face images are of the same illumination. Table IVa summarizes the illumination settings of experiments reported in this section.\nRecognition rates of CPA with integration of different methods are reported in Table IVb. Table IVb tells that with any choice of NS, LDA, or LBP, our proposed CPA for part-based alignment is superior to holistic face alignment. This confirms that our proposed CPA helps face recognition by effectively aligning individual facial parts.\n3) Pruning Efficacy: Pruning scheme in Algorithm 2 certainly leads to more efficient algorithm. In this section, we are interested in investigating how it impacts the recognition performance. To this end, we modified Algorithm 2 by simply removing the pruning scheme, i.e., setting P to the subject number in the gallery. Bottom half of Table V lists recognition rates of the non-pruning CPA method together with their difference with those of the original CPA. For the non-frontal poses, noticeable performance drops occur when the pruning scheme is removed from CPA. Top half of Table V gives more evidence on the impact of the pruning scheme. Taking the non-pruning version as the baseline, we find that, for the non-frontal poses, the original CPA method corrects one time more recognition errors than it introduces, where “correcting” a recognition error means correctly recognizing an image that is falsely recognized by the baseline, and “introducing” means the opposite. Experimental results reported in Table V were obtained by using SRC for part recognition. All other settings were the same as those used in preceding sections."

MDF\nachieves good performance by learning an MDF model from a large number of 3D face shapes, while training of CPA only requires 2D face images of a few subjects.\nLike our CPA method, MDF can also be equipped with different features and classifiers for recognition. In order fairly compare the two methods, in this paper, we used the same LDA classifier for both the two methods 6. While LDA models were learned from pruned gallery in the CPA method, a single LDA model was learned from the entire gallery set in advance for the MDF method, as it does not prune gallery during recognition.\nWe compare the CPA and MDF methods using probe face images that are under different pose and illumination conditions from those of gallery images. The experiment settings were largely the same as those of face recognition across pose with different illumination used in Session VI-A1, except that:\n1) In order to be consistent with the experimental protocol in the work of Li et al. [34], we used the last 137 subjects instead of the first 229 ones in Multi-PIE for testing. More specifically, for each subject, face images in the session where he/she first appears were included in the gallery set, and those in the other sessions were in the probe set. 2) We learned the tree-structured shape model in CPA using face images of 9 other subjects (subject id: {038, 040, 041, 042, 043, 044, 046, 047, 048}), who appear in all the four sessions of Multi-PIE. 3) We set P = 10 for the pruning scheme used in Algorithm 2.\nTable VIa reports recognition rates of CPA and MDF on neutral-expression face images of varying degrees of pose change, where both fully automatic and semi-automatic (manual initialization with known pose) experiments are reported. For the case of semi-automatic experiments using LDA as the classifier, our CPA method outperforms MDF when the degrees of pose change are within ±15◦. When the degrees of pose change increase to ±30◦, CPA performs worse than MDF. The performance inconsistency between smaller and larger degrees of pose change is in fact determined by the algorithm nature of the two methods. CPA is based on 2D similarity transform of individual facial parts, whose training only requires face images of a few subjects, while a large number of 3D face shapes are necessary for learning an MDF model. By learning more generic knowledge of 3D face shapes, MDF is able to better cope with face recognition across a larger degree of pose change. However, for the range between −15 and +15 degrees, which are more often encountered in practical scenarios such as access control, and face recognition in which is also more reliable, CPA gives more accurate recognition results than MDF does. In addition, our CPA method with SRC gives similarly better results in this range of pose change.\nWe realize a fully automatic CPA method by initializing our algorithm using Viola and Jones [41]’s face detector, followed by a coarse and holistic alignment using the method of Wagner et al. [3]. For knowledge of face pose used in the mCPA model,\n6Experimental results of MDF were produced by Li et al. [34]. As SRC was not implemented in their experiment pipeline, we thank them for their kind help to run MDF with the alternative LDA classifier.\n17\nwe consider two situations where poses of probe faces are either known in advance or estimated by Zhu and Ramanan [25]’s method. The accuracy rate of Zhu et al.’s pose estimator is 96.56% under our experiment settings 7.\nTable VIb reports recognition results of fully automatic CPA. Fully automatic CPA (the last two rows) performs comparably with the semi-automatic one (the first row) when pose changes of probe face images are within ±15◦. Note that the fully automatic alignment works from coarse to fine granularity, say, sequentially uses Viola and Jones [41]’s face detector, the method of Wagner et al. [3] for a holistic alignment, and partbased alignment by CPA. The experimental results show that this coarse-to-fine strategy works well for reasonable degrees of pose change (e.g., within ±15◦). For larger degrees of pose change, performance of holistic alignment by [3] drops. Consequently, our method loses the chance of correcting its alignment failure. In addition, the last two rows of Table VIb also tells that the mCPA model performs equally well when poses of probe faces are either given or automatically estimated. This confirms the effectiveness of our proposed method for automatic part-based face alignment."

This objective is formulated as a norm minimization problem regularized by the graph likelihoods, which can be efficiently solved by an alternating optimization method.

Now, taking the Gaussian-Wishart distribution Θ(u0, κ0, V0, r0) as the prior for µ,Λ, their posterior is\np(µ,Λ−1|{νk}nk=1, u0, κ0, V0, r0) = Θ(µ,Λ|un, κn, Vn, rn),\nwhere,\nrn = r0 + n,\nκn = κ0 + n, un = κ0u0 + nµML\nκ 〈i〉 0 + n\n,\nVn = ( V 〈i〉 0 −1 + nΛ−1ML + κ0n\nκ0 + n H\n)−1 ,\nH = (µML − u0)(µML − u0)T .\nBy finding the maximum of Θ(µ,Λ−1|un, κn, Vn, rn), we obtained the MAP estimations of µ,Λ:\nΛMAP = (r0 + n− d)Vn, µMAP = un.\nInversely, taking n = 0, we can set Θ(u0, κ0, V0, r0) to be consistent with specific Gaussian distribution N (µ0,Λ−10 ), say,\nu0 = µ0, V0 = Λ −1 0 /(r0 − d).\nIn addition, note that using the prior Θ(u0, κ0, V0, r0) equals to incorporating r0 (or κ0) additional samples drawn from the Gaussian distributionN ( u0, ((r0 − d)V0)−1 ) into the existing observations, where r0 and κ0 should be normally set to the same value. In view of this, we set r0 = κ0 = ϑn, where ϑ > 0 determines the weight of the prior w.r.t. the observations.\n20"

Existing literature suggests that pixel-wise face alignment is the key to achieve high-accuracy face recognition. By assuming a human face as piece-wise planar surfaces, where each surface corresponds to a facial part, we develop in this paper a Constrained Part-based Alignment (CPA) algorithm for face recognition across pose and/or expression. Our proposed algorithm is based on a trainable CPA model, which learns appearance evidence of individual parts and a tree-structured shape configuration among different parts. Given a probe face, CPA simultaneously aligns all its parts by fitting them to the appearance evidence with consideration of the constraint from the tree-structured shape configuration. This objective is formulated as a norm minimization problem regularized by graph likelihoods. CPA can be easily integrated with many existing classifiers to perform partbased face recognition. Extensive experiments on benchmark face datasets show that CPA outperforms or is on par with existing methods for robust face recognition across pose, expression, and/or illumination changes.",
