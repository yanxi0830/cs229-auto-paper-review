      "text" : "Unsupervised learning is the task of learning structure from unlabelled examples. Informally, the main goal of unsupervised learning is to extract structure from the data in a way that will enable efficient learning from future labelled examples for potentially numerous independent tasks.\nIt is useful to recall the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning theory for supervised learning [Val84], based on Vapnik’s statistical learning theory [Vap98]. In PAC learning, the learning can access labelled examples from an unknown distribution. On the basis of these examples, the learner constructs a hypothesis that generalizes to unseen data. A concept is said to be learnable with respect to a hypothesis class if there exists an (efficient) algorithm that outputs a generalizing hypothesis with high probability after observing polynomially many examples in terms of the input representation.\nThe great achievements of PAC learning that made it successful are its generality and algorithmic applicability: PAC learning does not restrict the input domain in any way, and thus allows very general learning, without generative or distributional assumptions on the world. Another important feature is the restriction to specific hypothesis classes, without which there are simple impossibility results such as the “no free lunch” theorem. This allows comparative and improper learning of computationally-hard concepts.\nThe latter is a very important point which is often understated. Consider the example of sparse regression, which is a canonical problem in high dimensional statistics. Fitting the best sparse vector to linear prediction is an NP-hard problem [Nat95]. However, this does not prohibit improper learning, since we can use a ℓ1 convex relaxation for the sparse vectors (famously known as LASSO [Tib96]).\nUnsupervised learning, on the other hand, while extremely applicative and well-studied, has not seen such an inclusive theory. The most common approaches, such as restricted Boltzmann machines, topic models, dictionary learning, principal component analysis and metric clustering, are based almost entirely on generative assumptions about the world. This is a strong restriction which makes it very hard to analyze such approaches in scenarios for which the assumptions do not hold. A more discriminative approach is based on compression, such as the Minimum Description Length criterion. This approach gives rise to provably intractable problems and doesn’t allow improper learning.\nMain results. We start by proposing a rigorous framework for unsupervised learning which allows data-dependent, comparative learning without generative assumptions. It is general enough to encompass previous methods such as PCA, dictionary learning and topic models. Our main contribution are optimization-based relaxations and efficient algorithms that are shown to improperly probably learn previous models, specifically:\n1. We consider the classes of hypothesis known as dictionary learning. We give a more general hypothesis class which encompasses and generalizes it according to our definitions. We proceed to give novel polynomial-time algorithms for learning the broader class. These algorithms are based on new techniques in unsupervised learning, namely sum-of-squares convex relaxations.\nAs far as we know, this is the first result for efficient improper learning of dictionaries without generative assumptions. Moreover, our result handles polynomially over-complete dictionaries, while previous works [AGMM15, BKS15a] apply to at most constant factor over-completeness.\n2. We give efficient algorithms for learning a new hypothesis class which we call spectral autoencoders. We show that this class generalizes, according to our definitions, the class of PCA (principal component analysis) and its kernel extensions.\nStructure of this paper. In the following chapter we a non-generative, distribution-dependent definition for unsupervised learning which mirrors that of PAC learning for supervised learning. We then proceed to an illustrative example and show how Principal Component Analysis can be formally learned in this setting. The same section also gives a much more general class of hypothesis for unsupervised learning which we call polynomial spectral decoding, and show how they can be efficient learned in our framework using convex optimization. Finally, we get to our main contribution: a convex optimization based methodology for improper learning a wide class of hypothesis, including dictionary learning."

      "text" : "The vast majority of work on unsupervised learning, both theoretical as well as applicative, focuses on generative models. These include topic models [BNJ03], dictionary learning [DH06], Deep Boltzmann Machines and deep belief networks [Sal09] and many more. Many times these models entail non-convex optimization problems that are provably NP-hard to solve in the worst-case.\nA recent line of work in theoretical machine learning attempts to give efficient algorithms for these models with provable guarantees. Such algorithms were given for topic models [AGM12], dictionary learning [AGM13, AGMM15], mixtures of gaussians and hidden Markov models [HK13, AGH+14] and more. However, these works retain, and at times even enhance, the probabilistic generative assumptions of the underlying model. Perhaps the most widely used unsupervised learning methods are clustering algorithms such as k-means, k-medians and principal component analysis (PCA), though these lack generalization guarantees. An axiomatic approach to clustering was initiated by Kleinberg [Kle03] and pursued further in [BDA09]. A discriminative generalization-based approach for clustering was undertaken in [BBV08] within the model of similarity-based clustering.\nAnother approach from the information theory literature studies with online lossless compression. The relationship between compression and machine learning goes back to the Minimum Description Length criterion [Ris78]. More recent work in information theory gives online algorithms that attain optimal compression, mostly for finite alphabets [ADJ+13, OSZ04]. For infinite alphabets, which are the main object of study for unsupervised learning of signals such as images, there are known impossibility results [JOS05]. This connection to compression was recently further advanced, mostly in the context of textual data [PWMH13].\nIn terms of lossy compression, Rate Distortion Theory (RDT) [Ber71, CT06] is intimately related to our definitions, as a framework for finding lossy compression with minimal distortion (which would\ncorrespond to reconstruction error in our terminology). Our learnability definition can be seen of an extension of RDT to allow improper learning and generalization error bounds. Another learning framework derived from lossy compression is the information bottleneck criterion [TPB00], and its learning theoretic extensions [SST08]. The latter framework assumes an additional feedback signal, and thus is not purely unsupervised.\nThe downside of the information-theoretic approaches is that worst-case competitive compression is provably computationally hard under cryptographic assumptions. In contrast, our compression-based approach is based on learning a restriction to a specific hypothesis class, much like PAC-learning. This circumvents the impossibility results and allows for improper learning."

      "text" : "The basis constructs in an unsupervised learning setting are:\n1. Instance domain X , such as images, text documents, etc. Target space, or range, Y . We usually think of X = Rd,Y = Rk with d ≫ k. (Alternatively, Y can be all sparse vectors in a larger space. )\n2. An unknown, arbitrary distribution D on domain X .\n3. A hypothesis class of decoding and encoding pairs,\nH ⊆ {(h, g) ∈ {X 7→ Y} × {Y 7→ X}},\nwhere h is the encoding hypothesis and g is the decoding hypothesis.\n4. A loss function ℓ : H×X 7→ R>0 that measures the reconstruction error,\nℓ((g, h), x) .\nFor example, a natural choice is the ℓ2-loss ℓ((g, h), x) = ‖g(h(x))−x‖22. The rationale here is to learn structure without significantly compromising supervised learning for arbitrary future tasks. Near-perfect reconstruction is sufficient as formally proved in Appendix A.1. Without generative assumptions, it can be seen that near-perfect reconstruction is also necessary.\nFor convenience of notation, we use f as a shorthand for (h, g) ∈ H, a member of the hypothesis class H. Denote the generalization ability of an unsupervised learning algorithm with respect to a distribution D as\nloss D (f) = E x∼D [ℓ(f, x)].\nWe can now define the main object of study: unsupervised learning with respect to a given hypothesis class. The definition is parameterized by real numbers: the first is the encoding length (measured in bits) of the hypothesis class. The second is the bias, or additional error compared to the best hypothesis. Both parameters are necessary to allow improper learning.\nDefinition 2.1. We say that instance D,X is (k, γ)-C -learnable with respect to hypothesis class H if exists an algorithm that for every δ, ε > 0, after seeing m(ε, δ) = poly(1/ε, log(1/δ), d) examples, returns an encoding and decoding pair (h, g) (not necessarily from H) such that:\n1. with probability at least 1− δ, lossD((h, g)) 6 min(h,g)∈H lossD((h, g)) + ε+ γ.\n2. h(x) has an explicit representation with length at most k bits.\nFor convenience we typically encode into real numbers instead of bits. Real encoding can often (though not in the worst case) be trivially transformed to be binary with a loss of logarithmic factor.\nFollowing PAC learning theory, we can use uniform convergence to bound the generalization error of the empirical risk minimizer (ERM). Define the empirical loss for a given sample S ∼ Dm as\nloss S\n(f) = 1 m · ∑\nx∈S ℓ(f, x)\nDefine the ERM hypothesis for a given sample S ∼ Dm as\nf̂ERM = argmin f̂∈H loss S (f̂) .\nFor a hypothesis class H, a loss function ℓ and a set of m samples S ∼ Dm, define the empirical Rademacher complexity of H with respect to ℓ and S as, 1\nRS,ℓ(H) = E σ∼{±1}m [ sup f∈H 1 m ∑ x∈S σiℓ(f, x) ]\nLet the Rademacher complexity of H with respect to distribution D and loss ℓ as Rm(H) = ES∼Dm[RS,ℓ(H)]. When it’s clear from the context, we will omit the subscript ℓ.\nWe can now state and apply standard generalization error results. The proof of following theorem is almost identical to [MRT12, Theorem 3.1]. For completeness we provide a proof in Appendix A.\nTheorem 2.1. For any δ > 0, with probability 1 − δ, the generalization error of the ERM hypothesis is bounded by:\nloss D (f̂ERM ) 6 min f∈H loss D\n(f) + 6Rm(H) + √ 4 log 1δ 2m\nAn immediate corollary of the theorem is that as long as the Rademacher complexity of a hypothesis class approaches zero as the number of examples goes to infinity, it can be C learned by an inefficient algorithm that optimizes over the hypothesis class by enumeration and outputs an best hypothesis with encoding length k and bias γ = 0. Not surprisingly such optimization is often intractable and hences the main challenge is to design efficient algorithms. As we will see in later sections, we often need to trade the encoding length and bias slightly for computational efficiency.\nNotation. For every vector z ∈ Rd1 ⊗Rd2 , we can view it as a matrix of dimension d1 × d2, which is denoted as M(z). Therefore in this notation, M(u⊗ v) = uv⊤.\nLet vmax(·) : (Rd)⊗2 → Rd be the function that compute the top right-singular vector of some vector in (Rd)⊗2 viewed as a matrix. That is, for z ∈ (Rd)⊗2, then vmax(z) denotes the top rightsingular vector of M(z). We also overload the notation vmax for generalized eigenvectors of higher order tensors. For T ∈ (Rd)⊗ℓ, let vmax(T ) = argmax‖x‖61 T (x, x, . . . , x) where T (·) denotes the multi-linear form defined by tensor T .\nWe use ‖A‖ℓp→ℓq to denote the induced operator norm of A from ℓp space to ℓq space. For simplicity, we also define |A|1 = ‖A‖ℓ∞→ℓ1 = ∑ ij |Aij |, |A|∞ = ‖A‖ℓ1→ℓ∞ = maxij |Aij |. We note that ‖A‖ℓ1→ℓ1 is the max column ℓ1 norm of A, and ‖A‖ℓ1→ℓ2 is the largest column ℓ2 norm of A. 1Technically, this is the Rademacher complexity of the class of functions ℓ◦H. However, since ℓ is usually fixed for certain problem, we emphasize in the definition more the dependency on H."

      "text" : "The goal of the spectral autoencoder hypothesis class we define henceforth is to learn the representation of data that lies on a low-dimensional algebraic variety/manifolds. The linear variety, or linear manifold, defined by the roots of linear equations, is simply a linear subspace. If the data resides in a linear subspace, or close enough to it, then PCA is effective at learning its succinct representation.\nOne extension of the linear manifolds is the set of roots of low-degree polynomial equations. Formally, let k, s be integers and let c1, . . . , cds−k ∈ Rd s be a set of vectors in ds dimension, and consider the algebraic variety\nM = { x ∈ Rd : ∀i ∈ [ds − k], 〈ci, x⊗s〉 = 0 } .\nObserve that here each constraint 〈ci, x⊗s〉 is a degree-s polynomial over variables x, and when s = 1 the variety M becomes a liner subspace. Let a1, . . . , ak ∈ Rd s be a basis of the subspaces orthogonal to all of c1, . . . , cds−k, and let A ∈ Rk×d s\ncontains ai as rows. Then we have that given x ∈ M, the encoding\ny = Ax⊗s\npins down all the unknown information regarding x. In fact, for any x ∈ M, we have A⊤Ax⊗s = x⊗s and therefore x is decodable from y. The argument can also be extended to the situation when the data point is close to M (according to a metric, as we discuss later). The goal of the rest of the subsections is to learn the encoding matrix A given data points residing close to M."

The results of this sub-section are not new, and given only for illustrative purposes.\nThe class of hypothesis corresponding to PCA operates on domain X = Rd and range Y = Rk for some k < d via linear operators. In kernel PCA, the encoding linear operator applies to the s-th tensor power x⊗s of the data. That is, the encoding and decoding are parameterized by a linear operator A ∈ Rk×ds ,\nHpcak,s = { (hA, gA) : hA(x) = Ax ⊗s, , gA(y) = A †y } ,\nwhere A† denotes the pseudo-inverse of A.

For a fixed constant s > 1, the class Hpcak,s is efficiently C -learnable with encoding length k and bias γ = 0.\nThe proof of the Theorem follows from two simple components: a) finding the ERM among Hpcak,s can be efficiently solved by taking SVD of covariance matrix of the (lifted) data points. b) The Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis class is bounded by O(ds/m) for m examples. Thus by Theorem 2.1 the minimizer of ERM generalizes. The full proof is deferred to Appendix B."

      "text" : "In this section we give a much broader set of hypothesis, encompassing PCA and kernel-PCA, and show how to learn them efficiently. Throughout this section we assume that the data is normalized to Euclidean norm 1, and consider the following class of hypothesis which naturally generalizes PCA:\nDefinition 3.1 (Spectral autoencoder). We define the class Hsak,s as the following set of all hypothesis (g, h),\nHsak = { (h, g) :\nh(x) = Ax⊗s, A ∈ Rk×ds g(y) = vmax(By), B ∈ Rd s×k\n} . (3.1)\nWe note that this notion is more general than kernel PCA: suppose some (g, h) ∈ Hpcak,s has reconstruction error ε, namely, A†Ax⊗s is ε-close to x⊗s in Euclidean norm. Then by eigenvector perturbation theorem, we have that vmax(A†Ax⊗s) also reconstructs x with O(ε) error, and therefore there exists a PSCA hypothesis with O(ε) error as well . Vice versa, it’s quite possible that for every A, the reconstruction A†Ax⊗s is far away from x⊗s so that kernel PCA doesn’t apply, but with spectral decoding we can still reconstruct x from vmax(A†Ax⊗s) since the top eigenvector of A†Ax⊗s is close x.\nHere the key matter that distinguishes us from kernel PCA is in what metric x needs to be close to the manifold so that it can be reconstructed. Using PCA, the requirement is that x is in Euclidean distance close to M (which is a subspace), and using kernel PCA x⊗2 needs to be in Euclidean distance close to the null space of ci’s. However, Euclidean distances in the original space and lifted space typically are meaningless for high-dimensional data since any two data points are far away with each other in Euclidean distance. The advantage of using spectral autoencoders is that in the lifted space the geometry is measured by spectral norm distance that is much smaller than Euclidean distance (with a potential gap of d1/2). The key here is that though the dimension of lifted space is d2, the objects of our interests is the set of rank-1 tensors of the form x⊗2. Therefore, spectral norm distance is a much more effective measure of closeness since it exploits the underlying structure of the lifted data points.\nWe note that spectral autoencoders relate to vanishing component analysis [LLS+13]. When the data is close to an algebraic manifold, spectral autoencoders aim to find the (small number of) essential non-vanishing components in a noise robust manner."

Though there are technical difficulties to achieve such a general result. A natural attempt would be to optimize the loss function f(A,B) = ‖g(h(x)) − x‖2 = ‖x − vmax(BAx⊗2)‖2. Not surprisingly, function f is not a convex function with respect to A,B, and in fact it could be even non-continuous (if not ill-defined)!\nHere we make a further realizability assumption that the data distribution D admits a reasonable encoding and decoding pair with reasonable reconstruction error.\nDefinition 3.2. We say a data distribution D is (k, ε)-regularly spectral decodable if there exist A ∈ R k×d2 and B ∈ Rd2×k with ‖BA‖op 6 τ such that for x ∼ D, with probability 1, the encoding y = Ax⊗2 satisfies that M(By) = M(BAx⊗2) = xx⊤ + E , (3.2)\nwhere ‖E‖op 6 ε. Here τ > 1 is treated as a fixed constant globally. To interpret the definition, we observe that if data distribution D is (k, ε)-regularly spectrally decodable, then by equation (3.2) and Wedin’s theorem (see e.g. [Vu11] ) on the robustness of eigenvector to perturbation, M(By) has top eigenvector2 that is O(ε)-close to x itself. Therefore, definition 3.2 is a\n2Or right singular vector when M(By) is not symmetric\nsufficient condition for the spectral decoding algorithm vmax(By) to return x approximately, though it might be not necessary.

We resolve this issue by using a convex surrogate.\nOur main result concerning the learnability of the aforementioned hypothesis class is:\nTheorem 3.2. The hypothesis class Hsak,2 is C - learnable with encoding length O(τ4k4/δ4) and bias δ with respect to (k, ε)-regular distributions in polynomial time.\nOur approach towards finding an encoding and decoding matrice A,B is to optimize the objective,\nminimize f(R) = E [∥∥Rx⊗2 − x⊗2 ∥∥ op ] (3.3)\ns.t. ‖R‖S1 6 τk\nwhere ‖ · ‖S1 denotes the Schatten 1-norm3.

On the other hand, suppose one obtains some R of rank k′ such that f(R) 6 δ, then we can produce hA and gB with O(δ) reconstruction simply by choosing A ∈ Rk\n′×d2B and B ∈ Rd2×k′ such that R = AB. We use (non-smooth) Frank-Wolfe to solve objective (3.3), which in particular returns a low-rank solution. We defer the proof of Theorem 3.2 to the Appendix B.1. With a slightly stronger assumptions on the data distribution D, we can reduce the length of the code to O(k2/ε2) from O(k4/ε4). See details in Appendix C."

In contrast to previous approaches, we do not construct an actual ”dictionary”, but rather improperly learn a comparable encoding via convex relaxations.\nWe consider a different family of codes which is motivated by matrix-based unsupervised learning models such as topic-models, dictionary learning and PCA. This family is described by a matrix A ∈ R d×r which has low complexity according to a certain norm ‖ · ‖α, that is, ‖A‖α 6 cα.

Error much smaller than √ k is already meaningful.\nWe note that here r can be potentially much larger than d since by choosing a large constant p the overhead caused by r can be negligible. Since the average size of the entries is √ k, therefore we can get the bias δ smaller than average size of the entries with code length roughly ≈ k. The proof of Theorem 4.1 is deferred to Section 5.6. To demonstrate the key intuition and technique behind it, in the rest of the section we consider a simpler algorithm that achieves a weaker goal: Algorithm 1 encodes multiple examples into some codes with the matching average encoding length Õ(k2r1/p/δ2), and these examples can be decoded from the codes together with reconstruction error ε⋆ + δ. Next, we outline the analysis of Algorithm 1, and we will show later that one can reduce the problem of encoding a single examples to the problem of encoding multiple examples together.\nHere we overload the notation gA⋆(hA⋆(·)) so that gA⋆(hA⋆(X)) denotes the collection of all the gA⋆(hA⋆(xj)) where xj is the j-th column of X. Algorithm 1 assumes that there exists a convex set Q ⊂ Rd×N such that\n{ gA⋆(hA⋆(X)) : X ∈ Rd×N } ⊂ {AY : ‖A‖ℓ1→ℓ∞ 6 1, ‖Y ‖ℓ1→ℓ1 6 k} ⊂ Q . (4.4)\nThat is, Q is a convex relaxation of the group of reconstructions allowed in the class Hdict. Algorithm 1 first uses convex programming to denoise the data X into a clean version Z , which belongs to the set Q. If the set Q has low complexity, then simple random sampling of Z ∈ Q serves as a good encoding.\nThe following Lemma shows that if Q has low complexity in terms of sampling Rademacher width, then Algorithm 1 will give a good group encoding and decoding scheme. Lemma 4.2. Suppose convex Q ⊂ Rd×N satisfies condition (4.4). Then, Algorithm 1 gives a group encoding and decoding pair such that with probability 1− δ, the average reconstruction error is bounded by ε⋆ + O( √ SRWm(Q) + O( √ log(1/δ)/m) where m = ρNd and SRWm(·) is the sampling Rademacher width (defined in subsection 5.2), and the average encoding length is Õ(ρd).\nThe proofs here are technically standard: Lemma 4.2 simply follows from Lemma 5.1 and Lemma 5.2 in Section 5. Lemma 5.1 shows that the difference between Z and X is comparable to ε⋆, which is a direct consequence of the optimization over a large set Q that contains optimal reconstruction. Lemma 5.2 shows that the sampling procedure doesn’t lose too much information given a denoised version of the data is already observed, and therefore, one can reconstruct Z from Y .\nThe novelty here is to use these two steps together to denoise and achieve a short encoding. The typical bottleneck of applying convex relaxation on matrix factorization based problem (or any other problem) is the difficulty of rounding. Here instead of pursuing a rounding algorithm that output the factor A and Y , we look for a convex relaxation that preserves the intrinsic complexity of the set which enables the trivial sampling encoding. It turns out that controlling the width/complexity of the convex relaxation boils down to proving concentration inequalities with sum-of-squares (SoS) proofs, which is conceptually easier than rounding.\nTherefore, the remaining challenge is to design convex set Q that simultaneously has the following properties\n(a) is a convex relaxation in the sense of satisfying condition (4.4)\n(b) admits an efficient optimization algorithm\n(c) has low complexity (that is, sampling rademacher width Õ(N poly(k)))\nMost of the proofs need to be deferred to Section 5. We give a brief overview: In subsection 5.3 we will design a convex set Q which satisfies condition (4.4) but not efficiently solvable, and in subsection 5.4 we verify that the sampling Rademacher width is O(Nk log d). In subsection 5.5, we prove that a sumof-squares relaxation would give a set Qsosp which satisfies (a), (b) and (c) approximately. Concretely, we have the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.3. For every p > 4, let N = dc0p with a sufficiently large absolute constant c0. Then, there exists a convex set Qsosp ⊂ Rd×N (which is defined in subsection 5.5.2) such that (a) it satisfies condition 4.4; (b) The optimization (4.2) and (4.3) are solvable by semidefinite programming with run-time nO(p 2); (c) the sampling Rademacher width of Qsosp is bounded by √ SRWm(Q) 6 Õ(k2r2/pN/m).\nWe note that these three properties (with Lemma 4.2) imply that Algorithm 1 with Q = Qsosp and ρ = O(k2r2/pd−1/δ2 · log d) gives a group encoding-decoding pair with average encoding length O(k2r2/p/δ2 · log d) and bias δ.\nProof Overview of Theorem 4.3: At a very high level, the proof exploits the duality between sumof-squares relaxation and sum-of-squares proof system. Suppose w1, . . . , wd are variables, then in SoS relaxation an auxiliary variable WS is introduced for every subset S ⊂ [d] of size at most s, and valid linear constraints and psd constraint for WS’s are enforced. By convex duality, intuitively we have that if a polynomial q(x) = ∑ |S|6s αSxS can be written as a sum of squares of polynomial q(x) = ∑ j rj(x)\n2, then the corresponding linear form over XS , ∑ |S|6sαSXS is also nonnegative. Therefore, to certify\ncertain property of a linear form ∑\n|S|6s αSXS over XS , it is sufficient (and also necessary by duality) that the corresponding polynomial admit a sum-of-squares proof.\nHere using the idea above, we first prove the Rademacher width of the convex hull of reconstructions Q0 = conv {Z = AY : ‖A‖ℓ1→ℓ∞ 6 1, ‖Y ‖ℓ1→ℓ1 6 k} using a SoS proof. Then the same proof automatically applies to for the Rademacher width of the convex relaxation (which is essentially a set of statements about linear combinations of the auxiliary variables). We lose a factor of r2/p because SoS proof is not strong enough for us to establish the optimal Rademacher width of Q0."

When p = t, Γp,q,s,p(Z) is the factorable norm [TJ89, Chapter 13] of matrix Z . In the case when p = t = 2, q = ∞, s = 1, we have that Γ2,∞,1,2(·) is the γ2-norm [LMSS07] or max norm [SS05], which has been used for matrix completion.\nThe following Lemma is the main purpose of this section which shows a construction of a convex set Q that satisfies condition (4.4).\nLemma 5.3. For any q, t > 1 we have that Γ1,q,1,t(·) is a norm. As a consequence, letting Q1,∞,1,1 = {C ∈ RN×d : Γ1,∞,1,1(C) 6 √ dk}, we have that Q1,∞,1,1 is a convex set and it satisfies condition (4.4).\nTowards proving Lemma 5.3, we prove a stronger result that if p = s = 1, then Γp,q,s,t is also a norm. This result is parallel to [TJ89, Chapter 13] where the case of p = t is considered.\nTheorem 5.4. Suppose that ‖ · ‖α and ‖ · ‖β are norms defined on matrices of any dimension such that\n1. ‖[A,B]‖α 6 max{‖A‖α, ‖B‖α}\n2. ‖ · ‖β is invariant with respect to appending a row with zero entries.\nThen, Γα,β(·) is a norm.\nProof. Non-negativity: We have that Γα,β(Z) > 0 by definition as a product of two norms. Further, Γα,β(Z) = 0 if and only if ‖A‖α = 0 or ‖B‖β = 0, which is true if and only if A or B are zero, which means that Z is zero.\nAbsolute scalability: For any positive t, we have that if Z = AB and Γα,β(Z) 6 ‖A‖α‖B‖β , then tZ = (tA) · B and Γα,β(tZ) 6 t‖A‖α‖B‖β . Therefore by definition of Γα,β(Z), we get Γα,β(tZ) 6 tΓα,β(Z).\nIf we replace Z by tZ and t by 1/t we obtain the other direction, namely Γα,β(Z) 6 1/t ·Γα,β(tZ). Therefore, Γα,β(tZ) = tΓα,β(Z) for any t > 0.\nTriangle inequality: We next show that Γα,β(Z) satisfies triangle inequality, from which the result follows. Let W and Z be two matrices of the same dimension. Suppose A,C satisfy that Z = AC and\nΓα,β(Z) = ‖A‖α‖C‖β . Similarly, suppose W = BD, and Γα,β(W ) = ‖B‖α‖D‖β .

Moreover, for similar reason, ‖ · ‖β = ‖ · ‖ℓ1→ℓt satisfies the condition b) in Theorem 5.4. Hence, Lemma 5.3 is a direct consequence of Theorem 5.4.

Recently, there has been a popular line of research on applications of sum-of-squares algorithms to machine learning problems [BKS15b, BKS14, BM16, MW15, GM15, HSS15, HSSS16, MSS16].

      "text" : "We have defined a new framework for unsupervised learning which replaces generative assumptions by notions of reconstruction error and encoding length. This framework is comparative, and allows learning of particular hypothesis classes with respect to an unknown distribution by other hypothesis classes.\nWe demonstrate its usefulness by giving new polynomial time algorithms for two unsupervised hypothesis classes. First, we give new polynomial time algorithms for dictionary models in significantly broader range of parameters and assumptions. Another domain is the class of spectral encodings, for which we consider a new class of models that is shown to strictly encompass PCA and kernel-PCA. This new class is capable, in contrast to previous spectral models, learn algebraic manifolds. We give efficient learning algorithms for this class based on convex relaxations."

According to Theorem 2.1, the ERM hypothesis generalizes with rates governed by the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis class. Thus, it remains to compute the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis class for PCA.

Suppose distribution D is (k, ε)-regularly spectral decodable. Then for any δ > 0, solving convex optimization (3.3) with non-smooth Frank-Wolfe algorithm [HK12, Theorem 4.4] with k′ = O(τ4k4/δ4) steps gives a solution R̂ of rank k′ such that f(R̂) 6 δ + ε.\nLemma B.2. The Rademacher complexity of the class of function Φ ={∥∥Rx⊗2 − x⊗2 ∥∥ op : R s.t. ‖R‖S1 6 τk } with m examples is bounded from above by at most Rm(Φ) 6 2τk · √ 1/m\nHere Lemma B.2 follows from the fact that ∥∥Rx⊗2 − x⊗2 ∥∥ op is bounded above by 2τk when ‖x‖ 6 1 and ‖R‖S1 6 τk. The rest of the section focuses on the proof of Lemma B.1. Lemma B.1 basically follows from the fact that f is Lipschitz and guarantees of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm.\nProposition B.3. The objective function f(R) is convex and 1-Lipschitz. Concretely, Let ℓx(R) = ‖Rx⊗2 − x⊗2‖op. Then\n∂ℓx ∋ (u⊗ v)(x⊗2)⊤\nwhere ∂ℓx is the set of sub-gradients of ℓx with respect to R, and u, v ∈ Rd are (one pair of) top left and right singular vectors of M(Rx⊗2 − x⊗2).\nProof. This simply follows from calculating gradient with chain rule. Here we use the fact that A ∈ (Rd)⊗2, the sub-gradient of ‖A‖op contains the vector a⊗ b where a, b are the top left and right singular vectors of M(A). We can also verify by definition that (u⊗ v)(x⊗2)⊤ is a sub-gradient.\nf(R′)− f(R) > (u⊗ v)⊤(R′x⊗2 −Rx⊗2) (by convexity of ‖ · ‖op) = 〈(u⊗ v)(x⊗2)⊤, R′ −R〉 .\nNow we are ready to prove Lemma B.1.\nProof of Lemma B.1. Since D is (k, ε)-regularly decodable, we know that there exists a rank-k solution R∗ with f(R∗) 6 ε. Since ‖R∗‖op 6 τ , we have that ‖R‖S1 6 rank(R∗) · ‖R‖op 6 τk. Therefore R∗ is feasible solution for the objective (3.3) with f(R∗) 6 ε.\nBy Proposition B.3, we have that f(R) is 1-Lipschitz. Moreover, for any R,S with ‖R‖S1 6 τk, ‖S‖S1 6 τk we have that ‖R − S‖F 6 ‖R‖F + ‖S‖F 6 ‖R‖S1 + ‖S‖S1 6 2τk. Therefore the diameter of the constraint set is at most τk.\nBy [HK12, Theorem 4.4], we have that Frank-Wolfe algorithm returns solution R with f(R) − f(R∗) 6 ε+ δ in ( τk δ )4 iteration.\n6For ℓ > 1 the sample complexity is Õ(dℓ/ε2)."

      "text" : "Notations. For a matrix A, let σ1(A) > σ2(A) > .. be its singular values. Then the Schatten p-norm, denoted by ‖ · ‖Sp , for p > 1 is defined as ‖A‖Sp = ( ∑ i σi(A)\np)1/p. For even integer p, an equivalent and simple definition is that ‖A‖pSp , Tr((A\n⊤A)p/2). In this section we consider the following further relaxation of objective (3.3).\nminimize f4(R) := E [∥∥Rx⊗2 − x⊗2 ∥∥2 Sp ] (C.1)\ns.t. ‖R‖S1 6 τk\nSince ‖A‖F > ‖A‖S4 > ‖A‖S∞ = ‖A‖, this is a relaxation of the objective (3.3), and it interpolates between kernal PCA and spectral decoding. Our assumption is weaker than kernal PCA but stronger than spectral decodable.\nDefinition C.1 (Extension of definition 3.2). We say a data distribution D is (k, ε)-regularly spectral decodable with ‖ · ‖Sp norm if the error E in equation (5.10) is bounded by ‖E‖Sp 6 ε.\nWe can reduce the length of the code from O(k4) to O(k2) for any constant p.\nTheorem C.1. Suppose data distribution is (k, ε)-spectral decodable with norm ‖ · ‖Sp for p = O(1), then solving (C.1) using (usual) Frank-Wolfe algorithm gives a solution R̂ of k′ = O(k2τ2/ε2) with f(R) 6 ε + δ. As a direct consequence, we obtain encoding and decoding pair (gA, hB) ∈ Hsak′ with k′ = O(k2τ2/ε2) and reconstruction error ε+ δ.\nThe main advantage of using relaxed objective is its smoothness. This allows us to optimize over the Schatten 1-norm constraint set much faster using usual Frank-Wolfe algorithm. Therefore the key here is to establish the smoothness of the objective function. Theorem C.1 follows from the following proposition straightforwardly.\nProposition C.2. Objective function fp (equation (C.1)) is convex and O(p)-smooth.\nProof. Since ‖·‖Sp is convex and composition of convex function with linear function gives convex function. Therefore,\n∥∥Rx⊗2 − x⊗2 ∥∥ Sp\nis a convex function. The square of an non-negative convex function is also convex, and therefore we proved that fp is convex. We prove the smoothness by first showing that ‖A‖2Sp is a smooth function with respect to A. We use the definition ‖A‖ p Sp\n= Tr((A⊤A)p/2). Let E be a small matrix that goes to 0, we have\n‖A+ E‖pSp = Tr((A ⊤A)p/2) + T1 + T2 + o(‖E‖2F ) (C.2)\nwhere T1, T2 denote the first order term and second order term respectively. Let U = A⊤E + E⊤A and V = A⊤A. We note that T2 is a sum of the traces of matrices like UV UV Up/2−2. By Lieb-Thirring inequality, we have that all these term can be bounded by Tr(Up/2−2V 2) = 2Tr((A⊤A)p/2−2A⊤EE⊤A) + 2Tr((A⊤A)p/2−2A⊤EA⊤E⊤). For the first term, we have that\nTr((A⊤A)p/2−2A⊤EE⊤A) 6 ‖(AA⊤)(p−2)/4E‖2 6 ‖(AA⊤)(p−2)/4‖2S∞‖E‖2F = ‖A‖ p−2 S∞ ‖E‖2F\nwhere in the first inequality we use Cauchy-Schwarz. Then for the second term we have\nTr((A⊤A)p/2−2A⊤EA⊤E⊤) 6 ‖(A⊤A)(p−2)/4E‖F ‖AE(A⊤A)(p−4)/4‖F 6 ‖(A⊤A)(p−2)/4E‖2F (by Lieb-Thirring inequality) 6 ‖(AA⊤)(p−2)/4‖2‖E‖2F = ‖A‖p−2S∞ ‖E‖ 2 F (C.3)\nTherefore, finally we got\nT2 6 O(p 2) · ‖A‖p−2Sp−2‖E‖ 2 F (C.4)\nTherefore, we complete the proof by having,\n‖A+ E‖2Sp 6 (‖A‖ p Sp + T1 + T2 + o(‖E‖2))2/p 6 ‖A‖Sp(1 + T ′1 + 2\np‖A‖p/2Sp T2) + o(‖E‖2)\n(by (1 + x)p/2 6 1 + 2x/p+ o(‖x‖2)) 6 ‖A‖2Sp + T ′′1 +O(p)‖E‖2 + o(‖E‖2) (by equation (C.3))"

First, it does not assume any generative model and based on a worst-case performance metric. Second, it is comparative, namely performance is measured with respect to a given hypothesis class. This allows to avoid known computational hardness results and improper algorithms based on convex relaxations. We show how several families of unsupervised learning models, which were previously only analyzed under probabilistic assumptions and are otherwise provably intractable, can be efficiently learned in our framework by convex optimization.",
