      "heading" : "1.1 Statistical vs. computational sample-size",
      "text" : "Modern machine learning and statistical inference problems are often high dimensional, and it is highly desirable to solve them using far less samples than the ambient dimension. Luckily, we often know, or assume, some underlying structure of the objects sought, which allows such savings in principle. Typical such assumption is that the number of real degrees of freedom is far smaller than the dimension; examples include sparsity constraints for vectors, and low rank for matrices and tensors. The main difficulty that occurs in nearly all these problems is that while information\n∗Supported in part by Simons Award for Graduate Students in Theoretical Computer Science †Supported in part by NSF grant CCF-1412958\ntheoretically the sought answer is present (with high probability) in a small number of samples, actually computing (or even approximating) it from these many samples is a computationally hard problem. It is often expressed as a non-convex optimization program which is NP-hard in the worst case, and seemingly hard even on random instances.\nGiven this state of affairs, relaxed formulations of such non-convex programs were proposed, which can be solved efficiently, but sometimes to achieve accurate results seem to require far more samples than existential bounds provide. This phenomenon has been coined the “statistical versus computational trade-off” by Chandrasekaran and Jordan [CJ13], who motivate and formalize one framework to study it in which efficient algorithms come from the Sum-of-Squares family of convex relaxations (which we shall presently discuss). They further give a detailed study of this trade-off for the basic de-noising problem [Joh02, Don95, DJ98] in various settings (some exhibiting the trade-off and others that do not). This trade-off was observed in other practical machine learning problems, in particular for the Sparse PCA problem that will be our focus, by Berthet and Rigollet [BR13a].\nAs it turns out, the study of the same phenomenon was proposed even earlier in computational complexity, primarily from theoretical motivations. Decatur, Goldreich and Ron [DGR97] initiate the study of “computational sample complexity” to study statistical versus computation tradeoffs in sample-size. In their framework efficient algorithms are arbitrary polynomial time ones, not restricted to any particular structure like convex relaxations. They point out for example that in the distribution-free PAC-learning framework of Vapnik-Chervonenkis and Valiant, there is often no such trade-off. The reason is that the number of samples is essentially determined (up to logarithmic factors, which we will mostly ignore here) by the VC-dimension of the given concept class learned, and moreover, an “Occam algorithm” (computing any consistent hypothesis) suffices for classification from these many samples. So, in the many cases where efficiently finding a hypothesis consistent with the data is possible, enough samples to learn are enough to do so efficiently! This paper also provide examples where this is not the case in PAC learning, and then turns to an extensive study of possible trade-offs for learning various concept classes under the uniform distribution. This direction was further developed by Servedio [Ser00].\nThe fast growth of Big Data research, the variety of problems successfully attacked by various heuristics and the attempts to find efficient algorithms with provable guarantees is a growing area of interaction between statisticians and machine learning researchers on the one hand, and optimization and computer scientists on the other. The trade-offs between sample size and computational complexity, which seems to be present for many such problems, reflects a curious “conflict” between these fields, as in the first more data is good news, as it allows more accurate inference and prediction, whereas in the second it is bad news, as a larger input size is a source of increased complexity and inefficiency. More importantly, understanding this phenomenon can serve as a guide to the design of better algorithms from both a statistical and computational viewpoints, especially for problems in which data acquisition itself is costly, and not just computation. A basic question is thus for which problems is such trade-off inherent, and to establish the limits of what is achievable by efficient methods.\nEstablishing a trade-off has two parts. One has to prove an existential, information theoretic upper bound on the number of samples needed when efficiency is not an issue, and then prove a computational lower bound on the number of samples for the class of efficient algorithms at hand. Needless to say, it is desirable that the lower bounds hold for as wide a class of algorithms as possible, and that it will match the best known upper bound achieved by algorithms from this class. The most general one, the computational complexity framework of [DGR97, Ser00] allows all polynomial-time\nalgorithms. Here one cannot hope for unconditional lower bounds, and so existing lower bounds rely on computational assumptions, e.g.”cryptographic assumptions”, e.g. that factoring integers has no polynomial time algorithm, or other average case assumptions. For example, hardness of refuting random 3CNF was used for establishing the sample-computational tradeoff for learning halfspaces [DLS13], and hardness of finding planted clique in random graphs was used for tradeoff in sparse PCA [BR13a, GMZ14]. On the other hand, in frameworks such as [CJ13], where the class of efficient algorithms is more restricted (e.g. a family of convex relaxations), one can hope to prove unconditional lower bounds, which are called “integrality gaps” in the optimization and algorithms literature. Our main result is of this nature, adding to the small number of such lower bounds for machine learning problems.\nWe now turn to describe and motivate SoS convex relaxations algorithms, and then the Sparse PCA problem."

      "text" : "Sum-of-Squares algorithms (sometimes called the Lasserre hierarchy) encompasses perhaps the strongest known algorithmic technique for a diverse set of optimization problems. It is a family of convex relaxations introduced independently around the year 2000 by Lasserre [Las01], Parillo [Par00], and in the (equivalent) context of proof systems by Grigoriev [Gri01b]. These papers followed better and better understanding in real algebraic geometry [Art27, Kri64, Ste74, Sho87, Sch91, Put93, Nes00]of David Hilbert’s famous 17th problem on certifying the non-negativity of a polynomial by writing it as a sum of squares (which explains the name of this method). We only briefly describe this important class of algorithms; far more can be found in the book [Las15] and the excellent extensive survey [Lau09].\nThe SoS method provides a principled way of adding constraints to a linear or convex program in a way that obtains tighter and tighter convex sets containing all solutions of the original problem. This family of algorithms is parametrized by their degree d (sometimes called the number of rounds); as d gets larger, the approximation becomes better, but the running time becomes slower, specifically nO(d). Thus in practice one hopes that small degree (ideally constant) would provide sufficiently good approximation, so that the algorithm would run in polynomial time. This method extends the standard semi-definite relaxation (SDP, sometimes called spectral), that is captured already by degree-2 SoS algorithms. Moreover, it is more powerful than two earlier families of relaxations: the Sherali-Adams [SA90] and Lovász-Scrijver [LS91] hierarchies.\nThe introduction of these algorithms has made a huge splash in the optimization community, and numerous applications of it to problems in diverse fields were found that greatly improve solution quality and time performance over all past methods. For large classes of problems they are considered the strongest algorithmic technique known. Relevant to us is the very recent growing set of applications of constant-degree SoS algorithms to machine learning problems, such as [BKS15, BKS14, BM15]. The survey [BS14] contains some of these exciting developments. Section 2.3 contains some self-contained material about the general framework SoS algorithms as well.\nGiven their power, it was natural to consider proving lower bounds on what SoS algorithms can do. There has been an impressive progress on SoS degree lower bounds (via beautiful techniques) for a variety of combinatorial optimization problems [Gri01a, Gri01b, Sch08, MPW15]. However, for machine learning problems relatively few such lower bounds (above SDP level) are known [BM15, WGL15] and follow via reductions to the above bounds. So it is interesting to enrich the set of techniques for proving such limits on the power of SoS for ML. The lower bound we prove indeed\nseem to follow a different route than previous such proofs."

      "text" : "Sparse principal component analysis, the version of the classical PCA problem which assumes that the direction of variance of the data has a sparse structure, is by now a central problem of high-diminsional statistical analysis. In this paper we focus on the single-spiked covariance model introduced by Johnstone [Joh01]. One observes n samples from p-dimensional Gaussian distribution with covariance\nΣ = λvvT + I (1.1)\nwhere (the planted vector) v is assumed to be a unit-norm sparse vector with at most k non-zero entries, and λ > 0 represents the strength of the signal. The task is to find (or estimate) the sparse vector v. More general versions of the problem allow several sparse directions/components and general covariance matrix [Ma13, VL13]. Sparse PCA and its variants have a wide variety of applications ranging from signal processing to biology: see, e.g., [ABN+99, JL09, Che11, JOB10].\nThe hardness of Sparse PCA, at least in the worst case, can be seen through its connection to the (NP-hard) Clique problem in graphs. Note that if Σ is a {0, 1} adjacency matrix of a graph (with 1’s on the diagonal), then it has a k-sparse eigenvector v with eigenvalue k if and only if the graph has a k-clique. This connection between these two problems is actually deeper, and will appear again below, for our real, average case version above.\nFrom a theoretical point of view, Sparse PCA is one of the simplest examples where we observe a gap between the number of samples needed information theoretically and the number of samples needed for a polynomial time estimator: It has been well understood [VL12, PJ12, BR13b] that information theoretically, given n = O(k log p) samples1, one can estimate v up to constant error (in euclidean norm), using a non-convex (therefore not polynomial time) optimization algorithm. On the other hand, all the existing provable polynomial time algorithms [JL09, AW09, VL13, DM14], which use either diagonal thresholding (for the single spiked model) or semidefinite programming (for general covariance), first introduced for this problem in [dGJL07], need at least quadratically many samples to solve the problem, namely n = O(k2). Moreover, Krauthgamer, Nadler and Vilenchik [KNV15] and Berthet and Rigollet [BR13b] have shown that for semi-definite programs (SDP) this bound is tight. Specifically, the natural SDP cannot even solve the detection problem: to distinguish the data in equation 1.1 above from the null hypothesis in which no sparse vector is planted, namely the n samples are drawn from the Gaussian distribution with covariance matrix I.\nRecall that the natural SDP for this problem (and many others) is just the first level of the SoS hierarchy, namely degree-2. Given the importance of the Sparse PCA, it is an intriguing question whether one can solve it efficiently with far fewer samples by allowing degree-d SoS algorithms with larger d. A very interesting conditional negative answer was suggested by Berthet and Rigollet [BR13b]. They gave an efficient reduction from Planted Clique2 problem to Sparse PCA, which shows in particular that degree-d SoS algorithms for Sparse PCA will imply similar ones for Planted Clique. Gao, Ma and Zhou [GMZ14] strengthen the result by establishing the hardness of the Gaussian single-spiked covariance model, which is an interesting subset3 of models considered by [BR13a]. These are useful as nontrivial constant-degree SoS lower bounds for\n1We treat λ as a constant so that we omit the dependence on it for simplicity throughout the introduction section 2An average case version of the Clique problem in which the input is a random graph in which a much larger than\nexpected clique is planted. 3Note that lower bounds for special cases are stronger than those for general cases\nPlanted Clique were recently proved by [MPW15, DM15] (see there for the precise description, history and motivation for Planted Clique). As [BR13b, GMZ14] argue, strong yet believed bounds, if true, would imply that the quadratic gap is tight for any constant d. Before the submission of this paper, the known lower bounds above for planted clique were not strong enough yet to yield any lower bound for Sparse PCA beyond the minimax sample complexity. We also note that the recent progress [RS15, HKP15] that show the tight lower bounds for planted clique, together with the reductions of [BR13a, GMZ14], also imply the tight lower bounds for Sparse PCA, as shown in this paper."

      "text" : "We give a direct, unconditional lower bound proof for computing Sparse PCA using degree-4 SoS algorithms, showing that they too require n = Ω̃(k2) samples to solve the detection problem (Theorem 3.1), which is tight up to polylogarithmic factors when the strength of the signal λ is a constant. Indeed the theorem gives a lower bound for every strength λ, which becomes weaker as λ gets larger. Our proof proceeds by constructing the necessary pseudo-moments for the SoS program that achieve too high an objective value (in the jargon of optimization, we prove an “integrality gap” for these programs). As usual in such proofs, there is tension between having the pseudo-moments satisfy the constraints of the program and keeping them positive semidefinite (PSD). Differing from past lower bound proofs, we construct two different PSD moments, each approximately satisfying one sets of constraints in the program and is negligible on the rest. Thus, their sum give PSD moments which approximately satisfy all constraints. We then perturb these moments to satisfy constraints exactly, and show that with high probability over the random data, this perturbation leaves the moments PSD.\nWe note several features of our lower bound proof which makes the result particularly strong and general. First, it applies not only for the Gaussian distribution, but also for Bernoulli and other distributions. Indeed, we give a set of natural (pseudorandomness) conditions on the sampled data vectors under which the SoS algorithm is “fooled”, and show that these conditions are satisfied with high probability under many similar distributions (possessing strong concentration of measure). Next, our lower bound holds even if the hidden sparse vector is discrete, namely its entries come from the set {0,± 1√\nk }. We also extend the lower bound for the detection problem to apply also\nto the estimation problem, in the regime when the ambient dimension is linear in the number of samples, namely n ≤ p ≤ Bn for constant B (see Theorem 3.2). Organization: Section 2 provides more backgrounds of sparse PCA and SoS algorithms. Then we state our main results in Section 3. In Section 4, we design the pseudo-moments and state their properties and then in Section 5 we prove our main theorems using these moments. Section 6 and 7 contain the analysis of the moments. Section 8 lists the tools that we heavily used for proving concentration inequalities in the analysis. Finally we conclude with a discussion of further directions of study in Section 9."

In this model, the task is to recover a single sparse vector from noisy samples as follows. The “hidden data” is an unknown k-sparse vector v ∈ Rp with |v|0 = k and ‖v‖ = 1. To make the task easier (and so the lower bound stronger), we even assume that v has discrete entries, namely that vi ∈ {0,± 1√k} for all i ∈ [p]. We observe n noisy samples X1, . . . ,Xn ∈ Rp that are generated as follows. Each is independently drawn as\nXj = √ λgjv + ξj (2.1)\nfrom a distribution which generalizes both Gaussian and Bernoulli noise to v. Namely, the gj ’s are i.i.d real random variable with mean 0 and variance 1, and ξj ’s are i.i.d random vectors which have independent entries with mean zero and variance 1. Therefore under this model, the covariance of Xi is equal to λvvT + I. Moreover, we assume that gj and entries of ξj are sub-gaussian5 with variance proxy O(1).

      "text" : "Here we will only briefly introduce the basic ideas of Sum-of-Squares (Lasserre) relaxation that will be used for this paper. We refer readers to the extensive [Las15, Lau09, BS14] for detailed discussions of sum of squares algorithms and proofs and their applications to algorithm design.\nLet R[x]d denote the set of all real polynomials of degree at most d with n variables x1, . . . , xn. We start by defining the notion of pseudo-moment (sometimes called pseudo-expectation ). The intuition is that these pseudo-moments behave like the actual first d moments of a real probability distribution.\nDefinition 2.2 (pseudo-moment). A degree-d pseudo-moments M is a linear operator that maps R[x]d to R and satisfies M(1) = 1 and M(p\n2(x)) ≥ 0 for all real polynomials p(x) of degree at most d/2.\nFor a mutli-set S ⊂ [n], we use xS to denote the monomial ∏i∈S xi. SinceM is a linear operator, it can be clearly described by all the values of M on the monomial of degree d, that is, all the values of M(xS) for mutli-set S of size at most d uniquely determines M . Moreover, the nonnegativity constraint M(p(x)2) ≥ 0 is equivalent to the positive semidefiniteness of the matrix-form (as defined below), and therefore the set of all pseudo-moments is convex.\nDefinition 2.3 (matrix-form). For an even integer d and any degree-d pseudo-moments M , we define the matrix-form of M as the trivial way of viewing all the values of M on monomials as a matrix: we use mat(M) to denote the matrix that is indexed by multi-subset S of [n] with size at most d/2, and mat(M)S,T = M(x SxT ).\nGiven polynomials p(x) and q1(x), . . . , qm(x) of degree at most d, and a polynomial program,\nMaximize p(x) (2.5)\nSubject to qi(x) = 0,∀i ∈ [m]\nWe can write a sum of squares based relaxation in the following way: Instead of searching over x ∈ Rn, we search over all the possible “pseudo-moments” M of a hypothetical distribution over solutions x, that satisfy the constraints above. The key of the relaxation is to consider only moments up to degree d. Concretely, we have the following semidefinite program in roughly nd variables.\nVariables M(xS) ∀S : |S| ≤ d Maximize M(p(x)) (2.6)\nSubject to M(qi(x)x K) = 0 ∀i,K : |K|+ deg(qi) ≤ d\nmat(M) 0\nNote that (2.6) is a valid relaxation because for any solution x∗ of (2.5), if we define M(xS) to be M(xS) = xS∗ , then M satisfies all the constraints and the objective value is p(x∗). Therefore it is guaranteed that the optimal value of (2.6) is always larger than that of (2.5).\nFinally, the key point is that this program can be solved efficiently, in polynomial time in its size, namely in time nO(d). As d grows, the constraints added make the “pseudo-distribution” defined by the moments closer and closer to an actual distribution, thus providing a tighter relaxation, at the cost of a larger running time to solve it.\nIn the next section we apply this relaxation to the Sparse PCA problem and state our results."

Note that constraint (3.3) implies other natural constraints that one may add to the program in order to make it stronger: for example, the upper bound on each entry xi, the lower bound on the non-zero entries of xi, and the constraint ‖x‖4 ≥ k which has been used as a surrogate for k-sparse vectors in [BKS14, BKS15].

For detection, we pick the natural threshold (1 + 12λ)k from the statistically optimal detection algorithm of Section 2.2. Our lower bound of the objective under H0 is actually a large constant multiple of λk, so we could have taken a higher threshold. To analyze even higher ones would require analyzing the behavior of SoS4 under the (planted) alternative distribution Hv. For estimation we output the maximizer M ∗ 2 of the objective function, and prove that it is not too correlated with the rank-1 matrix vvT in the planted distribution Hv. This suggest, but does not prove, that the leading eigenvector of M ∗ 2 (which is a natural estimator for v) is not too correlated with v. We finally note that Rigollet’s efficient reduction from detection to estimation is not in the SoS framework, and so our detection lower bound does not automatically imply the one for estimation."

When the data X is drawn from the null hypothesis H0, then with high probability (1−p−10), the objective value of degree-4 sum of squares relaxation SoS4(Σ̂) is at least 10λk. Consequently, Algorithm 1 can’t solve the detection problem.\nTo parse the theorem and to understand its consequence, consider first the case when λ is a constant (which is also arguably the most interesting regime). Then the theorem says that when we have only n ≪ k2 samples, degree-4 SoS relaxation SoS4 still overfits heavily to the randomness of the data X under the null hypothesis H0. Therefore, using SoS4(Σ̂) > (1 + λ 2 )k (or even 10λk) as a threshold will fail with high probability to distinguish H0 and Hv. We note that for constant λ our result is essentially tight in terms of the dependencies between n, k, p.

Note that while our Theorem proves that n = Ω̃(k2) samples is necessary for efficient algorithms to get even constant estimation error, it is known [YZ13, Ma13, WLL14] that slightly more samples, n = Õ(k2), can already achieve in polynomial time a much smaller (and optimal) estimation error, namely O( √ (k log p)/n)."

      "text" : "We start with a sketch of our approach to the design of the moments M at a very high level, highlighting aspects of their design which are different than in previous lower bounds. First, there\nare some natural choices to make. We define the degree-2 moments M̃ from the input as the empirical covariance matrix, as was done in the proof of the SDP lower bound. This already gives a large objective value (see Lemma 4.2). We also define taking odd moments (degree 1 and 3) to be 0.\nThe difficult part is designing the degree-4 moments consistently with the constraints and M̃ . We do this in stages, first approximating the constraints (indeed even M̃ only approximately satisfies, in a way we will specify in Section 4.1, constraints (C1) and (C2)) and later in Section 4.2 correcting the moments to satisfy the constraints precisely. Moreover, we separately use different 4-moments for different constraints and then combine them, as follows. We define two different degree-4 PSD moments P and Q such that (with high probability) P almost satisfies constraints (C3), (C5) and (C6), and negligible for constraint (C4) (see Lemma 4.4), whereas Q almost satisfies constraints (C5), (C4) and (C6), and negligible for (C3) (Lemma 4.5). Therefore taking the sum P + Q will almost satisfy all the constraints (Lemma 4.6), which completes the design of the approximate moments. Finally we “locally” adjust P +Q so that the resulting moments M exactly satisfy all the constraints (Theorem 4.7), and remain PSD with high probability.\nAll moments will be defined from the data matrix X, to which we first apply a simple preprocessing step: we scale all its rows to have square norm n (around which they are concentrated). We abuse notation and call the scaled matrix X as well. Note that when the noise model in the null hypothesis H0 is Bernoulli, namely the entries of X are chosen as unbiased independent ±1 variables, the rows are automatically scaled, which motivates our abuse of notation. We suggest that the reader thinks of this distribution, even though the proof works for a much wider class of distributions.\nThe properties above of our moments will be proved under the assumption that the scaled matrix X satisfies the “pseudo-randomness” condition below. This set-up allows us to encapsulate what we really need the data to satisfy, and thus prove our lower bound not only for Gaussian or Bernoulli noise, but actually for a larger family containing both. Namely, we later prove in Section 7, via a series of concentration inequalities, that when data is drawn from null hypothesis H0, its scaling X satisfies the pseudorandomness condition with very high probability under all these noise models. Note that this condition is actually a sequence of statements about deviation from the mean of various polynomials in the data - these will become natural once we define our moments.\nCondition 4.1 (Pseudorandomness Condition). Our constructions of the moments will only require\nthe following pseudorandom conditions about the (scaled) data matrix X,\n‖Xi‖2 = n ∀i ∈ [p] (P1) |〈Xi,Xj〉| ≤ Õ(\n√ n) ∀i 6= j (P2)∣∣∣∣∣∣ ∑ ℓ∈[p]\\i∪j 〈Xi,Xℓ〉3〈Xj ,Xℓ〉 ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ Õ(n1.5p), ∀i 6= j (P3) ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ∑ ℓ∈[p] 〈Xi,Xℓ〉〈Xj ,Xℓ〉〈Xs,Xℓ〉〈Xt,Xℓ〉 ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ Õ(n2p.5) ∀ disctinct i, j, s, t (P4) ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ∑ i∈[p] 〈Xi,Xs〉〈Xi,Xt〉 ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ Õ(n.5p) ∀ distinct s, t (P5)\n∑\ni,ℓ∈[p] 〈Xi,Xℓ〉2〈Xs,Xℓ〉〈Xt,Xℓ〉 ≤ Õ(n1.5p2), ∀ distinct s, t (P6) ‖XXT ‖2F ≥ (1− o(1))np2 (P7)"

      "text" : "In this section, we design a pseudo-moments M̃ that approximately satisfies the all the constraints. Then in the next subsection we will locally adjust it to obtain one that exactly satisfies all of the constraints.\nWe begin by designing a (partial) degree-2 moments that gives large objective value, which will be later used for the degree-4 moments. The design is essentially the same as [KNV15] though we only work with null hypothesis for now. For the purpose of this section, we suggest the reader to think of X as having uniform {±1} entires for simplicity, though as we will see later, we assume that X satisfies certain pseudorandomness condition which holds if X is chosen from a variety of natural stochastic models (with row normalization). We define M̃ : R[x]2 → R as follows:\nM̃(xixj) , γkn\np2 Σ̂ij =\nγk p2 〈Xi,Xj〉 ∀i, j ∈ [p] (4.1)\nM̃(xi) , 0 ∀i ∈ [p] M̃(1) , 1\nwhere γ is a constant that to be tuned later according to the signal strength λ. Note that by design mat(M̃ ) is a PSD matrix. We can check straightforwardly that M̃ satisfies constraint (C2) and gives a large objective value (Obj). Lemma 4.2. There exists constant C such that for p ≥ γn and k ≥ Cγ√n log p, supposeX satisfies Condition 4.1, then M̃ is a valid degree-2 pseudo-moments and satisfies the sparsity constraint (C2).\n∑\ni,j∈[p] |M̃ (xixj)| ≤ k2/2 (4.2)\nand has objective value ∑\ni,j∈[p] M̃(xixj)Σ̂ij ≥ (1− o(1))γk\nMoreover, we also have M̃(x2i ) = γkn p2 ≤ k p , and M̃ (xixj) ≤ Õ(\nγk √ n\np2 ).\nProof. The proof follows simple calculation and concentration inequality. Since ‖Xi‖2 = n for all i and with high probability over the randomness of X, for all i 6= j, |〈Xi,Xj〉| ≤ Õ( √ n), we obtain that M̃(x2i ) = γkn p2 ≤ kp , and M̃(xixj) ≤ Õ( γk √ n p2 ). Then to verify equation (4.2), we have\n∑\ni,j∈[p] |M̃(xixj)| ≤\n∑\ni\n|M(x2i )|+ ∑\ni 6=j |M(xixj)| ≤ k + Õ(γk\n√ n) ≤ k2/2\nwhen k ≫ γ√n. Finally, we can verify the objective value is large ∑\ni,j∈[p] M̃(xixj)Σ̂ij =\nγk\np2n\n∑\ni,j\n〈Xi,Xj〉2 = γk\np2n ‖XXT ‖2F ≥ (1− o(1))γk\nwhere we use the fact that ‖XXT ‖2F ≥ (1− o(1))p2n (see property (P7) in Condition 4.1).\nNote that M̃ doesn’t satisfies constraint (C1) exactly. However, we could simply fix this by defining M ′(xixj) = M̃(xixj) for all i 6= j and M ′(x2i ) = k/p. However, note that we will use a perturbation of M ′ in our final design in Section 4.2 so that it is consistent with the degree-4 moments. Corollary 4.3. There exists absolute constant C such that for p ≥ γn and k ≥ Cγ√n log p, there exists a degree-2 pseudo-moments M ′ that satisfies constraints (C1), (C2) and give objective value at least (1− o(1))γk.\nNow we define a degree-4 pseudo-moment that approximately satisfies all the constraints in SoS4(Σ̂) and give a large objective value. We keep the current (approximate) design M̃ for degree2 moments, since the degree-2 moments defined in previous section seems to be nearly optimal and enjoys many good properties. Then we define M̃(S) = 0 for any multi-set S of size 3, because apparently degree-3 moments don’t play any role the semidefinite relaxation.\nThe main difficulty is to define M̃(S) for S of size 4. Here we have three constraints (C3), (C4), and (C5), and the PSDness constraint that implicitly compete with each other. We took\nthe following approach. We let M̃ be a sum of two matrices matrix P and Q. We ensure that P “almost” (as will be specified later) satisfies (C3) and (C5), and is negligible for constraints C4. In turn Q is negligible for constraints (C3) and “almost” satisfies constraint (C4) and (C5). Therefore P +Q will “almost” satisfies constraints (C3)) and (C4)), and satisfy the sparsity constraint (C5). Moreover, P and Q will be PSD by definition. Concretely, we define\nM̃(i, j, s, t) , P (i, j, s, t) +Q(i, j, s, t)\nwhere P and Q are defined as\nP (i, j, s, t) = γk\np2n3\n∑ ℓ∈[p] 〈Xi,Xℓ〉〈Xj ,Xℓ〉〈Xs,Xℓ〉〈Xt,Xℓ〉\nQ(i, j, s, t) = γk2\np3n (〈Xs,Xt〉〈Xi,Xj〉+ 〈Xi,Xt〉〈Xs,Xj〉+ 〈Xj ,Xt〉〈Xi,Xs〉)\nWe note that P and Q are well defined pseudo-moments because they are invariant to the permutation of indices and naturally PSD. To see the PSDness, note that P is a sum of p rank-1 PSD matrices. Moreover, Q is also PSD: the part that correpsonds to 〈Xs,Xt〉〈Xi,Xj〉 is simply a rank-1 PSD matrix; 〈Xi,Xt〉〈Xs,Xj〉 can be written as 〈Xt ⊗Xs,Xi ⊗Xj〉 and therefore it also contributes a PSD matrix to Q. Similarly, 〈Xj ,Xt〉〈Xs,Xi〉 can be written as 〈Xs ⊗Xt,Xi ⊗Xj〉, and it also contributes a PSD matrix.\nIn the next two lemmas (one for P and one for Q), we formalize the intuition above by showing that, the deviation from P and Q exactly satisfying the constraints is captured by error matrices E ,F ,G. We bound the magnitude of these error matrices and establish the PSDness of some of them so that later we can fix them for the exact satisfaction of the constraints. Lemma 4.4. There exists some absolute constant C and r such that for 1 ≤ γ ≤ min{k1/4,√n}, 1 ≤ γ ≤ n, p = 1.1γn, and k ≥ C · γ7/6√n logr p, suppose X satisfies pseudorandomness condition 4.1, then P almost satisfies constraint (C3)and (C5), naturally satisfies PSD constraint (C6), and is negligible for constraint (C4) in the sense that\nP (x3ixj) = M̃ (xixj) + Fij , ∀i, j ∈ [p] (4.3)∑\ni P (x2i xsxt) = Est ∀s, t ∈ [p] (4.4) ∑\ni,j,s,t\n|P (xixjxsxt)| ≤ k4/3 (4.5)\nwhere F and E are p× p matrices that satisfy\n1. 0 ≤ Fii ≤ Õ ( γk pn ) , |Fij | ≤ Õ ( γk pn1.5 ) for any i and j 6= i. 2.

Define M̃(xixjxsxt) = P (xixjxsxt) +Q(xixjxsxt) for all i, j, s, t ∈ [p], then we have under the condition of Lemma 4.4,\nM̃(x3i xj) = M̃(xixj) + F ′ij (4.9)∑ i∈[p] M̃(x2ixsxt) = kM̃ (xsxt) + E ′st ∀s, t (4.10)\n∑\ni,j,s,t\n|M̃ (xixjxsxt)| ≤ 2k4/3 (4.11)\nwhere F ′ and E ′ are p× p matrices that satisfy\n1. |F ′ii| ≤ Õ ( γk2n p3 ) and |F ′ij | ≤ Õ ( γk2 √ n p3 ) for all i 6= j. 2. E ′ is a PSD matrix with E ′ss ≤ Õ ( γk n ) and |E ′st| ≤ Õ( γkn√n) for s 6= t.\nProof of Lemma 4.6 using Lemma 4.4 and Lemma 4.5. Note that by definition of M̃ and Lemma 4.4 and Lemma 4.5, we have F ′ij = Fij + 3kp M̃(xixj) and E ′ = E + G. The bound for F ′ follows the bound for F and the facts that M̃(x2i ) = γknp2 and |M̃(xixj)| ≤ Õ ( γk √ n p2 ) . The PSDness of E ′ and the bounds for it follows straightforwardly from those of E and G. Equation (4.11) follows equation (4.4) and equation (4.8)."

Note that M̃ satisfies the rest of constraints (C2), (C5) and (C6) (even with some slackness). We will prove that the difference between\nM and M̃ is small enough so that these constraints are still satisfied by M .\nTheorem 4.7.

We prove that M satisfies all the constraints in an order that is most convenient for the proof, and check the objective value at the end.\n• Constraint (C3): This is satisfied by the definition of M .\n• Constraint (C4): By the definition, we can see thatM(x3sxt) is also a perturbation of M̃(x3sxt):\nM(x3sxt) = M̃(xsxt) + 1 k − 2 ( E ′st − 2F ′st ) = M̃(x3sxt) + E ′st k − 2 − k k − 2F ′ st (4.15)\nIt follows that for s 6= t,\n∑ i∈[p] M(x2i xsxt) = 2M(xsxt) + ∑ i∈[p]\\{s,t} M̃(x2ixsxt)\n= 2M̃ (xsxt) + 2 k − 2 ( E ′st − 2F ′st ) + ∑\ni∈[p]\\{s,t} M̃(x2i xsxt)\n= M̃(x3sxt) + M̃(xsx 3 t )− 2F ′st +\n2 k − 2 ( E ′st − 2F ′st ) + ∑\ni∈[p]\\{s,t} M̃(x2i xsxt)\n= kM̃ (xsxt) + E ′st − 2F ′st + 2 k − 2 ( E ′st − 2F ′st ) = kM(xsxt)\nwhere the second equality uses definition (4.12) and the third uses equation (4.9), and the fourth uses (4.10) and the last equality uses the definition (4.12) again.\nMoreover, for the case when s = t, we have that\n∑ i∈[p] M(x2ix 2 s) = M(x 4 s) + ∑ i∈[p]\\{s} M(x2i x 2 s)\n= M(x2s) + (k − 1)M(x2s) = kM(x2s)\nwhere we used the definition (4.14) of M(x4s) and M(x 2 s). Therefore we verified that M satisfies constraint (C4).\n• Constraint (C1): Using equation (4.13) and (4.14), we have\n∑ i∈[p] M(x2i ) = 1 k − 1 ∑ i 6=j M(x2i x 2 j ) = k\n• Constraint (C6): Next we check the PSDness of matrix mat(M). Note that mat(M) is indexed by all the mutli subset of [p] of size at most 2, and it consists of 3 blocks mat(M) = blkdiag(M4,M2,M0), where\nM4 = (mat(M)S,T )|S|=2,|T |=2\nM2 = (mat(M)S,T )|S|=1,|T |=1\nM0 = 1\nTherefore it suffices to check that M0, M2 and M4 are all PSD. M0 is trivially PSD. We can write M2 in the following form\nM2 = (M(xsxt))s,t∈[p] = ( M̃(xsxt) ) s,t∈[p] +∆\nwhere ∆ = M2 − ( M̃(xsxt) ) s,t∈[p]\n. By equation (4.12), we have that for s 6= t, ∆st = 1\nk−2 (E ′st − 2F ′st) for all s 6= t.

We extract the PSD matrix 1k−2 · E ′ form ∆ and obtain ∆′ = ∆− 1k−2 · E ′. Then by this definition, ∆′ss = p−1 k−1 · δ + 1k−1 (E ′ss −F ′ss) − 1k−2E ′ss, and ∆′st = − 2k−2F ′st. We use Gershgorin Circle Theorem to establish the PSDness of ∆′. By Lemma 4.6, we have\n|Fij | ≤ Õ ( γk2 √ n\np3\n) Therefore\n∑ j:j 6=i |∆′ij | ≤ p · 4 k − 2Õ ( γk2 √ n p3 ) ≤ o ( k p )\nwhere we used the fact that √ n/p = o(1) which follows form p = 1.1γn and γ ≤ √n.\nUsing equation (4.16) and constrain (C1) we have that\nk = ∑\ns\nM(x2s) = ∑\ns\nM̃(x2s) + ∑\ns\n1 k − 1 ( E ′ss −F ′ss ) + p(p− 1) k − 1 · δ (4.17)\n≤ γkn p + Õ(1) + p(p− 1) k − 1 · δ (4.18)\nIt follows that δ ≥ (1−o(1))· k(k−1)12p(p−1) . Therefore we obtain that ∆′ii = p−1 k−1 ·δ+ 1k−1 (E ′ss −F ′ss)−\n1 k−2E ′ss ≥ 112(1 − o(1))kp − Õ( γ n ) − Õ ( γkn p3 ) = 112(1 − o(1))kp . Therefore we obtain ∆′ii ≥∑\nj:j 6=i |∆′ij| and by Gershgorin Circle Theorem ∆′ is PSD. Now we examine M4. we write M4 as\nM4 = mat(P ) + mat(Q) + Γ\nwhere Γ = M4 − (mat(P ) + mat(Q)). One can observe that Γ has only non-zero entries of the form\nΓii,ii = M(x 4 i )− P (x4i )−Q(x4i ) = M(x4i )− M̃(x4i ) = M(x2i )− M̃(x2i )−F ′ii\n= (p− 1) k − 1 · δ + 1 k − 1E ′ ii − k k − 1Fii (4.19)\nand\n∀i 6= j,Γii,jj = Γij,ij = Γij,ji = M(x2i x2j)− P (x2ix2j )−Q(x2i x2j) = M(x2i x 2 j)− M̃(x2i x2j) = δ (4.20)\nand\n∀i 6= j,Γii,ij = Γii,ji = M(x3i xj)− P (x3i xj)−Q(x3ixj)\n= M(x3i xj)− M̃(x3i xj) = E ′st\nk − 2 − k k − 2Fst (4.21)\nwhere the last equality uses equation (4.15). Now we are ready to prove PSDness of Γ. We further decompose Γ as Γ = Γ′+blkdiag(Λ′, 0) where Λ′ is the p × p matrix with Λ′ = δ11T 6. Note that Λ′ is a PSD matrix and therefore it suffices to prove that Γ′ = Γ− blkdiag(Λ′, 0) is a PSD matrix. Note that Γ′ has ij-th column the same as ji-th column, and therefore it’s only of rank at most p+p(p−1)/2. We define Γ′′ be the p+p(p−1)/2 by p+p(p−1)/2 submatrix of Γ′,that is indexed by subsets (i, i) for i ∈ [p] and (i, j) for i < j. Therefore it suffices to prove that Γ′′ is PSD. We prove it using Gershgorin Circle Theorem. Note that by equation (4.19), we have that Γ′′ii,ii = Γ ′ ii,ii −Λ′ii,ii = (p−k) k−1 · δ+ 1k−1E ′ii − kk−1Fii. Therefore by the lower bound for δ and Lemma 4.6, we obtain, Γ′′ii,ii ≥ (1−o(1)) ǫkp . Moreover, Γ′′ii,ij = Γii,ij = E ′st k−2− kk−2Fst and therefore |Γ′′ii,ij| ≤ | E ′st k−2 |+| kk−2Fst| ≤ Õ( γ n1.5 )+Õ ( γk2 √ n p3 ) ≤ Õ( γn1.5 ). Furthermore, for i < j, Γ ′′ ij,ij = Γij,ij = δ ≥ (1 − o(1)) ǫk 2 p2 . Finally observe that Γ′′ii,jj = 0 by definition and all other entries of Γ ′′ are trivially 0 because the corresponding entries of Γ and Λ′ vanish. Therefore we are ready to use a variant of Gershogorin Circle Theorem (Lemma 8.8) to prove the PSDness of Γ′. Taking α = 1/γ2, we have for any i,\n6Λ′ is index by ii, i = 1, . . . , p\nα ∑\ns,t:(s,t)6=(i,i),s<t |Γ′′ii,st| =\n∑ j∈[p] |Γ′′ii,jj|+ ∑ j:j>i |Γ′′ii,ij |+ ∑ j:j<i |Γ′′ii,ji|\n≤ αp · Õ( γ n1.5 ) = o\n( k\np\n) ≤ Γ′′ii,ii\nwhere we used the fact that k ≫ γ√n and ǫ is a constant.

Fixing λ, k, n, given a data matrix X ∈ Rp×n, and any submatrix matrix Y ∈ R p′×n of X with p′ ≤ p1, let Σ̂X and Σ̂Y be the covariance matrices of X and Y , then we have that SoS4(Σ̂X) ≥ SoS4(Σ̂Y ). Now we are ready to prove our main Theorem 3.1. The idea is very simple: we normalize the data matrix X so that the resulting matrix X̄ satisfies the the pseudorandomness condition 4.1. Then we apply Theorem 4.7 and obtain a moment matrix which give large objective value with respect to X̄. Then we argue that the difference between X̄ from X is negligible so that the same moment matrix has also large objective value with respect to X.\nProof of Theorem 3.1. Using the observation above, we take p = 1.1γn with γ = 11λ, and we define X̄ to matrix obtained by normalizing rows of X to euclidean norm √ n. Then by Theorem 7.1 it satisfies the pseudorandomenss condition 4.1. Let Σ̂′ = 1nX̄X̄ T be the covariance matrix defined by X̄ . By Theorem 4.7 we have that SoS4(Σ̂ ′) ≥ (1 − o(1))γk ≥ 11λk. Moreover, let M be the moment defined in Theorem 4.7, and M2 its restriction to degree-2 moments, that is, M2 = (mat(M)S,T )|S|=|T |=1. We are going to show that the entry-wise difference between Σ̂ and Σ̂ ′ are small enough so that 〈M2, Σ̂〉 is close to 〈M2, Σ̂′〉. Note that since ‖Xi‖2 = n±Õ( √ n), therefore for any i 6= j, Σ̂′ij = Σ̂ij ‖Xi‖‖Xj‖ = Σ̂ij±Õ( 1√ n )|Σ̂|ij = Σ̂ij ± Õ( 1n). For i = j, we have similarly that Σ̂′ii = Σ̂ii± Õ( 1√n). We bound the difference between 〈M2, Σ̂′〉 and 〈M2, Σ̂′〉 by the sum of the entry-wise differences:\n|〈M2, Σ̂′ − Σ̂〉| ≤ ∑\ni\nM(x2i )|Σ̂ii − Σ̂′ii|+ ∑\ni 6=j M(xixj)|Σ̂ij − Σ̂′ij|\n≤ p · O(k/p) · Õ( 1√ n ) + p2 · Õ(γk\n√ n\np2 ) · Õ( 1 n ) = o(k)\nTherefore 〈M2, Σ̂〉 ≥ (1−o(1))γk−o(k) = (1−o(1))γk. Therefore the momentM gives objective value (1− o(1))γk for data Σ̂, and therefore SoS4(Σ̂) ≥ (1− o(1))γk ≥ 10λk.\nThen we prove that Theorem 3.1 together with the arguments in [KNV15] implies Theorem 3.2. The intuition behind is the following: Suppose M∗2 is very close to vv\nT , then it is close to rank-1 and its leading eigenvector is close to v̂. However, since we prove that the objective value is large (which is true also in the planted vector case), M∗2 needs to be highly correlated with Σ̂, which implies its leading eigenvector v̂ needs to be correlated with Σ̂, which in turns implies that v is correlated with Σ̂. However, it turns out that v is not correlated enough with Σ̂, which leads to a contradiction.\nProof of Theorem 3.2. We first prove that the optimal value of SoS4(Σ̂) for hypothesis Hv is also at least 0.99kp/n. Suppose v has support S of size k. We consider the restriction of linear operator M to the subset T = [p]\\S, denoted by MT . That is, we have that MT (xα) = 0 for any monomial xα that contains a factor xi with i ∈ S, and otherwise MT (xα) = M(xα). We also consider the data matrix XT obtained by restricting to the rows indexed by T . Note that since XT doesn’t contain the signal, and k ≫ √n), using Theorem 4.7 with γ = (p− k)/(1.01n), we have that there exists pseudo-moment M∗T which gives objective value ≥ (1−o(1))γk ≥ 0.99pk/n with respective to covariance matrix Σ̂T = 1 nXTX T T . Note that by Proposition 5.1, SoS4(Σ̂) ≥ SoS4(Σ̂T ) and therefore we obtain that under hypothesis Hv, with high probability, SoS4(Σ̂) ≥ 0.99kp/n. Now suppose M∗ is the maximizer of SoS4(Σ̂), and M∗2 = (M ∗(xixj))i,j∈[p]. For the sake of contradiction, we assume that ‖ 1kM∗2 − vvT ‖ ≤ 1/5. We first show that this implies that M∗2 has an eigenvector v̂ that is close to v and its eigenvalue is large. Indeed we have ‖ 1kM2‖ ≥ ‖vvT ‖ − 1/5 = 4/5. Therefore the top eigenvector of 1kM∗2 has eigenvalue larger than 4/5. Then we can decompose the difference between 1k ·M∗2 and vvT into 1k ·M∗2 − vvT = 45 · ( v̂v̂T − vvT ) +((\n1 kM ∗ 2 − 45 v̂v̂T ) − 15vvT ) . Note that since ( 1 kM ∗ 2 − 45 v̂v̂T ) is a PSD matrix with eigenvalue at most\n1/5, we have ‖ ((\n1 kM ∗ 2 − 45 v̂v̂T ) − 15vvT ) ‖ ≤ 2/5 by triangle inequality. Then by triangle inequality\nand our assumption again we obtain that\n1 5 ≥ ‖1 k ·M∗2 − vvT ‖ ≥ ‖ 4 5\n( v̂v̂T − vvT ) ‖−‖\n(( 1\nk M∗2 −\n4 5 v̂v̂T\n) − 1\n4 vvT\n) ‖ ≥ ‖4\n5\n( v̂v̂T − vvT ) ‖− 2\n5\nTherefore we obtain that ‖vvT − v̂v̂T ‖ ≤ 3/5 and therefore ‖vvT − v̂v̂T ‖2F ≤ 2‖vvT − v̂v̂T ‖2 ≤ 1. It follow that |〈v, v̂〉|2 = 1− 12‖vvT − v̂v̂T ‖2F ≥ 1/2.\nNext we are going to show that it is impossible for M∗2 to have an eigenvector that is close to v with a large eigenvalue and therefore we will get a contradiction. Let v̂ = αv + βs where s is orthogonal to v and α2 + β2 = 1 and α ≥ √ 1/2, and β ≤ √ 1/2. Then using triangle inequality we have that ‖v̂‖Σ̂ ≤ ‖αv‖Σ̂ + ‖βs‖Σ̂ ≤ √ O(λ)α + √ ‖Σ̂‖β. Proposition 5.3 of [KNV15] implies that for sufficiently large C and λ ≥ 1, when p/n ≥ Cλ, ‖Σ̂‖ ≤ 1.01p/n. Therefore under our assumption we have that ‖Σ̂‖ ≤ 1.01p/n. It follows β ≤ √ 1/2 that ‖v̂‖Σ̂ ≤ √ O(λ)α+ √ β · √ p/n ≤√\nO(λ) + √ p/2n. Therefore, we have that\n0.99p/n ≤ 1 k · SoS4(Σ̂) = 1 k · 〈M2, Σ̂〉 = 1 k · 〈M∗2 − 4k 5 · v̂v̂T , Σ̂〉+ 4 5 〈v̂v̂T , Σ̂〉\n≤ 1 k tr(M∗2 − 4 5 · v̂v̂T )‖Σ̂‖2 + 4 5 ‖v̂‖2 Σ̂ ≤ 1 5 ‖Σ̂‖+O(α2λ) +O( √ λp/n) + 2 5 · p/n ≤ 4 5 · p n +O( √ λp/n)\nwhere in the third line we used the fact that ‖v̂‖Σ̂ ≤ √ O(λ) + √ p/2n, and the last line we used ‖Σ̂‖ ≤ 1.01p/n.Note that this is a contradiction since we assumed that p/n ≥ Cλ for sufficiently large C."

      "text" : "In this section, we prove that basically as long as the noise model is subgaussian and has variance 1(which generalizes the standard Bernoulli and Gaussian distributions), after normalizing the rows of the data matrix X ∼ H0, it satisfies the pseudorandomness condition 4.1. Theorem 7.1. Suppose independent random variables X1, . . . ,Xp ∈ Rn satisfy that for any i, Xi has a i.i.d entries with mean zero, variance 1, and subgaussian variance proxy 7 O(1), then the matrix X̄ with XTi ‖Xi‖ as rows satisfies the pseudorandomness condition 4.1.\nThe proof of the Theorem relies on the following Proposition and Theorem 7.4. The proposition says that XTi ‖Xi‖ still satisfies good properties like symmetry and that each entries has a subgaussian tail, even though its entries are no longer independent due to normalization. These properties will be encapsulated in the definition of a good random variable following the proposition. Then we prove in Theorem 7.4 that these properties suffice for establishing the pseudorandomness Condition 4.1 with high probability. We will heavily use the ψα-Orlicz norm (denoted ‖·‖ψα) of a random variable, defined in Definition 8.1, and its properties, summarized in the next (toolbox) section. Intuitively, ‖ ·‖ψ2 norm is a succinct and convenient way to capture the “subgaussianity” of a random variable.\n7A real random variable X is subgaussian with variance proxy σ2 if it has similar tail behavior as gaussian distribution with variance σ2, and formally if for any t ∈ R, E[exp(tX)] ≤ exp(t 2σ2/2)\nProposition 7.2. Suppose y ∈ Rn has i.i.d entries with variance 1 and mean zero, and gaussian variance proxy O(1), then random variable x = y‖y‖ satisfies the following properties:\n1. ‖x‖2 = n, almost surely.\n2. for any vector a ∈ Rn with ‖a‖2 ≤ 2n, ‖〈x, a〉‖2ψ2 ≤ O(n).\n3. ‖|x|∞‖ψ2 ≤ Õ(1)\n4. E[x2i ] = 1, E[x 4 i ] = C4, and E[x 2 ix 2 j ] = C2,2 for all i and j 6= i, where C4, C2,2 = O(1) are\nconstants that don’t depend on i, j\n5. For any monomial xα with an odd degree, E[xα] = 0.\nFor simplicity, we call a random variable good if it satisfies the five properties listed in the proposition above. Goodness will be invoked in most statements below.\nDefinition 7.3 (goodness). A random variable x ∈ Rn is called good, if it satisfies the conclusion of Proposition 7.2.\nWe will show a random matrix X with good rows satisfies the pseudo-randomness Condition 4.1 with high probability.\nTheorem 7.4. Suppose independent n-dimensional random vectors X1, . . . ,Xp with p ≥ n are all good, then X1, . . . ,Xp satisfies the pseudorandomness condition 4.1 with high probability.\nThe general approach to prove the theorem is just to use the concentration of measure. The only caveat here is that in most of cases, the random variables that we are dealing with are not bounded a.s. so we can’t use Chernoff bound or Bernstein inequality directly. However, though these random variables are not bounded a.s., they typically have a light tail, that is, their ψα norms can be bounded. Then we are going to apply Theorem 8.4 of Ledoux and Talagrand’s, a extended version of Bernstein inequality with only ψα norm boundedness required. We will also use other known technical results listed in the toolbox Section 8.\nProof of Theorem 7.4. Equation (P1) and (P2) follows the assumptions on Xi’s and union bound. Equation (P3) is proved in Lemma 7.5 by taking u = Xs and v = Xt and view the rest of Xi;s as Zj ’s in the statement of Lemma 7.5. Equation (P4) is proved in Lemma 7.6, (P5) in Lemma 7.8, (P6) in Lemma 7.10, and equation P7 is proved in Lemma 7.15.\nLemma 7.5. For any good random variable x, we have that for fixed u, v with ‖u‖2 = ‖v‖2 = n , |u|∞ ≤ Õ(1), |v|∞ ≤ Õ(1), and 〈u, v〉 ≤ Õ( √ n),\n∣∣ E [ 〈x, u〉3〈x, v〉 ]∣∣ ≤ Õ(n1.5)\nand moreover, for p ≥ n and a sequence of good independent random variables Z1, . . . , Zp, we have that with high probability, ∣∣∣∣∣ p∑\ni=1\n〈Zi, u〉3〈Zi, v〉 ∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ Õ(n 1.5p)\nProof. We calculate the expectation as follows\nE\n[ 〈x, u〉3〈x, v〉 ] = E    ∑\ni\nu2ix 2 i + 2\n∑\ni<j\nuiujxixj\n   ∑\ni\nviuix 2 i +\n∑ i 6=j uivjxixj\n   \n= E\n[ ∑\ni\nu3i vix 4 i ] + E  ∑\ni 6=j u2iujvjx 2 i x 2 j\n + E  ∑\ni 6=j uiuj(uivj + viuj)x\n2 ix 2 j\n \n= (C4 − C2,2) ∑\ni\nu3i vi + C2,2n ∑\ni\nuivi +C2,2 ∑\ni 6=j (u2i ujvj + u 2 juivi)\n= (C4 − 3C2,2) ∑\ni\nu3i vi + 3C2,2n ∑\ni\nuivi\nTherefore by our assumption on u and v we obtain that\n∣∣ E [ 〈x, u〉3〈x, v〉 ]∣∣ ≤ Õ(n) +O(n)|〈u, v〉| ≤ Õ(n1.5)\nNow we prove the second statement. Since ‖〈Zi, u〉‖ψ2 ≤ O( √ n), by Lemma 8.5 we have that\n‖〈Zi, u〉3〈Zi, v〉‖ψ1/2 ≤ O(n2), and it follows Lemma 8.6 that ‖〈Zi, u〉3〈Zi, v〉−E [ 〈Zi, u〉3〈Zi, v〉 ] ‖ψ1/2 ≤ O(n2) Then by Lemma 8.4 we obtain that with high probability,\np∑\ni=1\n〈Zi, u〉3〈Zi, v〉 − E [ p∑\ni=1\n〈Zi, u〉3〈Zi, v〉 ] ≤ Õ(n2√p)\nNote that we have proved that ∣∣E [∑p i=1〈Zi, u〉3〈Zi, v〉 ]∣∣ = Õ(n1.5), therefore we obtain the desired result.\nLemma 7.6.

The rest of the four terms are bounded by Õ(n2.5). Therefore putting together ‖∑ℓ∈[p]〈Xi,Xℓ〉〈Xj ,Xℓ〉〈Xs,Xℓ〉〈Xt,Xℓ〉‖ ≤ Õ(n2 √ p) for any fixed i, j, s, t with high probability and taking union bound we get the result.\nLemma 7.7. For any good random variable x, and for fixed a, b, c, d such that max{|a|∞, |b|∞, |c|∞, |d|∞} = Õ(1), and all the pair-wise inner products between a, b, c, d have magnitude at most Õ( √ n), we have that |E [〈x, a〉〈x, b〉〈x, c〉〈x, d〉]| = Õ(n)\nand moreover, for p ≥ n and a sequence independent random variable Z1, . . . , Zp such that each Zi satisfies the conclusion of proposition 7.2, we have that with high probability,\n∣∣∣∣∣ p∑\ni=1\n〈Zi, a〉〈Zi, v〉〈Zi, c〉〈Zi, d〉 ∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ Õ(n 2√p)\nProof.

Since 〈x, a〉 has ψ2 norm √ n and similar for the other three terms, we have that by Lemma 8.5\nthat ‖〈x, a〉〈x, b〉〈x, c〉〈x, d〉‖ψ1/2 ≤ O(n2). Therefore using Theorem 8.4 we have that ∥∥∥∥∥ p∑\ni=1\n〈Zi, a〉〈Zi, v〉〈Zi, c〉〈Zi, d〉 − E[ p∑\ni=1 〈Zi, a〉〈Zi, v〉〈Zi, c〉〈Zi, d〉] ∥∥∥∥∥ ψ1/2 ≤ Õ(n2√p)\nLemma 7.8.

Taking union bound we complete the proof.\nLemma 7.9. For p ≥ n and a sequence of good independent random variable Z1, . . . , Zp, and any two fixed vectors u, v with |u|∞ ≤ Õ(1) and |v|∞ ≤ Õ(1), and 〈u, v〉 ≤ Õ( √ n), we have that with high probability, ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ∑ i∈[p] 〈Zi, u〉〈Zi, v〉 ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ Õ(p √ n) Proof. E[〈Zi, u〉〈Zi, v〉] = 〈u, v〉 ≤ Õ( √ n), and therefore ∣∣∣E [∑ i∈[p]〈Zi, u〉〈Zi, v〉 ]∣∣∣ ≤ Õ(p √ n). Note that ‖〈Zi, u〉‖ψ2 ≤ O( √ n) and therefore ‖〈Zi, u〉〈Zi, v〉‖ψ1 ≤ O(n). By Theorem 8.4, we have the desired result.\nLemma 7.10. Suppose p ≥ n and X1, . . . ,Xp are good independent random variables, then with high probability, for any distinct s, t,\n∑\ni,ℓ∈[p] 〈Xi,Xℓ〉〈Xi,Xℓ〉〈Xs,Xℓ〉〈Xt,Xℓ〉 ≤ Õ(p2n1.5)\nProof. We expand the target as follows: ∑ i,ℓ∈[p] 〈Xi,Xℓ〉〈Xi,Xℓ〉〈Xs,Xℓ〉〈Xt,Xℓ〉 =\n∑\ni∈[p],ℓ∈[p]\\s∪t 〈Xi,Xℓ〉〈Xi,Xℓ〉〈Xs,Xℓ〉〈Xt,Xℓ〉\n+ ∑\ni\n〈Xi,Xs〉2〈Xs,Xs〉〈Xt,Xs〉+ ∑\ni\n〈Xi,Xt〉2〈Xt,Xt〉〈Xs,Xt〉\n= ∑\ni∈[p]\\s∪t,ℓ∈[p]\\s∪t 〈Xi,Xℓ〉〈Xi,Xℓ〉〈Xs,Xℓ〉〈Xt,Xℓ〉\n+ ∑\ni\n〈Xi,Xs〉2〈Xs,Xs〉〈Xt,Xs〉+ ∑\ni\n〈Xi,Xt〉2〈Xt,Xt〉〈Xs,Xt〉\n+ ∑\nℓ∈[p]\\s∪t 〈Xs,Xℓ〉3〈Xℓ,Xt〉+\n∑\nℓ∈[p]\\s∪t 〈Xt,Xℓ〉3〈Xℓ,Xs〉\nBy equation (P3), we have that\n∑\nℓ∈[p]\\s∪t 〈Xs,Xℓ〉3〈Xℓ,Xt〉 ≤ Õ(pn1.5)\nSince 〈Xs,Xt〉 ≤ Õ( √ n) and ∑ i∈[p]〈Xi,Xs〉2 = n2 + ∑ i 6=s〈Xi,Xs〉2 ≤ Õ(np), we have that\n∑\ni\n〈Xi,Xs〉2〈Xs,Xs〉〈Xt,Xs〉 ≤ Õ(pn2.5)\nInvoking Lemma 7.11 with u = Xs and v = Xt fixed and view Xℓ, ℓ ∈ [p]\\s∪ t as random variables Zi’s, we have that with high probability,\n∑\ni∈[p]\\s∪t,ℓ∈[p]\\s∪t 〈Xi,Xℓ〉〈Xi,Xℓ〉〈Xs,Xℓ〉〈Xt,Xℓ〉 ≤ Õ(p2n1.5)\nHence combining the three equations above, taking union bound over all choices of s, t, we obtain the desired result.\nLemma 7.11. For p ≥ n and a sequence of good independent random variables Z1, . . . , Zp, and any two fixed vectors u, v with |u|∞ ≤ Õ(1) and |v|∞ ≤ Õ(1), and 〈u, v〉 ≤ Õ( √ n), we have that with high probability, ∑\ni∈[p]\n∑ j∈[p] 〈Zi, Zj〉2〈Zj , u〉〈Zj , v〉 ≤ Õ(p2n1.5)\nProof. We first extract the consider those cases with i = j separately by expanding ∑\ni∈[p]\n∑ j∈[p] 〈Zi, Zj〉2〈Zj , u〉〈Zj , v〉 = ∑ i 6=j 〈Zi, Zj〉2〈Zj , u〉〈Zj , v〉 + ∑ i 〈Zi, Zi〉2〈Zi, u〉〈Zi, v〉\n= ∑\ni 6=j 〈Zi, Zj〉2〈Zj , u〉〈Zj , v〉 + Õ(pn2.5) (7.1)\nwhere the the last line uses Lemma 7.9. Let Y1, . . . , Yp are independent random variables that have the same distribution as Z1, . . . , Zp, respectively, then by Theorem 8.7, we can decouple the sum of functions of Zi, jZj into a sum that of functions of Zi and Yj,\nPr\n ∑\ni 6=j 〈Zi, Zj〉2〈Zj , u〉〈Zj , v〉 ≥ t\n  ≤ C Pr  ∑\ni 6=j 〈Yi, Zj〉2〈Zj , u〉〈Zj , v〉 ≥ t/C\n \nNow we can invoke Lemma 7.12 which deals with RHS of the equation above, and obtain that with high probability ∑\ni 6=j 〈Yi, Zj〉2〈Zj , u〉〈Zj , v〉 ≤ Õ(p2n1.5)\nTherefore, with high probability, ∑\ni 6=j 〈Zi, Zj〉2〈Zj , u〉〈Zj , v〉 ≤ Õ(p2n1.5)\nThen combine with equation (7.1) we obtain the desired result.\nLemma 7.12. For p ≥ n and a sequence of good independent random variables Z1, . . . , Zp, let Y1, . . . , Yp be independent random variables which have the same distribution as Z1, . . . , Zp, respectively, then for any two fixed vectors u, v with |u|∞ ≤ Õ(1) and |v|∞ ≤ Õ(1), and 〈u, v〉 ≤ Õ( √ n), with high probability,\n∑\ni∈[p]\n∑ j∈[p] 〈Yi, Zj〉2〈Zj , u〉〈Zj , v〉 ≤ Õ(p2n1.5)\nProof. Let B = ∑\ni∈[p] YiY T i . Therefore by Lemma 7.13, we have that with high probability over\nthe randomness of Y , ‖B‖2 ≤ Õ(p), tr(B) = pn. Moreover, by Lemma 7.9, we have that with high probability, |uTBv| ≤ Õ(p√n). Note that these bounds only depend on the randomness of Y , and conditioning on all these bounds are true, we can still use the randomness of Zi’s for concentration. We invoke Lemma 7.14 and obtain that∣∣∣∣∣∣ ∑ i,j∈[p] 〈Zj , Yi〉2〈Zj , u〉〈Zj , v〉 ∣∣∣∣∣∣ = ∣∣∣∣∣∣ p∑ j=1 ZTj BZi〈Zi, u〉〈Zi, v〉 ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ Õ(p2n1.5)\nLemma 7.13. For p ≥ n and a sequence of good independent random variables Z1, . . . , Zp, we have that with high probability, ∥∥∥∥∥∥ ∑ i∈[p] ZiZ T i ∥∥∥∥∥∥ ≤ Õ(p)\nProof. We use matrix Bernstein inequality. First of all, we have that E[ZiZ T i ] = In×n, and therefore\nE [∑ i∈[p]ZiZ T i ] = pIn×n. Moreover, we check the variance of the ZiZTi :\nE[ZiZ T i ZiZ T i ] = nE[ZiZ T i ] = nIn×n\nFinally we observe that ‖ZiZTi ‖ ≤ n. Thus applying matrix Bernstein inequality we obtain that with high probability,\n∥∥∥∥∥∥ ∑ i∈[p] ZiZ T i − pIn×n ∥∥∥∥∥∥ ≤ Õ(√np+ n) = Õ(√np)\nLemma 7.14. For p ≥ n and a sequence of good independent random variables Z1, . . . , Zp, and for any fixed symmetric PSD matrix B ∈ Rn×n with ‖B‖ ≤ Õ(p), tr(B) ≤ 2pn, and any two fixed vectors u, v with |u|∞ ≤ Õ(1) and |v|∞ ≤ Õ(1), and 〈u, v〉 ≤ Õ( √ n), we have that with high probability over the randomness of Zi’s, ∣∣∣∣∣ p∑\ni=1\nZTi BZi〈Zi, u〉〈Zi, v〉 ∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ Õ(p 2n1.5)\nProof. Let W = xTBx〈x, u〉〈x, v〉, where x is a random variable that satisfies the conclusion of Proposition 7.2. We first calculate the expectation of W ,\nE [W ] = E\n   ∑\ni\nBiix 2 i +\n∑ i 6=j xixjBij\n   ∑\ni\nuivix 2 i +\n∑ i 6=j xixjuivj\n   \n= (C4 − C2,2) ∑\ni\nBiiuivi + C2,2tr(B)〈u, v〉 + E\n ∑\ni 6=j Bij(uivj + ujvi)x\n2 i x 2 j\n \n= (C4 − 3C2,2) ∑\ni\nBiiuivi + tr(B)〈u, v〉\nTherefore by the fact that |u|∞ ≤ Õ(1) and tr(B) ≤ 2pn, we obtain that |E[W ]| ≤ Õ(pn1.5). Observe that ZTj BZj ≤ Õ(pn) a.s. (with respect to the randomness of Zj), and ‖〈Zi, u〉〈Zi, v〉‖ψ1 ≤\nO(n), therefore we have that ‖ZTj BZj〈Zi, u〉〈Zi, v〉‖ψ1 ≤ O(pn2). Using Theorem 8.4, we obtain that with high probability,\n∣∣∣∣∣ p∑\ni=1\nZTi BZi〈Zi, u〉〈Zi, v〉 − E [ p∑\ni=1\nZTi BZi〈Zi, u〉〈Zi, v〉 ]∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ Õ(n 2p1.5)\nUsing the fact that E [ ZTi BZi〈Zi, u〉〈Zi, v〉 ] ≤ Õ(pn1.5) we obtain that with high probability\n∣∣∣∣∣ p∑\ni=1\nZTi BZi〈Zi, u〉〈Zi, v〉 ∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ Õ(p 2n1.5)\nLemma 7.15. Suppose p ≥ n and X1, . . . ,Xp are good independent random variables, then with high probability,\n‖XXT ‖2F ≥ (1− o(1))p2n\nProof. We first i and examine ∑ j 6=i〈Xj ,Xi〉2 first. We have that E[ ∑\nj 6=i〈Xj ,Xi〉2] = (p−1)‖Xi‖2 = (p − 1)n. Moreover, ‖〈Xj ,Xi〉2‖ψ1 ≤ O(n) (where Xj is viewed as random and Xi is viewed as fixed). Therefore by Theorem 8.4, we obtain that with high probability over the randomness of Xj ’s, (j 6= i), ∑ j 6=i〈Xj ,Xi〉2 = (p − 1)n ± Õ(n √ p) = (1± o(1))pn. Therefore taking union bound over all i, and taking the sum we obtain that\n‖XXT ‖2F ≥ ∑\ni\n∑ j 6=i 〈Xj ,Xi〉2 ≥ (1− o(1))p2n"

      "text" : "This section contains a collection of known technical results which are useful in proving the concentration bounds of Section 7. We note that when the data matrix X takes uniformly {±1} entries, then X satisfies Proposition 7.2 without any normalization and actually due to the independence of the entries, it’s much easier to prove that it satisfies Condition 4.1.\nDefinition 8.1 (Orlicz norm ‖ · ‖ψα). For 1 ≤ α < ∞, let ψα(x) = exp(xα) − 1. For 0 < α < 1, let ψα(x) = x\nα − 1 for large enough x ≥ xα, and ψα is linear in [0, xα]. The Orlicz norm ψα of a random variable X is defined as\n‖X‖ψα , inf{c ∈ (0,∞) | E [ψα(|X|/c) ≤ 1] (8.1)\nNote that by definition ψα is convex and increasing. The following Theorem of Ledoux and Talagrand’s is our main tool for proving concentration inequalities in Section 7.\nTheorem 8.2 (Theorem 6.21 of [LT13]). There exists a constant Kα depending on α such that for a sequence of independent mean zero random variables X1, . . . ,Xn in Lψα , if 0 < α ≤ 1,\n∥∥∥∥∥ ∑\ni\nXi ∥∥∥∥∥ ψα ≤ Kα (∥∥∥∥∥ ∑ i Xi ∥∥∥∥∥ 1 + ∥∥∥∥maxi ‖Xi‖ ∥∥∥∥ ψα ) (8.2)\nand if 1 < α ≤ 2, ∥∥∥∥∥ ∑\ni\nXi ∥∥∥∥∥ ψα ≤ Kα (∥∥∥∥∥ ∑ i Xi ∥∥∥∥∥ 1 + ( ∑ i ‖Xi‖βψα) 1/β ) (8.3)\nwhere 1/α+ 1/β = 1.\nThe following convenient Lemma allows us to control the second part of RHS of (8.2) easily.\nLemma 8.3 ([vdVW00]). There exists absolute constant c, such that for any real valued random variables X1, . . . ,Xn, we have that\n∥∥∥∥max1≤i≤n |Xi| ∥∥∥∥ ψα ≤ cψ−1α (n) max 1≤i≤n ‖Xi‖ψα\nUsing Lemma 8.3 and Theorem 8.2, we obtain straightforwardly the following theorem that will be used many times for proving concentration bounds in this paper.\nTheorem 8.4. For any 0 < α ≤ 1, there exists a constant Kα such that for a sequence of independent random variables X1, . . . ,Xn,\n∥∥∥∥∥ ∑\ni\nXi − E[ ∑\ni\nXi] ∥∥∥∥∥ ψα ≤ Kα √ n log n ·max i ‖Xi‖ψα (8.4)\nwhich implies that with high probability over the randomness of Xi’s,\n∣∣∣∣∣ ∑\ni\nXi − E[ ∑\ni\nXi] ∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ Õ(Kα √ n ·max i ‖Xi‖ψα)\nThe following two lemmas are used to bound the Orlicz norms of random variables.\nLemma 8.5. There exists constant Dα depending on α such that, if two (possibly correlated) random variables X, Y have ψα Orlicz norm bounded by ‖X‖ψα ≤ a and ‖Y ‖ψα ≤ b then ‖XY ‖ψα/2 ≤ Dαab\nProof. For any x,y, a, b, α > 0,\nexp (|xy|)α/2 − 1 ≤ exp ( 1\n2 |x|α + 1 2 |y|α\n) − 1\n≤ 1 2 ((exp |x|α − 1) + (exp |y|α − 1))\nMoreover, note that by definition of ψα, there exists constant Cα and C ′ α such that for x ≥ 0, C ′α(exp(x α) − 1) ≥ ψα(x) ≥ Cα(exp(xα) − 1). Therefore we have that there exists a constant Eα such that ψα/2(|xy|) ≤ Eα2 (ψα(|x|)+ψα(|y|)). Also note that for any constant c, there exsits constant c′ such that ψα(x/c′) ≤ ψα(x)/c. Therefore, choosing Dα such that ψα/2(x/Dα) ≤ ψα(x)/Eα for all x ≥ 0 we obtain that\nE [ ψα/2(\n|XY | abDα )\n] ≤ E [ ψα/2(\n|XY | ab )\n] /Eα ≤ 1\n2 (E[ψα(|X|/a)] + E[ψα(|Y |/b)]) ≤ 1\nLemma 8.6. Suppose random variable X has ψα-Orlicz norm a, then X − E[X] has ψα Orlicz norm at most 2a.\nProof. First of all, since ψα is convex and increasing on [0,∞), we have that E [ψα(|X|/a)] ≥ ψα(E[|X|]/a) ≥ ψα(|E[X]|/a). Then we have that\nE [ ψα(\n|X − E[X]| 2a )\n] ≤ E[ψα(\n|X| 2a + |E[X]| 2a\n)] ≤ E [ 1\n2 ψα(|X|/a) +\n1 2 ψα(|E[X]|/a)\n] ≤ E[ψα(|X|/a)] ≤ 1\nwhere we used the convexity of ψα and the fact that E [ψα(|X|/a)] ≥ ψα(|E[X]|/a)\nThe following Theorem of [PMS95] is useful to decouple the randomness of a sum of correlated random variables into a form that is easier to control.\nTheorem 8.7 (Special case of Theorem 1 of [PMS95]). Let X1, . . . ,Xn, Y1, . . . , Yn are independent random variables on a measurable space over S, where Xi and Yi has the same distribution for i = 1, . . . , n. Let fij(·, ·) be a family of functions taking S × S to a Banach space (B, ‖ · ‖). Then there exists absolute constant C, such that for all n ≥ 2, t > 0,\nPr   ∥∥∥∥∥∥ ∑ i 6=j fij(Xi,Xj) ∥∥∥∥∥∥ ≥ t   ≤ C Pr   ∥∥∥∥∥∥ ∑ i 6=j fij(Xi, Yj) ∥∥∥∥∥∥ ≥ t/C  \nThe following lemma provides a simple way to prove the PSDness of a matrix that has large value on the diagonal and small off-diagonal values.\nLemma 8.8 (Consequence of Gershgorin Circle Theorem). Suppose a matrix Γ is of the form\nΓ = [ A B C D ] where A,D are square diagonal matrices, and C is of dimension n × m. Then Γ is PSD if there exists α > 0 such that the following holds: Aii ≥ 1α ∑\nj∈[n] |Cij |,∀ ∈ [p] and Djj ≥ α ∑ i∈[m] |Cij |,∀j ∈ [p].\nProof. Let vector u = (α1m, α −11n) and v = (α−11m, α1n), where 1n is n-dimensional all 1’s vector. Then Γ can be written as Γ = vvT ⊙ (uuT ⊙Γ), where ⊙ denotes the entries-wise product of two matrices (That is, A⊙B is a matrix with entry AijBij). Using the Gershgorin Circle Theorem and the conditions of the Lemma we obtain that uuT ⊙ Γ is PSD and therefore Γ is PSD."

      "text" : "In this paper we prove a lower bounds on the number of samples required to solve the Sparse PCA problem by degree-4 SoS algorithms. This extends the (spectral) degree-2 SoS lower bound for the problem, establishing the quadratic gap from the number of samples required by the (inefficient) information theoretic bound. It remains an interesting problem to extend our lower bounds to higher degree SoS algorithms (or even better, show that with some constant degree, one can solve the problem with fewer samples). One specific difficulty we encountered in trying to extend the lower bound to higher degree was the polynomial constraint x3i = xi, capturing the discreteness of the hidden sparse vector. The SoS formulation of the problem without this condition is interesting as well, and lower bound for it may be easier.\nAs mentioned, it is possible that the best way to prove strong SoS lower bounds for Sparse PCA is via the reduction of Berthet and Rigollet’s [BR13a], namely by improving existing lower bounds for the Planted Clique problem. However, we note that this approach is limited as well, as it seems\nthat sparse PCA is significantly harder. Specifically, Planted Clique has a simple O(log n)-degree SoS algorithm (and thus a quasi-polynomial time) optimal solution, whereas for Sparse PCA we know of no better sample-optimal algorithm than one running in exponential pO(k) time. It is thus conceivable that one can even prove Ω(k)-degree SoS lower bounds for this problem.\nMore generally, we believe that statistical and machine learning problems provide a new and challenging setting for testing the power and limits and SoS algorithms. While we have fairly strong techniques for proving optimal SoS lower bounds for combinatorial optimization problems, we lack similar ones for ML problems. In particular, many other problems besides Sparse PCA seem to exhibit the apparent trade-off between the number of samples required information theoretically versus via computationally efficient techniques, offering fertile ground for attempting SoS lower bounds establishing such trade-offs.\nFinally it would be nice to see more reductions between problems of statistical and ML nature, as the one by [BR13a]. Efficient reductions have proved extremely powerful in computational complexity theory and optimization, enabling the framework of complexity classes and complete problems. Creating such a framework within machine learning will hopefully expose structure on the relative difficulty of problems in this vast area, highlighting some problems as more central to attack, and enabling both new algorithms and new lower bounds.\nAcknowledgments: We would like to thank Sanjeev Arora, Boaz Barak, Philippe Rigollet and David Steurer for helpful discussions throughout various stages of this work."

    "abstractText" : "This paper establishes a statistical versus computational trade-off for solving a basic highdimensional machine learning problem via a basic convex relaxation method. Specifically, we consider the Sparse Principal Component Analysis (Sparse PCA) problem, and the family of Sum-of-Squares (SoS, aka Lasserre/Parillo) convex relaxations. It was well known that in large dimension p, a planted k-sparse unit vector can be in principle detected using only n ≈ k log p (Gaussian or Bernoulli) samples, but all efficient (polynomial time) algorithms known require n ≈ k samples. It was also known that this quadratic gap cannot be improved by the the most basic semi-definite (SDP, aka spectral) relaxation, equivalent to a degree-2 SoS algorithms. Here we prove that also degree-4 SoS algorithms cannot improve this quadratic gap. This averagecase lower bound adds to the small collection of hardness results in machine learning for this powerful family of convex relaxation algorithms. Moreover, our design of moments (or “pseudoexpectations”) for this lower bound is quite different than previous lower bounds. Establishing lower bounds for higher degree SoS algorithms for remains a challenging problem.",
