      "text" : "Revealing hidden structures of a graph is the heart of many data analysis problems. From the wellknown small-world network to the recent large-scale data collected from online service providers such as Wikipedia, Twitter and Facebook, there is always a momentum in seeking better and more informative representations of the graphs (Fienberg et al. 1985; Nowicki and Snijders 2001a; Hoff et al. 2002; Handcock et al. 2007; Airoldi et al. 2008; Xu et al. 2012; Azari and Airoldi 2012; Tang et al. 2013; Goldenberg et al. 2009; Kolaczyk 2009). In this paper, we develop a new computational tool to study one type of non-parametric representations which recently draws significant attentions from the community (Bickel and Chen 2009; Lloyd et al. 2012; Bickel et al. 2011; Zhao et al. 2011; Orbanz and Roy 2013).\nThe root of the non-parametric model discussed in this paper is in the theory of exchangeable random arrays (Aldous 1981; Hoover 1979; Kallenberg 1989), and it is presented in (Diaconis and Janson 2008) as a link connecting de Finetti’s work on partial exchangeability and graph limits (Lovász and Szegedy 2006; Borgs et al. 2006). In a nutshell, the theory predicts that every convergent sequence of graphs (Gn) has a limit object that preserves many local and global properties of the graphs in the sequence. This limit object, which is called a graphon, can be represented by measurable functions w : [0, 1]2 → [0, 1], in a way that any w′ obtained from measure preserving transformations of w describes the same graphon.\nGraphons are usually seen as kernel functions for random network models (Lawrence 2005). To construct an n-vertex random graph G(n,w) for a given w, we first assign a random label ui ∼ Uniform[0, 1] to each vertex i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, and connect any two vertices i and j with probability w(ui, uj), i.e., Pr (G[i, j] = 1 | ui, uj) = w(ui, uj), i, j = 1, . . . , n, (1) where G[i, j] denotes the (i, j)th entry of the adjacency matrix representing a particular realization of G(n,w) (See Figure 1). As an example, we note that the stochastic block-model is the case where w(x, y) is a piecewise constant function.\n∗This paper appears in the proceedings of NIPS 2013. In this version we include an appendix with proofs.\nThe problem of interest is defined as follows: Given a sequence of 2T observed directed graphs G1, . . . , G2T , can we make an estimate ŵ of w, such that ŵ → w with high probability as n goes to infinity? This question has been loosely attempted in the literature, but none of which has a complete solution. For example, Lloyd et al. (Lloyd et al. 2012) proposed a Bayesian estimator without a consistency proof; Choi and Wolfe (Choi and Wolfe) studied the consistency properties, but did not provide algorithms to estimate the graphon. To the best of our knowledge, the only method that estimates graphons consistently, besides ours, is USVT (Chatterjee). However, our algorithm has better complexity and outperforms USVT in our simulations. More recently, other groups have begun exploring approaches related to ours (Wolfe and Olhede 2013; P.Latouche and Robin 2013).\nThe proposed approximation procedure requires w to be piecewise Lipschitz. The basic idea is to approximate w by a two-dimensional step function ŵ with diminishing intervals as n increases.The proposed method is called the Stochastic blockmodel approximation (SBA) algorithm, as the idea of using a two-dimensional step function for approximation is equivalent to using the stochastic block models (Choi et al. 2012; Nowicki and Snijders 2001a; Hoff 2008; Channarond et al. 2012; Rohe et al. 2011). The SBA algorithm is defined up to permutations of the nodes, so the estimated graphon is not canonical. However, this does not affect the consistency properties of the SBA algorithm, as the consistency is measured w.r.t. the graphon that generates the graphs."

For generality we assume w to be asymmetric i.e., w(u, v) 6= w(v, u), so that symmetric graphons can be considered as a special case. Consequently, a random graph G(n,w) generated by w is directed, i.e., G[i, j] 6= G[j, i]."

      "heading" : "2.2 Similarity of graphon slices",
      "text" : "The intuition of the proposed SBA algorithm is that if the graphon is smooth, neighboring crosssections of the graphon should be similar. In other words, if two labels ui and uj are close i.e.,\n|ui − uj| ≈ 0, then the difference between the row slices |w(ui, ·)−w(uj , ·)| and the column slices |w(·, ui) − w(·, uj)| should also be small. To measure the similarity between two labels using the graphon slices, we define the following distance\ndij = 1\n2\n(∫ 1\n0\n[w(x, ui)− w(x, uj)]2 dx+ ∫ 1\n0\n[w(ui, y)− w(uj , y)]2 dy ) . (2)\nThus, dij is small only if both row and column slices of the graphon are similar.\nThe usage of dij for graphon estimation will be discussed in the next subsection. But before we proceed, it should be noted that in practice dij has to be estimated from the observed graphs G1, . . . , G2T . To derive an estimator d̂ij of dij , it is helpful to express dij in a way that the estimators can be easily obtained. To this end, we let\ncij =\n∫ 1\n0\nw(x, ui)w(x, uj)dx and rij = ∫ 1\n0\nw(ui, y)w(uj , y)dy,\nand express dij as dij = 12 [ (cii−cij−cji+cjj)+(rii−rij−rji+rjj) ] . Inspecting this expression, we consider the following estimators for cij and rij :\nĉkij = 1\nT 2\n  ∑\n1≤t1≤T Gt1 [k, i]\n    ∑\nT<t2≤2T Gt2 [k, j]\n  , (3)\nr̂kij = 1\nT 2\n  ∑\n1≤t1≤T Gt1 [i, k]\n    ∑\nT<t2≤2T Gt2 [j, k]\n  . (4)\nHere, the superscript k can be interpreted as the dummy variables x and y in defining cij and rij , respectively. Summing all possible k’s yields an estimator d̂ij that looks similar to dij :\nd̂ij = 1\n2\n[ 1\nS\n∑\nk∈S\n{( r̂kii − r̂kij − r̂kji + r̂kjj ) + ( ĉkii − ĉkij − ĉkji + ĉkjj )} ] , (5)\nwhere S = {1, . . . , n}\\{i, j} is the set of summation indices. The motivation of defining the estimators in (3) and (4) is that a row of the adjacency matrix G[i, ·] is fully characterized by the corresponding row of the graphon w(ui, ·). Thus the expected value of 1 T (∑ 1≤t1≤T Gt1 [i, ·] ) is w(ui, ·), and hence 1S ∑ k∈S r̂ k ij is an estimator for rij . To theoretically\njustify this intuition, we will show in Section 3 that d̂ij is indeed a good estimator: it is not only unbiased, but is also concentrated round dij for large n. Furthermore, we will show that it is possible to use a random subset of S instead of {1, . . . , n}\\{i, j} to achieve the same asymptotic behavior. As a result, the estimation of dij can be performed locally in a neighborhood of i and j, instead of all n vertices."

Given G1, . . . , G2T , we can cluster the (unknown) labels {u1, . . . , un} intoK blocks B̂1, . . . , B̂K using a procedure described below. Once the blocks B̂1, . . . , B̂K are defined, we can then determine ŵ(ui, uj) by computing the empirical frequency of edges that are present across blocks B̂i and B̂j :\nŵ(ui, uj) = 1 |B̂i| |B̂j | ∑\nix∈B̂i\n∑\njy∈B̂j\n1\n2T (G1[ix, jy] +G2[ix, jy] + . . .+G2T [ix, jy]) , (6)\nwhere B̂i is the block containing ui so that summing Gt[x, y] over x ∈ B̂i and y ∈ B̂j yields an estimate of the expected number of edges linking block B̂i and B̂j .\nTo cluster the unknown labels {u1, . . . , un} we propose a greedy approach as shown in Algorithm 1. Starting with Ω = {u1, . . . , un}, we randomly pick a node ip and call it the pivot. Then for all other vertices iv ∈ Ω\\{ip}, we compute the distance d̂ip,iv and check whether d̂ip,iv < ∆2 for some precision parameter ∆ > 0. If d̂ip,iv < ∆ 2, then we assign iv to the same block as ip. Therefore, after scanning through Ω once, a block B̂1 = {ip, iv1 , iv2 , . . .} will be defined. By updating Ω as Ω ← Ω\\B̂1, the process repeats until Ω = ∅. The proposed greedy algorithm is only a local solution in a sense that it does not return the globally optimal clusters. However, as will be shown in Section 3, although the clustering algorithm is not globally optimal, the estimated graphon ŵ is still guaranteed to be a consistent estimate of the true graphon w as n → ∞. Since the greedy algorithm is numerically efficient, it serves as a practical computational tool to estimate w."

The concentration inequality follows from a similar idea to bound the variance of r̂kij and apply Bernstein’s inequality.\nThat Gt1 [i, k] and Gt2 [j, k] are conditionally independent on uk is a critical fact for the success of the proposed algorithm. It also explains why at least 2 independently observed graphs are necessary, for otherwise we cannot separate the probability in the second equality above marked with (a)."

      "text" : "The performance of the Algorithm 1 is sensitive to the number of blocks it defines. On the one hand, it is desirable to have more blocks so that the graphon can be finely approximated. But on the other hand, if the number of blocks is too large then each block will contain only few vertices. This is bad because in order to estimate the value on each block, a sufficient number of vertices in each block is required. The trade-off between these two cases is controlled by the precision parameter ∆: a large ∆ generates few large clusters, while small ∆ generates many small clusters. A precise relationship between the ∆ and K , the number of blocks generated the algorithm, is given in Theorem 2.\nTheorem 2.

Here we only outline the key steps to present the intuition of the theorem. The goal of Theorem 3 is to show convergence of |ŵ(ui, uj)− w(ui, uj)|. The idea is to consider the following two quantities:\nw(ui, uj) = 1 |B̂i| |B̂j | ∑\nix∈B̂i\n∑\njx∈B̂j\nw(uix , ujx),\nŵ(ui, uj) = 1 |B̂i| |B̂j | ∑\nix∈B̂i\n∑\njy∈B̂j\n1\n2T (G1[ix, jy] +G2[ix, jy] + . . .+G2T [ix, jy]) ,\nso that if we can bound |w(ui, uj) − w(ui, uj)| and |w(ui, uj) − ŵ(ui, uj)|, then consequently |ŵ(ui, uj)− w(ui, uj)| can also be bounded. The bound for the first term |w(ui, uj) − w(ui, uj)| is shown in Lemma 1: By Algorithm 1, any vertex iv ∈ B̂i is guaranteed to be within a distance ∆ from the pivot of B̂i. Since w(ui, uj) is an average over B̂i and B̂j , by Theorem 1 a probability bound involving ∆ can be obtained.\nThe bound for the second term |w(ui, uj)−ŵ(ui, uj)| is shown in Lemma 2. Different from Lemma 1, here we need to consider two possible situations: either the intermediate estimate w(ui, uj) is close to the ground truth w(ui, uj), or w(ui, uj) is far from the ground truth w(ui, uj). This accounts for the sum in Lemma 2. Individual bounds are derived based on Lemma 1 and Theorem 1.\nCombining Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, we can then bound the error and show convergence.\nLemma 1. For any iv ∈ B̂i and jv ∈ B̂j ,\nPr [ |w(ui, uj)− w(uiv , ujv )| > 8∆1/2L1/4 ] ≤ 32|B̂i| |B̂j|e− S∆4 32/T+8∆2/3 . (10)\nLemma 2.

(11)\nThe condition S ∈ Θ(n) is necessary to make Theorem 3 valid, because if S is independent of n, it is not possible to drive (10) and (11) to 0 even if n → ∞. The other condition on ∆ is also important as it forces the numerators and denominators in the exponentials of (10) and (11) to be well behaved."

Since r̂kij and ĉ k ij are both unbiased, d̂ij must be unbiased.\nNow we proceed to prove the second part of the theorem. We first claim that\nVar [ r̂kij ] ≤ 2/T and Var [ ĉkij ] ≤ 2/T. (19)\nTo prove this, we note that\nVar [ r̂kij ] = Var\n[ 2T∑\nt2=T+1\nT∑\nt1=1\nGt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk]\n]\n=\n2T∑\nt2=T+1\nT∑\nt1=1\nVar [ Gt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk] ]\n+ 2T∑\nτ2=T+1 τ2 6=t2\n2T∑\nt2=T+1\nT∑\nτ1=1 τ1 6=t1\nT∑\nt1=1\nCov [ Gt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk], Gτ1 [ik]Gτ2 [jk] ]\nWe consider three cases:\nCase 1. First assume τ1 6= t1 and τ2 6= t2. (Occurs (T − 1)2T 2 times.) Cov [ Gt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk], Gτ1 [ik]Gτ2 [jk] ]\n= E [ (Gt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk] − E[Gt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk]]) (Gτ1 [ik]Gτ2 [jk] − E[Gτ1 [ik]Gτ2 [jk]]) ] = E [ (Gt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk] − wikwjk) (Gτ1 [ik]Gτ2 [jk] − wikwjk) ] = E [ Gt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk]Gτ1 [ik]Gτ2 [jk] ] − E [ Gτ1 [ik]Gτ2 [jk] ] wikwjk − E [ Gt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk] ] wikwjk + w 2 ikw 2 jk = E [ Gt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk]Gτ1 [ik]Gτ2 [jk] ] − w2ikw2jk (20)\nThe first term in (20) is E [ Gt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk]Gτ1 [ik]Gτ2 [jk] ] = w2ikw 2 jk because Gt1 [ik], Gt2 [jk], Gτ1 [ik] and\nGτ2 [jk] are all independent. Therefore, the overall sum in (20) is 0.\nCase 2. Next assume that τ1 6= t1 but τ2 = t2. (Occurs (T − 1)T 2 times.) In this case,\nE [ Gt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk]Gτ1 [ik]Gτ2 [jk] ] = E [ Gt1 [ik] ] E [ Gτ1 [ik] ] E [ Gt2 [jk]Gτ2 [jk] ]\n= wikwikE [ Gt2 [jk] 2 ]\n= w2ikwjk.\nSubstituting this result into (20) yields the covariance\nCov [ Gt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk], Gτ1 [ik]Gτ2 [jk] ] = w2ikwjk − w2ikw2jk = w2ikwjk(1−wjk) ≤ 1.\nCase 3. Assume τ1 = t1 but τ2 6= t2. (Occurs (T − 1)T 2 times.) In this case,\nE [ Gt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk]Gτ1 [ik]Gτ2 [jk] ] = wikw 2 jk,\nand so the covariance becomes\nCov [ Gt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk], Gτ1 [ik]Gτ2 [jk] ] = wikw 2 jk(1−wik) ≤ 1.\nCombining all 3 cases, we have the following bound:\nVar[r̂kij ] = 1\nT 4 Var\n[ ∑\nt1\n∑\nt2\nGt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk]\n]\n= 1\nT 4\n[ ∑\nt1\n∑\nt2\nVar [ Gt1 [ik]Gt2 [jk] ] + (T − 1)T 2w2ikwjk(1− wjk) + (T − 1)T 2wikw2jk(1− wik)\n]\n= 1 T 4 [ T 2wikwjk(1− wikwjk) + (T − 1)T 2w2ikwjk(1− wjk) + (T − 1)T 2wikw2jk(1− wik) ] ≤ 1 T 4 [ T 2 + 2(T − 1)T 2 ] = 2T − 1 T 2 ≤ 2 T .\nThe bound for Var [ ĉkij ] can be proved similarly.\nNext, we observe that Gt (for any t) is a directed graph. So the random variables Gt1 [i, k] and Gt1 [k, i] are independent. Similarly, Gt2 [j, k] and Gt2 [k, j] are independent. Therefore, the product variables Gt1 [i, k]Gt2 [j, k] and Gt1 [k, i]Gt2 [k, j] must be independent for any fixed ui, uj and uk , where i 6= j and k = {1, . . . , n}\\{i, j}. Consequently, r̂kij and ĉkij are independent, and hence\nE[r̂kij ĉ k ij ] = E [ r̂kij ] · E [ ĉkij ]\n= rijcij ,\nwhich implies that r̂kij and ĉ k ij are uncorrelated: E [ (r̂kij − rij)(ĉkij − cij) ] = 0. Consequently,\nVar\n[ 1\n2\n( r̂kij + ĉ k ij )] = 1\n4\n( Var [ r̂kij ] +Var [ ĉkij ]) ≤ 1\nT .\nSince r̂ij = 1S ∑ k∈S r̂kij and ĉij = 1 S ∑ k∈S ĉkij , by Bernstein’s inequality we have\nPr [∣∣∣∣ 1 2 (r̂ij + ĉij)− 1 2 (rij + cij) ∣∣∣∣ > ǫ ] = Pr [∣∣∣∣∣ 1 S ∑\nk∈S\n1\n2\n( r̂kij + ĉ k ij ) − 1\n2 (rij + cij) ∣∣∣∣∣ > ǫ ]\n≤ 2e − Sǫ2 2(Var[ 12 (r̂kij+ĉkij)]+ǫ/3) ≤ 2e− Sǫ2 2(1/T+ǫ/3) .\nFinally, we note that\n|d̂ij − dij | ≤ 1 2 |r̂ii + ĉii − rii − cii|+ 1 2 |r̂ij + ĉij − rij − cij |+\n1 2 |r̂ji + ĉji − rji − cji|+ 1 2 |r̂jj + ĉjj − rjj − cjj | .\nTherefore by union bound we have\nPr[|d̂ij − dij | > ǫ] ≤ Pr [1 2 |r̂ii + ĉii − rii − cii|+ 1 2 |r̂ij + ĉij − rij − cij |+\n+ 1 2 |r̂ji + ĉji − rji − cji|+ 1 2 |r̂jj + ĉjj − rjj − cjj | > ǫ\n]\n≤ Pr [ ∣∣∣∣ 1 2 (r̂ii + ĉii)− 1 2 (rii + cii) ∣∣∣∣ > ǫ/4 ] + Pr [ ∣∣∣∣ 1 2 (r̂ij + ĉij)− 1 2 (rij + cij) ∣∣∣∣ > ǫ/4 ] +\n+ Pr [ ∣∣∣∣ 1 2 (r̂ji + ĉji)− 1 2 (rji + cji) ∣∣∣∣ > ǫ/4 ] + Pr [ ∣∣∣∣ 1 2 (r̂jj + ĉjj)− 1 2 (rjj + cjj) ∣∣∣∣ > ǫ/4 ]\n≤ 8e− Sǫ2/16 2(1/T+ǫ/12) = 8e − Sǫ2 32/T+8ǫ/3 .\nIf the graph is un-directed, then ckij = r k ij and we can only have Var [ 1 2 ( rkij + c k ij )] ≤ 2 T instead of\nVar [ 1 2 ( rkij + c k ij )] ≤ 1 T . In this case,\nPr[|d̂ij − dij | > ǫ] ≤ 8e− Sǫ2 64/T+8ǫ/3 ."

Let ∆ be the accuracy parameter and K be the number of blocks estimated by Algorithm 1, then\nPr [ K > QL √ 2\n∆\n] ≤ 8n2e−\nS∆4\n128/T+16∆2/3 , (21)\nwhere L is the Lipschitz constant and Q is the number of Lipschitz blocks in the ground truth w.\nProof. Recall that in defining the Lipschitz condition of w (Section 2.1), we defined a sequence of nonoverlapping intervals Ik = [αk, αk+1], where 0 = α0 < . . . < αQ = 1, and Q is the number of Lipschitz blocks of w. For each of the interval Ik, we divide it into R def = L √ 2\n∆ subintervals of equal size 1/R. Thus,\nthe distance between any two elements in the same subinterval is at most 1/R. Also, the total number of subintervals over [0, 1] is QR. Now, suppose that there are K > QR = QL √\n2 ∆ blocks defined by the algorithm, and denote the K pivots be p1, . . . , pK . By the pigeonhole principle, there must be at least two pivots pi and pj in the same sub-interval. In this case, the distance dpi,pj must satisfy the following condition:\ndpi,pj = 1\n2\n(∫ 1\n0\n(w(x, upi)− w(x, upj ))2dx+ ∫ 1\n0\n(w(upi , y)−w(upj , y))2dy )\n≤ L2(upi − upj )2\n≤ L2 1 R2 = ∆2 2 .\nHowever, from the algorithm it holds that d̂pi,pj ≥ ∆2. So, if K > QR, then d̂pi,pj − dpi,pj > ∆ 2 2 .\nLet E be the following event:\nE = { d̂pi,pj − dpi,pj > ∆2\n2 for at least one pair of pi, pj\n} .\nThen, since the event E is a consequence of the event {K > QR}, we have\nPr [ K > QL √ 2\n∆\n] = Pr[K > QR] ≤ Pr[ E ].\nTo bound Pr[E ], we observe that\nPr [ d̂pi,pj − dpi,pj > ∆2\n2\n∣∣∣ pi, pj ] ≤ 8e− S(∆2/2)2 32/T+8(∆2/2)/3 = 8e − S∆4 128/T+16∆2/3 .\nTherefore, by union bound,\nPr [ E ∣∣∣ p1, . . . , pK ] ≤ ∑\npi,pj\nPr [ d̂pi,pj − dpi,pj > ∆2\n2\n∣∣∣ pi, pj ]\n≤ 8n2e− S∆4 128/T+16∆2/3 ,\nand hence,\nPr [ E ] = ∑\np1,...,pK\nPr [E | p1, . . . , pK ] Pr [p1, . . . , pK ]\n≤ ( 8n2e − S∆4 128/T+16∆2/3 ) · ∑\np1,...,pK\nPr [p1, . . . , pK ]\n= 8n2e − S∆4 128/T+16∆2/3 .\nThis completes the proof."

There are two possible situations that we need to consider.\nCase 1: For any vertex iv ∈ B̂i and jv ∈ B̂j , the estimate of the previous lemma wij (independent of (iv , jv)) is close to the ground truth wij def =w(uiv , ujv ). In other words, we want w(uiv , ujv ) to stay close for all iv ∈ B̂i and jv ∈ B̂j , so that the difference |wij − wij | remains small for all iv ∈ B̂i and jv ∈ B̂j . Case 2: Complement of case 1.\nTo encapsulate these two cases, we first define the event\nE = { |wij − wij | ≤ 8∆1/2L1/4,∀iv ∈ B̂i, jv ∈ B̂j }\nand define E be the complement of E . Then,\nPr [ |ŵij − wij | > 8∆1/2L1/4 ] = Pr [ |ŵij − wij | > 8∆1/2L1/4 ∣∣∣ E ] Pr [E ]\n+ Pr [ |ŵij − wij | > 8∆1/2L1/4 ∣∣∣ E ] Pr [ E ]\n≤ Pr [ |ŵij − wij | > 8∆1/2L1/4 ∣∣∣ E ] + Pr [ E ] .\nSo it remains to bound the two probabilities.\nConditioning on E , it holds that wij − ǫ ≤ wij ≤ w + ǫ.\nFix a vertex pair (iv , jv), we note that G1[iv, jv], . . . , G2T [iv , jv] are independent Bernoulli random variable with common mean w(uiv , ujv ). Denote\nŵij = 1\n2T |B̂i||B̂j |\n2T∑\nt=1\n∑\nix∈B̂i\n∑\njx∈B̂j\nGt[ix, jx],\nthen by Hoeffding inequality we have\nPr [ ŵij −wij > 2ǫ ∣∣∣ E ] = Pr [ ŵij > wij + 2ǫ ∣∣∣ E ]\n≤ Pr [ ŵij > wij + ǫ ∣∣∣ E ]\n≤ e−2(2T |B̂i ||B̂j |ǫ2),\nand similarly Pr [ ŵij − wij < −2ǫ ∣∣∣ E ] ≤ e−2(2T |B̂i | |B̂j |ǫ2). Therefore,\nPr [ |ŵij − wij | > 2ǫ ∣∣∣ E ] ≤ 2e−2(2T |B̂i | |B̂j |ǫ2).\nSubstituting ǫ = 4∆1/2L1/4, we have\nPr [ |ŵij − wij | > 8∆1/2L1/4 ∣∣∣ E ] ≤ 2e−128(|B̂i | |B̂j |(2T ) √ L∆).\nThe second probability is bounded as follows. Since E is the complement of E , it is bounded by the probability where at least one (iv, jv) violates the condition. Therefore,\nPr [ E ] = Pr [ at least one iv, jv s.t. |w(uiv , ujv )− wij | > 8∆1/2L1/4 ]\n≤ ∑\niv∈B̂i\n∑\njv∈B̂j\nPr [ |w(uiv , ujv )− wij | > 8∆1/2L1/4 ]\n≤ 32|B̂i|2|B̂j |2e− S∆4 32/T+8∆2/3 .\nFinally, by combining the above results we have\nPr [ |ŵij − wij | > 8∆1/2L1/4 ] ≤ 2e−256(T |B̂i | |B̂j | √ L∆) + 32|B̂i|2|B̂j |2e− S∆4 32/T+8∆2/3 .\nLemma 3. Let B̂i = {i1, i2, . . . , i|B̂i|} and B̂j = {j1, j2, . . . , j|B̂j |} be two clusters returned by the Algorithm. Suppose that {ui1 , ui2 , . . . , ui|B̂i|} and {uj1 , uj2 , . . . , uj|B̂j |} are the ground truth labels of the vertices in B̂i and B̂j , respectively.

Let Ik = [αk−1, αk] for k = 1, . . . ,K be a sequence of intervals such that Ii ∩ Ij = ∅ and ∪Ii = [0, 1]. Suppose that w is piecewise Lipschitz continuous and differentiable in Ik. For any ui, uj ∈ [0, 1], define\nfij(x) = (w(x, ui)−w(x, uj))2\ngij(y) = (w(ui, y)−w(uj , y))2 , and\nhij(x, y) = 1\n2 [fij(x) + gij(y)] .\nLet δ = min k=1,...,K\n|αk − αk−1|. If\ndcij =\n∫ 1\n0\nfij(x)dx ≤ ǫ 2\n8L , and drij =\n∫ 1\n0\ngij(y)dy ≤ ǫ 2\n8L ,\nfor some constant 0 < ǫ < 2δL, then\nsup x∈[0,1] fij(x) ≤ ǫ, and sup y∈[0,1] gij(y) ≤ ǫ.\nHence, sup (x,y)∈[0,1]2\nhij(x, y) ≤ ǫ.\nProof. Since hij(x, y) is separable, it is sufficient to prove for fij(x).\nFix i and j, and let fsupij = sup x∈[0,1] fij(x). Let Ik = [αk−1, αk] be the interval such that f sup ij is attained, and let δk = |αk − αk−1| be the width of the interval. Consider a neighborhood surrounding the center of Ik with radius δk/2− θ, where 0 < θ < δk/2. Then define\nfsupij (θ) = sup x∈[αk−1+θ,αk−θ] fij(x).\nIt is clear that fsupij = lim θ→0 fsupij (θ).\nThe set [αk−1 + θ, αk − θ] is compact, so there exists xmaxij (θ) ∈ [αk−1 + θ, αk − θ] such that fsupij = fij(x max ij ). Assume, without lost of generality, that x max ij (θ) + δk/2− θ (i.e., xmaxij is in the lower half of the interval). For any 0 < ǫ0 < ǫ4L − θ ≤ δ2 − θ ≤ δk 2\n− θ, hij(x max ij (θ))− hij(xmaxij (θ) + ǫ0)\nǫ0 =\n(w(i, xmaxij )− w(j, xmaxij ))2 − (w(i, xmaxij (θ) + ǫ0)− w(j, xmaxij (θ) + ǫ0))2 ǫ0 ≤\n(w(i, xmaxij )−w(j, xmaxij ))2 − (w(i, xmaxij ) + Lǫ0 − w(j, xmaxij ) + Lǫ0)2 ǫ0\n≤ 4L(w(j, xmaxij )− w(i, xmaxij )) ≤ 4L ⇒\nfij(x max ij (θ))− fij(xmaxij (θ) + ǫ0)\nǫ0 ≤ 4L,\nwhich implies that\nfij(x max ij (θ))− 4Lǫ0 ≤ fij(xmaxij (θ) + ǫ0).\nIntegrating both sides with respect to ǫ0 with limits 0 and ǫ4L − θ yields\nfij(x max ij (θ)) ( ǫ 4L − θ ) − 4L 2 ( ǫ 4L − θ )2 ≤ ∫ ǫ 4L −θ\n0\nfij(x max ij (θ) + ǫ0)dǫ0\n≤ ∫ 1\n0\nfij(x)dx = d c ij .\nTherefore,\nfij(x max ij (θ)) ≤ dcij ǫ 4L − θ + 2L ( ǫ 4L − θ ) ,\nand hence\nfsupij = lim θ→0 fsupij (θ) = lim θ→0 fij(x max ij (θ)) ≤ 4Ldcij ǫ + ǫ 2 .\nIt then follows that if dcij ≤ ǫ 2 8L , then fsupij ≤ ǫ.\nDefinition 2. The mean squared error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are defined as\nMSE(ŵ) = 1\nn2\nn∑\niv=1\nn∑\njv=1\n(w(uiv , ujv )− ŵiv ,jv )2 (27)\nMAE(ŵ) = 1\nn2\nn∑\niv=1\nn∑\njv=1\n|w(uiv , ujv )− ŵiv ,jv | . (28)\nTheorem 3. If S ∈ Θ(n) and ∆n ∈ ω ((\nlog(n) n\n) 1 4 ) ∩ o(1), then\nlim n→∞ E[MAE(ŵ)] = 0 and lim n→∞ E[MSE(ŵ)] = 0. (29)\nProof. Suppose that the algorithm is executed for a set of observed graphs with n vertices using parameters ∆n and S. Let K′n be the number of blocks generated. Assume that, as n → ∞, the parameters satisfy S ∈ Θ(n) and ∆n ∈ ω (( log(n)\nn\n) 1 4 ) ∩ o(1).\nThe proof is based on (4). The intuition is to that that the two terms ∑\niv ,jv∈E 2e −c1(T |B̂i| |B̂j |∆) and\n32|E|n4e− S∆4 16/T+8∆2/3 vanish as n → ∞. The latter is clear if S ∈ Θ(n) and ∆n ∈ ω ((\nlog(n) n\n) 1 4 ) ∩ o(1).\nFor the first term, it is necessary to consider the size |E|, which is the size of the cluster generated. We show that the number of small clusters is asymptotically irrelevant. Most of the error come from vertices whose cluster is large enough to make e − S∆4 32/T+8∆2/3 vanish.\nFrom Theorem 2, we have\nPr [ K′ > QL √ 2\n∆n\n] ≤ 8n2e− S∆4n 128/T+16∆2n/3 .\nLet En be the event that K′n ≤ QL √ 2/∆n. Then limn→∞ Pr[En] = 1.\nSuppose En happens and define rn as the number of blocks with less than n∆ 2 n\nQL √ 2 elements. Let Vn be the union\nof these blocks, and define V n be the complement of Vn. Then,\n|Vn| ≤ rn n∆ 2 n\nQL √ 2 ≤ K′n\nn∆2n\nQL √ 2 ≤ n∆n.\nSo, |Vn|/n ≤ ∆n. Now, let’s consider MAE.\nMAE = 1\nn2\n∑\niv∈V\n∑\njv∈V |w(uiv , ujv )− ŵiv ,jv |\n= 1\nn2\n∑\niv∈Vn\n∑\njv∈Vn\n|w(uiv , ujv )− ŵiv ,jv |+ 1\nn2\n∑\niv∈V n\n∑\njv∈V n\n|w(uiv , ujv )− ŵiv ,jv |+\n+ 1\nn2\n∑\niv∈V n\n∑\njv∈Vn\n|w(uiv , ujv )− ŵiv ,jv |+ 1\nn2\n∑\niv∈Vn\n∑\njv∈V n\n|w(uiv , ujv )− ŵiv ,jv |\n≤ |Vn| 2\nn2 + |Vn| n |V n| n + |V n| n |Vn| n + 1 n2\n∑\niv∈V n\n∑\njv∈V n\n|w(uiv , ujv )− ŵiv ,jv |\n≤ 1 n2\n∑\niv∈V n\n∑\njv∈V n\n|w(uiv , ujv )− ŵiv ,jv |+∆2n + 2∆n\n≤ 1 n2\n∑\niv∈V n\n∑\njv∈V n\n|w(uiv , ujv )− ŵiv ,jv |+ 3∆n.\nSimilar result holds for MSE:\nMSE = 1\nn2\n∑\niv∈V\n∑\njv∈V (w(uiv , ujv )− ŵiv ,jv )2 ≤\n1\nn2\n∑\niv∈V n\n∑\njv∈V n\n(w(uiv , ujv )− ŵiv ,jv )2 + 3∆n.\nTherefore, using Lemma 4 with E = V n:\nPr [ MAE(ŵ) > c0 √ ∆n + 3∆n ∣∣∣ E ] ≤ Pr\n\n 1 n2\n∑\niv∈V n\n∑\njv∈V n\n|w(uiv , ujv )− ŵiv ,jv |+ 3∆n > c0 √ ∆n + 3∆n ∣∣∣ E\n\n\n≤ 1 Pr[E ] Pr\n\n 1 |V n|2\n∑\niv∈V n\n∑\njv∈V n\n|w(uiv , ujv )− ŵiv ,jv | > c0 √ ∆n ∣∣∣ E\n\n\n≤ 1 Pr[E ]\n  ∑\niv∈V n\n∑\njv∈V n\n2e−256(T |B̂i | |B̂j | √ L∆) + 64|V n|n4e− S∆4 32/T+8∆2/3\n\n .\nand\nPr [ MSE(ŵ) > c0 √ ∆n + 3∆n ∣∣∣ E ] ≤ 1\nPr[E ]\n  ∑\niv∈V n\n∑\njv∈V n\n2e−256(T |B̂i | |B̂j | √ L∆) + 64|V n|n4e− S∆2 32/T+8∆/3\n\n .\nSo,\nlim n→∞\nPr [ MAE(ŵ) > c0 √ ∆n + 3∆n ∣∣∣ E ] Pr [E ] = 0.\nSince limn→∞ ∆n = 0 and limn→∞ Pr[En] = 1, it holds that for any ǫ > 0, lim\nn→∞ Pr[MAE(ŵ) > ǫ] = 0.\nFinally, since ŵ is bounded in [0, 1],\nE[MAE(ŵ)] ≤ ǫPr[MAE(ŵ) ≤ ǫ] + Pr[MAE(ŵ) > ǫ]. Sending ǫ → ∞,\nlim n→∞ E[MAE(ŵ)] ≤ lim n→∞ Pr[MAE(ŵ) > ǫ] = 0.\nSame arguments hold for MSE."

The key object that defines an ExGM is often referred to as a graphon. This non-parametric perspective on network modeling poses challenging questions on how to make inference on the graphon underlying observed network data. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient procedure to estimate a graphon from a set of observed networks generated from it. This procedure is based on a stochastic blockmodel approximation (SBA) of the graphon. We show that, by approximating the graphon with a stochastic block model, the graphon can be consistently estimated, that is, the estimation error vanishes as the size of the graph approaches infinity.",
