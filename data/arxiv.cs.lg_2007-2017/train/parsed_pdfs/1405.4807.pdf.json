For general graphs, this problem is well-known to be NPhard (Shimony, 1994). However, due in part to its importance in practice, a large body of algorithms have been proposed to approximate MAP estimates by solving various convex relaxation formulations.\nAmong those methods based on convex surrogates, semidefinite relaxation usually strictly dominates other formulations based on linear programming or quadratic programming in terms of solution quality. Despite its superiority in obtaining more accurate estimates, however, the most significant challenge that limits the applicability of any semidefinite relaxation paradigm on real problems is efficiency. So far existing general-purpose SDP solvers can only handle problems with small dimensionality.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel semidefinite relaxation approach (referred to as SDR) for second-order MAP inference in pairwise undirected graphical models. Our key observation is that the marginalization constraints in a typical linear programming relaxation (c.f.(Kumar et al., 2009)) can be subsumed by combing a semidefinite conic constraint with a small set of linear constraints. As a result, SDR admits a concise set of nicely decoupled constraints, which allows us to develop an accelerated variant (referred as SDPAD-LR) of the alternating direction method of multipliers method (ADMM) that is scalable to very large-scale problems.\nOn a standard PC, we have successfully applied SDR on dense problems of dimensions of (#states × #variables) up to five thousand, and on grid-structured problems up to 105 variables each with dozens of states per node.\nPractically, SDPAD-LR performs remarkably well on a variety of problems. We have evaluated\nSDPAD-LR on two collections of benchmark datasets: OPENGM2 (Kappes et al., 2013a) and a probabilistic inference challenge (PIC, 2011). Each benchmark consists of multiple categories of problems derived from various MAP estimation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SDPAD-LR outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms in computational speed, while often obtaining better MAP estimates."

      "text" : "There is a vast literature concerning MAP estimation over discrete undirected graphical models and it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss all existing algorithms. Interested readers are referred to (Wainwright & Jordan, 2008) for an in-depth introduction to this topic. In the following, we focus on methods that involve convex relaxation, which are the most relevant to our approach.\nMany prior convex relaxation techniques are derived from the original graph structure underlying the MAP estimation problem, among which linear programming relaxation (LPR) methods (Chekuri et al., 2004; Wainwright et al., 2005) are the most popular. In addition to LPR, researchers have considered alternative convex relaxations, e.g., quadratic relaxation (QP-RL) (Ravikumar et al., 2010) and second-order cone relaxation (SOCP-MS) (Kumar et al., 2009). In the seminal work of (Kumar et al., 2009), the authors evaluate various convex relaxation approaches, and assert that LPR dominates QP-RL and SOCP-MS. However, as will be shown later, LPR is further dominated by a standard SDP relaxation (Wainwright & Jordan, 2008), which is one of the main foci of this paper.\nA recent line of approaches have aimed at obtaining tighter convex relaxations by incrementally adding higher-order interactions to enforce proper marginalization over groups of variables (Sontag et al., 2012; Komodakis & Paragios, 2008; Batra et al., 2011). Despite the practical success of these approaches, it remains an open problem to analyze their behavior — for example, to decide whether a polynomial number of clusters are sufficient.\nThere have been several attempts in applying semidefinite relaxation to obtain MAP assignment (Torr, 2003; Olsson et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2013; Peng et al., 2012). However, most of these methods are primarily designed for binary MAP estimation problems. In a recent work, (Peng et al., 2012) considered a general MAP estimation problem, where each variable has multiple states. The key difference between the proposed formulation and that of (Peng et al., 2012) is that we utilize the semidefinite cone constraint to prune redundant linear marginalization constraints. This leads to a concise set of loosely decoupled constraints, which is important in developing effective optimization paradigms."

Denote by xi = (xi,1, · · · , xi,m)⊤ ∈ {0, 1}m a binary vector such that xi,j = 1 if and only if xi = j.

These motivate us to relax the constraints in some appropriate manner, leading to our semidefinite relaxation. In the sequel, we present the proposed relaxation in a step-by-step fashion.\n1) In the same spirit as existing convex formulations (e.g., (Kumar et al., 2009; Peng et al., 2012)), we introduce a binary block matrix X := xx⊤ ∈ {0, 1}nm×nm\nto accommodate quadratic objective terms:\nX =\n\n    \nDiag(x1) X12 · · · X1n\nX⊤12 Diag(x2) ... ... ... · · · . . . ...

For the sake of numerical efficiency, we further relax the non-negative constraint X ≥ 0 to be\nX ij ≥ 0, (i, j) ∈ G. (5)\nAs we will see later, this relaxation is crucial in accelerating SDP solvers for large-scale problems.\nRemark 1. The non-negativity constraints described in (5) are necessary since otherwise SDR becomes loose for submodular functions.

Superiority over LP relaxations.\nCareful readers will remark that there might exist other convex constraints on X and x that we can enforce to tighten the proposed semidefinite relaxation. One alternative is the following marginalization constraints, which have been widely invoked in LP relaxation for MAP estimation:\nXij1 = 1, X ⊤ ij1 = 1, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. (10)\nSomewhat unexpectedly, these constraints turn out to be redundant, as asserted in the following theorem.\nTheorem 1. Any feasible solution X to SDR (i.e. any X obeying the feasibility constraints of SDR) necessarily satisfies\nXij1 = 1, X ⊤ ij1 = 1, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. (11)\nProof. See the supplemental material.\nIntuitively, this property arises from the following features of x and Xii:\nx⊤i · 1 = 1, Xii1 = xi, X ⊤ ii1 = 1, 1 ≤ i ≤ n.\nThese intrinsic properties are then propagated to all offdiagonal blocks by the semidefinite constraint.\n2.2.2. Invariance under variable reparameterization.\nPioneered by the beautiful relaxation proposed for the MAX-CUT problem (Goemans & Williamson, 1995), many SDP approaches developed for combinatorial problems employ the integer indicator y = 12 (1 + x) to parameterize binary variables (e.g., (Torr, 2003; Kumar et al., 2009)).

See the supplemental material.\nDespite the theoretical equivalence between SDR2 and SDR, from a numerical perspective, solving SDR2 is much harder than solving SDR. The difficulty arises from the complicated form of the linear constraints enforced by SDR2 (i.e., (12)). Note that the advantage of SDR2 is that all diagonal entries of Y are equal to 1 as follows\ndiag(Y ii) = 2(1+yi)−1−yi−yi = 1, ( 1 ≤ i ≤ n).\nNevertheless, none of prior SDP algorithms takes full advantage of this property in accelerating the algorithm."

      "text" : "The curse of dimensionality poses inevitable numerical challenges when applying general-purpose SDP solvers to solve SDR. Despite their superior accuracy, primal-dual interior point methods (IPM) like SDPT (Toh et al., 1999) are limited to small-scale problems (e.g. nm < 150 on a regular PC). More scalable solvers such as CSDP (Helmberg & Rendl, 2000) and DSDP (Benson & Ye, 2008) propose to solve the dual problem. However, since the non-negativity constraints Xij ≥ 0 produce numerous dual variables, these solvers are still far too restrictive for our program — none of them can solve SDR on a standard PC when nm exceeds 1000.\nThe limited scalability of interior point methods has inspired a flurry of activity in developing first-order methods, among which the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) (Wen et al., 2010; Boyd et al., 2011) proves well suited for large-scale problems. In this section, we propose an efficient variant of ADMM – referred to as SDPAD-LR (SDP Alternating Direction method for Low Rank structure), which is tailored to the special structure of SDR (including low rank and sparsity) and enables us to solve problems with very large dimensionality."

We let variables y, z, and S represent the corresponding dual variables for respective constraints. In the sequel, we will start by reviewing SDPAD, i.e., the original alternating direction method introduced in (Wen et al., 2010), and then present the key modification underlying the proposed efficient variant SDPAD-LR.\n3.1.1. SDPAD: Procedures and Convergence\nSDPAD considers the following augmented Lagrangian:\nL(y,z,S,X) = 〈b,y〉+ 〈 P⋆(z) + S −C −A⋆(y),X 〉\n+ (2µ)−1 ‖P⋆(z) + S −C −A⋆(y)‖2F ,\nwhere the penalty parameter µ controls the strength of the quadratic term. As suggested by (Boyd et al., 2011), we initialize µ with a small value, and gradually increase it throughout the optimization process.\nLet superscript (k) indicate the variable in the kth iteration. Each iteration of the SDPAD consists of a dual optimization step, followed by a primal update step given as follows\nX (k) = X (k−1) + P⋆(z(k)) + S(k) −C −A⋆(y(k))\nµ . (14)\nInstead of jointly optimizing all dual variables, the key idea of SDPAD is to decouple the dual optimization step into several sub-problems or, more specifically, to optimize\ny, z,S in order with other variables fixed. This leads to closed-form solutions for each sub-problem as follows\ny (k) = (AA∗)−1\n(\nA ( S(k−1) −C + µX (k−1)) − µb ) ,\nz (k) = P\n(\nC − S(k−1) − µX (k−1)\n)\n+ ,\nS (k) =\n(\nC +A⋆(y(k))− P⋆(z(k))− µX (k−1)\n)\n0 .\nSimilar to that considered in (Wen et al., 2010), our stopping criterion involves measuring of both primal feasibility ‖A(X (k) )− b‖ and dual feasibility µ(X (k) −X (k−1) ).\nConvergence property. In general, convergence properties of SDPAD are known when only equality constraints are present (Wen et al., 2010). However, the inequality constraints of SDR are special in the following two aspects:\n(i) They are element-wise non-negativity constraints;\n(ii) They are essentially decoupled from other linear constraints.\nProperty (ii) arises as all equality constraints are concerned with diagonal blocks of X , while all linear inequality constraints are only enforced on its off-diagonal blocks. Such special structure leads to theoretical convergence guarantees for SDPAD, as stated in the following theorem.\nTheorem 3. The SDPAD method presented above converges to the optimizer of SDR.\nProof. See the supplemental material.\n3.1.2. SDPAD-LR: Accelerated Method\nApparently, the most computationally expensive step of SDPAD is the update of S, which involves the eigendecomposition of an nm × nm matrix. This limits the applicability of SDPAD to large-scale problems (e.g. nm > 104). To bypass this numerical bottleneck, we modify SDPAD and present an efficient heuristic called SDPAD-LR, which exploits the low-rank structure of X .\nFirst, we observe that S can be alternatively expressed as\nS (k) = C +A⋆(y(k))− P⋆(z(k))− µ\n(\nX (k) −X (k−1)\n)\n.\nThis allows us to present SDPAD without invoking S. The detailed steps of SDPAD can now be summarized as in Algorithm 1.\nIt is straightforward to see that the bottleneck of Algorithm 1 lies in how to compute and store the primary variable X . To derive an efficient solver, we make the assumption that the optimal solution X ⋆ is low-rank. This is motivated by the empirical evidence that for a variety of problems (see the experimental section for details), SDR is\nAlgorithm 1 SDPAD for solving SDR\ninput: kmax = 1000, ǫ = 10−4, µmin = 10−3, ρ = 1.005. initialize: X(0) = X(−1) = 0, y(0) = 0, z(0) = 0 repeat\nX (k) temp = 2X (k−1) −X (k−2) t (k) temp = (AA ⋆)−1(A(X (k) temp)− b) y(k) = y(k−1) + µt (k) temp z(k) = ( z(k−1) − µP(X (k) temp) )\n+\nX (k) = ( X (k−1) − C +A⋆(y(k))−P⋆(z(k))\nµ\n)\n0\n(15) k ← k + 1; µ = µρ\nuntil min(µ‖X(k) − X(k−1)‖F, ‖A(X (k)\n) − b‖) ≤ ǫ or k > kmax\nexact, meaning rank(X ⋆ ) = 1. Moreover, in the general case, the rank of X ⋆\nis expected to be much small than its dimension (e.g. (Burer & Monteiro, 2003)), i.e.,\nrank ( X ⋆ )( rank(X ⋆ ) + 1 ) ≤ 2M,\nwhere M is the number of constraints.1 of SDPR.\nBased on this assumption, the key idea of SDPAD-LR is to invoke a low-rank matrix Y ∈ R(nm+1)×r for some small r and encode X = Y Y ⊤ throughout the iterative process. This allows us to keep all the variables in memory even for large-scale problems.\nIn this case, (15) is modified as Y (k) = U (k)Σ 1 2\n+, where Σ = Diag(σ1, · · · , σr) and U = (u1, · · · ,ur) represent the top r eigenvalues and respective eigenvectors of\nV (k) = Y (k−1)Y (k−1)⊤ −\nC +A⋆(y(k))− P⋆(z(k))\nµ . (16)\nAlthough V (k) is a dense matrix, its top eigenvectors can be efficiently computed using the Lanczos process (Cullum & Willoughby, 2002), whose efficiency is dictated by the complexity of the matrix multiplication operator V (k) : u ∈ Rnm+1 → V (k)u ∈ Rnm+1. As SDR only involves the constrains Xij ≥ 0, (i, j) ∈ E , the matrix C+A⋆(y(k))−P⋆(z(k)) turns our to share the same sparsity pattern with G. Thus, the complexity of computing V (k)u is at most O(nmr2 +m2|E|).\nTheoretically, it is extremely challenging to derive an upper bound on r to ensure the exactness of the modified algorithm. To address this issue, we thus design SDPAD-LR so that it iteratively doubles the value of r and reapplies the modified algorithm until it returns the optimal solution. For most of our experiments, we found that r = 8 is sufficient.\n1Practically, many negativity constraints are redundant.\nAlgorithm 2 SDPAD-LR for solving SDR\ninput: kmax = 5000, ǫ = 10−4, µmin = 10−3, ρ = 1.005, δ = 1e− 2, rmax = 32, r = 4. initialize: X(0) = X(−1) = 0, y(0) = 0, z(0) = 0 repeat\nX (k) temp = 2X (k−1) −X (k−2) t (k) temp = (AA ⋆)−1(A(X (k) temp)− b) y(k) = y(k−1) + µt (k) temp z(k) = ( z(k−1) − µP(X (k) temp) )\n+\nCompute X(k) according to (16) k ← k + 1; µ = ρµ if mod (k, 1000) = 0, λmin(X (k) ) > δλmax(X (k)\n) then\nr = min(rmax, 2r); µ = µmin end if\nuntil k > kmax or λmin(X (k) ) ≤ δλmax(X (k)\n) and min(µ‖X (k) −X (k−1) ‖F, ‖A(X (k) )− b‖) ≤ ǫ\nThe pseudo-code of SDPAD-LR is summarized in Algorithm 2."

Thus, rather than continuing until SDPAD-LR converges, it would be more efficient to shrink the problem size by fixing those variables whose optimal states are likely to have been revealed. Specifically, after each round of SDPAD-LR, we fix the optimal state j of a variable xi if xi,j > tmax (tmax = 0.99 for all the examples) or xi,j = max1≤i≤n,1≤j≤m xi,j .

However, MOSEK is not scalable to large data sets, as reported in Table 1. IPM-NC is scalable to large-scale problems, as the number variables involved is small.

In each block, the top element (which is tilted) describes −f of each method on each category, and the bottom block describes the percentage of obtaining the best solution. We can see that the overall performance of SDPAD-LR is superior to each other individual algorithm. Except on GM-Matching, SDPAD-LR is the top performing on each other dataset. In contrast, each existing method either does not apply or generates poor results on one or several datasets. This shows the advantage of solving a strong convex relaxation of the MAP inference problem. Below we break down the performance on each benchmark.\n• ORIENT. SDPAD-LR is the leading method on ORI-\nENT. The problems in ORIENT exhibit specific structures, i.e, the pair-wise potentials consist of approximately shifted permutation matrices. Experimentally, we found that SDR is usually tight on these problems. This explains the superior performance SDPAD-LR. In contrast, linear programming relaxations are not tight on ORIENT, and thus TRBP and TRWS only deliver moderate performance. Moreover, this structural pattern leads to huge search spaces for combinatorial algorithms (e.g., BRAOBB), and they can easily get stuck in local optimums.\n• Dense problems. SDPAD-LR also outperforms other methods on three dense categories from PIC. It achieves the best mean energy value as well as the highest percentage of obtaining the best solution. This again arises since SDR is tight on these problems.\n• Sparse problems. SDR yields comparable results with state-of-the-art algorithms on the three sparse categories from OPENGM2. GM-Label consists of problems where the standard LP relaxation is tight. On GM-Char which consists of large-scale binary problems, SDR is comparable to MCBC in the sense that SDR achieves a better mean energy value while MCBC attains a higher percentage of being the best solution. This arises because MCBC is a highly optimized solver designed for binary quadratic problems. On the other hand, SDPAD-LR is only an approximate SDP solver which, in some cases, may not converge to the global optimum due to numerical issues.\n• GM-Matching. SDR only yields moderate results on GM-Matching. This occurs because SDR is not tight on GM-Matching. In contrast, as GM-Matching is a small-scale problem, combinatorial optimization techniques such as BRAOBB and A-star are capable of finding globally optimal solutions.\nRunning Times. The running time of SDPAD-LR (includ-\ning the rounding procedure) is of the same scale as other convex relation techniques. As shown in Table 2, our preliminary Matlab implementation takes less than 10 mins on small-scale problems (i.e. those in PIC-Object, GMMatching and PIC-Label). On medium size problems, i.e., those in PIC-Folding, PIC-Align, GM-Char and ORIENT, the running time of SDPAD-LR ranges from 20 minutes to 1 hour. On large-scale problems from GM-Montage, SDPAD-LR takes around 8 hours on each problem. However, there is still huge room for improvement. One alternative is to use the eigenvalues computed in the previous iteration to accelerate the eigen-decomposition at the current iteration, which is left for future work."

      "heading" : "5. Conclusions",
      "text" : "In this paper, we have presented a novel semidefinite relaxation for second-order MAP estimation and proposed an efficient ADMM solver. We have extensively compared the proposed SDP solver with various state-of-the-art SDP solvers. Experimental results confirm that our SDP solver is much more scalable than prior approaches when applied to various MAP estimation problem, which enables us to apply SDR on large-scale datasets. Owing to the power of semidefinite relaxation, SDR proves superior to other top-performing MAP inference algorithms on a variety of benchmark datasets.\nThere are plenty of opportunities for future research. First, we would like to extend SDR to higher-order MAP problems. Moreover, it would be interesting to integrate SDR and combinatorial optimization techniques, which has the potential to boost the power of both. From the theoretical side, theoretical support for exact estimation with SDR would be one exciting direction for investigation. This would offer justification of the presented low-rank heuristic. On the other hand, as many combinatorial optimization problems can be formulated as MAP inference problems,\nsuch exact estimation conditions can shed light on the original combinatorial optimization problems."

    "abstractText" : "Maximum a posteriori (MAP) inference over discrete Markov random fields is a fundamental task spanning a wide spectrum of real-world applications, which is known to be NP-hard for general graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel semidefinite relaxation formulation (referred to as SDR) to estimate the MAP assignment. Algorithmically, we develop an accelerated variant of the alternating direction method of multipliers (referred to as SDPAD-LR) that can effectively exploit the special structure of the new relaxation. Encouragingly, the proposed procedure allows solving SDR for large-scale problems, e.g., problems on a grid graph comprising hundreds of thousands of variables with multiple states per node. Compared with prior SDP solvers, SDPAD-LR is capable of attaining comparable accuracy while exhibiting remarkably improved scalability, in contrast to the commonly held belief that semidefinite relaxation can only been applied on small-scale MRF problems. We have evaluated the performance of SDR on various benchmark datasets including OPENGM2 and PIC in terms of boththe quality of the solutions and computation time. Experimental results demonstrate that for a broad class of problems, SDPAD-LR outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in producing better MAP assignments in an efficient manner.",
