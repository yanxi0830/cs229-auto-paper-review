      "text" : "The main claim of this paper is that the Christoffel function (a tool from Approximation Theory) can prove to be very useful in statistics and Machine learning applications. The Christoffel function is associated with a finite measure and a degree parameter d. It has an important history of research with strong connection to orthogonal polynomials (Szego, 1974; Dunkl and Xu, 2001), interpolation and approximation theory (Nevai, 1986; De Marchi et al., 2014). Its typical asymptotic behavior as d increases is of particular interest because, in some specific settings, it provides very relevant information on the support and the density of the associated input measure. Important references include Máté and Nevai (1980); Máté et al. (1991); Totik (2000); Gustafsson et al. (2009) in a single dimension, Bos (1994); Bos et al. (1998); Xu (1999); Berman (2009); Kroo and Lubinsky (2013) for specific multivariate settings and Kroo and Lubinsky (2012) for ratii of mutually absolutely continuous measures. The topic is still a subject of active research, but regarding properties of the Christoffel function, a lot of information is already available.\nThe present work shows how properties of the Christoffel function can be used successfully in some statistics and Machine Learning applications. To the best of our our knowledge, this is the first attempt in such a context with the recent work of Lasserre and\nar X\niv :1\n70 1.\n02 88\n6v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 3\nPauwels (2016) and Malyshkin (2015). More precisely, we consider the empirical Christoffel function, a specific case where the input measure is a scaled counting measure uniformly supported on a set (a cloud) of datapoints. This methodology has three distinguishing features: (i) It is extremely simple and involves no optimization procedure, (ii) it scales linearly with the number of observations (one pass over the data is sufficient), and (iii) it is affine invariant. These three features prove to be especially important in all the applications that we consider.\nIn Lasserre and Pauwels (2016) we have exhibited a striking property of some distinguished family of sum-of-squares (SOS) polynomials (Qd)d∈N, indexed by their degree (2d ∈ N), and easily computed from empirical moments associated with a cloud of n points in Rp which we call X. The associated family of sublevel sets Sα,d = {x : Qd(x) ≤ α}, for various values of α > 0, approximates the global shape of original cloud of points X. The degree index d can be used as a tuning parameter, trading off regularity of the polynomial Qd with the fitness of the approximation of the shape of X (as long as the cloud contains sufficiently many points). Remarkably, even with relatively low degree d, the sets Sα,d capture acurately the shape of X, and so provides a compact (algebraic) encoding of the cloud.\nIn fact the reciprocal function x 7→ Qd(x)−1 is precisely the Christoffel function Λµn,d associated to the empirical counting measure supported on X and the degree index d. Some properties of the Christoffel function stemming from approximation theory suggest that it could be exploited in a statistical learning context by considering its empirical counterpart. The purpose of this work is to push this idea further. In particular we investigate (a) further properties of the Christoffel function which prove to be relevant in some machine learning applications, (b) statistical properties of the empirical Christoffel function as well as (c) further applications to well known machine learning tasks.\nContributions\nThis paper significantly extends Lasserre and Pauwels (2016) in several directions. Indeed our contribution is threefold:\nI. We first provide a thresholding scheme which allows to approximate the compact support S of a measure with strong asymptotic guarantees. This result rigorously establishes the property that, as d increases, the scaled Christoffel function decreases to zero outside S and remains positive in the interior of S.\nII. In view of potential applications in statistics and machine learning we provide a rationale for using the empirical Christoffel function in place of its population counterpart in the limit of large sample size. We consider a compactly supported population measure µ as well as an empirical measure µn uniformly supported on a sample of n vectors in Rp, drawn independently from µ. For each fixed d we show a highly desirable strong asymptotic property as n increases. Namely, the empirical Christofell function Λµn,d(·) converges, uniformly in x ∈ Rp, to Λµ,d(·), almost-surely with respect to the draw of the random sample.\nIII. We illustrate the benefits of the empirical Christoffel function in some important applications, mainly in statistics and machine learning. The rationale for such benefits builds on approximation properties of the Christoffel function combined with our consistency\nresult. In particular, we first show on simulated data that the Christoffel function can be useful for density estimation and support inference. In Lasserre and Pauwels (2016) we have described how the Christoffel function yields a simple procedure for intrusion detection in networks, and here we extend these results by performing a numerical comparison with well established methods for novelty detection on a real world dataset. Finally we show that the Christoffel function is also very useful to perform affine matching and inverse affine shuffling of a dataset.\nOrganisation of the paper\nSection 2 describes the notation and definitions which will be used throughout the paper. In Section 3 we introduce the Christoffel function, outline some of its known properties and describe our main theoretical results. Applications are presented in Section 4 where we consider both simulated and real world data as well as a comparison with well established machine learning methods. For clarity of exposition most proofs and technical details are postponed to the Appendix in Section 6."

      "text" : "We fix the ambient dimension to be p throughout the text. For example, we will manipulate vectors in Rp as well as p-variate polynomials with real coefficients. We denote by X a set of p variables X1, . . . , Xp which we will use in mathematical expressions defining polynomials. We identify monomials from the canonical basis of p-variate polynomials with their exponents in Np: we associate to α = (αi)i=1...p ∈ Np the monomial Xα := Xα11 X α2 2 . . . X αp p which degree is deg(α) := ∑p i=1 αi = |α|. We use the expressions <gl and ≤gl to denote the graded lexicographic order, a well ordering over p-variate monomials. This amounts to, first, use the canonical order on the degree and, second, break ties in monomials with the same degree using the lexicographic order with X1 = a,X2 = b . . . For example, the monomials in two variables X1, X2, of degree less or equal to 3 listed in this order are given by: 1, X1, X2, X 2 1 , X1X2, X 2 2 , X 3 1 , X 2 1X2, X1X 2 2 , X 3 2 .\nWe denote by Npd, the set {α ∈ N p; deg(α) ≤ d} ordered by ≤gl. R[X] denotes the set of p-variate polynomials: linear combinations of monomials with real coefficients. The degree of a polynomial is the highest of the degrees of its monomials with nonzero coefficients1. We use the same notation, deg(·), to denote the degree of a polynomial or of an element of Np. For d ∈ N, R[X]d denotes the set of p-variate polynomials of degree at most d. We set s(d) = ( p+d d ) , the number of monomials of degree less or equal to d.\nWe will denote by vd(X) the vector of monomials of degree less or equal to d sorted by ≤gl, i.e., vd(X) := (Xα)α∈Npd ∈ R[X] s(d) d . With this notation, we can write a polynomial P ∈ R[X]d as P (X) = 〈p,vd(X)〉 for some real vector of coefficients p = (pα)α∈Npd ∈ R s(d) ordered using ≤gl. Given x = (xi)i=1...p ∈ Rp, P (x) denotes the evaluation of P with the assignments X1 = x1, X2 = x2, . . . Xp = xp. Given a Borel probability measure µ and\n1. For the null polynomial, we use the convention that its degree is 0 and it is ≤gl smaller than all other monomials.\nα ∈ Np, yα(µ) denotes the moment α of µ, i.e., yα(µ) = ∫ Rp x\nαdµ(x). Finally for δ > 0 and every x ∈ Rp, let Bδ(x) := {x : ‖x‖ ≤ δ} be the closed Euclidean ball of radius δ and centered at x. We use the shorthand notation B to denote the closed Euclidean unit ball. Recall that its Lebesgue volume vol(Bδ(x)) satisfies:\nvol(Bδ(x)) = π p 2 Γ (p 2 + 1 )δp, ∀x ∈ Rp.\nFurthermore, let ωp := 2π\np+1 2\nΓ( p+12 ) denote the surface of the p dimensional unit sphere in\nRp+1. Throughout the paper, we will only consider measures of which all moments are finite.\nMoment matrix\nFor a finite Borel measure µ on Rp denote by sup(µ) its support, i.e., the smallest closed set Ω ⊂ Rp such that µ(Rp \\Ω) = 0. The moment matrix of µ, Md(µ), is a matrix indexed by monomials of degree at most d ordered by ≤gl. For α, β ∈ Npd, the corresponding entry in Md(µ) is defined by Md(µ)α,β := yα+β(µ), the moment ∫ xα+βdµ of µ. When p = 2, letting yα = yα(µ) for α ∈ N24, we have\nM2(µ) :\n1 X1 X2 X 2 1 X1X2 X 2 2\n1 1 y10 y01 y20 y11 y02 X1 y10 y20 y11 y30 y21 y12 X2 y01 y11 y02 y21 y12 y03 X21 y20 y30 y21 y40 y31 y22 X1X2 y11 y21 y12 y31 y22 y13 X22 y02 y12 y03 y22 y13 y04 .\nThe matrix Md(µ) is positive semidefinite for all d ∈ N. Indeed, for any p ∈ Rs(d), let P ∈ R[X]d be the polynomial with vector of coefficients p; then pTMd(µ)p = ∫ Rp P (x)\n2dµ(x) ≥ 0. We also have the identity Md(µ) = ∫ Rp vd(x)vd(x)\nTdµ(x) where the integral is understood elementwise.\nSum of squares (SOS)\nWe denote by Σ[X] ⊂ R[X] (resp. Σ[X]d ⊂ R[X]d), the set of polynomials (resp. polynomials of degree at most d) which can be written as a sum of squares of polynomials. Let P ∈ R[X]2m for some m ∈ N, then P belongs to Σ[X]2m if there exists a finite J ⊂ N and a family of polynomials Pj ∈ R[X]m, j ∈ J , such that P = ∑ j∈J P 2 j . It is obvious that sum of squares polynomials are always nonnegative. A further interesting property is that this class of polynomials is connected with positive semidefiniteness. Indeed, P belongs to Σ[X]2m if and only if\n∃Q ∈ Rs(m)×s(m), Q = QT , Q 0, P (x) = vm(x)TQvm(x), ∀x ∈ Rp. (2.1)\nAs a consequence, every real symmetric positive semidefinite matrix Q ∈ Rs(m)×s(m) defines a polynomial in Σ[X]2m by using the representation (2.1).\nOrthonormal polynomials\nWe define a classical (Szego, 1974; Dunkl and Xu, 2001) family of orthonormal polynomials, {Pα}α∈Npd ordered according to ≤gl, which satisfies for all α ∈ N p d\n〈Pα, Pβ〉µ = δα=β, 〈Pα, Xβ〉µ = 0, if β <gl α, 〈Pα, Xα〉µ > 0. (2.2)\nExistence and uniqueness of such a family is guaranteed by the Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization process following the ≤gl ordering on monomials and by the positivity of the moment matrix, see for instance Dunkl and Xu (2001) Theorem 3.1.11.\nLet Dd(µ) be the lower triangular matrix of which rows are the coefficients of the polynomials Pα defined in (2.2) ordered by ≤gl. It can be shown that Dd(µ) = Ld(µ)−T , where Ld(µ) is the Cholesky factorization of Md(µ). Furthermore, there is a direct relation with the inverse moment matrix as Md(µ) −1 = Dd(µ) TDd(µ) (Helton et al. (2008) Proof of Theorem 3.1)."

For every d, define the function κµ,d : Rp × Rp → R by:\n(x,y) 7→ κµ,d(x,y) := ∑ α∈Npd Pα(x)Pα(y) = vd(x) TMd(µ) −1vd(y), (3.1)\nwhere the family of polynomials {Pα}α∈Npd is defined in (2.2) and the last equality follows from properties of this family (see also Lasserre and Pauwels (2016)). The kernel (x,y) 7→ K(x,y) := ∑ α∈Np Pα(x)Pα(y) is a reproducing kernel on L2(µ) because\nPα(X) = ∫ K(X,y)Pα(y) dµ(y), ∀α ∈ Np,\nthat is, the (Pα) are eigenvectors of the associated operator on L2(µ), and so\np(X) = ∫ K(X,y) p(y) dµ(y), ∀p ∈ R[X].\nThe function x 7→ Λµ,d(x) := κµ,d(x,x)−1 is called the Christoffel function associated with µ and d ∈ N. The following result states a fundamental extremal property of the Christoffel function.\nTheorem 3.1 (see e.g. Dunkl and Xu (2001); Nevai (1986)) Let ξ ∈ Rp be fixed, arbitrary. Then\nΛµ,d(ξ) = min P∈R[X]d {∫ Rp P (x)2 dµ(x) : P (ξ) = 1 } . (3.2)\nThe Christoffel function plays an important role in orthogonal polynomials and the theory of interpolation and approximation, see e.g. Szego (1974); Dunkl and Xu (2001). One is particularly interested in the asymptotics of the normalized Christoffel function x 7→ s(d)Λµ,d(x) as d → ∞. The subject has a very long history in the univariate case, see Nevai (1986) for a detailed historical account prior to the 80’s. The first quantitative asymptotic result was given in Máté and Nevai (1980) and was latter improved by Máté et al. (1991) and Totik (2000). In the multivariate setting, precise results are known in some particular cases such as balls, spheres and simplices (Bos, 1994; Bos et al., 1998; Xu, 1996, 1999; Kroo and Lubinsky, 2013) but much remains to be done for the general multivariate case. A typical example of asymptotic result is given under quite general (and technical) conditions in Kroo and Lubinsky (2013, 2012). This work shows that, as d→∞, the limit of the ratii,\nΛν,d Λµ,d , of two Christofell functions associated to two mutually absolutely continuous\nmeasures µ and ν, converges to the density dνdµ(x) on the interior of their common support.\nRemark 3.2 Notice that Theorem 3.1 also provides a mean to compute the numerical value Λµ,d(x) for x ∈ Rn, fixed, arbitrary. Then indeed (3.2) is a convex quadratic programming problem which can be solved efficiently, even in high dimension using first order methods such as projected gradient descent and its stochastic variants. This is particularly interesting when the nonsingular moment matrix Md(µ) is large.\nWe next provide additional insights on Theorem 3.1 and solutions of (3.2).\nTheorem 3.3 For any ξ ∈ Rp, the optimization problem in (3.2) is convex with a unique optimal solution P ∗d ∈ R[X]d defined by\nP ∗d (X) = κµ,d(X, ξ)\nκµ,d(ξ, ξ) = Λµ,d(ξ)κµ,d(X, ξ). (3.3)\nIn addition,\nΛµ,d(ξ) = ∫ P ∗d (x) 2 dµ(x) = ∫ P ∗d (x) dµ(x) (3.4)\nΛµ,d(ξ)ξ α = ∫ xα P ∗d (x) dµ(x) α ∈ N p d. (3.5)\nThe proof is postponed to Section 6. Interestingly, each of the orthonormal polynomials (Pα)α∈Np also satisfies an important and well-known extremality property.\nTheorem 3.4 (see e.g. Szego (1974)) Let α ∈ Np be fixed, arbitrary and let d = |α|. Then up to a multiplicative positive constant, Pα is the unique optimal solution of\nmin P∈R[x]d  ∫ P 2(x) dµ(x) : P (x) = xα + ∑ β<gl α θβ x β for some {θβ}β<glα  . (3.6) Finally, we hilight the following important property which will be useful in the sequel.\nTheorem 3.5 (See e.g. Lasserre and Pauwels (2016)) Λµ,d is invariant by change of polynomial basis vd, change of the origin of Rp or change of basis in Rp."

      "text" : "In this section we consider the important case of the Lebesgue measure on a compact set S ⊂ Rp such that cl(int(S)) = S. It is known that in this case the Christoffel function encodes information on the set S; see for example the discussion in Section 3.1. In particular, the scaled Christoffel function remains positive on the interior of S. We push this idea further and present a new result asserting that it is possible to recover the set S with strong asymptotic garanties by carefuly thresholding the corresponding scaled Christoffel function.\nFor any measurable set A, denote by µA the uniform probability measure on A, that is µA = λA/λ(A) where λ is the Lebesgue measure and λA is its restriction to A (λA(A\n′) = λA∩A′ for any measurable set A ′).\nThreshold and asymptotics\nThe main idea is to use quantitative lower bounds on the scaled Christoffel function, s(d)ΛµS ,d, on the interior of S (Lemma 6.2) and upper bounds outside S (Lemma 6.6). In combining these bounds one proves the existence of a sequence of thresholds of the scaled Christoffel function which estimate S in a strongly consistent manner. Let us introduce the following notation and assumption.\nAssumption 3.6\n(a) S ⊂ Rp is a compact set such that cl(int(S)) = S.\n(b) {δk}k∈N is a decreasing sequence of positive numbers converging to 0. For every k ∈ N, let dk be the smallest integer such that:\n2 3− δkdk\nδk+diam(S)dpk\n( e\np\n)p exp ( p2\ndk\n) ≤ αk (3.7)\nwhere diam(S) denotes the diameter of the set S, and\nαk := δpkωp λ(S)\n(dk + 1)(dk + 2)(dk + 3)\n(dk + p+ 1)(dk + p+ 2)(2dk + p+ 6)\nRemark 3.7 (On Assumption 3.6)\n• dk is well defined. Indeed, since δk is positive, the left hand side of (3.7) goes to 0 as k →∞ while the right hand side remains bounded for increasing values of dk.\n• From the definition of dk and the fact that δk is decreasing, the sequence {dk}k∈N is non decreasing.\n• Given {δk}k∈N, computing dk can be done recursively and only requires the knowledge of diam(S) and λ(S).\n• A similar condition can be enforced if only upper bounds on diam(S) and on λ(S) are available. In this case, replace these quantities by their upper bounds in (3.7) to obtain a similar result.\nWe are now ready to state the first main result of this section whose proof is postponed to Section 6 for sake of clarity of exposition. Recall the definition of the Hausdorff distance dH(X,Y ) between two subsets X,Y of Rp:\ndH(X,Y ) = max { sup x∈X inf y∈Y dist(x,y), sup y∈Y inf x∈X dist(x,y) } .\nTheorem 3.8 Let S ⊂ Rp, {δk}k∈N, {αk}k∈N and {dk}k∈N satisfy Assumption 3.6. For every k ∈ N let Sk ⊂ Rp be the set defined by,\nSk := {x ∈ Rp : s(dk) ΛµS ,dk(x) ≥ αk} .\nThen dH(Sk, S)→ 0 as k →∞.\nExtension to more general probability measures\nTheorem 3.8 can easily be extended to probability measures that are more general than uniform distributions, in which case we consider the following alternative assumption.\nAssumption 3.9\n(a) S ⊂ Rp is a compact set such that cl(int(S)) = S.\n(b) The function w : int(S)→ [w−,+∞) is integrable on int(S) with w− > 0. The measure µ is such that for any measurable set A, µ(A) = ∫ A∩S w(x)dx and µ(S) = 1. {δk}k∈N\nis a decreasing sequence of positive numbers which limit is 0. For every k ∈ N, let dk be the smallest integer such that:\n2 3− δkdk\nδk+diam(S)dpk\n( e\np\n)p exp ( p2\ndk\n) ≤ αk (3.8)\nwhere\nαk := w−δ p kωp\n(dk + 1)(dk + 2)(dk + 3)\n(dk + p+ 1)(dk + p+ 2)(2dk + p+ 6) .\nUnder Assumption 3.8 we obtain the following analogue of Theorem 3.8.\nTheorem 3.10 Let S ⊂ Rp, w : S → [w−,+∞), {δk}k∈N, {αk}k∈N and {dk}k∈N satisfy Assumption 3.9.

Hence if one knows both the Christoffel function and the boundary effect term, one has access to the density term. Unfortunately, this boundary term is only known in specific situations, the most typical example being the Euclidean ball. Hence, in the present state of knowledge, one of the following is assumed to hold true.\n• The support of the population measure µ is S and limd→∞ s(d)ΛλS ,d exists (possibly unknown).\n• The support is unknown but contains a set S with the same property as above. In this case, we consider the restriction of the population measure µ to S.

Note that ΛλS ,d is easily derived from the moments of the uniform distribution on [−1, 1].\nThe result is presented in Figure 1 and a comparison is given with a classical technique, kernel density estimation (Rosenblatt, 1956; Parzen, 1962) with the Gaussian kernel. The result suggest that empirical Christoffel based density estimation is competitive with kernel density estimation in this setting.

      "text" : "In Lasserre and Pauwels (2016) we suggested that the empirical Christoffel function could be used for the purpose of detecting outliers and the claim was supported by some numerical experiments. The rationale for this is that the empirical Christoffel function encodes information about the population density and outliers can be seen as samples from low density areas. We follow the same line and consider the network intrusion detection task described in Williams et al. (2002) based on the KDD cup 99 dataset (Lichman, 2013). Following the pre-processing described in Williams et al. (2002); Lasserre and Pauwels (2016), we build up five datasets consisting of network connections represented by labeled vectors in R3 where each label indicates wether the connection was an attack or not.\nDataset http smtp ftp-data ftp other\nNumber of examples 567498 95156 30464 4091 5858 Proportions of attacks 0.004 0.0003 0.023 0.077 0.016\nAll the experiments described in this section are performed on the “other” dataset which is the most heterogeneous. The main task is to recover attacks from the collection of points in R3, ignoring the labels, and then compare the predictions with the ground thruth (given by the labels). We compare different methods, each of them assign a score to an individual, the higher the score, the more likely the individual is to be an outlier, or an attack. The metric that we use to compare different methods is the area under the Precision Recall curve (AUPR); see for example Davis and Goadrich (2006). We compare three different methods, each of them producing a score reflecting some degree of outlyingness.\n• Empirical Christoffel function.\n• Kernel density estimation (Rosenblatt, 1956; Parzen, 1962) with Gaussian kernel. The value of the density estimated at each datapoint is used as an outlyingness score.\n• One-class SVM (Schölkopf et al., 2001) with Gaussian kernel. The value of the estimated decision function at each datapoint is used as an outlyingness score. We used the implementation provided in the kernlab package Zeileis et al. (2004).\nThe first two methods involve only a single parameter while the last method requires two parameters to be tuned. The results are given in Table 1 and the corresponding curves can be found in Section 6.4. Table 1 suggest that one-class SVM and the empirical Christoffel perform similarly and clearly outperform the kernel density estimation approach. It is worth noticing here that the one-class SVM provides slightly better performances but requires a precise tuning of the second parameter."

      "heading" : "4.5 Inversion of affine shuffling",
      "text" : "This last application has fewer connections with statistics. Suppose that we are given two matrices X ∈ Rp×n and X′ ∈ Rp×n. Furthermore, we know that there exists an invertible affine mapping A : Rp → Rp such that after a potential permutation of the columns, A defines a bijection between the columns of X′ and those of X. The problem is to recover the correspondence between the columns of X and the columns of X′, whence the name “affine shuffling inversion”. Note that the columns may be shuffled in an arbitrary way and therefore the matching problem is not trivial. In this setting we can use the affine invariance\nproperty of the Christoffel function described in Theorem 3.5. This is based on the two following observations.\n• The Christoffel function only depends on the empirical moments and hence is not sensitive to reshufling of the columns.\n• Working with the affine image amounts to perform a change of basis and a change of origin. By Theorem 3.5, the evaluation of the Christoffel function does not change.\nThis suggests the following procedure.\n• Compute ΛX,d and ΛX′,d the Christoffel functions associated to the columns of X and the columns of X′ respectively.\n• Set A ∈ Rn to be the vector which i-th entry is ΛX,d(Xi) where Xi is the i-th column of X. Set A′ similarly.\n• Match the values in A to the values in A′ according to their rank.\nThe proposed procedure defines a unique permutation between columns of X and columns of X′ when there are no ties in the vectors A and A′. In this case, Theorem 3.5 ensures that we have found the correct correspondance. In case of ties, the procedure does not allow to elicit completely the correspondance matching. Overall, the method is not garanteed to work but allows to treat simple cases easily. Investigating the robustness of this procedure to noise or to matching mispecification is the subject of future research.\nAn illustration is given in Figure 3 where a moon shaped cloud of points in R2 is deformed by an affine transformation and the matching between the points between the two clouds is recovered by matching the corresponding Christoffel function values. The correspondance between Christoffel function values is illustrated on a quantile quantile plot."

      "heading" : "5. Conclusion",
      "text" : "In this paper we have investigated the potential of the empirical Christoffel function for some applications in statistics and machine learning. This question led us to investigate its theoretical properties as well as potential paths toward applications, mostly in a statistical framework.\nOn the theoretical side, we proposed two main contributions. The first one provides an explicit thresholding scheme which allows to use the Christoffel function to recover the support of a measure with strong asymptotic guarantees. Although this property finds its root in the long history of results regarding asymptotic properties of the Christoffel function, we have provided a systematic way to tune the threshold and the degree to ensure strong convergence guarantees. The second main contribution relates the empirical Christoffel function to its population counterpart in the limit of large samples. This type of results is new and paves the way toward a much more precise understanding of relations between these two objects in a small sample setting.\nOn the practical side, we have illustrated the relevance of the Christoffel function as a practical tool in a machine learning context. In particular, simulations and experiments on real world data support our claim that the empirical Christoffel function is potentially\nuseful for density estimation, support inference and outlier detection. Finally, in another application outside the statistical framework (detection of affine matching between two clouds of points), we have again illustrated the potential of the Christoffel function as a tool in shape recognition and shape comparison.\nBoth theory and applications suggest a broad research program. As already mentioned, an important issue is to quantify the deviation of the empirical Christofel function from its population counterpart in a finite sample setting. Results in this direction could have both theoretical and practical impacts and would to compare more accurately the performance of Christoffel-based approaches with state-of-the art methods. Furthermore, the use of the Christoffel function in a statistical framework raises questions specific to each application considered in this paper and will be the subject of future investigations. Finally, there are still important open questions on the Christoffel function itself and works in the line of Berman (2009) are of great interest to address applications in statistics."

We argue by contradiction, for the rest of the proof, M denotes a fixed positive number which value can change between expressions. Suppose that (6.11) is false. This means that for each k ∈ N (up to a subsequence), we can find xk ∈ S which satisfies\ndist(xk, Sk) ≥M (6.12)\nSince xk ∈ S and S is compact, the sequence (xk)k∈N has an accumulation point x̄ ∈ S, i.e., (up to a subsequence) xk → x̄ as k → ∞. Since dist(·, Sk) is a Lipschitz function, combining with (6.12), for every k ∈ N (up to a subsequence),\ndist(x̄, Sk) ≥M. (6.13)\nWe next show that (6.13) contradicts the assumption S = cl(int(S)).

Up to a rearrangment of\nthe terms, we may assume that dist(yl, ∂S) is decreasing and dist(y0, ∂S) ≥ δ0. For all l, denote by kl the smallest integer such that dist(yl, ∂S) ≥ δkl . We must have kl → ∞ and we can discard terms so that kl is a valid subsequence. We have constructed a subsequence kl such that for every l ∈ N, yl ∈ Skl and yl → x̄. This is in contradiction with (6.13) and hence (6.11) must be true. The result follows by combining (6.10) and (6.11).\nRemark 6.7 (Refinements) The proof of Theorem 3.8 is based on the following fact{ x ∈ Rp : dist(x, S̄) ≥ δk } ⊆ Sk ⊆ {x ∈ Rp : dist(x, S) ≤ δk} .\nDepending on the regularity of the boundary ∂S of S, it should be possible to get sharper bounds on the distance as a function of δk. This should involve the dependency in δ of the function\nδ → dH ({ x ∈ Rp : dist(x, S̄) ≥ δ } , ∂S ) .\nFor example, if the boundary ∂S has bounded curvature, this function is equal to δ for sufficiently small δ.

The result follows from (6.15), (6.19) and Theorem 3.1.\n6.3.2 Proof of Theorem 3.11\n. Proof First let us consider measurability issues. Fix n and d such that Md(µ) is invertible. Let X be a matrix in Rp×n, we use the shorthand notation\nΛX,d(z) = min P∈Rd[x], P (z)=1\n1\nn n∑ i=1 P (Xi) 2, (6.20)\nwhere for each i, Xi is the i-th column of the matrix X. This corresponds to the empirical Christoffel function with input data given by the columns of X. Consider the function F : Rp×n → [0, 1] defined as follows:\nF : X→ sup z∈Rp |Λµ,d(z)− ΛX,d(z)| . (6.21)\nIt turns out that F is a semi-algebraic function (its graph is a semi-algebraic set). Roughly speaking a set is semi-algebraic if it can be defined by finitely many polynomial inequalities. We refer the reader to Coste (2000) for an introduction to semi-algebraic geometry, we mostly rely on content from Chapter 2. First, the function\n(X, z, P )→ 1 n n∑ i=1 P (Xi) 2\nis semi-algebraic (by identifying the space of polynomials with the Euclidean space of their coefficients) and the set {(P, z) : P (z) = 1} is also semi-algebraic. Partial minimization can be expressed by a first order formula, and, by Tarski-Seidenberg Theorem (see e.g. (Coste, 2000, Theorem 2.6)), this operation preserves semi-algebraicity. Hence, the function (X, z) → ΛX,d(z) is semi-algebraic. Furthermore, Theorem 3.1 ensures that Λµ,d(z) = 1/κ(z, z) for any z, where κ(z, z) is a polynomial in z and hence z → Λµ,d(z) is semi-algebraic. Finally absolute value is semi-algebraic and using a partial minimization argument again, we have that F is a semi-algebraic function.\nAs a semi-algebraic function, F is Borel measurable. Indeed, using the good sets principle (Ash (1972) §1.5.1, p. 35) it is sufficient to prove that, for an arbitrary interval2 (a, b] ⊂ [0, 1], F−1((a, b]) ∈ B(Rp×n). Any such set is the pre-image of a semi-algebraic set by a semialgebraic map. As proved in (Coste, 2000, Corollary 2.9), any such set must be semialgebraic and hence measurable. Thus, with the notations of Theorem 3.11, ‖Λµn,d−Λµ,d‖∞ is indeed a random variable for each fixed n, d such that Md(µ) is invertible.\nWe now turn to the proof of the main result of the Theorem. For simplicity we adopt the following notation for the rest of the proof. For any continuous function f : Rp → R, and any subset V ⊆ Rp,\n‖f‖V := sup x∈V |f(x)|, [ so that ‖f‖Rp = ‖f‖∞], (6.22)\nwhich could be infinite. We prove that for any > 0,\nP (lim supn {‖Λµn,d − Λµ,d‖Rp ≥ }) = 0, (6.23)\nwhere the probability is taken with respect to the random choice of the sequence of independent samples from µ and the limit supremum is understood setwise with respect to the underlying events.\nFix > 0. Denote by S the compact support of µ. Note that S is also the support of µn with probability one. From Lemma 6.8, we have an upper bound on both Λµn,d and Λµ,d of order O ( dist(x, conv(S))−2 ) which holds with probability one. Hence, it is possible to find a compact set V containing S (with complement V c = Rn \\ V ) such that, almost surely,\nmax { ‖Λµn,d‖V c , ‖Λµ,d‖V c } ≤\n2 . (6.24)\nNext, we have the following equivalence ‖Λµn,d − Λµ,d‖Rp ≥ ⇔ { ‖Λµn,d − Λµ,d‖V ≥ or ‖Λµn,d − Λµ,d‖V c ≥\n(6.25)\nOn the other hand, since both functions are non negative, from equation (6.24), almost surely,\n‖Λµn,d − Λµ,d‖V c ≤ max { ‖Λµn,d‖V c , ‖Λµ,d‖V c } ≤\n2 . (6.26)\n2. Recall that the Borel σ-field B([0, 1]) is generated by the intervals (a, b] of [0, 1]; see Ash (1972) §1.4.6, p. 27.\nHence the second event in the right hand side of (6.25) occurs with probability zero. As a consequence, except for a set of events of measure zero, we have\n‖Λµn,d − Λµ,d‖Rp ≥ ⇔ ‖Λµn,d − Λµ,d‖V ≥ ,\nwhich in turn implies\nP (lim supn {‖Λµn,d − Λµ,d‖Rp} ≥ ) = P (lim supn {‖Λµn,d − Λµ,d‖V } ≥ ) . (6.27)\nBy assumption the moment matrix Md(µ) is invertible and by the strong law of large numbers, almost surely, Md(µn) must be invertible for sufficiently large n. Assume that Md(µn) is invertible, we have\n‖Λµn,d − Λµ,d‖V = sup x∈V {∣∣∣∣ 1vd(x)TMd(µ)−1vd(x) − 1vd(x)TMd(µn)−1vd(x) ∣∣∣∣} (6.28)\n= sup x∈V {∣∣∣∣ vd(x)T (Md(µn)−1 −Md(µ)−1)vd(x)vd(x)TMd(µ)−1vd(x)vd(x)TMd(µn)−1vd(x) ∣∣∣∣} .\nUsing the strong law of large numbers again, almost surely, for n sufficiently large, the smallest eigenvalue of Md(µn) −1 is close to that of Md(µ) −1 and hence bounded away from zero. Since the first coordinate of vd(x) is 1, the denominator in (6.28) is bounded away from zero almost surely for sufficiently large n. In addition, since V is compact, vd(x) is bounded on V and there exists a constant K such that, almost surely, for sufficiently large n,\n‖Λµn,d − Λµ,d‖V ≤ K‖Md(µ)−1 −Md(µn)−1‖, (6.29)\nwhere the matrix-norm in the right hand side is the operator norm induced by the Euclidean norm. Combining (6.27) and (6.29), we obtain\nP (lim supn {‖Λµn,d − Λµ,d‖Rp} ≥ ) ≤ P ( lim supn { K‖Md(µ)−1 −Md(µn)−1‖ ≥ }) . (6.30)\nThe strong law of large numbers and the continuity of the matrix inverse Md(·)−1 at µ ensure that the right hand side of (6.30) is 0. This concludes the proof."

Secondly, we provide a consistency result which relates the empirical Christoffel function and its population counterpart in the limit of large samples. Finally, we illustrate the relevance of our results on simulated and real world datasets for several applications in statistics and machine learning: (a) density and support estimation from finite samples, (b) outlier and novelty detection and (c) affine matching.",
