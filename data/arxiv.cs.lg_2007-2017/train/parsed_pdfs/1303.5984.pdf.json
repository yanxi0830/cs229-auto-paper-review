In particular, our algorithm has an average cost of (1 + ǫ) times the optimum cost after T = polylog(p)O(1/ǫ2). This is in comparison to previous work on the dense dynamics where the algorithm requires time that scales exponentially with dimension in order to achieve regret of ǫ times the optimal cost.

      "text" : "In this paper we address the problem of adaptive control of a high dimensional linear quadratic (LQ) system. Formally, the dynamics of a linear quadratic system are given by\nx(t+ 1) = A0x(t) +B0u(t) + w(t + 1),\nc(t) = x(t)TQx(t) + u(t)TRu(t), (1)\nwhere u(t) ∈ Rr is the control (action) at time t, x(t) ∈ Rp is the state at time t, c(t) ∈ R is the cost at time t, and {w(t + 1)}t≥0 is a sequence of random vectors in Rp with i.i.d. standard Normal entries. The matrices Q ∈ Rp×p and R ∈ Rr×r are positive semi-definite (PSD) matrices that determine the cost at each step. The evolution of the system is described through the matrices A0 ∈ Rp×p and B0 ∈ Rp×r. Finally by high dimensional system we mean the case where p, r ≫ 1. A celebrated fundamental theorem in control theory asserts that the above LQ system can be optimally controlled by a simple linear feedback if the pair (A0, B0) is controllable and the pair (A0, Q1/2) is observable. The optimal controller can be explicitly computed from the matrices describing the dynamics and the cost. Throughout this paper we assume that controllability and observability conditions hold.\nWhen the matrix Θ0 ≡ [A0, B0] is unknown, the task is that of adaptive control, where the system is to be learned and controlled at the same time. Early works on the adaptive control of LQ systems relied on the certainty equivalence principle [2]. In this scheme at each time t the unknown parameter Θ0 is estimated based on the observations collected so far and the optimal controller for the\nestimated system is applied. Such controllers are shown to converge to an optimal controller in the case of minimum variance cost, however, in general they may converge to a suboptimal controller [11]. Subsequently, it has been shown that introducing random exploration by adding noise to the control signal, e.g., [14], solves the problem of converging to suboptimal estimates.\nAll the aforementioned work have been concerned with the asymptotic convergence of the controller to an optimal controller. In order to achieve regret bounds, cost-biased parameter estimation [12, 8, 1], in particular the optimism in the face of uncertainty (OFU) principle [13] has been shown to be effective. In this method a confidence set S is found such that Θ0 ∈ S with high probability. The system is then controlled using the most optimistic parameter estimates, i.e., Θ̂ ∈ S with the smallest optimum cost. The asymptotic convergence of the average cost of OFU for the LQR problem was shown in [6]. This asymptotic result was extended in [1] by providing a bound for the cumulative regret. Assume x(0) = 0 and for a control policy π define the average cost\nJπ = limsup T→∞\n1\nT\nT∑\nt=0\nE[ct] . (2)\nFurther, define the cumulative regret as\nR(T ) =\nT∑\nt=0\n(cπ(t)− J∗) , (3)\nwhere cπ(t) is the cost of control policy π at time t and J∗ = J(Θ0) is the optimal average cost. The algorithm proposed in [1] is shown to have cumulative regret Õ( √ T ) where Õ is hiding the logarithmic factors. While no lower bound was provided for the regret, comparison with the multiarmed bandit problem where a lower bound of O( √ T ) was shown for the general case [9], suggests that this scaling with time for the cumulative regret is optimal.\nThe focus of [1] was on scaling of the regret with time horizon T . However, the regret of the proposed algorithm scales poorly with dimension. More specifically, the analysis in [1] proves a regret bound of R(T ) < Cpp+r+2 √ T . The current paper focuses on (many) applications where the state and control dimensions are much larger than the time horizon of interest. A powerful reinforcement learning algorithm for these applications should have regret which depends gracefully on dimension. In general, there is little to be achieved when T < p as the number of degrees of freedom (pr + p2) is larger than the number of observations (Tp) and any estimator can be arbitrary inaccurate. However, when there is prior knowledge about the unknown parameters A0, B0, e.g., when A0, B0 are sparse, accurate estimation can be feasible. In particular, [3] proved that under suitable conditions the unknown parameters of a noise driven system (i.e., no control) whose dynamics are modeled by linear stochastic differential equations can be estimated accurately with as few as O(log(p)) samples. However, the result of [3] is not directly applicable here since for a general feedback gain L even if A0 and B0 are sparse, the closed loop gain A0 − B0L need not be sparse. Furthermore, system dynamics would be correlated with past observations through the estimated gain matrix L. Finally, there is no notion of cost in [3] while here we have to obtain bounds on cost and its scaling with p. In this work we extend the result of [3] by showing that under suitable conditions, unknown parameters of sparse high dimensional LQ systems can be accurately estimated with as few as O(log(p + r)) observations. Equipped with this efficient learning method, we show that sparse high dimensional LQ systems can be adaptively controlled with regret Õ(p √ T ).\nTo put this result in perspective note that even when x(t) = 0, the expected cost at time t + 1 is Ω(p) due to the noise. Therefore, the cumulative cost at time T is bounded as Ω(pT ). Comparing this to our regret bound, we see that for T = polylog(p)O( 1ǫ2 ), the cumulative cost of our algorithm is bounded by (1 + ǫ) times the optimum cumulative cost. In other words, our algorithm performs close to optimal after polylog(p) steps. This is in contrast with the result of [1] where the algorithm needs Ω(p2p) steps in order to achieve regret of ǫ times the optimal cost.\nSparse high dimensional LQ systems appear in many engineering applications. Here we are particularly motivated by an emerging field of applications in marketing and advertising. The use of dynamical optimal control models in advertising has a history of at least four decades, cf. [17, 10] for a survey. In these models, often a partial differential equation is used to describe how advertising expenditure over time translates into sales. The basic problem is to find the advertising expenditure that maximizes the net profit. The focus of these works is to model the temporal dynamics of\nthe advertising expenditure (the control variable) and the variables of interest (sales, goodwill level, etc.). There also exists a rich literature studying the spatial interdependence of consumers’ and firms’ behavior to devise marketing schemes [7]. In these models space can be generalized beyond geographies to include notions like demographies and psychometry.\nCombination of spatial interdependence and temporal dynamics models for optimal advertising was also considered [16, 15]. A simple temporal dynamics model is extended in [15] by allowing state and control variables to have spatial dependence and introducing a diffusive component in the controlled PDE which describes the spatial dynamics. The controlled PDE is then showed to be equivalent to an abstract linear control system of the form\ndx(t)\ndt = Ax(t) +Bu(t). (4)\nBoth [15] and [7] are concerned with the optimal control and the interactions are either dictated by the model or assumed known. Our work deals with a discrete and noisy version of (4) where the dynamics is to be estimated but is known to be sparse. In the model considered in [15] the state variable x lives in an infinite dimensional space. Spatial models in marketing [7] usually consider state variables which have a large number of dimensions, e.g., number of zip codes in the US (∼ 50K). High dimensional state space and control is a recurring theme in these applications. In particular, with the modern social networks customers are classified in a highly granular way, potentially with each customer representing his own class. With the number of classes and complexity of their interactions, its unlikely that we could formulate an effective model a priori for how classes interact. Further, the nature of these interactions change over time with the changing landscape of Internet services and information available to customers. This makes it important to efficiently learn from real-time data about the nature of these interactions.\nNotation: We bundle the unknown parameters into one variable Θ0 = [A0, B0] ∈ Rp×q where q = p+ r and call it the interaction matrix. For v ∈ Rn, M ∈ Rm×n and p ≥ 1, we denote by ‖v‖p the standard p-norm and by ‖M‖p the corresponding operator norm. For 1 ≤ i ≤ m, Mi represents the ith row of matrix M . For S ⊆ [m], J ⊆ [n], MSJ is the submatrix of M formed by the rows in S and columns in J . For a set S denote by |S| its cardinality. For an integer n denote by [n] the set {1, . . . , n}."

      "text" : "Our algorithm employs the Optimism in the Face of Uncertainty (OFU) principle in an episodic fashion. At the beginning of episode i the algorithm constructs a confidence set Ω(i) which is guaranteed to include the unknown parameter Θ0 with high probability. The algorithm then chooses Θ̃(i) ∈ Ω(i) that has the smallest expected cost as the estimated parameter for episode i and applies the optimal control for the estimated parameter during episode i.\nThe confidence set is constructed using observations from the last episode only but the length of episodes are chosen to increase geometrically allowing for more accurate estimates and shrinkage of the confidence set by a constant factor at each episode. The details of each step and the pseudo code for the algorithm follows.\nConstructing confidence set: Define τi to be the start of episode i with τ0 = 0. Let L(i) be the controller that has been chosen for episode i. For t ∈ [τi, τi+1) the system is controlled by u(t) = −L(i)x(t) and the system dynamics can be written as x(t+1) = (A0−B0L(i))x(t)+w(t+1). At the beginning of episode i+1, first an initial estimate Θ̂ is obtained by solving the following convex optimization problem for each row Θu ∈ Rq separately:\nΘ̂(i+1)u ∈ argmin L(Θu) + λ‖Θu‖1, (5) where\nL(Θu) = 1\n2∆τi+1\nτi+1−1∑\nt=τi\n{xu(t+ 1)−ΘuL̃(i)x(t)}2, ∆τi+1 = τi+1 − τi, (6)\nALGORITHM: Reinforcement learning algorithm for LQ systems.\nInput: Precision ǫ, failure probability 4δ, initial (ρ, Cmin, α) identifiable controller L(0), ℓ(Θ0, ǫ) Output: Series of estimates Θ̃(i), confidence sets Ω(i) and controllers L(i)\n1: Let ℓ0 = max(1,maxj∈[r] ‖L(0)j ‖2), and\nn0 = 4 · 103 k2ℓ20\nα(1− ρ)C2min\n( 1\nǫ2 +\nk (1 − ρ)2 ) log( 4kq δ ),\nn1 = 4 · 103 k2ℓ(Θ0, ǫ)2\n(1 − ρ)C2min\n( 1\nǫ2 +\nk (1 − ρ)2 ) log( 4kq δ ).\nLet ∆τ0 = n0, ∆τi = 4i(1 + i/ log(q/δ))n1 for i ≥ 1, and τi = ∑i\nj=0 ∆τj . 2: for i = 0, 1, 2, . . . do 3: Apply the control u(t) = −L(i)x(t) until τi+1 − 1 and observe the trace {x(t)}τi≤t<τi+1 . 4: Calculate the estimate Θ̂(i+1) from (5) and construct the confidence set Ω(i+1). 5: Calculate Θ̃(i+1) from (9) and set L(i+1) ← L(Θ̃(i+1)).\nand L̃(i) = [I,−L(i)T]T. The estimator Θ̂u is known as the LASSO estimator. The first term in the cost function is the normalized negative log likelihood which measures the fidelity to the observations while the second term imposes the sparsity constraint on Θu. λ is the regularization parameter.\nFor Θ(1),Θ(2) ∈ Rp×q define the distance d(Θ(1),Θ(2)) as d(Θ(1),Θ(2)) = max\nu∈[p] ‖Θ(1)u −Θ(2)u ‖2, (7)\nwhere Θu is the uth row of the matrix Θ. It is worth noting that for k-sparse matrices with k constant, this distance does not scale with p or q. In particular, if the absolute value of the elements of Θ(1) and Θ(2) are bounded by Θmax then d(Θ(1),Θ(2)) ≤ 2 √ kΘmax.\nHaving the estimator Θ̂(i) the algorithm constructs the confidence set for episode i as\nΩ(i) = {Θ ∈ Rp×q | d(Θ, Θ̂(i)) ≤ 2−iǫ}, (8) where ǫ > 0 is an input parameter to the algorithm. For any fixed δ > 0, by choosing τi judiciously we ensure that with probability at least 1− δ, Θ0 ∈ Ω(i), for all i ≥ 1. (see Theorem 3.2). Design of the controller: Let J(Θ) be the minimum expected cost if the interaction matrix is Θ = [A,B] and denote by L(Θ) the optimal controller that achieves the expected cost J(Θ). The algorithm implements OFU principle by choosing, at the beginning of episode i, an estimate Θ̃(i) ∈ Ω(i) such that\nΘ̃(i) ∈ argmin Θ∈Ω(i) J(Θ). (9)\nThe optimal control corresponding to Θ̃(i) is then applied during episode i, i.e., u(t) = −L(Θ̃(i))x(t) for t ∈ [τi, τi+1). Recall that for Θ = [A,B], the optimal controller is given through the following relations\nK(Θ) = Q+ATK(Θ)A−ATK(Θ)B(BTK(Θ)B +R)−1BTK(Θ)A , (Riccati equation) L(Θ) = (BTK(Θ)B +R)−1BTK(Θ)A .\nThe pseudo code for the algorithm is summarized in the table."

      "text" : "In this section we present performance guarantees in terms of cumulative regret and learning accuracy for the presented algorithm. In order to state the theorems, we first need to present some assumptions on the system.\nGiven Θ ∈ Rp×q and L ∈ Rr×p, define L̃ = [I,−LT]T ∈ Rq×p and let Λ ∈ Rp×p be a solution to the following Lyapunov equation Λ−ΘL̃ΛL̃TΘT = I. (10) If the closed loop system (A0−B0L) is stable then the solution to the above equation exists and the state vector x(t) has a Normal stationary distribution with covariance Λ.\nWe proceed by introducing an identifiable regulator.\nDefinition 3.1. For a k-sparse matrix Θ0 = [A0, B0] ∈ Rp×q and L ∈ Rr×p, define L̃ = [I,−LT]T ∈ Rq×p and let H = L̃ΛL̃T where Λ is the solution of Eq. (10) with Θ = Θ0. Define L to be (ρ, Cmin, α) identifiable (with respect to Θ0) if it satisfies the following conditions for all S ⊆ [q], |S| ≤ k.\n(1) ‖A0 −B0L‖2 ≤ ρ < 1, (2) λmin(HSS) ≥ Cmin, (3) ‖HScSH−1SS‖∞ ≤ 1− α.\nThe first condition simply states that if the system is controlled using the regulator L then the closed loop autonomous system is asymptotically stable. The second and third conditions are similar to what is referred to in the sparse signal recovery literature as the mutual incoherence or irreprepresentable conditions. Various examples and results exist for the matrix families that satisfy these conditions [18]. Let S be the set of indices of the nonzero entries in a specific row of Θ0. The second condition states that the corresponding entries in the extended state variable y = [xT, uT] are sufficiently distinguishable from each other. In other words, if the trajectories corresponding to this group of state variables are observed, non of them can be well approximated as a linear combination of the others. The third condition can be thought of as a quantification of the first vs. higher order dependencies. Consider entry j in the extended state variable. Then, the dynamic of yj is directly influenced by entries yS . However they are also influenced indirectly by other entries of y. The third condition roughly states that the indirect influences are sufficiently weaker than the direct influences. There exists a vast literature on the applicability of these conditions and scenarios in which they are known to hold. These conditions are almost necessary for the successful recovery by ℓ1 relaxation. For a discussion on these and other similar conditions imposed for sparse signal recovery we refer the reader to [19] and [20] and the references therein.\nDefine Θmin = mini∈[p],j∈[q],Θ0 ij 6=0 |Θ0ij |. Our first result states that the system can be learned efficiently from its trajectory observations when it is controlled by an identifiable regulator.\nTheorem 3.2. Consider the LQ system of Eq. (1) and assume Θ0 = [A0, B0] is k-sparse. Let u(t) = −Lx(t) where L is a (ρ, Cmin, α) identifiable regulator with respect to Θ0 and define ℓ = max(1,maxj∈[r] ‖Lj‖2). Let n denote the number of samples of the trajectory that is observed. For any 0 < ǫ < min(Θmin, ℓ2 , 3 1−ρ), there exists λ such that, if\nn ≥ 4 · 10 3 k2ℓ2\nα2(1− ρ)C2min\n( 1\nǫ2 +\nk (1− ρ)2 ) log( 4kq δ ) , (11)\nthen the ℓ1-regularized least squares solution Θ̂ of Eq. (5) satisfies d(Θ̂,Θ0) ≤ ǫ with probability larger than 1− δ. In particular, this is achieved by taking λ = 6ℓ √ log(4q/δ)/(nα2(1 − ρ)) .\nOur second result states that equipped with an efficient learning algorithm, the LQ system of Eq. (1) can be controlled with regret Õ(p √ T log 3 2 (1/δ)) under suitable assumptions.\nDefine an ǫ-neighborhood of Θ0 as Nǫ(Θ0) = {Θ ∈ Rp×q | d(Θ0,Θ) ≤ ǫ}. Our assumption asserts the identifiably of L(Θ) for Θ close to Θ0.\nAssumption: There exist ǫ, C > 0 such that for all Θ ∈ Nǫ(Θ0), L(Θ) is identifiable w.r.t. Θ0 and σL(Θ\n0, ǫ) = sup Θ∈Nǫ(Θ0) ‖L(Θ)‖2 ≤ C, σK(Θ0, ǫ) = sup Θ∈Nǫ(Θ0) ‖K(Θ)‖2 ≤ C.\nAlso define\nℓ(Θ0, ǫ) = sup Θ∈Nǫ(Θ0) max(1,max j∈[r] ‖Lj(Θ)‖2) .\nNote that ℓ(Θ0, ǫ) ≤ max(C, 1), since maxj∈[r] ‖Lj(Θ)‖2 ≤ ‖L(Θ)‖2.\nTheorem 3.3. Consider the LQ system of Eq. (1). For some constants ǫ, Cmin and 0 < α, ρ < 1, assume that an initial (ρ, Cmin, α) identifiable regulator L(0) is given. Further, assume that for any Θ ∈ Nǫ(Θ0), L(Θ) is (ρ, Cmin, α) identifiable. Then, with probability at least 1− δ the cumulative regret of ALGORITHM (cf. the table) is bounded as\nR(T ) ≤ Õ(p √ T log 3 2 (1/δ)) , (12)\nwhere Õ is hiding the logarithmic factors."

Further, for u ∈ [p], j ∈ [q], define φ(τ) ∈ Rp×p to have all rows equal to zero except the uth row which is equal to L̃j(A0 −B0L)τ . Define Φ̃j ∈ Rnp×np as,\nΦ̃j =   0 0 . . . 0 0 φ(0) 0 . . . 0 0 φ(1) φ(0) . . . 0 0\n... ... . . . 0 0 φ(n− 2) φ(n− 3) . . . φ(0) 0\n  , (33)\nand let\nΦj = 1\n2 (Φ̃j + Φ̃\nT j ). (34)\nLemma A.1. Let νi denote the ith eigenvalue of Φj and assume ρ < 1. Then,\nnp∑\ni=1\nνi = 0, (35)\nmax i\n|νi| ≤ ℓ\n1− ρ , (36) np∑\ni=1\nν2i ≤ ℓ2n\n2(1− ρ) . (37)\nWe do not prove this lemma here and refer the reader to Lemma A.3 in [3].\nProof (Lemma 4.2). The proof of this lemma follows closely the proof of Proposition 4.2 in [3] which we provide here for the reader’s convenience. Let w ∈ Rnp be the vector obtained by stacking all the noise vectors up to time n, i.e.,\nw T = [w(1)T, w(2)T, . . . , w(n)T].\nThen we have that\nĜj = L̃j\nn−1∑\nt=1\nx(t)wu(t+ 1) =\nn−1∑\nt=1\nwu(t+ 1)\nt−1∑\nτ=0\nL̃j(A 0 −B0L)τw(t − τ) = wTΦjw.\nwhere Φj is defined in (34). Since w ∼ N(0, Inp) and Φj is symmetric, we can write\nĜj =\nnp∑\ni=1\nνiz 2 i . (38)\nwhere zi ∼ N(0, 1) are independent and νi’s are the eigenvalues of the matrix Φj . Now we have for any β > 0,\nP\n{ np∑\ni=1\nνiz 2 i > nǫ\n} ≤ exp (−nβǫ) pn∏\ni=1\nE { exp ( βνiz 2 i ) }\n= exp ( −n ( βǫ + 1\n2n\nnp∑\ni=1\nlog(1− 2νiβ) )) .\nLet β = (1− ρ)ǫ/(2ℓ2). Then it follows from Eq. (36) and the assumption ǫ < ℓ2 that |2νiβ| ≤ 1/2. Furthermore, for |x| < 1/2, log(1− x) > −x− x2. Hence,\nP(\nnp∑\ni=1\nνiz 2 i > nǫ) ≤ exp\n( −n(βǫ− 2β2 1\nn\nnp∑\ni=1\nν2i )\n)\n≤ exp ( −n(1− ρ)ǫ 2\n4ℓ2\n) ,\nwhere the first inequality follows from the fact that ∑np\ni=1 νi = 0 (Eq. (35)) and the second inequality is obtained using the bound in Eq. (37). Finally, by the union bound we obtain the desired result\nP { ‖ĜS‖∞ > ǫ } ≤ 2|S| max j∈S P { zTΦjz > nǫ }\n≤ 2|S| exp ( −n(1− ρ)ǫ 2\n4ℓ2\n) .\nA.2 Proof of Lemma 4.3\nLemma A.2. Let R̃j ∈ R(n−1)p×np be obtained by removing the first p rows of Φ̃j . For i, j ∈ [q] define R(i, j) = 1/2(R̃Tj R̃i+ R̃ T\ni R̃j) ∈ Rnp×np. Assume ρ < 1 and let νl denote the lth eigenvalue of R(i, j). Then,\n|νl| ≤ ℓ2\n(1 − ρ)2 , (39)\n1\nn\nnp∑\nl=1\nν2l ≤ 2ℓ2 (1 − ρ)3 ( 1 + 3 2n 1 1− ρ ) . (40)\nProof (Lemma 4.3). Our proof of 4.2 here closely follows the proof of Proposition 4.2 in [3].\nNote that Ĥij can be written as,\nĤij = 1\nn\nn−1∑\nt=1\nL̃i x(t)x(t) TL̃Tj\n= 1\nn\nn−1∑\nt=1\nL̃i\n( t−1∑\nτ=0\n(A0 −B0L)τw(t− τ) )( t−1∑\nτ=0\n(A0 −B0L)τw(t− τ) )T\nL̃Tj\n= 1\nn\nn−1∑\nt=1\n( t−1∑\nτ=0\nL̃i(A 0 −B0L)τ ) w(t − τ)w(t − τ)T ( t−1∑\nτ=0\nL̃j(A 0 −B0L)τ\n)T\n= 1\nn\nn−1∑\nt=1\nw(t − τ)T ( t−1∑\nτ=0\nL̃i(A 0 −B0L)τ\n)T( t−1∑\nτ=0\nL̃j(A 0 −B0L)τ ) w(t− τ)\n= 1\nn w\nTR(i, j)w.\nSince w ∼ N(0, Inp) and R(i, j) is symmetric, we can write\nĤij = 1\nn\nnp∑\nl=1\nνlz 2 l , (41)\nwhere zl ∼ N(0, 1) are independent and νl’s are the eigenvalues of the matrix R(i, j). Further,\nĤij − E(Ĥij) = 1\nn\nnp∑\nl=1\nνl(z 2 l − 1), (42)\nHence, using Chernoff bound we get\nP(Ĥij − E(Ĥij) > ǫ) = P( np∑\nl=1\nνl(z 2 l − 1) > ǫn)\n≤ exp (−βǫn) exp ( −1 2 np∑\nl=1\nlog(1− 2βνl) ) .\nBy Lemma A.2, for n > 31−ρ we have\n1\nn\nnp∑\nl=1\nν2l ≤ 3ℓ2\n(1 − ρ)3 , (43)\nLet β = (1−ρ) 3ǫ\n12ℓ2 . By assumption ǫ < 3 1−ρ , we have |2βνl| < 1/2. Using the inequality log(1−x) > −x− x2 for |x| < 1/2, we obtain\nP(Ĥij − E(Ĥij) > ǫ) ≤ exp ( −βǫn+ 2β2 np∑\nl=1\nν2l\n)\n≤ exp ( −n(1− ρ) 3ǫ2\n24ℓ2\n) ,\nwhich finishes the proof.\nA.3 Proof of Lemma 4.5\nBefore embarking on the proof, we state and prove the following claim which will be repeatedly used in the proofs of Lemmas 4.5, 4.6, and 4.7.\nProposition A.3. Under the event E1 ∩ E2, the following holds true.\n‖x(t)‖ ≤ 2 1− ρ\n√ p log( T\nδ ) , for 1 ≤ t ≤ T + 1 .\nProof (Proposition A.3). Conditioning on the event E1, Θ0 ∈ Ω(i) for i ≥ 1. Furthermore, for all i ≥ 1, Ω(i) ⊆ Nǫ(Θ0). Recall our assumption that for all Θ ∈ Nǫ(Θ0), L(Θ) is identifiable with respect to Θ0. Consequently, we have ‖A0 − B0Lt‖2 ≤ ρ, for all t ≥ 1, where Lt denotes the controller (used by ALGORITHM ) at time t. Now, we write for 1 ≤ t ≤ T + 1,\n‖x(t)‖ = ‖ t∑\nt1=1\nt∏\nt2=t1+1\n(A0 −B0Lt)w(t1)‖ ≤ t∑\nt1=1\nρt−t1‖w(t1)‖\n≤ 2 √ p log( T\nδ )\nt∑\nt1=1\nρt−t1 < 2\n1− ρ\n√ p log( T\nδ ) ,\n(44)\nwhere the second inequality holds since we are conditioning on E2.\nArmed with this proposition, we prove Lemma 4.5.\nDefine z(t) = A0x(t) +B0u(t), and Kt = K(Θ̃t) for all t ≥ 0. Since x(0) = 0, we have\nC1 =\nT∑\nt=0\n( x(t)TKtx(t)− E [ x(t+ 1)TKt+1x(t+ 1) ∣∣Ft ])\n= −E [ x(T + 1)TKT+1x(T + 1) ∣∣FT ] + T∑\nt=1\n( x(t)TKtx(t) − E [ x(t)TKtx(t)|Ft−1 ]) .\nBecause KT+1 is PSD, the first term is bounded above by zero. To bound the second term, define\nEt1 = {Θ0 ∈ Ωτ , for 1 ≤ τ ≤ t} , Et2 = {‖w(τ)‖ ≤ 2 √ p log(T/δ), for 1 ≤ τ ≤ t} .\nNote that Et+11 ⊆ Et1 and Et+12 ⊆ Et2. Following the approach of [1], it can be shown that the second term is bounded above by\nT∑\nt=1\nI{Et−11 ∩E t−1 2 }\n( x(t)TKtx(t)− E [ x(t)TKtx(t)|Ft−1 ]) .\nDefine the martingale\nMτ =\nτ∑\nt=1\nI{Et−11 ∩E t−1 2 }\n( x(t)TKtx(t) − E [ x(t)TKtx(t)|Ft−1 ]) , M0 = 0 .\nNote that Mτ is a martingale since Et−11 and Et−12 are Ft−1 measurable. In addition,\n|Mτ −Mτ−1| ≤ I{Et−11 ∩Et−12 } ∣∣∣x(t)TKtx(t) − E [ x(t)TKtx(t)|Ft−1 ]∣∣∣\n≤ 2C I{Et−11 ∩Et−12 } ‖x(t)‖ 2 ≤ 8C (1 − ρ)2 p log( T δ ) I{Et−11 ∩E t−1 2 }\n≤ 8C (1 − ρ)2 p log( T δ ) ,\nwhere the penultimate inequality follows from Proposition A.3. Applying Azuma’s inequality,\nP(MT −M0 ≥ β) ≤ exp ( − β\n2(1− ρ)4 128TC2p2 log2(Tδ )\n) .\nHence, with probability at least 1− δ,\nC1 ≤ √ 128C\n(1− ρ)2 √ T p log( T δ )\n√ log( 1\nδ ) ."
