      "text" : "This paper proposes a method for domain adaptation that extends the maximum margin domain transfer (MMDT) proposed by Hoffman et al., by introducing L2 distance constraints between samples of different domains; thus, our method is denoted as MMDTL2. Motivated by the differences between the images taken by narrow band imaging (NBI) endoscopic devices, we utilize different NBI devices as different domains and estimate the transformations between samples of different domains, i.e., image samples taken by different NBI endoscope systems. We first formulate the problem in the primal form, and then derive the dual form with much lesser computational costs as compared to the naive approach. From our experimental results using NBI image datasets from two different NBI endoscopic devices, we find that MMDTL2 is more stable than MMDT and better than support vector machines without adaptation.\nKeywords: Domain adaptation; Dual formulation; Kernels; NBI endoscopy"

      "text" : "In many hospitals, endoscopic examinations (i.e., colonoscopies) using narrow band imaging (NBI) systems are widely performed to diagnose colorectal cancer [1], which is a major cause of cancer deaths worldwide [2]. During examinations, endoscopists observe and examine a polyp based on its visual appearance, including via NBI magnification findings [3, 4], as shown in Figure 1.\n∗Corresponding author\nPreprint submitted to *** November 9, 2016\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n02 44\n3v 1\n[ cs\nTo support proper diagnosis during examinations, a computer-aided diagnostic system based on the textural appearance of polyps would be helpful; thus, numerous patch-based classification methods for endoscopic images have been proposed [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11].\nThis paper focuses on the inconsistencies between training and test images. As with other frequently used machine learning approaches, training classifiers assumes that the distribution of features extracted from both training and test image datasets are the same; however, different endoscope systems may be used to collect training and test datasets, causing such an assumption to be violated. Further, given the rapid development of medical devices (i.e., endoscopies in this case), hospitals can introduce new endoscopes after training images have already been taken. In addition, classifiers may be trained with a training dataset collected by a certain type of endoscope in one hospital, while another hospital might use the same classifiers for images taken by a different endoscope. In general, such inconsistencies lead to the deterioration of classification performance; hence, collecting new images for a new training dataset may be necessary or is at least preferred. However, this is not the case with medical images. It is impractical to collect enough sets of images for all types and manufacturers of endoscopes.\nFigure 2 shows an example of differences between textures captured by different endoscope systems. More specifically, the images shown in Figures 2(a) and 2(b) are the same scene from a printed sheet of a colorectal polyp image taken by different endoscope systems at approximately the same distance to the sheet from the endoscopes. Even for the same manufacture (e.g., Olympus) and the same modality (e.g., NBI), images may differ in terms of factors such as resolution, image quality, sharpness, brightness, and viewing angle. These differences may impact classification performance.\nTo address this problem, Sonoyama et al. [12] proposed a method based on transfer learning [13, 14, 15, 16] to estimate a transformation matrix between feature vectors of training and test datasets captured by different (i.e., old and new) devices. In this prior study, we formulated the problem as a constraint optimization problem and developed an algorithm to estimate a linear transformation; however, a key limitation is that corresponding datasets are required, i.e., each test image (i.e., taken by a new device) must have a corresponding training image (i.e., taken by an old device). Further, these images must capture the same polyp to properly estimate the linear transformation. These restrictions are rather strong, causing our system to be somewhat impractical.\nTherefor, this paper proposes an improved method for a task that does not require image-by-image correspondences between training and test datasets. More specifically, we extend the transfer learning method proposed by Hoffman et al. [20, 21], called maximum margin domain transfer (MMDT). Their approach was a domain adaptation technique to handle the domain shift problem, in which distributions of classes (or categories) in one domain, called the source, change in another domain, called the target. This situation occurs in various applications, and hence, domain adaptation and transfer learning have already been widely studied.\nCompared to previous studies, MMDT had the following advantages: (1) applicability to multiclass problems with one-vs-rest support vector machines (SVMs); (2) the ability to use different feature dimensions in the source and target domains; (3) the ability to handle unlabeled target samples by estimating global class-independent affine transformation matrix W ; and (4) scalability to the number of constraints, i.e., MMDT solves KLs constraints as compared to LtLs in the previous studies, where K is the number of classes and Ls and Lt are the feature dimensions of the source and target domains.\nIn this paper, we therefore propose a non-trivial extension to MMDT for handling inconsistencies between NBI endoscopic devices1. First, we add L2 distance constraints to MMDT, thus calling our method MMDTL2. The original formulation of MMDT uses the Frobenius norm of transformation W as a regularizer, but pulling transformation W into a zero matrix is not intuitive and might not have a good effect on transferring samples. Other regularizers were discussed by [21], e.g., an identity matrix when Ls = Lt, but no examples were given for cases of Ls 6= Lt. Instead of exploring another regularizer, we add more intuitive constraints. Further, target samples in one category should be transformed into the same category of the source domain. To this end, we use the L2 distances between the source and transformed target samples as constraints. Second, we explicitly formulate MMDTL2 as a quadratic programming (QP) problem. In [20, 21], the MMDT problem was described but not in a QP form. In this paper, we explicitly formulate MMDTL2 in the standard QP form, which includes MMDT as a special case (i.e., where no L2 constraints are used). Third, we derive the dual problem of MMDTL2. The QP form men-\n1A conference version of this paper was presented [22]. This paper extends that version with more rigorous derivations, the compact form of the dual formulation, and the kernelization of the method, as well as experiments from different aspects.\ntioned above is a primal form of MMDTL2 in which computational costs are the same as with MMDT. Its computational costs can be very large for samples with large dimensions because transformation W has size Ls × Lt, in addition to KLt constraints. Further, a matrix of size Ls(Lt + 1) × Ls(Lt + 1) appears in the computation of the primal form. Our derived dual form of MMDTL2 is more scalable and consists of a KM ×KM matrix, where M is the number of target samples, and KM constraints. This is common and therefore reasonable for problems of domain adaptation, including our problem of NBI device inconsistency, namely that the number of target samples is limited or much smaller than that of source samples. Finally, we show that the primal solution can be converted from the dual solution with much lesser computational costs. With our derived formula, this conversion needs matrices of size at most KM ×KM , while with no elaboration, a matrix of size Ls(Lt + 1)× Ls(Lt + 1) appears in the conversion. In addition, we derive a kernelization of the dual formulation, which enables us to use a nonlinear transformation as W .\nNote that our dual form is different from the dual form derived by Rodner et al. [23]. Their motivation was to make MMDT scalable in terms of the number of target samples, because in their study, they attempted to adapt large datasets such as ImageNet. Therefore, their dual form still suffers from the large feature dimensions of the source and target samples. In contrast, our formulation is scalable in terms of feature dimensions.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. We formulate problems of MMDT and MMDTL2 in Section 2, and then derive the primal form in Section 3. In Section 4, we show the dual form, and in Section 5, we obtain the primal solution from the dual solution. In Section 6, we present our experimental results using numerical examples and datasets of actual NBI endoscopic images.\nFinally, in Section 7, we conclude this paper and provide avenues for future work."

      "text" : "In this section, we introduce the problems of MMDT [21] and our proposed MMDTL2.\nProblem 1 (MMDT). Suppose we are given a training set χs = {xsn, ysn}Nn=1 ⊂ RLs ×{1, 2, . . . ,K} in the source domain and another set χt = {xtm, ytm}Mm=1 ⊂ RLt × {1, 2, . . . ,K} in the target domain for a K-class classification problem.\nMMDT solves the following optimization problem:\nmin W,Θ̂\n1 2 ‖W‖2F + 1 2 ‖Θ̂‖2F + ctL(W, Θ̂, χt) + csL(Θ̂, χs), (1)\nwhere ct and cs are weights and\nL(W, Θ̂, χt) = ∑ k,m max ( 0, 1− ytkmθ̂Tk ( W x̂tm 1 )) (2)\nand\nL(Θ̂, χs) = ∑ k,m max ( 0, 1− ysknθ̂Tk x̂sn )\n(3)\nare hinge loss functions. Here, θ̂k ∈ RLs+1 is an SVM hyperplane parameter (including weights θk ∈ RLs and bias bk ∈ R, i.e., θ̂k = (θTk , bk)T ) for the kth class stacked into a matrix Θ̂ = (θ̂1, θ̂2, . . . , θ̂K), y t km = 2δ(y t m, k)− 1 ∈ {−1, 1} is a label in terms of the kth hyperplane, and cs and cs are weights. Note that x̂ denotes an augmented vector with 1 as its last element, i.e.,\nx̂ = ( x 1 ) .\nIn this problem, we simultaneously obtain K SVM classifiers and transformation W ∈ RLs×Lt . One-vs-all SVMs are used for multiclass classification; thus, K hyperplane parameters θ̂k are obtained in the source domain. Target samples xtm are transformed by W from the target domain to the source domain, and then the loss function causes them to be classified by the SVMs.\nBecause this problem is non-convex, an alternating optimization approach was used in [21].\nProblem 2 (MMDT with iteration). MMDT solves problem 1 by iteratively solving subproblems\nmin W\n1 2 ‖W‖2F + ctL(W, Θ̂, χt), (4)\nand\nmin Θ̂\n1 2 ‖Θ̂‖2F + ctL(W, Θ̂, χt) + csL(Θ̂, χs), (5)\ninitializing Θ̂ with\narg min Θ̂\n1 2 ‖Θ̂‖2F + csL(Θ̂, χs). (6)\nAs noted in the Introduction, the use of Frobenius norm ‖W‖2F is not intuitive for the transformation matrix. Further, it might not be a good choice for small values of ct because the obtained solution is pulled toward a zero matrix; however, the use of large values of ct impacts the SVM subproblem (5) because C-SVM solvers are known to be unstable for large values of parameter C.\nIn this paper, we therefore propose the following problem, which we call MMDTL2. MMDTL2 incorporates additional constraints of L2 distances to pull target samples to source samples of the same category.\nProblem 3 (MMDTL2). MMDT with L2 constraints solves problem 1 by iteratively solving subproblems\nmin W\n1 2 cf‖W‖2F + ctL(W, Θ̂, χt) + cdL(W,χs, χt), (7)\nand\nmin Θ̂\n1 2 ‖Θ̂‖2F + ctL(W, Θ̂, χt) + csL(Θ̂, χs) (8)\nwith the same initialization as problem 2, where\ncdL(W,χs, χt) = 1\n2 M∑ m=1 N∑ n=1 snm‖W x̂tm − xsn‖22, (9)\nwhere snm = cdδ(y s n, y t m) is a weight between samples x t m ∈ RLt and xsn ∈ RLs and cd is the balance weight. MMDTL2 reduces to MMDT when cf = 1 and cd = 0.\nThe SVM subproblem (8) can be solved by common SVM solvers, as is done for (5) by MMDT. Therefore, in the following sections, we focus on deriving the primal and dual forms of subproblem (7) as standard QP problems."

If (Kt)−1 exists, we obtain\nG = (cf (K t)−1 + SM ) −1 (110)\nby applying the Woodbury formula. In summary, G ∈ RM×M is\nG =  (cf (K t)−1 + SM ) −1, if (Kt)−1 exists, 1 cf Kt − 1 c2f Kt(S−1M + 1 cf Kt)−1Kt, if (S−1M + 1 cf Kt)−1 exists,\n(Xt)TA−1Xt, otherwise,\n(111)\ndepending on the existence of the inverse of kernel matrix Kt ∈ RM×M . It exists when the dimension of the column space of Xt is M , i.e., when the target samples are linearly independent. If not, the second option can be used, i.e., the inverse of S−1M + 1 cf Kt, which can be interpreted as the regularization of kernel Kt with diagonal weight matrix S−1M . In the next lemma, we rewrite qTV −1Φ.\nLemma 8. Given matrix Φ ∈ RLs(Lt+1)×KM and vector q ∈ RLs(Lt+1), we have\nqTV −1Φ = vec ( ΘTXsSG )T . (112)\nProof.

The dual form of the original primal problem is given by\nmax a −1 2 aTY T ((ΘTΘ)⊗G)Y a+ (1T − (Y b̃)T − vec\n( ΘTXsSG )T Y )a (128)\ns.t. cT1 ≥ a ≥ 0. (129)\nProof. According to the lemmas derived above, we can write the Lagrangian as\nL = −1 2 aTY TΦTV −1ΦY a+ (1T − qTV −1ΦY )a+ −1 2 qTV −1q + 1 2 s (130)\n= −1 2 aTY T ((ΘTΘ)⊗G)Y a+ (1T − (Y b̃)T − vec\n( ΘTXsSG )T Y )a\n+ −1 2 qTV −1q + 1 2 s. (131)\nBy omitting the last two terms, which do not involve a, we have the dual problem as claimed.\nNote that this dual form involves matrices of size at most KM×KM , which is reasonable when the number of categories K and the number of samples in the target domain M are both small.\nIf all snm = 0, then the problem reduces to MMDT, i.e.,\nL = −1 2 aTY T ((ΘTΘ)⊗G)Y a+ (1T − (Y b̃)T )a, (132)\nwhere G = (Xt)TXt, since A = I."

In this dataset, there are four domains, i.e., Amazon, webcam, digital SLR (dslr), and Caltech, each of which has 10 categories. For each pair of domains, each sample is represented by an 800-dimension descriptor. One training set has eight source training samples per category (80 samples in total except the domain Amazon which has 200 source training samples (20 samples per category)), and three target training samples per category (30 samples in total). Further, 20 training/test sets are given (and provided by [25, 27]) by randomly selecting samples from each domain and category, which are used to report average performance measures. Note that different target domains use differing numbers of test samples; more specifically, dslr has 127, webcam has 265, Amazon has 928, and Caltech has 1093.\nTable 1 shows results of MMDT and MMDTL2. The second column shows a reproduction of results from [20, 21] using publicly available code [27] with the\nprovided parameters and necessary preprocessing (i.e., dimensions were reduced from 800 to 20 using principal component analysis (PCA)). In the third column, results are shown for MMDT without the dimensionality reduction via PCA. Finally, results of MMDTL2 are shown in the rightmost column.\nClearly, in comparison with MMDT, our proposed method is not suitable for this dataset. More investigation is necessary here, though a possible reason for this is that the number of training samples (i.e., eight in the source domain and three in the target domain per category) might be too small for the L2 constraint to behave properly. In a more realistic scenario, there are a sufficient number of source training samples, whereas fewer target samples are available. We therefore focus on this revised situation in the next experiment."

      "heading" : "7.2. NBI endoscopic image dataset",
      "text" : "The NBI dataset used in this experiment consisted of two domains. For the first (i.e., source) domain, we used the NBI image dataset consisting of 908 NBI patches collected from endoscopic examinations at Hiroshima University by using OLYMPUS EVIS LUCERA endoscope system [17]; patches were labeled based on NBI magnification findings [3, 4], which categorizes appearances of tumors into types A, B, and C, with type C further sub-classified into C1, C2, and C3 based on microvessel structures (see Figure 1). In this study, we used only types A, B, and C3 in accordance with our previous work [11, 28, 12, 29]. In general, a patch is trimmed from a larger frame of the entire endoscopic image such that the trimmed rectangular region represents the typical texture pattern of the colorectal polyp appearing in the frame. To align the size of patches between source and target domains, we further trimmed the center of each patch to 180× 180 and created 734 patches with 289 in type A, 365 in type B, and 80 in type C3. Note that this study was conducted with the approval from the Hiroshima University Hospital ethics committee, and informed consents\nwere obtained from the patients and/or family members for the endoscopic examinations.\nFor the second (i.e., target) domain, we used another NBI image dataset consisting of 279 patches with 92 in type A and 187 in type B. These images were taken by OLYMPUS EVIS LUCERA ELITE endoscope system [19], which is a newer model than that of the system of the source domain. Due to the limited number of endoscopic examinations using this newer endoscope system, we trimmed the center square to 180 × 180 from video frames of 41 NBI examination videos; hence, there are two factors of domain shift here: (1) the NBI endoscopic devices and (2) the differences between still images (i.e., source) and video frames (i.e., target).\nFrom these two domains, we computed convolutional neural network (CNN) features extracted using CaffeNet [30]; more specifically, this is the fc6 feature of 4096 dimensions, which is known to work well for many tasks [31]. These features were used without dimensionality reduction.\nTo see the effect of the number of target samples, we prepared training/test sets as follows. First, we randomly split the source and target domain samples into half; we therefore had a source training set of 367 source samples and a target training set of 139 target samples. Next, we kept a specified number of target samples per category (up to 40) in each of the target training sets, discarding the rest. For the test set, we used 140 target samples. We created 10 training/test sets and reported average performance.\nFigure 3 shows performance results of different methods over the different\nnumbers of target training samples. As a baseline, we also show two SVM results, i.e., source SVM and target SVM. Source SVM estimates an SVM classifier with source and target training samples (and only source samples when no target samples are used). Target SVM does the same, but only with target training samples. MMDT results were obtained using the code provided by [27], just as in our first experiment. There were three results for MMDTL2, i.e., a linear version and two kernel versions with RBF and polynomial kernels.\nEven with no target samples, source SVM performed relatively better and increased its performance as the number of target training samples increased. Target SVM started below 70%, but caught up to source SVM when 20 training target samples were given. The results indicate that our proposed MMDTL2 behaves between source and target SVMs. When one or two target samples are given, MMDTL2 behaves similarly to target SVM and far below the source SVM, but it quickly gains from the benefits of adaptation. With the RBF kernel, MMDTL2 is the best when 10 and 15 training samples are given, but the linear and polynomial kernels become better when more samples are given. MMDTL2 with the linear kernel and target SVM approach one another, which is expected because a sufficient number of target training samples are considered to be the best for classifying target domain samples. Overall, MMDTL2 with a polynomial kernel works the best.\nNote that the results of MMDT seem to be unstable for this dataset given differing numbers of training samples. In the extreme case, e.g., the left half of the plot, where only a couple of training samples are available, MMDT might be a good choice, and this is one possible reason why MMDT works better than MMDTL2 in the first experiment."

We have shown that conv3 features are expected to work better than fc6 features for NBI patch classification problems [32]; however, transformation matrix W for the conv3 features could be very large without our efficient dual formulation. The ability to handle such large dimensions of features is the key advantage of our proposed method. Figure 4 shows that the source SVM is the best when a few target samples are available, just as in Figure 3. Further, our proposed MMDTL2 with a polynomial kernel becomes better at the right half of the plot, and the differences between the source and target SVMs are much more significant than those in Figure 3."

Our future work includes using other loss functions for problem formulation. We observed that the one-vs-rest multiclass classification by SVMs was a performance bottleneck of MMDTL2 in our experiments using the Office-Caltech dataset. Given 10 categories, we had 10 SVMs, each classifying test target samples with 80-90% accuracy measures as 10 separated and independent binary classifiers; however, the total performance for multiclass classification was sometimes lower than 40%. Therefore, instead of relying on maximum margin loss functions, multiclass logistic loss might be better here. In the future, we plan to explore this idea and report performance results for the NBI dataset as well."

Motivated by the differences between the images taken by narrow band imaging (NBI) endoscopic devices, we utilize different NBI devices as different domains and estimate the transformations between samples of different domains, i.e., image samples taken by different NBI endoscope systems. We first formulate the problem in the primal form, and then derive the dual form with much lesser computational costs as compared to the naive approach. From our experimental results using NBI image datasets from two different NBI endoscopic devices, we find that MMDTL2 is more stable than MMDT and better than support vector machines without adaptation.",
