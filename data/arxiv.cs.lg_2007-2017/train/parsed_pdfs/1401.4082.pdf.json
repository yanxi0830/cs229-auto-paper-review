These efforts, combined with the demand for accurate probabilistic inferences and fast simulation lead us to seek generative models that are i) deep, since hierarchical structure allows us to capture higher moments of the data, ii) are non-linear, allowing for complex structure in the data to be modelled, iii) allow for fast sampling of fantasy data from the inferred model, and iv) are tractable and scalable to large amounts of data.\nWe meet these desiderata by introducing a class of deep, directed generative models with Gaussian latent variables at each layer. To allow for efficient and tractable inference, we also introduce a corresponding recognition model, which can be interpreted as a stochastic encoder of the data, and represents an approximate posterior distribution. For the generative model, we derive the objective function for optimisation using variational principles; for the recognition model, we specify its structure and regularisation by exploiting recent advances in deep learning. Using this construction, we can train the entire model by a modified gradient back-propagation, which allows for optimisation of the parameters of both the generative and recognition models jointly.\nWe build upon the large body of prior work (contextualised in section 5) and make the following contributions: • We marry ideas from deep neural networks and\nprobabilistic latent variable modelling to derive a general class of deep, non-linear latent Gaussian models (section 2). • We present a new approach for scalable variational inference that allows for joint optimisation of both variational and model parameters by exploiting the properties of latent Gaussian distributions and gradient back-propagation (sections 3 and 4).\nar X\niv :1\n40 1.\n40 82\nv1 [\nst at\n.M L\n] 1\n6 Ja\nn 20\n14\n• We provide a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the model demonstrating its applicability to problems in simulation, visualisation, prediction and missing data imputation (section 6)."

      "text" : "Deep latent Gaussian models (DLGM) are a general class of deep directed graphical models that consist of Gaussian latent variables at each layer of a processing hierarchy. The model consists of L layers of latent variables. To generate a sample from the model, we begin at the top-most layer (L) by drawing from a Gaussian distribution. The activation hl at any lower layer is formed by a non-linear transformation of the layer above hl+1, perturbed by Gaussian noise. We then generate observations v by sampling from the likelihood using the activation h1. This process is described graphically in figure 1.\nThis generative process is described by the following equations:\nξl = N (ξ|0, I), l = 1, . . . , L (1) hL = GLξL, (2)\nhl = Tl(hl+1) + Glξl, l = 1 . . . L− 1 (3) v ∼ π(v|T0(h1)), (4)\nwhere ξl are Gaussian variables. The transformations Tl are represented by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and Gl are matrices. At the visible layer, the data is generated from any appropriate distribution π(v|·) whose parameters are specified by a transformation of the first latent layer. This allows us to deal with data that may be of any type, such as binary, categorical, counts, real-values, or a heterogeneous combination of these data types. We typically make use of distributions in the exponential family, such as the Bernoulli distribution for binary data, but we are not restricted to this set of likelihood functions.\nThe joint probability distribution of this model can be expressed in two equivalent ways:\np(v,h) = p(v|h1)p(hL)p(θg) L−1∏ l=1 pl(hl|hl+1), (5)\np(v, ξ) = p(v|h1(ξ1...L))p(θ g) L∏ l=1 N (ξl). (6)\nA graphical model corresponding to these two views is shown in figure 1(a),(b). The conditional distribution p(hl|hl+1) is a distribution implicitly defined by equation (3) and are Gaussian distributions with mean µl = Tl(hl+1) and covariance Sl = GlG > l . Equation\n(6) makes explicit that this generative model works by applying a highly non-linear transformation to a spherical Gaussian distribution such that the transformed distribution tries to match the empirical distribution. We discuss this in more detail in appendix A. Throughout the paper we refer to the set of parameters in Tl and Gl by θ\ng. We adopt a weak Gaussian prior over θg, p(θg) = N (θ|0, κI).\nThis specification for deep latent Gaussian models generalises a number of well known models. When we have only one layer of latent variables and use a linear mapping T (·), we recover factor analysis (Bartholomew & Knott, 1999) – more general mappings allow for a nonlinear factor analysis. When the mappings are of the form Tl(h) = Alf(h) + bl, for simple element-wise non-linearities f such as the probit function or the rectified linearity, we recover the non-linear Gaussian belief network (Frey & Hinton, 1999). We describe the relationship to other existing models in section 5. Given this specification, our key task is to develop a method for tractable inference. A number of approaches are known and currently used, in particular algorithms based on mean-field variational EM (Beal, 2003), the wake-sleep algorithm (Dayan, 2000), policygradient methods such as REINFORCE (Williams, 1992), or stochastic gradient methods (Hoffman et al., 2012). We develop an alternative to these inference algorithms that overcomes many of their limitations, and that is both scalable and efficient."

We develop these identities and refer to them as the rules for stochastic back-propagation.\nGradient descent methods in latent variable models typically require computations of the form: ∇θEqθ [f(ξ)], where θ is a set of parameters of a distribution qθ(ξ) and f is a loss function, which we assume to be integrable and smooth. Of special interest here are cases where the distribution q is a K-dimensional Gaussian N (ξ|µ,C) with parameters θ = {µ,C}.

Equation (9) can be interpreted as a modified back-propagation rule for Gaussian distributions that takes into account the gradients through the mean and covariance and that reduces to the standard back-propagation rule when C is constant. Unfortunately this rule requires knowledge of the Hessian matrix of f(ξ), which has an algorithmic complexity O(K3). For inference in DLGMs, we later introduce an unbiased though higher variance estimator that requires only quadratic complexity.\nWe can also derive general back-propagation rules for q-distributions other than the Gaussian.

We refer to the approximate posterior distribution q(ξ) as a recognition model, and its design is important for the success of such variational methods.\nWe use a variational distribution q(ξ) that factorises across the L layers, but not necessarily within a layer:\nq(ξ|V,θr) = N∏ n=1 L∏ l=1 N ( ξn,l|µl(vn),Cl(vn) ) , (13)\nwhere µl(v) and Cl(v) are generic maps represented by MLPs corresponding to the mean vector and covariance matrix of the units in layer l respectively.

Maintaining a full covariance matrix C in equation (14) would entail an algorithmic complexity O(LK3) where K is the number of latent variables per layer and L is the number of latent layers.\nThe simplest approach is to use a diagonal covariance matrix C = diag(d), where d is a K-dimensional vector. This approach is appealing since it allows for linear-time computation and sampling, but only allows for axis-aligned posterior distributions.\nWe can improve upon the diagonal approximation by considering a structured covariance parameterised by two independent vectors d and u. We parameterise the precision matrix C−1 (Magdon-Ismail & Purnell, 2010):\nC−1 = D + uuT , (15)\nwhere D = diag(d). This representation allows for arbitrary rotations of the Gaussian distribution along one principal direction, with relatively few additional parameters.\nBy application of the matrix inversion lemma, we obtain the covariance matrix in terms of d and u as:\nC = D−1 + ηD−1uuTD−1, η = 1 uTD−1u+1 , log |C| = log η − log |D|. (16)\nThis allows both the trace Tr(C) and the log |C| needed in the computation of the Gaussian KL to be computed in O(KL) time.\nIn addition, we can factorise the covariance matrix as the product of two matrices C = RRT . R is a square matrix of the same size as C and can be computed directly in terms of the vectors d and u. One solution for R is:\nR = D− 1 2 − [ 1−√η uTD−1u ] D−1uuTD− 1 2 . (17)\nDue to this structure, the product of R with an arbitrary vector can be computed in O(K) without having to compute R explicitly.

      "text" : "Directed Graphical Models. There is a broad existing literature on directed graphical models with depth. Our model is directly related to non-linear Gaussian belief networks (NLGNBN) (Frey & Hinton, 1999), which also use latent Gaussian distributions throughout a multi-layer hierarchy, but whose means are simple non-linear transformations of higher layers. Sigmoid belief networks (SBN) (Saul et al., 1996) are closely related and are models with Bernoulli variables at every layer. Both these models are trained by a mean-field variational EM algorithm. More recently, Gregor et al. (2013) described Deep Auto-regressive Networks (DARN), which also form a directed graphical model that uses auto-regressive Bernoulli distributions at each layer. The Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM) (Lawrence, 2005) is the non-parametric analogue of our model, and employs Gaussian process priors over the non-linear functions between each layer. Some of the best results using directed models are provided by the neural autoregressive density estimator (NADE) (Larochelle & Murray, 2011; Uria et al., 2013), which uses function approximation to model conditional distributions within a directed acyclic graph. We will also see this performance on the benchmark tests we present, but major drawbacks exist, such as its inability to allow for deep representations and difficulties in extending to locally connected models (e.g., through the use of convolutional layers) that allow for high-dimensional scaling.\nRelation to denoising auto-encoders. Denoising auto-encoders (DAE) (Vincent et al., 2010) introduce a random corruption to the encoder network and at-\ntempt to minimize the expected reconstruction error under this corruption noise with additional regularisation terms. Bengio et al. (2013) show how these models can be used as generative models, but since the generative process underlying the denoising auto-encoder is unknown, simulation from the model requires a slow Markov chain sampling procedure. In the model we describe, the recognition distribution q(ξ|v) can be interpreted as a stochastic encoder in the DAE setting. We can readily see the correspondence between the expression for the free energy (12) and the reconstruction error and regularization terms used in denoising autoencoders (c.f. equation (4) of Bengio et al. (2013)).\nIt is possible to now see denoising auto-encoders in the framework for variational learning in latent variable models. The key difference is that the form of encoding ‘corruption’ and regularisation terms used in our model have been derived from the variational principle to provide a strict bound on the data log-likelihood of a known directed generative model and that allows for easy generation of samples.\nAlternative Gradient Estimates. Other approaches for gradient estimation are typically used in the literature. The most general approaches are policy-gradient methods such as REINFORCE (Williams, 1992) that are simple to implement and applicable to both discrete and continuous models. This estimator can be written as:\n∇θEp[f(ξ)] = Ep[(f(ξ)− b)∇θ log p(ξ|θ)], (23)\nwhere b is a baseline typically chosen to reduce the variance of the estimator; we use draws ξ ∼ p(ξ|θ).\nUnfortunately the variance of (23) scales poorly with the number of random variables (Dayan et al., 1995). To see this limitation, consider\nfunctions of the form f(ξ) = ∑D i=1 f(ξi), where each individual term has a bounded variance, i.e., Var[f(ξi)] ≤ κ∀i for some κ > 0, and consider independent or weakly correlated random variables. Given these assumptions we have the following bounds for the variances of (7) and REINFORCE (23):\nGBP: Var[∇ξf(ξ)] ≤ κ REINFORCE: Var [ (ξ−µ) σ2 (f(ξ)− E[f(ξ)]) ] ≤ Dκ.\nThus, the REINFORCE estimator has the undesirable property that its variance scales linearly with the number of independent random variables in the target function, while the variance of GBP is bounded by a constant.\nAny correlation between the different terms in f(ξ) would reduce the absolute value of the variance (5). The assumption of weakly correlated terms is relevant\nfor variational learning in larger generative models where variables tend to depend strongly only on other variables in their Markov blanket (i.e. only neighbouring nodes in the graphical model tend to display strong correlations). Moreover, due to independence assumptions and structure in the variational distribution, the resulting free energies are often summations over weakly correlated or independent terms, further supporting this view. We provide a second view on the issue in appendix C.\nAnother very general alternative to REINFORCE is the wake-sleep algorithm (Dayan et al., 1995). The wake-sleep algorithm fails to optimise a single consistent objective function and there is thus no guarantee that it leads to a decrease of the free energy (12). But it has been shown to work well in some small practical examples. In figure 2(c) we provide a comparison of the performance achieved by our model and the wakesleep algorithm.\nStochastic back-propagation in other contexts. The key theorems for the Gaussian stochastic backpropagation were first exploited by Opper & Archambeau (2009) for variational learning in Gaussian process regression, and subsequently by Graves (2011) for learning the parameters of large neural networks.\nOpper & Archambeau (2009) make use of an unconditional variational approximation, which typically requires several iterations for every visible pattern v in order to converge to a local minimum of the free energy. In contrast, we use a parametric recognition model (eq. (13)) which can produce a one-shot sample from the approximate posterior distribution (similar to the procedure in Dayan et al. (1995); Dayan (2000)). Using a conditional, parametric recognition model also provides a cheap probabilistic encoding of the dataset and provides a framework for treating generative models and classes of auto-encoders on the same principled ground (as described above). Recently, Kingma & Welling (2013) also make the connection between stochastic back-propagation, generative auto-encoders and variational inference that we describe here. This work was developed simultaneously with ours and provides an additional perspective on the use and derivation of stochastic back-propagation rules."

We visualise the posterior distribution for a model with two Gaussian latent variables in figure 2. The true posterior distribution is shown by the grey regions and was computed by importance sampling with a large number of particles aligned in a grid between -5 and 5. In figure 2(a) we see that many posterior distributions are elliptical or spherical in shape and thus, it is reasonable to assume that they can be well described by a Gaussian approximation. Samples from the prior (shown in green) are spread widely over the space and very few samples fall in the region of significant posterior mass, explaining the inefficiency of estimation methods that rely on samples from the prior. Samples from the recognition model (shown in blue) are concentrated on the posterior mass, indicating that the recognition model has learnt the correct posterior statistics and should lead to efficient learning.\nIn figure 2(a) we see that samples from the recognition model are aligned to the axis and cannot capture any correlation in the posterior. Using the low-rank covariance model, we see in figure 2(b) that we are able to capture the posterior correlation. Not all posteriors are Gaussian in shape, but the recognition places mass in the best location possible to provide a reasonable approximation. This aspect emphasises the importance of posterior approximation, and one we continue to investigate.

The model produces very good completions in both test cases. There is uncertainty in the identity of the image. This is expected and reflected in the errors in these completions as the resampling procedure is run, and further demonstrates the ability of the model to capture the diversity of the underlying data. We do not integrate over the missing values in our imputation procedure, but use a procedure that simulates a Markov chain that we show converges to the true marginal distribution. The procedure to sample from the missing pixels given the observed pixels is explained in appendix E."

For models with discrete latent variables (e.g., sigmoid belief networks), policy-gradient approaches that improve upon the REINFORCE approach remain the most general, but intelligent design is needed to control the gradient-variance in high dimensional settings.\nThese models are typically used with a large number\nof latent variables. In this setting, and under the appropriate conditions, the required expectations for inference could be well approximated by Gaussian integrals. Thus, we believe that our approach is applicable even in the high-dimensional discrete setting: we can apply the gradient estimators derived in section 4 as an approximation in high-dimensional discrete latent variable models, and potentially obtain new learning rules for these models.\nAn additional feature of our approach is that it can easily be combined with convolutional architectures and computation using GPUs to allow for scaling to the large-data settings we are now routinely faced with. More investigation is required to fully explore the impact of the structure of the recognition model and to allow more accurate covariance estimation. This is particularly important in the high-dimensional setting where we lack intuition regarding the characteristics of the posterior distribution. This and other extensions form the basis of much future work."

Our approach introduces a recognition model, which can be seen as a stochastic encoding of the data, to allow for efficient and tractable inference. We derived a lower bound on the marginal likelihood for the generative model and specified the structure and regularisation of the recognition model by exploiting recent advances in deep learning. By developing modified rules for back-propagation through stochastic layers, we derived an efficient inference algorithm that allows for joint optimisation of all parameters, i.e. parameters of the generative and recognition models. We have demonstrated on several real-world data sets that the model generates realistic samples, provides accurate imputations of missing data and can be a useful tool for high-dimensional data visualisation."

We provide more details on this view here for clarity.\nFrom the model description (3), (4), we can interpret the variables hl as deterministic functions of the noise variables ξl. This can be formally introduced as a coordinate transformation of the probability density in equation (5): we perform a change of coordinates hl → ξl. The density of the transformed variables ξ can be expressed in terms of the density (5) times the determinant of the Jacobian of the transformation p(ξ) = p(h(ξ))| ∂h\n∂ξ |. Since the coordinate transforma-\ntion is linear we have | ∂h ∂ξ | = |Gl| and the distribution of ξ is:\np(ξ)=p(hL)|GL| L−1∏ l=1 |Gl|pl(hl|hl+1)= L∏ l=1 |Gl||Sl|− 1 2N (ξl)\n= L∏ l=1 |Gl||GlGTl |− 1 2N (ξl) = L∏ l=1 N(ξl), (25)\nwhere N (ξ) is a Gaussian with mean zero and covariance equal to the identity matrix.

      "text" : "In section 3 we described two ways in which to derive stochastic back-propagation rules. We show specific examples and provide some more discussion in this section.\nB.1. Using the Product Rule for Integrals\nWe can derive rules for stochastic back-propagation for many distributions by finding a appropriate nonlinear function that allows us to express the gradient with respect to the parameters of the distribution as a gradient with respect to the random variable directly. The approach we described in the main text was:\n∇θEp[f(x)]= ∫ ∇θp(x|θ)f(x)dx= ∫ ∇xp(x|θ)B(x)f(x)dx\n= [B(x)f(x)p(x|θ)]supp(x) − ∫ p(x|θ)∇x[B(x)f(x)]\n= −Ep(x|θ)[∇x[B(x)f(x)]] (30)\nwhere we have introduced the non-linear function B(x) to allows the transformation of the gradients and have applied the product rule for integrals (rule for integration by parts) to rewrite the integral in two parts in the second line, and the supp(x) indicates that the term is evaluated at the boundaries of the support. To use this approach, we require that the density we are analysing be zero at the boundaries of the support to ensure that the first term in the second line is zero.\nAs an alternative, we can also write this differently and find an non-linear function of the form:\n∇θEp[f(x)]== −Ep(x|θ)[B(x)∇xf(x)]. (31)\nConsider general exponential family distributions of the form:\np(x|θ) = h(x) exp(η(θ)>φ(x)−A(θ)) (32)\nwhere h(x) is the base measure, θ is the set of mean parameters of the distribution, η is the set of natural parameters, and A(θ) is the log-partition function. We can express the non-linear function in (30) using these quantities as:\nB(x) = [∇θη(θ)φ(x)−∇θA(θ)]\n[∇x log[h(x)] + η(θ)T∇xφ(x)] . (33)\nThis can be derived for a number of distributions such as the Gaussian, inverse Gamma, Log-Normal, Wald (inverse Gaussian) and other distributions. We show some of these below:\nThe B(x) corresponding to the second formulation can also be derived and may be useful in certain situations, requiring the solution of a first order differential equation. This approach of searching for non-linear transformations leads us to the second approach for deriving stochastic back-propagation rules.\nFamily θ B(x)\nGaussian\n( µ σ2 ) ( −1 (x−µ−σ)(x−µ+σ)\n2σ2(x−µ) ) Inv.

Using Alternative Co-ordinate Transformations\nThere are many distributions outside the exponential family that we would like to consider using. A simpler approach is to search for a co-ordinate transformation that allows us to separate the deterministic and stochastic parts of the distribution. We described the case of the Gaussian in section 3. Other distributions also have this property. As an example, consider the Levy distribution (which is a special case of the inverse Gamma considered above). Due to the self-similarity property of this distribution, if we draw X from a Levy distribution with known parameters X ∼ Levy(µ, λ), we can obtain any other Levy distribution by rescaling and shifting this base distribution: kX + b ∼ Levy(kµ+ b, kc).\nMany other distributions hold this property, allowing stochastic back-propagation rules to be determined for distributions such as the Student’s t-distribution, Logistic distribution, the class of stable distributions and the class of generalised extreme value distributions (GEV). Examples of co-ordinate transformations T (·) and the resulsting distributions are shown below for variates X drawn from the standard distribution listed in the first column.\nStd Distr. T (·) Gen.

Additionally, the ratio between the variances of the former and later estimators is lowerbounded by 5/2. We can also see that the variance of the estimator based on (8) is zero for this specific function whereas the variance of the estimator based on (11) is not.\nThe high variance nature of the policy gradient approaches are undesirable and is magnified in multivarate settings, leading to the variance estimates that scale with the dimensionality of the latent variables that were discussed in section 5"

The imputation procedure can be written formally as a Markov chain with\ntransition kernel T q(vm → v′m) given by\nT q(vm → v′m) = ∫ p(v′|ξ)q(ξ|v)dξ, (40)\nwhere v = (vm,vo) and v ′ = (v′m,vo).\nProvided that the recognition model q(ξ|v) constitutes a good approximation of the true posterior p(ξ|v), (40) can be seen as an approximation of the Kernel\nT (vm → v′m) = ∫ p(v′|ξ)p(ξ|v)dξ. (41)\nThe kernel (41) has two important properties: (i) it has as eigen-distribution the model’s marginal p(vm|vo); (ii) T (v → v′) > 0∀v,v′. The property (i) can be derived by applying the kernel (41) to the marginal p(vm|vo) and noting that it is an fixed point. Property (ii) is an immediate consequence of the smoothness of the model.\nWe apply the fundamental theorem for Markov chains (Neal, 1993, pp. 38) and conclude that given the above properties, a Markov chain generated by (41) is guaranteed to generate samples from the correct marginal p(vm|vo).\nIn practice, the stationary distribution of the completed pixels will not be exactly the model’s marginal p(vm|vo), since we can only use the approximated kernel (40). We can nevertheless provide a bound on the L1 norm of the difference between the resulting stationary marginal and the target marginal p(vm|vo) by the following proposition.\nProposition E.1 (L1 bound on marginal error ). If the recognition model q(ξ|v) is such that for all ξ\n∃ε > 0 s.t. ∫ ∣∣∣∣q(ξ|v)p(v)p(ξ) − p(v|ξ) ∣∣∣∣ dv ≤ ε (42) then the marginal p(v) is a weak fixed point of the kernel (40) in the following sense:\n∫ ∣∣∣∣∫ [T q(vm → v′m)− T (v→ v′)] p(v)dv∣∣∣∣ dv′ < ε. (43)\nProof.∫ ∣∣∣∣∫ [T q(vm → v′m)− T (v→ v′)] p(v)dv∣∣∣∣ dv′ =\n∫ ∣∣∣∣∫ p(v′|ξ)p(v)[q(ξ|v)− p(ξ|v)]dvdξ∣∣∣∣ dv′ = ∫ ∣∣∣∣∫ p(v′|ξ)p(v)[q(ξ|v)− p(ξ|v)]p(v)p(ξ) p(ξ)p(v)dvdξ ∣∣∣∣ dv′\n= ∫ ∣∣∣∣∫ p(v′|ξ)p(ξ)[q(ξ|v)p(v)p(ξ) − p(v|ξ)]dvdξ ∣∣∣∣ dv′\n≤ ∫ ∫ p(v′|ξ)p(ξ) ∫ ∣∣∣∣q(ξ|v)p(v)p(ξ) − p(v|ξ) ∣∣∣∣ dvdξdv′ ≤ ε.\nwhere we apply the condition (42) to obtain the last statement. That is, if the recognition model is sufficiently close to the true posterior to guarantee that (42) holds for some acceptable error ε than (43) guarantees that the fixed point of the Markov chain induced by (40) is not further and ε away from the true marginal with respect to the L1 norm.\nF. Variational Bayes for Deep Directed Models\nIn the main test we focussed on the variational problem of specifying an posterior on the latent variables only. It is natural to consider the variational Bayes problem in which we specify an approximate posterior for both the latent variables and model parameters.\nFollowing the same construction and considering an Gaussian approximate distribution on the model parameters θg, the free energy becomes:\nF(V) = − ∑ n reconstruction error︷ ︸︸ ︷ Eq[log p(vn|h(ξn))]\n+ 1\n2 ∑ n,l [ ‖µn,l‖2 + TrCn,l − log |Cn,l| − 1 ] ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nlatent regularization term\n+ 1\n2 ∑ j [ m2j κ + τj κ + log κ− log τj − 1 ] ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nparameter regularization term\n, (44)\nwhich now includes an additional term for the cost of using parameters and their regularisation.

The model class we describe here builds upon other widely-used models with latent Gaussian distributions and provides an inference mechanism for use within this diverse model class. Recognising the latent Gaussian structure shows the connection to models such as generalised linear regression, Gaussian process regression, factor analysis, probabilistic principal components analysis, stochastic volatility models, and other latent Gaussian graphical models (such as logGaussian Cox processes and models for covariance selection).\nAlternative Inference Approaches. The most common approach for inference in deep directed models has been variational EM. The alternating minimisation often suffers from slow convergence, expensive parameter learning steps, and typically requires the specification of additional local bounds to allows for efficient computation of the required expectations. The wake-sleep algorithm (Dayan, 2000) is a further alternative, but fails to optimise a single consistent objective function and has had limited success in the past. For latent Gaussian models, other alternative inference algorithms have been proposed: the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) has been popular, but it is limited to models with very few hyperparameters (Rue et al., 2009). Alternative variational algorithms such as expectation propagation (EP) (Minka, 2001) can also be used, but are numerically difficult to implement and have performance similar to approaches based on the variational lower bound."

Our algorithm introduces a recognition model to represent approximate posterior distributions, and that acts as a stochastic encoder of the data. We develop stochastic backpropagation – rules for back-propagation through stochastic variables – and use this to develop an algorithm that allows for joint optimisation of the parameters of both the generative and recognition model. We demonstrate on several real-world data sets that the model generates realistic samples, provides accurate imputations of missing data and is a useful tool for high-dimensional data visualisation.",
