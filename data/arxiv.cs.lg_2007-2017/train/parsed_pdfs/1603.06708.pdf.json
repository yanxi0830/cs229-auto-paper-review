      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nMulti-label learning has attracted much attention in the past decade [1], [2]. Its goal is to learn a classifier to map the input instance into a label vector space, where each instance is associated with multiple labels instead of one single label. Different from multi-class learning, multiple labels in multi-label learning are often assumed to be correlated with each other. Often, this correlation among labels is beneficial to accurately predicting labels of test instances. Due to its empirical success, multi-label learning has been widely applied to various domains including image annotation [3], video concept detection [4], web page categorization [5], and visual object recognition [6].\nDuring the past years, many multi-label learning algorithms have been proposed. One simplified approach is to decompose multi-label learning into multiple independent binary classification problems (one per label or category). However, such a solution does not consider the relationship among labels, whereas previous studies [7], [1] have revealed that the label relationship is quite helpful and should be considered. Therefore, several approaches attempt to exploit label correlations by incorporating external prior knowledge [8], [9], [10], [11]. Considering that the prior knowledge is often unavailable in real applications, many other approaches [7], [12], [13], [14],\nC. Li and W. Dong are with IBM Research-China, Beijing 100094, China.

E-mail: zhangxiaoyu@iie.ac.cn\n[15], [16], [1] try to mine label relationships based on training data and incorporate the label correlations into the learning process of multi-label model. In addition, there are also many works focusing on leveraging other learning techniques for multi-label learning, such as multi-instance multi-label learning [17], active learning for multi-label learning [18], and multi-label learning combined with multi-kernel learning [19].\nThe algorithms above treat all the categories equally and also treat all the training instances per category equally when training the model. However, in real-world scenarios, the complexities of different label learning tasks may differ quite much, and the same for complexities of different training instances in one label learning task. For example, as shown in Figure 1, when learning the label tiger, image (b) is clearly harder than image (a), since the color of the tiger in image (b) is quite similar to the background, and the tiger in (b) is partially occlusive by the trees. Moreover, in image (a), the label Siberian tiger is more difficult to learn than the label tiger, since Siberian tiger is a subclass of tiger. In addition, many multi-label learning methods are associated with nonconvex objective functions, which is prone to local minima especially in the presence of large corruption and bad starting point.\nInspired by how children learn concepts, self-paced learning [20] advocates a paradigm that learning should first consider ‘simple’ or ‘easy’ instances, and then gradually take ‘complex’ or ‘hard’ instances into account. By simulating such a process of human learning, it has been empirically verified that self-paced learning can mitigate the problem of local-minima during iterative learning [20], [21], and exhibit better generalization behavior in many tasks, such as matrix factorization [22], multi-view learning [23], and multi-instance learning [24]. Based on these facts, we conclude that adding the training instances into the learning process in order of complexities can produce a more robust and accurate multilabel learning model.\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n06 70\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n2 M\nar 2\n01 6\n2 This paper proposes a novel multi-label learning framework, called Multi-Label Self-Paced Learning (MLSPL), which is an effort to build a connection between multi-label learning and self-paced learning, in a principled fashion. MLSPL aims to learn multi-label model by introducing a self-paced function as a regularizer that can simultaneously take into consideration the complexities of both instances and labels during learning. Similar to human’s learning mechanism, MLSPL should use different learning schemes for different multi-label learning scenarios. To achieve this, we present a general way to find the self-paced functions for the desired learning schemes. Finally, we tailor a simple yet effective algorithm to solve the optimization problem. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, compared to the state-of-the-art methods."

      "heading" : "II. BACKGROUND",
      "text" : "We first define notations and then briefly introduce the work [1] that our approach is originated from. Let X = Rd be the d-dimensional input feature space and Y = {−1,+1}L the finite set of L possible labels. Given a multi-label training set D = {(xi,yi)}ni=1, where xi = [xi1, . . . , xid] ∈ X is the i-th instance and yi = [yi1, . . . , yiL] ⊆ Y is the label vector associated with xi. yij is +1 if xi has the j-th label and −1 otherwise. The goal of multi-label learning is to learn a multi-label learner h : X → 2L from the training set D, so that we can predict a set of labels for each unseen instance.\nAs mentioned earlier, most existing multi-label learning methods attempt to exploit the correlations among labels to help learn the classifier h. Among these methods, one representative algorithm is ML-LOC [1] which tries to exploit the correlations locally; it assumes that the instances are partitioned into m different clusters and each cluster shares a subset of label correlations. Let W = [w1, . . . ,wL] ∈ Rn×L, Q = [q1, . . . ,qn] ∈ Rm×n, and A = [a1, . . . ,am] ∈ RL×m where aj ∈ RL is the mean of all the label vectors in the j-th cluster. Before explaining the variables, we first provide its formulation.\nmin W,A,\nQ∈[0,1]m×n L∑ l=1 L(wl,Q;D) + αΓ(W) + βΩ(A) (1)\n= L∑ l=1 L(wl,Q;D)+α L∑ l=1 ‖wl‖2+β n∑ i=1 m∑ j=1 qij‖yi−aj‖2\ns.t. m∑ j=1 qij = 1,∀i ∈ [1, n],\nwhere W is the learned weight matrix with each column representing the weight vector for the corresponding task. L(wl,Q;D) is the empirical loss on the training set D for the l-th label, defined as L(wl,Q;D) = ∑n i=1 L(wl,qi;xi, yil). Let zi = [φ(xi);qi]1 where φ is a feature mapping induced by a kernel κ. Then L(wl,qi;xi, yil) = max(0, 1−yilwTl zi). The idea of ML-LOC is as follows. If the label vector yi is close to aj , then it is more likely that xi belongs to the j-th\n1The symbol [u;v] means flatten u,v into one single column vector.\ncluster. Moreover, minimizing the third term in (1) will result in a larger qij when yi is closer to aj . Thus, Q encodes the similarity between instances and clusters. The first term aims to take the similarity information as additional features for the instance, and incorporates them into the learning process of the classifier. By jointly optimizing these terms, the global discrimination fitting and local correlation sensitivity can be realized in a unified framework."

      "heading" : "A. Proposed Formulation",
      "text" : "As can be seen from (1), the objective function treats all the training instances and all the label learning tasks equally. However, we should prioritize learning the easier instances and the easier labels. Moreover, the non-convexity of problem (1) renders the issue of bad local minima. To overcome these shortcomings, one interesting principle is that learning should be first done on the easy instances, and then gradually take the hard. This coincides with the idea for self-paced learning which is inspired by the way humans learn. Indeed, selfpaced learning has empirically demonstrated its usefulness for mitigating bad local minima and achieving better model generalization [20], [25]. More specifically, here we have ‘easy’ and ‘hard’ labels, as well as ‘easy’ and ‘hard’ instances. With the aim to incorporate the self-paced learning paradigm into the multi-label learning regime, we propose the following objective function by considering the complexities of labels and instances in a unified setting:\nmin W,A,\nQ∈[0,1]m×n , V∈[0,1]n×L\nn∑ i=1 L∑ l=1 v (l) i L(wl,qi;xi, yil) + αΓ(W)\n+βΩ(A) + f(V, λ) (2)\ns.t. m∑ j=1 qij = 1,∀i ∈ [1, n],\nwhere v(l) = [v(l)1 , . . . , v (l) n ]T consists of the weights of n instances for the l-th label. V = [v(1), . . . ,v(L)]. Different from (1), the first term in (2) is a weighted loss term on the training data D. f(V, λ) denotes the self-paced function or self-paced regularizer used to determine which label learning tasks and the corresponding instances to be selected during training: we can select ‘easy’ labels and ‘easy’ instances for learning at the beginning of training. As the learning is iteratively proceeded, we can gradually add ‘hard’ labels and ‘hard’ instances into the process.\nMore importantly, since different problems often need different self-paced learning schemes during training, there is no universal self-paced function for all applications. Although many self-paced regularizers have been proposed for various\n3 applications [20], [24], [25], there lacks of a general method to derive the self-paced functions. In the following, we provide a general method to find the appropriate self-paced functions."

      "heading" : "B. Self-Paced Function",
      "text" : "First, we introduce definition of the self-paced function from the recent work [22]:\nDefinition 1. Suppose that v is a weight variable, l is the loss, and λ is the learning pace parameter. f(v, λ) is called self-paced function, if\n1) f(v, λ) is convex with respect to v ∈ [0, 1]; 2) v∗ is monotonically decreasing with respect to l, and it\nholds that liml→0 v∗ ≤ 1, liml→∞ v∗ = 0; 3) v∗ is monotonically increasing with respect to λ, and it\nholds that limλ→0 v∗ = 0, limλ→∞ v∗ ≤ 1; where v∗(l, λ) = arg minv∈[0,1] vl + f(v, λ) for fixed l, λ.\nWe can see that v∗(l, λ) is an S-shaped function in l. In order to find the self-paced function f , we first find a family of S-shaped functions gλ(l) with range in [0, 1] such that it is monotonically decreasing with respect to l, and that liml→∞ gλ(l) = 0 as well as liml→0 gλ(l) ≤ 1. We further want gλ(l) to increase with respect to λ when keeping l fixed. Let v∗ = gλ(l) be the arg min in Definition 1. Thus Conditions 2 and 3 in Definition 1 are satisfied. Let l = s(λ, v) be the inverse function of gλ(l). Then we propose the original lemma based on Definition 1.\nLemma 1. A smooth function f(v, λ) is a self-paced function corresponding to v∗ if and only if ∂f(v,λ)∂v = −s(λ, v) and ∂s(v,λ) ∂v ≤ 0 for v ∈ [0, 1]. Proof. Since v∗ = arg min vl + f(v, λ). We need\n∂(vl + f(v, λ))\n∂v = 0.\nBy plugging in v∗, we have\nl + ∂f(v∗, λ)\n∂v = 0.\nBy our definition above, we know that l = s(λ, v). So we need to have that ∂f(v,λ)∂v = −s(λ, v). In this way we have related f(v, λ) with v∗ which satisfies Conditions 2 and 3.\nNow we also need Condition 1 to be satisfied. It is equivalent to say that ∂\n2f(v,λ) ∂v2 ≥ 0. Thus we have\n∂2f(v, λ) ∂v2 = ∂(−s(λ, v)) ∂v ≥ 0.\nSince different multi-label learning scenarios often need different self-paced schemes, it is necessary to develop more schemes for exploring this interesting direction. Next, we discuss some examples of self-paced learning schemes.\nExample 1. We choose v∗ as the arctan function, which is a classical S-shaped activation function.\nv∗(l, λ) = −arctan(l − λ) + π/2\nπ . (3)\nThis function is centrally symmetric around the axis l = λ. And v∗ is invairant under l − λ.\nIn order to obtain the inverse function of v∗, we have that cot(πv∗) + λ = l. Therefore s(λ, v) = λ+ cot(πv). Thus\n−s(λ, v) = ∂f(v, λ) ∂v = −λ− cot(πv).\nIntegrating, we can obtain f(v, λ) by f(v, λ) = − ∫ v s(v, λ) = −λv − ln | sin(πv)|/π. (4) We also need to check that f is convex. Therefore it suffices to check that ∂s(v,λ)∂v = −π\n2/ sin2(πv) ≤ 0. Thus we have checked that f(v, λ) is a self-paced function corresponding to v∗(l, λ).\nExample 2. v∗ is the classical sigmoid function. We want\nv∗(l, λ) = 2\n1 + el/λ . (5)\nThis v∗ is invariant under l/λ Clearly v∗(l, λ) ∈ [0, 1] as l ≥ 0. By solving l in terms of v∗ and λ, we have l = s(v, λ) = λ ln(2/v−1). Thus we have\nf(v, λ) = − ∫ v s(v, λ) = λ((2− v) ln(2− v) + v ln v). (6)\nTo check that f is convex in v, we just need ∂s∂v ≤ 0. This is the case since ∂s∂v = 2λ (v−2)v ≤ 0 when v ∈ [0, 1]. Example 3. v∗ is the classical tanh function, another wellknown activation function.\nv∗(l, λ) = 1\n1 + e2(l−λ) . (7)\nThis v∗ is invariant under l − λ. Therefore l = s(v, λ) = 1 2 ln(1/v − 1) + λ. By f(v, λ) = − ∫ v s(v, λ), we have\nf(v, λ) = 1\n2 ((1− v) ln(1− v) + v ln v)− λv. (8)\nTo check that f is convex in v, we just need ∂s∂v ≤ 0. This is the case since ∂s∂v = 1 2(v−1)v ≤ 0 when v ∈ [0, 1]. Example 4. v∗ is another well-known activation function, the exponential function, defined by\nv∗(l, λ) = e−l/λ. (9)\nClearly this is an S-shaped curve in l. When l → 0 we have v∗(l, λ) → 1. Also as l → ∞, we have v∗(l, λ) → 0. v∗ is invariant under l/λ. Similar to before, we have l = s(v, λ) = λ √ − ln v. Thus by f(v, λ) = − ∫ v s(v, λ) we have\nf(v, λ) = λ ( −2v − √ πErf(− √ − ln v)√\n− ln v\n)√ − ln v/2, (10)\nwhere Erf(x) is the error function. To check that f is convex in v, we just need ∂s∂v ≤ 0. This is the case since ∂s ∂v = − 1 2v √ − ln v which is no greater than 0 when v ∈ [0, 1].\nIn general, after fixing one S-shaped function in terms of l, we can create a family of S-shaped functions gλ(l) by deciding whether it is invariant under l/λc for some positive constant c or l−λ as shown in the examples above. By integrating the corresponding inverse function s(v, λ) and then integrating s against v, we can find the self-paced function f(v, λ).\n4 Algorithm 1 Multi-Label Self-Paced Learning Algorithm Input: Data matrix D, Number of groups m;\nRegularization parameters α and β; Self-paced parameters: λ, µ > 1;\n1.

They have 194, 593, and 2407 instances and 7, 6, 6 possible labels, respectively. To further evaluate MLSPL’s performance, we compare it with several state-of-the-art multilabel learning algorithms3. We first compare with ML-LOC [1] that is the most related multi-label learning approach to ours. We also compare with ML-kNN [27] and RankSVM [7] that consider first-order and second order correlations, respectively. In addition, we compare with TRAM [28] that is proposed recently. Finally, we compare with another baseline BSVM [12] that learns a binary SVM for each label. LibSVM [26] is used to implement the SVM models for BSVM, MLLOC and MLSPL. For the compared methods, the parameters recommended in the corresponding literatures are used. In our method, the regularization parameters α and β are set the same with ML-LOC. The initial self-paced parameter λ and µ is searched from {10−5, 10−4, 10−3, 10−2} and {1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5}, and then λ is iteratively increased to make ‘harder’ label tasks and instances included gradually. We evaluate the performances of the compared approaches with five commonly used multi-label criteria: hamming loss, ranking loss, one error, coverage, and average precision. These criteria measure the performance from different aspects and the detailed definitions can be found in [29], [30]. In the following experiments, on each data set, we randomly select 30% instances as the training data, and use the rest 70% instances as the testing data. We repeat each experiment 10 times, and report the average results as well as standard deviations over the 10 repetitions.\n2These datasets can be downloaded from http://mulan.sourceforge.net/datasets-mlc.html\n3The codes of the compared methods are obtained from the corresponding authors.\n5\n6"

In addition, as can be seen from the objective functions (1) and (2), ML-LOC is a special case to our method: when all the entries in V are 1, our method is reduced to ML-LOC.

    "abstractText" : "In this paper, we propose a novel multi-label learning framework, called Multi-Label Self-Paced Learning (MLSPL), in an attempt to incorporate the self-paced learning strategy into multi-label learning regime. In light of the benefits of adopting the easy-to-hard strategy proposed by self-paced learning, the devised MLSPL aims to learn multiple labels jointly by gradually including label learning tasks and instances into model training from the easy to the hard. We first introduce a self-paced function as a regularizer in the multi-label learning formulation, so as to simultaneously rank priorities of the label learning tasks and the instances in each learning iteration. Considering that different multi-label learning scenarios often need different self-paced schemes during optimization, we thus propose a general way to find the desired self-paced functions. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets suggest the state-of-the-art performance of our approach.",
