      "text" : "Least Squares Twin Support Vector Machine (LSTSVM) is an extremely efficient and fast version of SVM algorithm for binary classification. LSTSVM combines the idea of Least Squares SVM and Twin SVM in which two nonparallel hyperplanes are found by solving two systems of linear equations. Although, the algorithm is very fast and efficient in many classification tasks, it is unable to cope with two features of real-world problems. First, in many realworld classification problems, it is almost impossible to assign data points to a single class. Second, data points in real-world problems may have different importance. In this study, we propose a novel version of LSTSVM based on fuzzy concepts to deal with these two characteristics of real-world data. The algorithm is called Fuzzy LSTSVM (FLSTSVM) which provides more flexibility than binary classification of LSTSVM. Two models are proposed for the algorithm. In the first model, a fuzzy membership value is assigned to each data point and the hyperplanes are optimized based on these fuzzy samples. In the second model we construct fuzzy hyperplanes to classify data. Finally, we apply our proposed FLSTSVM to an artificial as well as three real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that FLSTSVM obtains better performance than SVM and LSTSVM.\nKeywords: Machine learning, Fuzzy least squares twin support vector machine, Fuzzy hyperplane, SVM."

Some of these tasks are: text classification [2], image classification [3], and bioinformatics [4, 5].\nOne of the newest versions of SVM is Least Squares Twin Support Vector Machine (LSTSVM) introduced in 2009 [6]. The algorithm combines the idea of Least Squares SVM (LSSVM) [7] and Twin SVM (TSVM) [8]. Although, in some classification tasks LSTSVM provides high accuracies [6] it still suffers from two main drawbacks. (I) In real-world applications, the data points may not be fully assigned to a class, while LSTSVM strictly assigns each data point to a class, (II) Although, in many classification tasks data points have different importance; LSTSVM considers the data points to have same priorities.\nMany real-world applications require different values of importance for input data. In such cases, the main concern is how to determine the final classes by assigning different importance degrees to training data. Moreover, the classifier should be designed in a way that it has the ability to separate the noises from data. A good approach to cope with these challenges is to use the concept of fuzzy functions.\nThe fuzzy theory is very useful for analyzing complex processes using standard quantitative methods or when the available information is interpreted uncertainly. A fuzzy function can represent uncertainty in data structures using fuzzy parameters. In the literature, the concepts of fuzzy function and fuzzy operations are introduced by different researchers [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. A fuzzy function offers an efficient way of capturing the inexact nature of real-world problems.\nIn this paper we incorporate the concept of fuzzy set theory into the LSTSVM model. Unlike the standard LSTSVM, in the training phase the proposed fuzzy LSTSVM treats training data points according to their importance degrees. In the literature several approaches of applying fuzzy sets in SVM have been proposed [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. The key feature of the proposed fuzzy LSTSVM is that it assigns fuzzy membership values to data points based on their importance degrees. In addition, we use fuzzy numbers to set the parameters of the fuzzy LSTSVM model such as the weight vector and the bias term. Using these two features, we proposed two models for fuzzy LSTSVM.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. A brief review of basic concepts including the SVM, TSVM, and LSTSVM is presented in Section 2. The proposed models for fuzzy LSTSVM are introduced in Section 3. In section 4 we evaluate the proposed models, and finally section 5 concludes the paper."

Suppose we are given a set of training data points xi ∈ Rd, i = 1, · · · ,n with labels yi ∈ {−1,+1}. SVM seeks for a hyperplane with equation w.x+ b = 0 with the following constraints:\nyi(w.xi + b) ≥ 1, ∀i. (1)\nwhere w is the weight vector. Such a hyperplane could be obtained by solving Eq.

[8] proposed TSVM with the idea of using two hyperplanes in which samples are assigned to a class according to their distance from the hyperplanes. The main equations of TSVM are as follows:\nxiw (1) + b(1) = 0 (3)\nxiw (2) + b(2) = 0\nwhere w(i) and b(i) are the weight vector and bias term of the ith hyperplane, respectively. Each hyperplane represents the samples of its class. This concept is geometrically depicted in Fig. 2 for a toy example. In TSVM, the two hyperplanes are non-parallel. Each of them is closest to the samples of its own class and farthest from the samples of the opposite class [19, 20].\nLet us assume that A and B indicate two data points of class +1 and class −1, respectively.

      "text" : "LSTSVM [6, 21] is a binary classifier which combines the idea of LSSVM and TSVM. In other words, LSTSVM employs least squares of errors to modify the inequality constraints in TSVM to equality constraints and solves a set of linear equations rather than two Quadratic Programming Problems (QPPs). Experiments have shown that LSTSVM can considerably reduce the training time, while preserving competitive classification accuracy [7, 22]. Furthermore, since the time complexity of SVM is of order m3, where m is the number of constraints, theoretically when there are equal number of positive and negative samples, the speed of the algorithm increases by the factor of four compared to\nthe standard SVM.\nLSTSVM finds its hyperplanes by minimizing Eq.

      "text" : "In many real-world applications a sample in the training data does not belong exactly to a single class. Furthermore, in some applications it would be desirable for the new training samples to have higher importance than older ones. Given\nthe uncertainty of assigning such importance values, the fuzzy sets provide an elegant way to cope with this problem. We can define a fuzzy membership degree µi for each sample in the training data. The membership degree is a number between 0 and 1 which can be considered as a measure of influence of the sample on the final class. Therefore, a training sample with membership degree of µi influences class +1 by µi and influences class −1 by (1−µi). In addition, using fuzzy membership functions, it is possible to assign a membership degree to each sample based on its entry time. Sequential learning [23] is another application which induces applying fuzzy concepts in classification algorithms such as SVM.\nIn 2008 Pei-Yi Hao introduced fuzzy SVM [18]. In his paper, he introduced two approaches, M1 and M2for applying fuzzy sets in SVM. In the first model, M1, he constructed a crisp hyperplane, and he also assigned a fuzzy membership to each data point. In the second model, M2, he constructed a fuzzy hyperplane to discriminate classes. In the following sections, we integrated the fuzzy set theory into the LSTSVM algorithm in accordance with [18]."

Let us assume that ∆1 = (δ1, γ1) and ∆2 = (δ2, γ2) are fuzzy distances between a data point and the two hyperplanes H1 and H2, respectively. Then for an input data x0, the degree that x0 belongs to hyperplane H1 is defined by the following membership function (by finding membership degrees for H1, membership degrees for H2 are easily obtainable):\nµ1(x0) =  1− δ1+γ1δ1+γ1+δ2+γ2 δ1 ≥ γ1, δ2 ≥ γ2, 1− δ1δ1+δ2+γ2 δ1 < γ1, δ2 ≥ γ2, 1− δ1+γ1δ1+γ1+δ2 δ1 ≥ γ1, δ2 < γ2 1− δ1δ1+δ2 δ1 < γ1, δ2 < γ2,\n(29)"

It should be noted that in this paper, only the linear version of all the three algorithms are studied. The obtained values for accuracies of all three algorithms are fully justifiable. In SVM there is only one hyperplane responsible of classifying data and because the dataset is defined as a two-dimensional space, this hyperplane would be a line which is shown in figure 4a. In LSTSVM algorithm we have two lines for classification. As mentioned in Section 2.3, these lines should be the nearest to their corresponding class records and farthest from the opposite class records. Figure 4b shows these lines for LSTSVM. Because the data points overlap and\nthey don’t exactly lie on a line, the LSTSVM algorithm has still a large amount of error although it has higher accuracy compared to the SVM. FLSTSVM also has two lines responsible for classifying data with the difference that these two lines are not crisp. Figure 4c shows the fuzzy lines of FLSTSVM. To show the fuzzy nature of each line, we have used multiple lines. As shown in the figure, these fuzzy lines discriminate the data points better than SVM and LSTSVM.

LSTSVM combines the idea of Least Squares SVM and Twin SVM in which two nonparallel hyperplanes are found by solving two systems of linear equations. Although, the algorithm is very fast and efficient in many classification tasks, it is unable to cope with two features of real-world problems. First, in many realworld classification problems, it is almost impossible to assign data points to a single class. Second, data points in real-world problems may have different importance. In this study, we propose a novel version of LSTSVM based on fuzzy concepts to deal with these two characteristics of real-world data. The algorithm is called Fuzzy LSTSVM (FLSTSVM) which provides more flexibility than binary classification of LSTSVM. Two models are proposed for the algorithm. In the first model, a fuzzy membership value is assigned to each data point and the hyperplanes are optimized based on these fuzzy samples. In the second model we construct fuzzy hyperplanes to classify data. Finally, we apply our proposed FLSTSVM to an artificial as well as three real-world datasets. Results demonstrate that FLSTSVM obtains better performance than SVM and LSTSVM.",
