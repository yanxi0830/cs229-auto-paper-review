      "text" : "Traditional security systems seek to ensure that an attacker can never access or modify critical parts of a system, by creating clear boundaries between the system and outside world. In machine learning, however, the most critical ingredient of all – the training data – comes directly from the outside world. For a system trained on user data, an attacker can inject malicious data simply by creating a user account. Such data poisoning attacks require us to re-think what it means for a system to be secure.\nThe focus of the present work is on data poisoning attacks against classification algorithms, first studied by Biggio et al. (2012) and later by a number of others (Xiao et al., 2012; 2015b; Newell et al., 2014; Mei and Zhu, 2015b; Burkard and Lagesse, 2017; Koh and Liang, 2017). This body of work has demonstrated data poisoning attacks that can degrade classifier accuracy, sometimes dramatically. Moreover, while some defenses have been proposed against specific attacks (Laishram and Phoha, 2016), few have been stress-tested against a determined attacker.\nAre there defenses that are robust to a large class of data poisoning attacks? The main difficulty in answering this question is the near-limitless space of possible attacks. Because of this, it is impossible to conclude from empirical success alone that a defense that works against a known set of attacks will not fail against some new attack.\nIn this paper, we address this difficulty by presenting a framework for providing certified defenses and near-optimal attacks via no-regret learning. Our framework applies to defenders that (i) remove outliers residing outside a feasible set, then (ii) minimize a margin-based loss on the remaining data. For such defenders, we can generate approximate upper bounds on the efficacy of any data poisoning attack, along with a candidate attack that nearly matches the bound. We consider two different settings: first, where the outlier detector is trained independently and cannot be affected by the poisoned data, and second, where the data poisoning can attack the outlier detector as well.\nIn the first setting, we apply our framework to an “oracle” defense that knows the true class centroids and removes points that are far away from the centroid of the corresponding class. While previous work showed successful attacks on the MNIST-1-7 (Biggio et al., 2012) and Dogfish (Koh and Liang, ∗Equal contribution.\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n03 69\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 9\nJ un\n2 01\n7\n2017) image datasets in the absence of any defenses, we show (Section 4) that no attack is possible against this oracle — e.g., the test error of an SVM on either dataset is at most 4%, even after adding 30% poisoned data. On the other hand, our candidate attack increases classification test error on the IMDB sentiment corpus from 12% to 23% with only 3% poisoned data.\nFor the second setting, we consider a more realistic defender that uses the empirical (poisoned) centroids. For small amounts of poisoned data (≤ 5%) we can still establish the resilience of MNIST1-7 and Dogfish to attack (Section 5). However, with more poisoned data, the attacker can subvert the outlier removal to obtain stronger attacks — e.g., increasing test error on MNIST-1-7 by 37% with 30% poisoned data."

      "text" : "Consider a prediction task from an input x ∈ X (e.g., Rd) to an output y ∈ Y (e.g., {−1,+1} for binary classification). Let ` be a non-negative loss function—e.g., for linear classification with the hinge loss, `(θ;x, y) = max(0, 1− y〈θ, x〉) for a model θ ∈ Θ ⊆ Rd and data point (x, y). Given a true data-generating distribution p∗ over X × Y , define the test loss as L(θ) = E(x,y)∼p∗ [`(θ;x, y)]. We consider the causative attack model (Barreno et al., 2010), which consists of a game between two players: the defender (who seeks to learn a model θ), and the attacker (who wants the learner to learn a bad model). The game proceeds as follows:\n• n data points are drawn from p∗ to produce a clean training dataset Dc. • The attacker adaptively chooses a “poisoned” dataset Dp of n poisoned points, where ∈ [0, 1]\nparametrizes the attacker’s resources. • The defender trains on the full dataset Dc ∪ Dp to produce a model θ̂, and incurs test loss L(θ̂).\nThe defender’s goal is to minimize the quantity L(θ̂) while the attacker’s goal is to maximize it.\nRemarks. We assume the attacker has full knowledge of the defender’s algorithm and of the clean training data Dc. While this may seem generous to the attacker, it is widely considered poor practice to rely on secrecy for security (Kerckhoffs, 1883; Biggio et al., 2014a); moreover, a determined attacker can often reverse-engineer necessary system details (Tramèr et al., 2016).\nThe causative attack model allows the attacker to add points but not modify existing ones. Indeed, systems constantly collect new data (e.g., product reviews, user feedback on social media, or insurance claims), whereas modification of existing data would require first compromising the system.\nAttacks that attempt to increase the overall test loss L(θ̂), known as indiscriminate availability attacks (Barreno et al., 2010), can be thought of as a denial-of-service attack. This is in contrast to targeted attacks on individual examples or sub-populations (e.g., Burkard and Lagesse, 2017). Both have serious security implications, but we focus on denial-of-service attacks, as they compromise the model in a broad sense and interfere with fundamental statistical properties of learning algorithms."

      "text" : "A defender who trains naïvely on the full (clean + poisoned) data Dc ∪ Dp is doomed to failure, as even a single poisoned point can in some cases arbitrarily change the model (Liu and Zhu, 2016; Park et al., 2017). In this paper, we consider data sanitization defenses (Cretu et al., 2008), which examine the full dataset and try to remove the poisoned points, for example by deleting outliers. Formally, the defender constructs a feasible set F ⊆ X × Y and trains only on points in F :\nθ̂ def = argmin\nθ∈Θ L(θ; (Dc ∪ Dp) ∩ F), where L(θ;S)\ndef = ∑ (x,y)∈S `(θ;x, y). (1)\nGiven such a defense F , we would like to compute an upper bound on the worst possible test loss over any attacker (choice of Dp)—in symbols, maxDp L(θ̂). Such a bound would certify that the defender incurs at most some level of loss no matter what the attacker does. We consider two classes of data sanitization defenses:\n• Fixed defenses, where F does not depend on Dp. One example for text classification is letting F be documents that contain only licensed words (Newell et al., 2014). Other examples are oracle\ndefenders that depend on the true distribution p∗. While such defenders are not implementable in practice, they provide bounds: if even an oracle can be attacked, then we should be worried. • Data-dependent defenses, where F depends on Dc ∪ Dp. These defenders try to estimate p∗ from Dc ∪ Dp and thus are implementable in practice. However, they open up a new line of attack wherein the attacker could choose the poisoned data Dp to change the feasible set F .\nExample: binary classification. Let µ+ def = E[x | y = +1] and µ− def = E[x | y = −1] be the centroids of the positive and negative classes. A natural data sanitization strategy is to remove points that are too far away from the corresponding centroid. We consider two ways of doing this: the sphere defense, which removes points outside a spherical radius, and the slab defense, which first projects points onto the line between the centroids and then discards points that are too far on this line:\nFsphere def = {(x, y) : ‖x− µy‖2 ≤ ry}, Fslab def = {(x, y) : |〈x− µy, µy − µ−y〉| ≤ sy}. (2)\nHere ry, sy are thresholds (e.g. chosen so that 30% of the data is removed). Note that both defenses are oracles (µy depends on p∗); in Section 5, we consider versions that estimate µ from Dc ∪ Dp. Figure 1 depicts both defenses on the MNIST-1-7 and IMDB datasets. For MNIST-1-7, it appears the constraints make it difficult for an attacker to damage the model. In the next section, we will present a method for certifying this. In contrast, IMDB looks far more attackable, which we will verify as well."

      "text" : "Recall that we are interested in the worst-case test loss maxDp L(θ̂). To make progress, we consider three approximations: (i) we pass from the test loss to the training loss on the clean data, which are related by standard concentration arguments as long as we regularize the model appropriately (see Appendix B for details); (ii) we consider the training loss on the full (clean + poisoned) data, which upper bounds the loss on the clean data due to non-negativity of the loss.

      "text" : "We now focus on computing the minimax loss M (4) when F is independent of Dp (fixed defenses). In the process of computing M, we will also produce candidate attacks. Our algorithm is based on no-regret online learning, which models a game between a learner and nature and thus is a natural fit to our data poisoning setting. For simplicity of exposition we assume Θ is an `2-ball of radius ρ.\nOur algorithm, shown in Algorithm 1, is very simple: in each iteration, it alternates between finding the worst attack point (x(t), y(t)) with respect to the current model θ(t−1) and updating the model in the direction of the attack point, producing θ(t). The attack Dp is the set of points thus found. To derive the algorithm, we simply swap min and max in (4) to get an upper bound on M, after which the optimal attack set Dp ⊆ F for a fixed θ is realized by a single point (x, y) ∈ F :\nM ≤ min θ∈Θ max Dp⊆F\n1 n L(θ;Dc ∪ Dp) = min θ∈Θ U(θ), where U(θ) def= 1 n L(θ;Dc) + max (x,y)∈F `(θ;x, y).\n(5)\nNote that U(θ) upper bounds M for any model θ. Algorithm 1 follows the natural strategy of minimizing U(θ) to iteratively tighten this upper bound. In the process, the iterates {(x(t), y(t))} form a candidate attack Dp whose induced loss 1nL(θ̂;Dc ∪ Dp) is a lower bound on M. We can monitor the duality gap between lower and upper bounds on M to ascertain the quality of the bounds.\nMoreover, assuming the loss ` is convex in θ, U(θ) is convex in θ (regardless of the structure of F , which could even be discrete). In this case, if we minimize U(θ) using any online learning algorithm with sublinear regret, the duality gap vanishes. This is summarized as follows (proof in Appendix A): Proposition 1. Assume the loss ` is convex. Suppose that an online learning algorithm (e.g., Algorithm 1) is used to minimize U(θ), and that the parameters (x(t), y(t)) maximize the loss `(θ(t−1);x, y) for the iterates θ(t−1) of the online learning algorithm. Let U∗ = min nt=1 U(θ\n(t)). Also suppose that the learning algorithm has regret Regret(T ) after T time steps. Then, for the attack Dp = {(x(t), y(t))} nt=1, the corresponding parameter θ̂ (defined in (1)) satisfies:\n1 n L(θ̂;Dc ∪ Dp) ≤M ≤ U∗ and U∗ − 1 n L(θ̂;Dc ∪ Dp) ≤ Regret( n) n . (6)\nHence, any algorithm whose average regret Regret( n) n is small will have a nearly optimal candidate attack Dp. The particular algorithm depicted in Algorithm 1 is a variant of regularized dual\naveraging (Xiao, 2010), which is an alternative to gradient descent that often converges faster for norm-constrained optimization problems. In summary, we have a simple learning algorithm that simultaneously computes upper bounds on the minimax loss as well as a candidate attack, which provides a lower bound. Of course, the minimax loss M is only an approximation to the true worst case test loss (via (4)). We examine the tightness of this approximation empirically in Section 4."

      "text" : "We now turn our attention to data-dependent defenders, where the feasible set F depends on the data Dc ∪ Dp (and hence can be influenced by the attacker). For example, consider the slab defense (see (2)) that uses the empirical (poisoned) mean instead of the true mean:\nFslab(Dp) def = {(x, y) : |〈x− µ̂y(Dp), µ̂y(Dp)− µ̂−y(Dp)〉| ≤ sy}, (7)\nwhere µ̂y(Dp) is the empirical mean over Dc ∪ Dp; the notation F(Dp) tracks the dependence of the feasible set on Dp. Similarly to Section 3.1, we analyze the minimax loss M, which we can bound as in (5): M ≤ minθ∈Θ maxDp⊆F(Dp) 1nL(θ;Dc ∪ Dp). However, unlike in (5), it is no longer the case that the optimalDp places all points at a single location due to the dependence of F on Dp; we must jointly maximize over the full set Dp. To improve tractability, we take a continuous relaxation: we think of Dp as a probability distribution with mass 1 n on each point in Dp, and relax this to allow any probability distribution πp. The constraint then becomes supp(πp) ⊆ F(Dp) (where supp denotes the support), and the analogue to (5) is\nM ≤ min θ∈Θ\nŨ(θ), where Ũ(θ) def= 1\nn L(θ;Dc) + max supp(πp)⊆F(πp) Eπp [`(θ;x, y)].

Indeed, this is what we shall do, but there are a few caveats:\n• The maximization problem in the definition of Ũ(θ) is in general quite difficult. We will, however, solve a specific instance in Section 5.\n• The constraint set for πp is non-convex, so duality (Proposition 1) no longer holds.\nWe will run Algorithm 1, at each iteration obtaining a distribution π(t)p and upper bound Ũ(θ(t)). Then, for each π(t)p we will generate a candidate attack by sampling n points from π (t) p , and take the best resulting attack. In Section 4 we will see that despite a lack of rigorous theoretical guarantees, this often leads to good upper bounds and attacks in practice."

      "text" : "An advantage of our framework is that we obtain a tool that can be easily run on new datasets and defenses to learn about the robustness of the defense and gain insight into potential attacks. We first study two image datasets: MNIST-1-7, and the Dogfish dataset used by Koh and Liang (2017). For MNIST-1-7, following Biggio et al. (2012), we considered binary classification between the digits\n1 and 7; this left us with n = 13007 training examples of dimension 784. For Dogfish, which is a binary classification task, we used the same neural net features as in Koh and Liang (2017), so that each of the n = 1800 training images is represented by a 2048-dimensional vector. For this and subsequent experiments, our loss ` is the hinge loss (i.e., we train an SVM).\nWe consider the combined oracle slab and sphere defense from Section 2.1: F = Fslab ∩ Fsphere. To run Algorithm 1, we need to maximize the loss over (x, y) ∈ F . Note that maximizing the hinge loss `(θ;x, y) is equivalent to minimizing 〈θ, x〉. Therefore, we can solve the following quadratic program (QP) for each y ∈ {+1,−1} and take the one with higher loss:\nminimize y〈θ, x〉 subject to ‖x− µy‖22 ≤ r2y, |〈x− µy, µy − µ−y〉| ≤ sy. (9)\nThe results of Algorithm 1 are given in Figures 2a and 2b; here and elsewhere, we used a combination of CVXPY (Diamond and Boyd, 2016), YALMIP (Löfberg, 2004), SeDuMi (Sturm, 1999), and Gurobi (Gurobi Optimization, Inc., 2016) to solve the optimization. We plot the upper bound U∗ computed by Algorithm 1, as well as the train and test loss induced by the corresponding attack Dp. Except for small , the model θ̂ fits the poisoned data almost perfectly, and hence the loss L(θ̂;Dc) on the clean data nearly matches its upper bound L(θ̂;Dc ∪Dp) (which in turn matches U∗). On both datasets, U∗ is small (< 0.1 with = 0.3), showing that they are resilient to attack under the oracle defense; indeed, the maximum test 0-1 error on either dataset, for up to 0.3, was 4%.\nWe compare our attack to two baselines in Figure 2c — the gradient descent method employed by Biggio et al. (2012) and Mei and Zhu (2015b), and a simple baseline that inserts copies of points from Dc with the opposite label (subject to the flipped points lying in F ). Our attack consistently performs better; for the gradient algorithm, this seems to be due to local minima.∗ Finally, we visualize our attack in Figure 1a. Interestingly, though the attack was free to place points anywhere, most of the attack is tightly concentrated around a single point at the boundary of F for the negative class."

      "text" : "We next consider attacks on text data. Beyond the the sphere and slab constraints, a valid attack on text data must satisfy additional integrity constraints (Newell et al., 2014) — if we encode input text t by a vector x = φ(t) of indicator features, then each entry of φ(t) is a non-negative integer.†\nAlgorithm 1 still applies in this case — the only difference is that the QP from Section 4 has the added constraint x ∈ Zd≥0 and hence becomes an integer quadratic program (IQP), which can be computationally expensive to solve. We can still obtain upper bounds simply by relaxing the integrity constraints; the only issue is that the points x(t) in the corresponding attack will have continuous values, and hence don’t correspond to actual text inputs. To address this, we can use an IQP solver such as Gurobi to find an approximately optimal feasible x. This yields a valid candidate attack, but it might not be optimal if the solver doesn’t find near-optimal solutions. ∗Though Mei and Zhu (2015b) state that their cost is convex, they communicated to us that this is incorrect. †Note that in the previous section, we ignored such integrity constraints for simplicity.\nWe ran both the upper bound relaxation and the IQP solver on two text datasets, the Enron spam corpus (Metsis et al., 2006) and the IMDB sentiment corpus (Maas et al., 2011). The Enron training set consists of n = 4137 e-mails (30% spam and 70% non-spam), with d = 5166 distinct words. The IMDB training set consists of n = 25000 product reviews with d = 89527 distinct words. We used bag-of-words features, which yields test accuracy 97% and 88%, respectively, in the absence of poisoned data. IMDB was too large for Gurobi to even approximately solve the IQP, so we resorted to a randomized rounding heuristic to convert the continuous relaxation to an integer solution.\nResults are given in Figure 3; there is a relatively large gap between the upper bound and the attack. Despite this, the attacks are relatively successful. Most striking is the attack on IMDB, which increases test error from 12% to 23% for = 0.03, despite having to pass the oracle defender.\nTo understand why the attacks are so much more successful in this case, we can consult Figure 1b. In contrast to MNIST-1-7, for IMDB the defenses place few constraints on the attacker. This seems to be a consequence of the high dimensionality of IMDB and the large number of irrelevant features, which increase the size of F without a corresponding increase in separation between the classes."

      "text" : "We now revisit the MNIST and Dogfish data sets. Before, we saw that they were unattackable provided we had an oracle defender that knew the true class means. If we instead consider a data-dependent defender that uses the empirical (poisoned) means, how much can this change the attackability of these data sets? In this section, we will see that the answer is quite a lot.\nAs described in Section 3.2, we can still use our framework to obtain upper and lower bounds even in this data-dependent case, although the bounds won’t necessarily match. The main difficulty is in computing Ũ(θ), which involves a potentially intractable maximization (see (8)). However, for 2-class SVMs there is a tractable semidefinite programming algorithm; the full details are in Appendix D, but the rough idea is the following: we can show that the optimal distribution πp in (8) is supported on at most 4 points (one support vector and one non-support vector in each class). Moreover, for a fixed πp, the constraints and objective depend only on inner products between the 4 attack points together with the class means µ (on the clean data) and the model θ. Thus, we can solve for the optimal attack locations with a 42-variable SDP. Then in an outer loop, we randomly sample πp over the 3-dimensional simplex and take the one with the highest loss. Running this algorithm on MNIST-1-7 yields the results in Figure 4a. On the test set, our = 0.3 attack leads to a 0.67 increase in hinge loss and a 0.36 increase in 0-1 loss. Similarly, on the Dogfish dataset, our = 0.3 attack achieves a 0.67 increase in test hinge loss and a 0.32 increase in 0-1 loss.\nThe geometry of the attack is depicted in Figure 4b. By carefully choosing the location of the attack, the attacker can place points that lie substantially outside original (clean) feasible set. Thus,\nthere appears to be substantial danger in employing data-dependent defenders — beyond the greater difficulty of analyzing them, they seem to actually be more vulnerable to attack."

(2010), Biggio et al. (2014a), Papernot et al. (2016b), and Gardiner and Nagaraja (2016) for some recent surveys.\nOur contribution relates to the long line of work on data poisoning attacks; beyond linear classifiers, others have studied the LASSO (Xiao et al., 2015a), clustering (Biggio et al., 2013; 2014c), PCA (Rubinstein et al., 2009), topic modeling (Mei and Zhu, 2015a), collaborative filtering (Li et al., 2016), neural networks (Yang et al., 2017), and other models (Mozaffari-Kermani et al., 2015; Vuurens et al., 2011; Wang, 2016). There have also been a number of demonstrated vulnerabilities in deployed systems (Newsome et al., 2006; Laskov and Šrndic̀, 2014; Biggio et al., 2014b). We provide formal scaffolding to this line of work, by providing a tool for certifying a defense against a range of attacks.\nA striking recent security vulnerability discovered in machine learning systems is adversarial test images that can fool image classifiers despite being imperceptible from normal images (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Carlini et al., 2016; Kurakin et al., 2016; Papernot et al., 2016a). These exhibit security vulnerabilities at test time, whereas data poisoning is a vulnerability at training time. Adversarial training (Goodfellow et al., 2015) and generative adversarial networks (Goodfellow et al., 2014) are similarly focused on test time; they both improve test performance by altering the training objective. Recent adversarial attacks on reinforcement learners (Huang et al., 2017; Behzadan and Munir, 2017; Lin et al., 2017) blend train and test vulnerabilities.\nFinally, a number of authors have studied the theoretical question of learning in the presence of adversarial errors, under a priori distributional assumptions on the data. Robust algorithms have been exhibited for mean and covariance estimation and clustering (Diakonikolas et al., 2016; Lai et al., 2016; Charikar et al., 2017), classification (Klivans et al., 2009; Awasthi et al., 2014), regression (Nasrabadi et al., 2011; Nguyen and Tran, 2013; Chen et al., 2013; Bhatia et al., 2015) and crowdsourced data aggregation (Steinhardt et al., 2016)."

      "text" : "In this paper we have presented a tool for studying data poisoning defenses, which goes beyond empirical validation by providing certificates for a large family of attacks. Having applied this framework to binary SVMs, there are a number of extensions we can consider: e.g. to other loss functions or to multiclass classification. We can also consider defenses beyond the sphere and slab considered here — for instance, sanitizing text data using a language model. In all these cases, the minimax loss M gives us a natural starting point for investigating both attack and defense.\nSeparately, the bound L(θ̂) / M was useful because M admits the natural minimax formulation (5), but the worst-case L(θ̂) can be expressed directly as a bilevel optimization problem (Mei and Zhu, 2015b), which is intractable in general but admits a number of heuristics (Bard, 1999). Bilevel optimization has been considered in the related setting of Stackelberg games (Brückner and Scheffer, 2011; Brückner et al., 2012; Zhou and Kantarcioglu, 2016), and is natural to apply here as well.\nTo conclude, we quote Biggio et al., who call for the following methodology for evaluating defenses:\nTo pursue security in the context of an arms race it is not sufficient to react to observed attacks, but it is also necessary to proactively anticipate the adversary by predicting the most relevant, potential attacks through a what-if analysis; this allows one to develop suitable countermeasures before the attack actually occurs, according to the principle of security by design.\nThe existing paradigm for such proactive anticipation is to design various hypothetical attacks against which to test the defenses. However, such an evaluation is fundamentally limited because it leaves open the possibility that there is a more clever attack that we failed to think of. Our approach provides a first step towards surpassing this limitation, by not just anticipating but certifying the reliability of a defender, thus implicitly considering an infinite number of attacks before they occur."

      "text" : "In Section 3 we claimed that it is possible to defend against overfitting defenses with appropriate regularization. In this section we justify this claim. The key is the classical theory of uniform convergence, which allows us to say that, with probability 1− δ, the following uniform bound holds:∣∣∣ 1\nN ∑ (x,y)∈Dc `(θ;x, y)−Ex,y∼p∗ [`(θ;x, y)] ∣∣∣ ≤ E(N, ρ, δ), (14)\nwhere E is an error bound that is roughly ρ √\nlog(1/δ) N . More precisely, Kakade et al. (2009) show the\nfollowing: Theorem 1 (Corollary 5 of Kakade et al. (2009)). Let `(θ;x, y) be any margin-based loss: `(θ;x, y) = φ(y〈θ, x〉), where φ is 1-Lipschitz. Then the bound (14) holds with probability 1 − δ,\nfor E(N, ρ, δ) = ρR (√\n4 n +\n√ log(1/δ)\n2n\n) , where R is such that ‖x‖2 ≤ R with probability 1.\nBy setting ρ appropriately relative to R and n we can therefore guarantee that the train and test losses in (14) are close together, and therefore rule out any overfitting attack (because any attack that makes the test loss high would also have to make the train loss high)."

      "text" : "Our optimization algorithm (Algorithm 1) is similar in spirit to Regularized Dual Averaging (Xiao, 2010), but the known regret bounds for RDA do not apply directly because the regularizer is chosen adaptively to ensure the norm constraint ‖θ‖2 ≤ ρ holds. In fact, a somewhat different analysis is required in this case, closer in spirit to that given by Steinhardt et al. (2014) for sparse linear regression. While the details would take us beyond the scope of this paper, we state the regret bound here:\nTheorem 2. After T steps of the update in Algorithm 1, the regret of Algorithm 1 can be bounded as\nRegret(T ) ≤ ρ 2\n2η + T∑ t=1 ‖g(t)‖22 2λt . (15)\nWe make two observations: first, since λt ≥ 1η necessarily, by setting η to be on the order of 1√ T we\ncan ensure average regret O(1/ √ T ). On the other hand, in many instances λt will actually increase linearly with t (in order to enforce the norm constraints ‖θ‖2 ≤ ρ) in which case the average regret decreases at the faster rate O( log(T )T ). In either case, the average regret goes to 0 as T →∞."

      "heading" : "D Semidefinite Program for Ũ(θ)",
      "text" : "Here we elaborate on the semidefinite program for Ũ(θ) that was discussed in Section 5. Recall the definition of Ũ(θ):\nŨ(θ) = 1\nn L(Dc) + max supp(πp)⊆F(πp) Eπp [`(θ;x, y)]. (16)\nOur goal is to solve the maximization over πp in the special case that F is defined by the datadependent sphere and slab defenses (with empirical centroids) and `(θ;x, y) = max(1− y〈θ, x〉, 0) is the hinge loss. First, we argue that the optimal πp without loss of generality is supported on at most four points (xa,+, 1), (xb,+, 1), (xa,−,−1), and (xb,−,−1), where the a points are support vectors and the b points are non-support vectors.\nIndeed, suppose that there are two distinct support vectors which both lie in the positive class. Then replacing them both with their midpoint does not affect either F(πp) or Eπp [`(θ;x, y)]; moreover, since F(πp) is convex for fixed πp both points are still feasible. A similar argument applies to the non-support vectors and to the negative class, so that indeed we may assume there are at most the four distinct points above in supp(πp).\nNow, let πa,+, πa,−, πb,+, and πb,− be the weights of these points under πp. Letting µ+ and µ− be the empirical means of the positive and negative class over Dc, and p+ and p− the empirical probability of the two classes, we have the following expression for µ̂y:\nµ̂y(πp) = pyµy + πa,yxa,y + πb,yxb,y\npy + πa,y + πb,y . (17)\nMoreover, the objective Eπp [`(θ;x, y)] may be written as\nEπp [`(θ;x, y)] = πa,+(1− 〈θ, xa,+〉) + πa,−(1 + 〈θ, xa,−〉), (18) using the assumption that the xa are support vectors and the xb are not.\nNow, the sphere and slab constraints may be written as\n|〈xi,y − µ̂y, µ̂y − µ̂−y〉| ≤ sy, (19) 〈xi,y − µ̂y, xi,y − µ̂y〉 ≤ r2y (20)\nfor i ∈ {a, b}, y ∈ {+1,−1}. We also have the constraints 1− y〈θ, xa,y〉 ≥ 0 (21) 1− y〈θ, xb,y〉 ≤ 0 (22)\nfor y ∈ {+1,−1} (encoding the constraints that the xa are support vectors and the xb are not). A careful examination reveals that, for fixed π{a,b},{+,−}, all terms in (18-22) can be written as linear inequality constraints in the inner products between the 7 vectors xa,+, xa,−, xb,+, xb,−, µ+, µ−, θ. Therefore, by changing variables to the 7× 7 Gram matrix G among these vectors, we can express the maximization in (16) as a semidefinite program over these variables, with equality constraints for the known inner products between µ+, µ−, and θ.\nMoreover, for any matrix G 0 satisfying these equality constraints, it is possible to recover vectors xa,+, xa,−, xb,+, and xb,− (depending on µ+, µ−, and θ) whose inner products match the Gram\nmatrix G. Precisely, if G = [ G11 G12 G21 G22 ] is the Gram matrix (with block 1 being the 4 vectors x and block 2 being the 3 known vectors µ{+,−}, θ), then for any vectors v{a,b},{+,−} orthogonal to the span of µ+, µ−, and θ, we can take\n[ xa,+ xa,− xb,+ xb,− ] = [ va,+ va,− vb,+ vb,− ]A+ [ µ+ µ− θ ]B, (23)\nwhere A>A = G11 −G12G†22G21 and B = G † 22G21, and † denotes pseudoinverse. This allows us to compute not only the optimal objective value, but to actually recover vectors x realizing it.\nTo finish, we must handle the fact that the weights π{a,b},{+,−} are not known. However, they comprise only a 3-dimensional parameter space, and hence we can approximate the maximum over all π{a,b},{+,−} through Monte Carlo simulation (i.e., randomly sample the weights a sufficiently large number of times and take the best)."

While recent work has proposed a number of attacks and defenses, little is understood about the worst-case loss of a defense in the face of a determined attacker. We address this by constructing approximate upper bounds on the loss across a broad family of attacks, for defenders that first perform outlier removal followed by empirical risk minimization. Our bound comes paired with a candidate attack that nearly realizes the bound, giving us a powerful tool for quickly assessing defenses on a given dataset. Empirically, we find that even under a simple defense, the MNIST-1-7 and Dogfish datasets are resilient to attack, while in contrast the IMDB sentiment dataset can be driven from 12% to 23% test error by adding only 3% poisoned data.",
