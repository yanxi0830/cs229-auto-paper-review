      "text" : "Proxσg (B) = argmin X m∑ i=1 g(σi(X))+ 1 2 ||X−B||2F , associated with a nonconvex function g defined on the singular values of X. We prove that GSVT can be obtained by performing the proximal operator of g (denoted as Proxg(·)) on the singular values since Proxg(·) is monotone when g is lower bounded. If the nonconvex g satisfies some conditions (many popular nonconvex surrogate functions, e.g., `p-norm, 0 < p < 1, of `0-norm are special cases), a general solver to find Proxg(b) is proposed for any b ≥ 0. GSVT greatly generalizes the known Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) which is a basic subroutine in many convex low rank minimization methods. We are able to solve the nonconvex low rank minimization problem by using GSVT in place of SVT.\nIntroduction The sparse and low rank structures have received much attention in recent years. There have been many applications which exploit these two structures, such as face recognition (Wright et al. 2009), subspace clustering (Cheng et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2013b) and background modeling (Candès et al. 2011). To achieve sparsity, a principled approach is to use the convex `1-norm. However, the `1-minimization may be suboptimal, since the `1-norm is a loose approximation of the `0-norm and often leads to an over-penalized problem. This brings the attention back to the nonconvex surrogate by interpolating the `0-norm and `1-norm. Many nonconvex penalities have been proposed, including `p-norm (0 < p < 1) (Frank and Friedman 1993), Smoothly Clipped Absolute Deviation (SCAD) (Fan and Li 2001), Logarithm (Friedman 2012), Minimax Concave Penalty (MCP) (Zhang and others 2010), Geman (Geman and Yang 1995) and Laplace (Trzasko and Manduca 2009). Their definitions are shown in Table 1. Numerical studies (Candès, Wakin, and Boyd 2008) have shown that the nonconvex optimization usually outperforms convex models.\n∗Corresponding author.

A principled way is to use the nuclear norm which is a convex surrogate of the rank function (Recht, Fazel, and Parrilo 2010). However, it suffers from the same suboptimal issue as the `1-norm in many cases. Very recently, many popular nonconvex surrogate functions in Table 1 are extended on the singular values to better approximate the rank function (Lu et al. 2014). However, different from the convex optimization, the nonconvex low rank minimization is much more challenging than the nonconvex sparse minimization.\nThe Iteratively Reweighted Nuclear Norm (IRNN) method is proposed to solve the following nonconvex low rank minimization problem (Lu et al. 2014)\nmin X F (X) = m∑ i=1 g(σi(X)) + h(X), (1)\nwhere σi(X) denotes the i-th singular value of X ∈ Rm×n (we assume m ≤ n in this work). g : R+ → R+ is continuous, concave and nonincreasing on [0,+∞). Popular nonconvex surrogate functions in Table 1 are some examples. h : Rm×n → R+ is the loss function which has Lipschitz continuous gradient. IRNN updates Xk+1 by minimizing a surrogate function which upper bounds the objective function in (9). The surrogate function is constructed by linearizing g and h at Xk, simultaneously. In theory, IRNN guarantees to decrease the objective function value of (9) in each iteration. However, it may decrease slowly since the upper\nar X\niv :1\n41 2.\n22 31\nv1 [\ncs .C\nV ]\n6 D\nec 2\n01 4\nbound surrogate may be quite loose. It is expected that minimizing a tighter surrogate will lead to a faster convergence.\nA possible tighter surrogate function of the objective function in (9) is to keep g and relax h only. This leads to the following updating rule which is named as Generalized Proximal Gradient (GPG) method in this work\nXk+1 = arg min X m∑ i=1 g(σi(X)) + h(X k)\n+ 〈∇h(Xk),X−Xk〉+ µ 2 ||X−Xk||2F\n= arg min X m∑ i=1 g(σi(X)) + µ 2 ||X−Xk + 1 µ ∇h(Xk)||2F ,\n(2) where µ > L(h), L(h) is the Lipschitz constant of h, guarantees the convergence of GPG as shown later. It can be seen that solving (10) requires solving the following problem\nProxσg (B) = arg min X m∑ i=1 g(σi(X)) + 1 2 ||X−B||2F . (3) In this work, the mapping Proxσg (·) is called the Generalized Singular Value Thresholding (GSVT) operator associated with the function ∑m i=1 g(·) defined on the singular\nvalues. If g(x) = λx, ∑m i=1 g(σi(X)) is degraded to the convex nuclear norm λ||X||∗. Then (3) has a closed form solution Proxσg (B) = UDiag(Dλ(σ(B)))VT , where Dλ(σ(B)) = {(σi(B) − λ)+}mi=1, and U and V are from the SVD of B, i.e., B = UDiag(σ(B))VT . This is the known Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) operator associated with the convex nuclear norm (when g(x) = λx) (Cai, Candès, and Shen 2010). More generally, for a convex g, the solution to (3) is\nProxσg (B) = UDiag(Proxg(σ(B)))V T , (4)\nwhere Proxg(·) is defined element-wise as follows,\nProxg(b) = arg min x≥0\nfb(x) = g(x) + 1\n2 (x− b)2, 1 (5)\n1For x < 0, g(x) = g(−x). If b ≥ 0, Proxg(b) ≥ 0. If b < 0, Proxg(b) = −Proxg(−b). So we only need to discuss the case b, x ≥ 0 in this work.\nwhere Proxg(·) is the known proximal operator associated with a convex g (Combettes and Pesquet 2011). That is to say, solving (3) is equivalent to performing Proxg(·) on each singular value of B. In this case, the mapping Proxg(·) is unique, i.e., (5) has a unique solution. More importantly, Proxg(·) is monotone, i.e., Proxg(x1) ≥ Proxg(x2) for any x1 ≥ x2. This guarantees to preserve the nonincreasing order of the singular values after shrinkage and thresholding by the mapping Proxg(·). For a nonconvex g, we still call Proxg(·) as the proximal operator, but note that such a mapping may not be unique. It is still an open problem whether Proxg(·) is monotone or not for a nonconvex g. Without proving the monotonity of Proxg(·), one cannot simply perform it on the singular values of B to obtain the solution to (3) as SVT. Even if Proxg(·) is monotone, since it is not unique, one also needs to carefully choose the solution pi ∈ Proxg(σi(B)) such that p1 ≥ p2 ≥ · · · ≥ pm. Another challenging problem is that there does not exist a general solver to (5) for a general nonconvex g.\nIt is worth mentioning that some previous works studied the solution to (3) for some special choices of nonconvex g (Nie, Huang, and Ding 2012; Chartrand 2012; Liu et al. 2013a). However, none of their proofs was rigorous since they ignored proving the monotone property of Proxg(·). See the detailed discussions in the next section. Another recent work (Gu et al. 2014) considered the following problem related to the weighted nuclear norm:\nmin X fw,B(X) = m∑ i=1 wiσi(X) + 1 2 ||X−B||2F , (6)\nwhere wi ≥ 0, i = 1, · · · ,m. Problem (6) is a little more general than (3) by taking different gi(x) = wix. It is claimed in (Gu et al. 2014) that the solution to (6) is X∗ = UDiag ({Proxgi(σi(B)), i = 1, · · · ,m})VT , (7) where B = UDiag(σ(B))VT is the SVD of B, and Proxgi(σi(B)) = max{σi(B) − wi, 0}. However, such a result and their proof are not correct. A counterexample is as follows:\nB = [ 0.0941 0.4201 0.5096 0.0089 ] , w = [ 0.5 0.25 ] ,\nX∗ = [ −0.0345 0.1287 0.0542 −0.0512 ] , X̂ = [ 0.0130 0.1938 0.1861 −0.0218 ] ,\nwhere X∗ is obtained by (7). The solution X∗ is not optimal to (6) since there exists X̂ shown above such that fw,B(X̂) = 0.2262 < fw,B(X\n∗) = 0.2393. The reason behind is that (Prox gi(σi(B))−Prox gj (σj(B)))(σi(B)−σj(B)) ≥ 0, (8) does not guarantee to hold for any i 6= j. Note that (8) holds when 0 ≤ w1 ≤ · · · ≤ wm, and thus (7) is optimal to (6) in this case.\nIn this work, we give the first rigorous proof that Proxg(·) is monotone for any lower bounded function (regardless of the convexity of g). Then solving (3) is degenerated to solving (5) for each b = σi(B). The Generalized Singular Value Thresholding (GSVT) operator Proxσg (·) associated with any lower bounded function in (3) is much more\ngeneral than the known SVT associated with the convex nuclear norm (Cai, Candès, and Shen 2010). In order to compute GSVT, we analyze the solution to (5) for certain types of g (some special cases are shown in Table 1) in theory, and propose a general solver to (5). At last, with GSVT, we can solve (9) by the Generalized Proximal Gradient (GPG) algorithm shown in (10). We test both Iteratively Reweighted Nuclear Norm (IRNN) and GPG on the matrix completion problem. Both synthesis and real data experiments show that GPG outperforms IRNN in terms of the recovery error and the objective function value.\nGeneralized Singular Value Thresholding"

      "text" : "A main goal of this work is to compute GSVT (3), and uses it to solve (9). We will show that, if Proxg(·) is monotone, problem (3) can be reformulated into an equivalent problem which is much easier to solve. Lemma 1. (von Neumann’s trace inequality (Rhea 2011)) For any matrices A, B ∈ Rm×n (m ≤ n), Tr(ATB) ≤∑m i=1 σi(A)σi(B), where σ1(A) ≥ σ2(A) ≥ · · · ≥ 0 and σ1(B) ≥ σ2(B) ≥ · · · ≥ 0 are the singular values of A and B, respectively. The equality holds if and only if there exist unitaries U and V such that A = UDiag(σ(A))VT and B = UDiag(σ(B))VT are the SVDs of A and B, simultaneously. Theorem 1. Let g : R+ → R+ be a function such that Proxg(·) is monotone. Let B = UDiag(σ(B))VT be the SVD of B ∈ Rm×n. Then an optimal solution to (3) is\nX∗ = UDiag(%∗)VT , (9)\nwhere %∗ satisfies %∗1 ≥ %∗2 ≥ · · · ≥ %∗m, i = 1, · · · ,m, and\n%∗i ∈ Proxg(σi(B)) = argmin %i≥0\ng(%i) + 1\n2 (%i − σi(B))2.\n(10)\nProof. Denote σ1(X) ≥ · · · ≥ σm(X) ≥ 0 as the singular values of X. Problem (3) can be rewritten as\nmin %:%1≥···≥%m≥0\n{ min\nσ(X)=% m∑ i=1 g(%i) + 1 2 ||X−B||2F\n} .\n(11) By using the von Neumann’s trace inequality in Lemma 1, we have\n||X−B||2F = Tr (XTX)− 2 Tr(XTB) + Tr(BTB)\n= m∑ i=1 σ2i (X)− 2 Tr(XTB) + m∑ i=1 σ2i (B)\n≥ m∑ i=1 σ2i (X)− 2 m∑ i=1 σi(X)σi(B) + m∑ i=1 σ2i (B)\n= m∑ i=1 (σi(X)− σi(B))2.\nNote that the above equality holds when X admits the singular value decomposition X = UDiag(σ(X))VT , where\nU and V are the left and right orthonormal matrices in the SVD of B. In this case, problem (11) is reduced to\nmin %:%1≥···≥%m≥0 m∑ i=1 ( g(%i) + 1 2 (%i − σi(B))2 ) . (12)\nSince Proxg(·) is monotone and σ1(B) ≥ σ2(B) ≥ · · · ≥ σm(B), there exists %∗i ∈ Proxg(σi(B)), such that %∗1 ≥ %∗2 ≥ · · · ≥ %∗m. Such a choice of %∗ is optimal to (12), and thus (9) is optimal to (3).\nFrom the above proof, it can be seen that the monotone property of Proxg(·) is a key condition which makes problem (12) separable conditionally. Thus the solution (9) to (3) shares a similar formulation as the known Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) operator associated with the convex nuclear norm (Cai, Candès, and Shen 2010). Note that for a convex g, Proxg(·) is always monotone. Indeed,\n(Prox g(b1)−Prox g(b2)) (b1 − b2) ≥ (Proxg(b1)−Proxg(b2))2 ≥ 0, ∀ b1, b2 ∈ R+.\nThe above inequality can be obtained by the optimality of Proxg(·) and the convexity of g.\nThe monotonicity of Proxg(·) for a nonconvex g is still unknown. There were some previous works (Nie, Huang, and Ding 2012; Chartrand 2012; Liu et al. 2013a) claiming that the solution (9) is optimal to (3) for some special choices of nonconvex g. However, their results are not rigorous since the monotone property of Proxg(·) is not proved. Surprisingly, we find that the monotone property of Proxg(·) holds for any lower bounded function g. Theorem 2. For any lower bounded function g, its proximal operator Proxg(·) is monotone, i.e., for any p∗i ∈ Proxg(xi), i = 1, 2, p∗1 ≥ p∗2, when x1 > x2.\nNote that it is possible that σi(B) = σj(B) for some i < j in (10). Since Proxg(·) may not be unique, we need to choose %∗i ∈ Proxg(σi(B)) and %∗j ∈ Proxg(σj(B)) such that %∗i ≤ %∗j . This is the only difference between GSVT and SVT."

      "text" : "So far, we have proved that solving (3) is equivalent to solving (5) for each b = σi(B), i = 1, · · · ,m, for any lower bounded function g. For a nonconvex g, only for some special cases, the candidate solutions to (5) have a closed form (Gong et al. 2013). There does not exist a general solver for a more general nonconvex g. In this section, we analyze the solution to (5) for a broad choice of the nonconvex g. Then a general solver will be proposed in the next section. Assumption 1. g : R+ → R+, g(0) = 0. g is concave, nondecreasing and differentiable. The gradient∇g is convex.\nIn this work, we are interested in the nonconvex surrogate of `0-norm. Except the differentiablity of g and the convexity of ∇g, all the other assumptions in Assumption 2 are necessary to construct a surrogate of `0-norm. As shown later, these two additional assumptions make our analysis much easier. Note that the assumptions for the nonconvex\nfunction considered in Assumption 2 are quite general. It is easy to verify that many popular surrogates of `0-norm in Table 1 satisfy Assumption 2, including `p-norm, Logarithm, MCP, Geman and Laplace penalties. Only the SCAD penalty violates the convex∇g assumption, as shown in Figure 1.\nProposition 1. Given g satisfying Assumption 2, the optimal solution to (5) lies in [0, b].\nThe above fact is obvious since both g(x) and 12 (x − b) 2 are nondecreasing on [b,+∞). Such a result limits the solution space, and thus is very useful for our analysis. Our general solver to (5) is also based on Proposition 1.\nNote that the solutions to (5) lie in 0 or the local points {x|∇fb(x) = ∇g(x) + x − b = 0}. Our analysis is mainly based on the number of intersection points of D(x) = ∇g(x) and the line Cb(x) = b − x. Let b̄ = sup{b | Cb(x) and D(x) have no intersection}. We have the solution to (5) in different cases. Please refer to the supplementary material for the detailed proofs.\nProposition 2. Given g satisfying Assumption 2 and ∇g(0) = +∞.

It can be seen that one only needs to compute x̂b which is the largest local minimum. Then comparing the objective function value at 0 and x̂b leads to an optimal solution to (5).\nAlgorithms In this section, we first give a general solver to (5) in which g satisfies Assumption 2. Then we are able to solve the GSVT problem (3). With GSVT, problem (9) can be solved by Generalized Proximal Gradient (GPG) algorithm as shown in (10). We also give the convergence guarantee of GPG."

The left task is to find x̂b which is\nthe largest local minimum point near x = b. So we can start searching for x̂b from x0 = b by the fixed point iteration algorithm. Note that it will be very fast since we only need to search within [0, b]. The whole procedure to find x̂b can be found in Algorithm 1. In theory, it can be proved that the fixed point iteration guarantees to find x̂b.\nIf g is nonsmooth or ∇g is nonconvex, the fixed point iteration algorithm may also be applicable. The key is to find all the local solutions with smart initial points. Also all the nonsmooth points should be considered as the candidates.\nAll the nonconvex surrogates g except SCAD in Table 1 satisfy Assumption 2, and thus the solution to (5) can be obtained by Algorithm 1. Figure 2 illustrates the shrinkage effect of proximal operators of these functions and the convex `1-norm. The shrinkage and thresholding effect of these proximal operators are similar when b is relatively small. However, when b is relatively large, the proximal operators of the nonconvex functions are nearly unbiased, i.e., keeping b nearly the same as the `0-norm. On the contrast, the proximal operator of the convex `1-norm is biased. In this case, the `1-norm may be over-penalized, and thus may perform quite differently from the `0-norm. This also supports the necessity of using nonconvex penalties on the singular values to approximate the rank function."

Problem (13) can be solved by GPG by using GSVT (9) in each iteration. We compared GPG with IRNN on both synthetic and real data.

For the noise free case, we generate M = M1M2, where M1 ∈ Rm×r, M2 ∈ Rr×n are i.i.d. random matrices, and m = n = 150. The underlying rank r varies from 20 to 33. Half of the elements in M are missing. We set λ0 = 0.9||PΩ(M)||∞, and λt = 10−5λ0. The relative error RelErr= ||X∗ −M||F /||M||F is used to evaluate the recovery performance. If RelErr is smaller than 10−3, X∗ is regarded as a successful recovery of M. We repeat the experiments 100 times for each r. We compare GPG\nby using GSVT with IRNN and the convex Augmented Lagrange Multiplier (ALM) (Lin, Chen, and Ma 2009). Figure 3 (a) plots r v.s. the frequency of success. It can be seen that GPG is slightly better than IRNN when r is relatively small, while both IRNN and GPG fail when r ≥ 32. Both of them outperform the convex ALM method, since the nonconvex logarithm penalty approximates the rank function better than the convex nuclear norm.\nFor the noisy case, the data matrix M is generated in the same way, but are added some additional noises 0.1E, where E is an i.i.d. random matrix. For this task, we set λ0 = 10||PΩ(M)||∞, and λt = 0.1λ0 in GPG. The convex APGL algorithm (Toh and Yun 2010b) is compared in this task. Each method is run 100 times for each r ∈ {15, 18, 20, 23, 25, 30}. Figure 3 (b) shows the mean relative error. It can be seen that GPG by using GSVT in each iteration significantly outperforms IRNN and APGL. The reason is that λt is not that small as in the noise free case. Thus, the upper bound surrogate of g in IRNN will be much more loose than that in GPG. Figure 3 (c) plots some convergence curves of GPG and IRNN. It can be seen that GPG without relaxing g will decrease the objective function value faster."

It can be seen that GPG achieves the best performance, i.e., the largest PSNR value and the smallest relative error.\nWe also apply matrix completion for collaborative filtering. The task of collaborative filtering is to predict the unknown preference of a user on a set of unrated items, according to other similar users or similar items. We test on the MovieLens data set (Herlocker et al. 1999) which includes\nthree problems, “movie-100K”, “movie-1M” and “movie10M”. Since only the entries in Ω of M are known, we use Normalized Mean Absolute Error (NMAE) ||PΩ(X∗)− PΩ(M)||1/|Ω| to evaluate the performance as in (Toh and Yun 2010b). As shown in Table 2, GPG achieves the best performance. The improvement benefits from the GPG algorithm which uses a fast and exact solver of GSVT (9).\nThis paper studied the Generalized Singular Value Thresholding (GSVT) operator associated with the nonconvex function g on the singular values. We proved that the proximal operator of any lower bounded function g (denoted as Proxg(·)) is monotone. Thus, GSVT can be obtained by performing Proxg(·) on the singular values separately. Given b ≥ 0, we also proposed a general solver to find Proxg(b) for certain type of g. At last, we applied the generalized proximal gradient algorithm by using GSVT as the subroutine to solve the nonconvex low rank minimization problem (9). Experimental results showed that it outperformed previous method with smaller recovery error and objective function value.\nFor nonconvex low rank minimization, GSVT plays the same role as SVT in convex minimization. One may extend other convex low rank models to nonconvex cases, and solve them by using GSVT in place of SVT. An interesting future work is to solve the nonconvex low rank minimization problem with affine constraint by ALM (Lin, Chen, and Ma 2009) and prove the convergence.\nAcknowledgements This research is supported by the Singapore National Research Foundation under its International Research Centre @Singapore Funding Initiative and administered by the IDM Programme Office.

If there does not exist b > b̄ such that fb(0) = fb(x b 2), then Proxg(b) = 0 for all b ≥ 0. If there exists b > b̄ such that fb(0) = fb(xb2), let b∗ = inf{b | b > b̄, fb(0) = fb(x b 2) }. Then we have\nProxg(b) = argmin x≥0 fb(x)\n{ = xb2, if b > b\n∗, 3 0, if b ≤ b∗. (2)\nRemark: When b∗ exists and b > b∗, because D(x) = ∇g(x) is convex and decreasing, we can conclude that Cb(x) and D(x) have exactly two intersection points. When b ≤ b∗, Cb(x) and D(x) may have multiple intersection points.\nProof. When b > b̄, since ∇fb(x) = D(x)− Cb(x), we can easily see that fb is increasing on (0, xb1), decreasing on (xb1, xb2) and increasing on (xb2, b). So, 0 and x b 2 are two local minimum points of fb(x) on [0, b].\nCase 1 : If there exists b > b̄ such that fb(0) = fb(xb2), denote b ∗ = inf{b | b > b̄, fb(0) = fb(xb2) }. First, we consider b > b∗. Let b = b∗ + ε for some ε > 0. We have\nfb(x b∗ 2 )− fb(0)\n= 1\n2 (xb\n∗ 2 − b∗ − ε)2 + g(x∗)− 1\n2 (b∗ + ε)2\n= 1\n2 (xb\n∗ 2 − b∗)2 − 1\n2 (b∗)2 − ε(xb\n∗\n2 − b∗)− εb∗\n=fb∗(x b∗ 2 )− fb∗(0)− εx∗2 =− εx∗2 < 0.\nSince fb is decreasing on [xb ∗ 2 , x b 2], we conclude that fb(0) > fb(x b∗ 2 ) ≥ fb(xb2). So, when b > b∗, xb2 is the global minimum of fb(x) on [0, b].\nSecond, we consider b̄ < b ≤ b∗. We show that fb(0) ≤ fb(xb2) by contradiction. Suppose that there exists b such that fb(0) > fb(x b 2). Since fb̄ is strictly increasing on (0, x b̄ 2), we have fb̄(x\nb̄ 2) > fb̄(0). Because we have{\nfb̄(x b̄ 2) > fb̄(0), fb(x b 2) < fb(0),\n?Corresponding author.\nby a direct computation, we get { g(xb̄2)− xb̄2∇g(xb̄2)− 12 (x b̄ 2)\n2 > 0, g(xb2)− xb2∇g(xb2)− 12 (x b 2) 2 < 0.\nAccording to the intermediate value theorem, there exists x̃ such that xb̄2 < x̃ < x b 2 and g(x̃) − x̃∇g(x̃) − 12 (x̃) 2 = 0. Let b̃ = ∇g(x̃) + x̃. Then, (x̃, b̃− x̃) is the intersection point of Cb̃(x) and D(x) such that fb̃(x̃) = fb̃(0). Since xb̄2 < x̃ < xb2 and ∇g is convex and nonincreasing, we conclude that b̄ < b̃ < b ≤ b∗, which contradicts the minimality of b∗.\nAlso, when b ≤ b̄, we have ∇fb(x) = D(x)− Cb(x) ≥ 0, because D(x) is above Cb(x). So, the global minimum of fb(x) on [0, b] is 0.\nCase 2 : Suppose for all b∗ > b̄, fb∗(0) 6= fb∗(xb ∗ 2 ). Since fb̄ is increasing on (0, x b̄ 2), we have fb̄(x b̄ 2) > fb̄(0). We now show that for all b > b̄, fb(xb2) ≥ fb(0). Suppose this is not true and there exists b such that b > b̄ and fb(xb2) < fb(0). Because we have {\nfb̄(x b̄ 2) > fb̄(0), fb(x b 2) < fb(0),\nby a direct computation, we get { g(xb̄2)− xb̄2∇g(xb̄2)− 12 (x b̄ 2)\n2 > 0, g(xb2)− xb2∇g(xb2)− 12 (x b 2) 2 < 0.\nSo, according to the intermediate value theorem, there exists x̃ such that g(x̃)− x̃∇g(x̃)− 12 (x̃) 2 = 0.

Since xb̄2 < x̃ < xb2 and ∇g is convex and nonincreasing, we conclude that b̄ < b̃ < b, which contradicts fb∗(0) 6= fb∗(xb ∗ 2 ) for all b ∗ > b̄. So, for all b > b̄, 0 is the minimum of fb(x) on [0, b]. Similarly, when b ≤ b̄, we have ∇fb(x) = D(x)− Cb(x) ≥ 0, because D(x) is above Cb(x). So, the global minimum of fb(x) on [0, b] is 0.

Case 1 : Suppose we have Cg′(0)(x) = ∇g(0)− x ≤ ∇g(x) for all x on (0,∇g(0)). Notice for all b ≤ ∇g(0), we have ∇g(x) = D(x) − Cb(x) ≥ 0, so the minimum point of fb(x) is 0. For all b > ∇g(0), Cb = b − x and D(x) have only one intersection point denoted as (xb, yb). Then, we can easily see that fb is decreasing on (0, xb) and increasing on (xb, b).

Then, D(x) and Cb(x) have two intersection points, i.e., (0,∇g(0)) and (x∇g(0)2 , y ∇g(0) 2 ). It is easily checked that f∇g(0) is strictly decreasing on (0, x ∇g(0) 2 ), so we have f∇g(0)(x ∇g(0) 2 ) < f∇g(0)(0). Also, since fb̄ is strictly increasing on (0, x b̄ 2), we have fb̄(x b̄ 2) > fb̄(0).\nBecause we have { fb̄(x b̄ 2) > fb̄(0),\nf∇g(0)(x ∇g(0) 2 ) < f∇g(0)(0),\nby a direct computation, we get { g(xb̄2)− xb̄2∇g(xb̄2)− 12 (x b̄ 2) 2 > 0,\ng(x ∇g(0) 2 )− x ∇g(0) 2 ∇g(x ∇g(0) 2 )− 12 (x ∇g(0) 2 ) 2 < 0.\nSo, according to the intermediate value theorem, there exists x̃ such that g(x̃)− x̃∇g(x̃)− 12 (x̃) 2 = 0.

Given ∇g(0) ≥ b > b̄, we can easily see that fb is increasing on (0, xb1), decreasing on (xb1, xb2) and increasing on (xb2, b). So, 0 and xb2 are two local minimum points of fb(x) on [0, b].

Then x∗ is optimal to (1), i.e., x∗ ∈ Proxg(b).\nProof. As shown in Proposition 2 and 3, when b is larger than a certain threshold, Proxg(b) (xb2 in (2)(4) or x b in (3)(4)) is unique. Actually the unique solution is the largest intersection point of Cb(x) and ∇g(x), i.e., Proxg(b) = x̂b = max{x|∇fb(x) = 0, 0 ≤ x ≤ b}. For all the other choices of b, 0 ∈ Proxg(b). Thus, 0 and x̂b, one of them should be optimal to (1). Thus x∗ = arg minx∈{0,x̂b} fb(x) is optimal to (1).\nProof of Theorem 2 Theorem 2. For any lower bounded function g, its proximal operator Proxg(·) is monotone, i.e., for any p∗i ∈ Proxg(xi), i = 1, 2, p∗1 ≥ p∗2, when x1 > x2.\nProof. The lower bound assumption of g guarantees a finite solution to problem (1). By the optimality of p∗i , i = 1, 2, we have\ng(p∗2) + 1\n2 (p∗2 − x1)2 ≥ g(p∗1) +\n1 2 (p∗1 − x1)2, (5)\ng(p∗1) + 1\n2 (p∗1 − x2)2 ≥ g(p∗2) +\n1 2 (p∗2 − x2)2. (6)\nSumming them together gives (p∗2 − x1)2 + (p∗1 − x2)2 ≥ (p∗1 − x1)2 + (p∗2 − x2)2. (7)\nIt reduces to (p∗1 − p∗2)(x1 − x2) ≥ 0. (8) Thus p∗1 ≥ p∗2 when x1 > x2.\nConvergence Analysis of Algorithm 1 Assume there exists x̂b = max{x|∇fb(x) = ∇g(x) + x− b = 0, 0 ≤ x ≤ b}; otherwise, 0 is a solution to (1).\nWe only need to prove that the fixed point iteration guarantees to find x̂b. First, if∇g(b) = 0, then we have found x̂b = b. For the case x̂b < b, we prove that, the fixed point iteration, starting from x0 = b, converges to x̂b. Indeed, we have\nb−∇g(x) < x, for any x > x̂b.\nWe prove this by contradiction. Assume there exists x̃ > x̂b such that b − ∇g(x̃) > x̃. Notice g satisfies Assumption 1. It is easy to see∇g is continuous, decreasing and nonnegative. Then we have b−∇g(b) < b (∇g(b) > 0 since b > x̂b). Thus there must exist some x̂ ∈ (min(b, x̃),max(b, x̃)) > x̂b such that b− g(x̂) = x̂. This contradicts the definition of x̂b.\nSo, we have xk+1 = b−∇g(xk) < xk, if xk > x̂b.\nOn the other hand, {xk} is lower bounded by x̂b. So there must exist a limit of {xk}, denoted as x̄, which is no less than x̂b. Let k → +∞ on both sides of xk+1 = b−∇g(xk), and we see that x̄ = b−∇g(x̄). So, x̄ = x̂b, i.e., lim\nk→+∞ xk = x̂\nb.\nConvergence Analysis of Generalized Proximal Gradient Algorithm Consider the following problem\nmin X F (X) = m∑ i=1 g(σi(X)) + h(X), (9)\nwhere g : R+ → R+ is continuous, concave and nonincreasing on [0,+∞), and h : Rm×n → R+ has Lipschitz continuous gradient with Lipschitz constant L(h). The Generalized Proximal Gradient (GPG) algorithm solves the above problem by the following updating rule\nXk+1 = arg min X m∑ i=1 g(σi(X)) + h(X k) + 〈∇h(Xk),X−Xk〉+ µ 2 ||X−Xk||2F\n= arg min X m∑ i=1 g(σi(X)) + µ 2 ||X−Xk + 1 µ ∇h(Xk)||2F .\n(10)\nThen we have the following results.\nTheorem 3. If µ > L(h), the sequence {Xk} generated by (10) satisfies the following properties: (1) F (Xk) is monotonically decreasing. Indeed,\nF (Xk)− F (Xk+1) ≥ µ− L(h) 2 ||Xk −Xk+1||2F ≥ 0;\n(2) lim k→+∞ (Xk −Xk+1) = 0;\n(3) If F (X)→ +∞ when ||X||F → +∞, then any limit point of {Xk} is a stationary point.\nProof. Since Xk+1 is optimal to (10), we have m∑ i=1 g(σi(X k+1)) + h(Xk) + 〈∇h(Xk),Xk+1 −Xk〉+ µ 2 ||Xk+1 −Xk||2F\n≤ m∑ i=1 g(σi(X k)) + h(Xk) + 〈∇h(Xk),Xk −Xk〉+ µ 2 ||Xk −Xk||2F\n= m∑ i=1 g(σi(X k)).\n(11)\nOn the other hand, since h has Lipschitz continuous gradient, we have (Beck and Teboulle 2009)\nh(Xk+1) ≤ h(Xk) + 〈∇h(Xk),Xk+1 −Xk〉+ L(h) 2 ||Xk+1 −Xk||2F . (12)\nCombining (11) and (12) leads to\nF (Xk)− F (Xk+1)\n= m∑ i=1 g(σi(X k)) + h(Xk)− m∑ i=1 g(σi(X k+1))− h(Xk+1)\n≥µ− L(h) 2 ||Xk+1 −Xk||2F .\n(13)\nThus µ > L(h) guarantees that F (Xk) ≥ F (Xk+1). Summing (13) for k = 1, 2, · · · , we get\nF (X1) ≥ µ− L(h) 2 +∞∑ k=1 ||Xk+1 −Xk||2F . (14)\nThis implies that lim\nk→+∞ (Xk −Xk+1) = 0. (15)\nFurthermore, since F (X) → +∞ when ||X||F → +∞, {Xk} is bounded. There exist X∗ and a subsequence {Xkj} such that lim\nj→+∞ Xkj = X∗. By using (15), we get lim j→+∞ Xkj+1 = X∗. Considering that Xkj is optimal to (10), and − ∑m i=1 g(σi(X)) is convex (since g is concave) (Lewis and Sendov 2005) , there exists Q kj+1 ∈ −∂ ( − ∑m i=1 g(σi(X kj+1)) ) such that Qkj+1 +∇h(Xkj ) + µ(Xkj+1 −Xkj ) = 0. (16)\nLet j → +∞ in (16). By the upper semi-continuous property of the subdifferential (Clarke 1983), there exists Q∗ ∈ −∂ (− ∑m i=1 g(σi(X\n∗))), such that 0 = Q∗ +∇h(X∗) ∈ ∇F (X∗). (17)\nThus X∗ is a stationary point to (9).\nReferences [Beck and Teboulle 2009] Beck, A., and Teboulle, M. 2009. A fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm for linear inverse problems.
