Its convergence properties are well understood for convex functions, which arise in many machine learning applications (Nesterov, 2004). However, non-convex functions are also ubiquitous and have recently drawn a lot of interest due to the growing success of deep neural networks. Yet, non-convex functions are extremely hard to optimize due to the presence of saddle points and local minima which are not global optima (Dauphin et al., 2014; Choromanska et al., 2015). In fact, the work of (Hillar & Lim, 2013) showed that even a degree four polynomial can be NP-hard to optimize. Instead of aiming for a global minimizer, we will thus seek for a local optimum of the objective. In this regard, a lot of attention has focused on a specific type of functions known as strict saddle functions or ridable functions (Ge et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2015). These functions are characterized by the fact that the Hessian of every saddle point has a negative eigenvalue. Geometrically this means that there is a direction of negative curvature where decreasing function values can be found. Examples of strict saddle functions include dictionary learning, orthogonal tensor decomposition and generalized phase retrieval (Ge et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2015).\nIn this work, we focus our attention on trust region methods to optimize Eq. 1. These methods construct and optimize a local model of the objective function within a region whose radius depends on how well the model approximates the real objective. One of the keys for efficiency of these methods is to pick a model that is comparably easy to optimize, such as a quadratic function (Conn et al., 2000). Following the trust region paradigm, cubic regularization methods (Nesterov & Polyak, 2006; Cartis et al., 2011a) suggest finding the step sk that minimizes a cubic model of the form\nmk(sk) := f(xk) + s ᵀ k∇f(xk) +\n1 2 sᵀkHksk + σk 3 ‖sk‖3 ,\n(2) where Hk := ∇2f(xk) and σk > 0 1.\n(Nesterov & Polyak, 2006) were able to show that, if the\n1In the work of (Nesterov & Polyak, 2006), σk is assumed to be the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian in which case the model defined in Eq. 2 is a global overestimator of the objective, i.e. f(x) ≤ m(x) ∀x ∈ Rd. We will elaborate on the role of σk in (Cartis et al., 2011a) later on.\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n05 93\n3v 3\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\nJ ul\n2 01\n7\nstep is computed by globally minimizing the cubic model and if the Hessian Hk is globally Lipschitz continuous, Cubic regularization methods possess the best known worst case complexity to solve Eq. 1: an overall worst-case iteration count of order −3/2 for generating ‖∇f(xk)‖ ≤ , and of order −3 for achieving approximate nonnegative curvature. However, minimizing Eq. 2 in an exact manner impedes the performance of this method for machine learning applications as it requires access to the full Hessian matrix. More recently, (Cartis et al., 2011a) presented a method (hereafter referred to as ARC) which relaxed this requirement by assuming that one can construct an approximate Hessian Bk that is sufficiently close to Hk in the following way:\n‖(Bk −Hk)sk‖ ≤ C ‖sk‖2 , ∀k ≥ 0, C > 0 (3)\nFurthermore, they showed that it is sufficient to find an approximate minimizer by applying a Lanczos method to build up evolving Krylov spaces, which can be constructed in a Hessian-free manner, i.e. by accessing the Hessians only indirectly via matrix-vector products. However there are still two obstacles for the application of ARC in the field of machine learning: (1) The cost of the Lanczos process increases linearly in n and is thus not suitable for large datasets and (2) there is no theoretical guarantee that quasiNewton approaches satisfy Eq. 3 and (Cartis et al., 2011a) do not provide any alternative approximation technique.\nIn this work, we make explicit use of the finite-sum structure of Eq. 1 by applying a sub-sampling technique in order to provide guarantees for machine learning applications. Towards this goal, we make the following contributions:\n• We provide a theoretical Hessian sampling scheme that is guaranteed to satisfy Eq. 3 with high probability.\n• We extend the analysis to inexact gradients and prove that the convergence guarantees of (Nesterov & Polyak, 2006; Cartis et al., 2011a) can be retained.\n• Since the dominant iteration cost lie in the construction of the Lanczos process and increase linearly in n, we lower the computational cost significantly by reducing the number of samples used in each iteration.\n• Finally, we provide experimental results demonstrating significant speed-ups compared to standard first and second-order optimization methods for various convex and non-convex objectives."

In largescale learning, when n dmost of the computational cost of traditional deterministic optimization methods is spent\nin computing the exact gradient information. A common technique to address this issue is to use sub-sampling in order to compute an unbiased estimate of the gradient. The simplest instance is Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) whose convergence does not depend on the number of datapoints n. However, the variance in the stochastic gradient estimates slows its convergence down. The work of (Friedlander & Schmidt, 2012) explored a sub-sampling technique for gradient descent in the case of convex functions, showing that it is possible to maintain the same convergence rate as full-gradient descent by carefully increasing the sample size over time. Another way to recover a linear rate of convergence for strongly-convex functions is to use variance-reduced methods (Johnson & Zhang, 2013; Defazio et al., 2014; Roux et al., 2012; Hofmann et al., 2015; Daneshmand et al., 2016). Recently, the convergence of SGD and its variance-reduced counterparts has also been extended to non-convex functions (Ghadimi & Lan, 2013; Reddi et al., 2016a) but the techniques used in these papers require using a randomized sampling scheme which is different from what is typically used in practice. Furthermore, the guarantees these methods provide are only in terms of convergence to critical points. However, the work of (Ge et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2015) recently showed that SGD can achieve stronger guarantees in the case of strict saddle functions. Yet, the convergence rate has a polynomial dependency to the dimension d and the smallest eigenvalue of the Hessian which can make this method fairly impractical.\nSecond-order methods. For second-order methods, the problem of avoiding saddle points is even worse as they might be attracted by saddle points or even points of local maximizers (Dauphin et al., 2014). Another predominant issue is the computation (and perhaps storage) of the Hessian matrix, which requires O(nd2) operations as well as computing the inverse of the Hessian, which requires O(d3) computations. Quasi-Newton methods such as the well-known (L-)BFGS algorithm partially address this issue by requiring O(nd + d2) per-iteration cost (Nesterov, 2004) instead of O(nd2 + d3). An increasingly popular alternative is to use sub-sampling techniques to approximate the Hessian matrix, such as done for example in (Byrd et al., 2011) and (Erdogdu & Montanari, 2015). The latter method, named NewSamp, approximates the Hessian with a low-rank approximation which reduces the complexity per iteration to O(nd + |S|d2) with |S| being the sample size 2. Although this is a significant reduction in terms of complexity, NewSamp yields a composite convergence rate: quadratic at first but only linear near the minimizer. Unlike NewSamp, our sampling scheme yields a locally quadratic rate of convergence (as well as faster global con-\n2Note that this method still requires O(nd) computation for the gradient as it only subsamples the Hessian.\nvergence). Our analysis also does not require using exact gradients and can thus further reduce the complexity per iteration.\nCubic regularization and trust region methods. Trust region methods are among the most effective algorithmic frameworks to avoid pitfalls such as local saddle points in non-convex optimization. Classical versions iteratively construct a local quadratic model and minimize it within a certain radius wherein the model is trusted to be sufficiently similar to the actual objective function. This is equivalent to minimizing the model function with a suitable quadratic penalty term on the stepsize. Thus, a natural extension is the cubic regularization method introduced by (Nesterov & Polyak, 2006) that uses a cubic over-estimator of the objective function as a regularization technique for the computation of a step to minimize the objective function. The drawback of their method is that it requires computing the exact minimizer of Eq. 2, thus requiring the exact gradient and Hessian matrix. However finding a global minimizer of the cubic model mk(s) may not be essential in practice and doing so might be prohibitively expensive from a computational point of view. (Cartis et al., 2011a) introduced a method named ARC which relaxed this requirement by letting sk be an approximation to the minimizer. The model defined by the adaptive cubic regularization method introduced two further changes. First, instead of computing the exact Hessian Hk it allows for a symmetric approximation Bk. Second, it introduces a dynamic positive parameter σk instead of using the global Lipschitz constant L.\nThere have been efforts to further reduce the computational complexity of this problem. For example, (Agarwal et al., 2016) refined the approach of (Nesterov & Polyak, 2006) to return an approximate local minimum in time which is linear in the input representation. Similar improvements have been made by (Carmon & Duchi, 2016) and (Hazan & Koren, 2016). These methods provide alternatives to minimize the cubic model and can thus be seen as complementary to our approach. Finally, the work of (Blanchet et al., 2016) proposed a stochastic variant of a trust region method but their analysis does not specify any accuracy level required for the estimation of the stochastic Hessian. (Cartis & Scheinberg, 2017) also analyzed a probabilistic cubic regularization variant that allows approximate secondorder models but they did not provide an explicit derivation of sampling conditions."

Let gk and Bk be sampled such that 17 and 19 hold in each iteration k. Furthermore, for unsuccessful iterations, assume that the sample size is not decreasing.\nWe have already established a lower stepsize bound in Lemma 12 so let us turn our attention directly to 2.: Lemma 23 (Upper bound on stepsize). Suppose that sk satisfies (11) and that the Rayleigh coefficient\nRk(sk) := sᵀkBksk\n‖sk‖2 (68)\nis positive, then\n‖sk‖ ≤ 1\nRk(sk) ‖gk‖ =\n1\nRk(sk) ‖∇f(wk) + ek‖ ≤\n1\nRk(sk) ( ‖∇f(wk)‖+ ‖ek‖) (69)\nProof: Given the above assumptions we can rewrite (11) as follows\nRk(sk) ‖sk‖2 = −sᵀkgk − σk ‖sk‖ 3 ≤ ‖sk‖ ‖gk‖ , (70)\nwhere we used Cauchy-Schwarz inequality as well as the fact that σk > 0, ∀k. Solving (70) for ‖sk‖ gives (69).\nLemma 24 (Eventually full sample size). Let {f(xk)} be bounded below by some finf > −∞. Also, let A1, A3 hold and let gk and Bk be sampled according to A22. Then we have w.h.p. that\n|Sg,k| → n and |SB,k| → n as k →∞ (71)\nThe sampling schemes from Theorem 7 and Theorem 9 imply that the sufficient agreement assumptions A5 and A4 hold with high probability. Thus, we can deduce from Lemma 10 that after a certain number of consecutive unsuccessful iterates the penalty parameter is so high (σk ≥ σsup) that we are guaranteed to find a successful step. Consequently, the number of successful iterations must be infinite (|S| = ∞) when we consider the asymptotic convergence properties of SCR. We are left with two possible scenarios:\n(i) If the number of unsuccessful iterations is finite (|U| ≤ ∞ & |S| = ∞) we have that ∃ k̂ after which all iterates are successful, i.e. k ∈ S,∀ k > k̂. From Lemma 20 we know that for all successful iterations ‖sk‖ → 0 as k → ∞. Consequently, due to the sampling scheme as specified in Theorem 7 and Theorem 9, ∃ k̄ ≥ k̂ with |Sg,k| = |SB,k| = n, ∀ k ≥ k̄.\n(ii) If the number of unsuccessful iterations is infinite (|U| = ∞ & |S| = ∞) we know for the same reasons that for the subsequence of successful iterates {k = 0, 1, . . .∞|k ∈ S} again ‖sk‖ → 0, as k ∈ S → ∞ and hence ∃ k̃ with |Sg,k| = |SB,k| = n, ∀ k ≥ k̃ ∈ S . Given that we do specifically not decrease the sample size in unsuccessful iterations we have that |Sg,k| = |SB,k| = n, ∀ k ≥ k̃.\nAs a result the sample sizes eventually equal n with high probability in all conceivable scenarios which proves the assertion5.\nNow that we have (asymptotic) stepsize bounds and gradient (Hessian) agreement we are going to establish that, when converging, all SCR iterations are indeed very successful asymptotically. Lemma 25 (Eventually successful iterations). Let f ∈ C2,∇f uniformly continuous and Bk bounded above. Let Bk and gk be sampled according to A22, as well as sk satisfy (11). Furthermore, let\nwk → w∗, as k →∞, (72)\nwith∇f(w∗) = 0 and H(w∗) positive definite. Then there exists a constant Rmin > 0 such that for all k sufficiently large\nRk(sk) ≥ Rmin. (73)\nFurthermore, all iterations are eventually very successful w.h.p.\n5We shall see that, as a result of Lemma 25, the case of an infinite number of unsuccessful steps can actually not happen\nProof: Since f is continuous, the limit (72) implies that {f(wk)} is bounded below. Since H(w∗) is positive definite per assumption, so is H(wk) for all k sufficiently large. Therefore, there exists a constant Rmin such that\nsᵀkH(wk)sk\n‖sk‖2 > 2Rmin > 0, for all k sufficiently large. (74)\nAs a result of Lemma 24 we have that ‖ek‖ → 0 as k → ∞. Hence, Lemma 23 yields ‖sk‖ ≤ 1/Rmin ‖∇fk‖ which implies that the step size converges to zero as we approximate w∗. Consequently, we are able to show that eventually all iterations are indeed very successful. Towards this end we need to ensure that the following quantity rk becomes negative for sufficiently large k:\nrk := f(wk + sk)−m(sk)︸ ︷︷ ︸ (i) +(1− η2) (m(sk)− f(wk))︸ ︷︷ ︸ (ii) , (75)\nwhere η2 ∈ (0, 1) is the ”very successful” threshold.\n(i) By a (second-order) Taylor approximation around f(wk) and applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:\nf(wk + sk)−m(sk) =(∇f(w)− gk)ᵀsk + 1\n2 sᵀk((H(wk + τsk)−Bk)sk − σk 3 ‖s‖3\n≤‖ek‖ ‖sk‖+ 1\n2 ‖((H(wk + τsk)−Bk)sk‖ ‖sk‖ ,\n(76)\nwhere the term ‖ek‖ ‖sk‖ is extra compared to the case of deterministic gradients.\n(ii) Regarding the second part we note that if sk satisfies (11), we have by the definition of Rk and equation (73) that\nf(wk)−mk(sk) = 1\n2 sᵀkBsk +\n2 3 σk ‖sk‖3\n≥1 2 Rmin ‖sk‖2 ,\n(77)\nwhich negated gives the desired bound on (ii). All together, the upper bound on rk is written as\nrk ≤ 1\n2 ‖sk‖2 ( 2 ‖ek‖ ‖sk‖ + ‖((H(wk + τsk)−Bk)sk‖ ‖sk‖ − (1− η2)Rmin ) . (78)\nLet us add and subtract H(wk) to the second summand and apply the triangle inequality\nrk ≤ 1\n2 ‖sk‖2 ( 2 ‖ek‖ ‖sk‖ + ‖(H(wk + τsk)−Hk)sk‖+ ‖(Hk −Bk)sk‖ ‖sk‖ − (1− η2)Rmin ) . (79)\nNow applying ‖Av‖ ≤ ‖A‖ ‖v‖ we get\nrk ≤ 1\n2 ‖sk‖2 ( 2 ‖ek‖ ‖sk‖ + ‖H(wk + τsk)−Hk‖+ ‖(Hk −Bk)‖ − (1− η2)Rmin ) . (80)\nWe have already established in Lemma 24 that ‖ek‖ → 0 and ‖(Hk −Bk)‖ → 0. Together with Lemma 23 and the assumption ‖∇fk‖ → 0 this implies ‖sk‖ → 0. Furthermore, since τ ∈ [0, 1] we have that ‖wk + τsk‖ ≤ ‖wk + sk‖ ≤ ‖sk‖. Hence, H(wk + τsk) and H(wk) eventually agree. Finally, η2 < 1 and Rmin > 0 such that rk is negative for all k sufficiently large, which implies that every such iteration is very successful."

Let us assume that ‖∇f(xk0+1)‖ = > 0, then ‖∇f(xk)‖ = , ∀ k ≥ k0 + 1. (83) Since, furthermore, all iterations k ≥ k0 + 1 are unsuccessful σk increases by γ, such that\nσk →∞ as k →∞.

Furthermore, it is bounded below per assumption and thus the objective values converge\nf(xk)→ finf , as k →∞.

Details concerning experimental section\nWe here provide additional results and briefly describe the baseline algorithms used in the experiments as well as the choice of hyper-parameters. All experiments were run on a CPU with a 2.4 GHz nominal clock rate.\n6Note that this result can also be proven without Lipschitz continuity of H and less strong agreement conditions as done in Corollary 2.6 in (Cartis et al., 2011a).\nDatasets The real-world datasets we use represent very common instances of Machine Learning problems and are part of the libsvm library (Chang & Lin, 2011), except for cifar which is from Krizhevsky & Hinton (2009). A summary of their main characteristic can be found in table 1. The multiclass datasets are both instances of so-called image classification problems. The mnist images are greyscale and of size 28× 28. The original cifar images are 32× 32× 3 but we converted them to greyscale so that the problem dimensionality is comparable to mnist.

      "text" : "• Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): To bring in some variation, we select a mini-batch of the size dn/10e on the real world classification- and dn/100e on the multiclass problems. On the artificial datasets we only sample 1 datapoint per iteration and update the parameters with respect to this point. We use a problem-dependent, constant step-size as this yields faster initial convergence (Hofmann et al., 2015),(Roux et al., 2012).\n• SAGA: is a variance-reduced variant of SGD that only samples 1 datapoint per iteration and uses a constant step-size.\n• Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) is the most popular and stable Quasi-Newton method.\n• Limited-memory BFGS is a variant of BFGS which uses only the recent K iterates and gradients to construct an approximate Hessian. We used K = 20 in our experiments. Both methods employs a line-search technique that satisfies the strong Wolfe condition to select the step size.\n• NEWTON is the classic version of Newton’s method which we apply with a backtracking line search.\nFor L-BFGS and BFGS we used the implementation available in the optimization library of scipy. All other methods are our own implementation. The code for our implementation of SCR is publicly available on the authors’ webpage.\nInitialization. All of our experiments were started from the initial weight vector w0 := (0, . . . , 0).\nChoice of parameters for ARC and SCR. The regularization parameter updating is analog to the rule used in the reported experiments of (Cartis et al., 2011a), where γ = 2. Its goal is to reduce the penalty rapidly as soon as convergence sets in, while keeping some regularization in the non asymptotic regime. A more sophisticated approach can be found in (Gould et al., 2012). In our experiments we start with σ0 = 1, η1 = 0.2, and η2 = 0.8 as well as an initial sample size of 5%.\nInfluence of dimensionality To test the influence of the dimensionality on the progress of the above applied methods we created artificial datasets of three different sizes, labeled as gaussian s, gaussian m and gaussian l.\nThe feature vectors X = (x1,x2, ...,xd),xi ∈ Rn were drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution\nX ∼ N (µ, Σ) (87)\nwith a mean of zero µ = (0, . . . , 0) and a covariance matrix that has reasonably uniformly distributed off-diagonal elements in the interval (−1, 1).\nAs expected, the classic Newton methods suffers heavily from an increase in the dimension. The regularized Newton methods on the other hand scale comparably very well since they only need indirect access to the Hessian via matrixvector products. Evidently, these methods outperform the quasi-newton approaches even in high dimensions. Among these, the limited memory version of BFGS is significantly faster than its original variant.\nMulticlass regression In this section we leave the trust region method out because our implementation is not optimized towards solving multi-class problems. We do not run Newton’s method or BFGS either as the above results suggests that they are unlikely to be competitive. Furthermore, Figure 5 does not show logarithmic but linear suboptimality because optimizing these problems to high precision takes very long and yields few additional benefits. For example, the 25th SCR iteration drove the gradient norm from 3.8 · 10−5 to 5.6 · 10−8 after building up a Krylov space of dimensionality 7800. It took 9.47 hours and did not change any of the first 13 digits of the loss. As can be seen, SCR provides early progress at a comparable rate to other methods but gives the opportunity to solve the problem to high precision if needed."

Specifically, we focus our attention on a variant of trust region methods known as cubic regularization. This approach is particularly attractive because it escapes strict saddle points and it provides stronger convergence guarantees than firstand second-order as well as classical trust region methods. However, it suffers from a high computational complexity that makes it impractical for large-scale learning. Here, we propose a novel method that uses sub-sampling to lower this computational cost. By the use of concentration inequalities we provide a sampling scheme that gives sufficiently accurate gradient and Hessian approximations to retain the strong global and local convergence guarantees of cubically regularized methods. To the best of our knowledge this is the first work that gives global convergence guarantees for a sub-sampled variant of cubic regularization on non-convex functions. Furthermore, we provide experimental results supporting our theory.",
