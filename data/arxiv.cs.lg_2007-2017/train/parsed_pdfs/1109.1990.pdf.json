      "text" : "The concept of parsimony is central in many scientific domains. In the context of statistics, signal processing or machine learning, it takes the form of variable or feature selection problems, and is commonly used in two situations: first, to make the model or the prediction more interpretable or cheaper to use, i.e., even if the underlying problem does not admit sparse solutions, one looks for the best sparse approximation. Second, sparsity can also be used given prior knowledge that the model should be sparse. Many methods have been designed to learn sparse models, namely methods based on combinatorial optimization [1, 2], Bayesian inference [3] or convex optimization [4, 5].\nIn this paper, we focus on the regularization by sparsity-inducing norms. The simplest example of such norms is the `1-norm, leading to the Lasso, when used within a least-squares framework. In recent years, a large body of work has shown that the Lasso was performing optimally in highdimensional low-correlation settings, both in terms of prediction [6], estimation of parameters or estimation of supports [7, 8]. However, most data exhibit strong correlations, with various correlation structures, such as clusters (i.e., close to block-diagonal covariance matrices) or sparse graphs, such as for example problems involving sequences (in which case, the covariance matrix is close to a Toeplitz matrix [9]). In these situations, the Lasso is known to have stability problems: although its predictive performance is not disastrous, the selected predictor may vary a lot (typically, given two correlated variables, the Lasso will only select one of the two, at random).\nSeveral remedies have been proposed to this instability. First, the elastic net [10] adds a strongly convex penalty term (the squared `2-norm) that will stabilize selection (typically, given two correlated variables, the elastic net will select the two variables). However, it is blind to the exact correlation structure, and while strong convexity is required for some variables, it is not for other variables. Another solution is to consider the group Lasso, which will divide the predictors into groups and penalize the sum of the `2-norm of these groups [11]. This is known to accomodate strong correlations within groups [12]; however it requires to know the group in advance, which is not always possible. A third line of research has focused on sampling-based techniques [13, 14, 15].\nar X\niv :1\n10 9.\n19 90\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n9 S\nep 2\nAn ideal regularizer should thus be adapted to the design (like the group Lasso), but without requiring human intervention (like the elastic net); it should thus add strong convexity only where needed, and not modifying variables where things behave correctly. In this paper, we propose a new norm towards this end.\nMore precisely we make the following contributions:\n• We propose in Section 2 a new norm based on the trace norm (a.k.a. nuclear norm) that interpolates between the `1-norm and the `2-norm depending on correlations.\n• We show that there is a unique minimum when penalizing with this norm in Section 2.2.\n• We provide optimization algorithms based on reweighted least-squares in Section 3.\n• We study the second-order expansion around independence and relate to existing work on including correlations in Section 4.\n• We perform synthetic experiments in Section 5, where we show that the trace Lasso outperforms existing norms in strong-correlation regimes.\nNotations. Let M ∈ Rn×p. The columns of M are noted using superscript, i.e., M(i) denotes the i-th column, while the rows are noted using subscript, i.e., Mi denotes the i-th row. For M ∈ Rp×p, diag(M) ∈ Rp is the diagonal of the matrix M, while for u ∈ Rp, Diag(u) ∈ Rp×p is the diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the ui. Let S be a subset of {1, ..., p}, then uS is the vector u restricted to the support S, with 0 outside the support S. We denote by Sp the set of symmetric matrices of size p. We will use various matrix norms, here are the notations we use:\n• ‖M‖∗ is the trace norm, i.e., the sum of the singular values of the matrix M,\n• ‖M‖op is the operator norm, i.e., the maximum singular value of the matrix M, • ‖M‖F is the Frobenius norm, i.e., the `2-norm of the singular values, which is also equal to√ tr(M>M), • ‖M‖2,1 is the sum of the `2-norm of the columns of M: ‖M‖2,1 = p∑ i=1 ‖M(i)‖2."

      "text" : "We will now present some classical penalty functions for linear models which are widely used in the machine learning and statistics community. The first one, known as Tikhonov regularization [16] or ridge regression [17], is the squared `2-norm. When used with the square loss, estimating the parameter vector w is done by solving a linear system. One of the main drawbacks of this penalty function is the fact that it does not perform variable selection and thus does not behave well in sparse high-dimensional settings.\nHence, it is natural to penalize linear models by the number of variables used by the model. Unfortunately, this criterion, sometimes denoted by ‖ · ‖0 (`0-penalty), is not convex and solving the problem in Eq. (1) is generally NP-hard [18]. Thus, a convex relaxation for this problem was introduced, replacing the size of the selected subset by the `1-norm of w. This estimator is known as the Lasso [4] in the statistics community and basis pursuit [5] in signal processing. It was later shown that under some assumptions, the two problems were in fact equivalent (see for example [19] and references therein).\nWhen two predictors are highly correlated, the Lasso has a very unstable behavior: it may only select the variable that is the most correlated with the residual. On the other hand, the Tikhonov regularization tends to shrink coefficients of correlated variables together, leading to a very stable behavior. In order to get the best of both worlds, stability and variable selection, Zou and Hastie introduced the elastic net [10], which is the sum of the `1-norm and squared `2-norm. Unfortunately, this estimator needs two regularization parameters and is not adaptive to the precise correlation structure of the data. Some authors also proposed to use pairwise correlations between predictors to interpolate more adaptively between the `1-norm and squared `2-norm, by introducing the pairwise elastic net [20] (see comparisons with our approach in Section 5).\nFinally, when one has more knowledge about the data, for example clusters of variables that should be selected together, one can use the group Lasso [11]. Given a partition (Si) of the set of variables, it is defined as the sum of the `2-norms of the restricted vectors wSi :\n‖w‖GL = k∑ i=1 ‖wSi‖2.\nThe effect of this penalty function is to introduce sparsity at the group level: variables in a group are selected altogether. One of the main drawback of this method, which is also sometimes one of its quality, is the fact that one needs to know the partition of the variables, and so one needs to have a good knowledge of the data."

      "heading" : "2.2 The ridge, the Lasso and the trace Lasso",
      "text" : "In this section, we show that Tikhonov regularization and the Lasso penalty can be viewed as norms of the matrix X Diag(w). We then introduce a new norm involving this matrix.\nThe solution of empirical risk minimization penalized by the `1-norm or `2-norm is not equivariant by rescaling of the predictors X(i), so it is common to normalize the predictors. When normalizing the predictors X(i), and penalizing by Tikhonov regularization or by the Lasso, people are implicitly using a regularization term that depends on the data or design matrix X. In fact, there is an equivalence between normalizing the predictors and not normalizing them, using the two following reweighted `2 and `1-norms instead of the Tikhonov regularization and the Lasso:\n‖w‖22 = p∑ i=1 ‖X(i)‖22 w2i and ‖w‖1 = p∑ i=1 ‖X(i)‖2 |wi|. (2)\nThese two norms can be expressed using the matrix X Diag(w):\n‖w‖2 = ‖X Diag(w)‖F and ‖w‖1 = ‖X Diag(w)‖2,1,\nand a natural question arises: are there other relevant choices of functions or matrix norms? A classical measure of the complexity of a model is the number of predictors used by this model,\nwhich is equal to the size of the support of w. This penalty being non-convex, people use its convex relaxation, which is the `1-norm, leading to the Lasso.\nHere, we propose a different measure of complexity which can be shown to be more adapted in model selection settings [21]: the dimension of the subspace spanned by the selected predictors. This is equal to the rank of the selected predictors, or also to the rank of the matrix X Diag(w). As for the size of the support, this function is non-convex, and we propose to replace it by a convex surrogate, the trace norm, leading to the following penalty that we call “trace Lasso”:\nΩ(w) = ‖X Diag(w)‖∗.\nThe trace Lasso has some interesting properties: if all the predictors are orthogonal, then, it is equal to the `1-norm. Indeed, we have the decomposition:\nX Diag(w) = p∑ i=1 ( ‖X(i)‖2wi ) X(i) ‖X(i)‖2 e>i ,\nwhere ei are the vectors of the canonical basis. Since the predictors are orthogonal and the ei are orthogonal too, this gives the singular value decomposition of X Diag(w) and we get\n‖X Diag(w)‖∗ = p∑ i=1 ‖X(i)‖2|wi| = ‖X Diag(w)‖2,1.\nOn the other hand, if all the predictors are equal to X(1), then\nX Diag(w) = X(1)w>,\nand we get ‖X Diag(w)‖∗ = ‖X(1)‖2‖w‖2 = ‖X Diag(w)‖F , which is equivalent to the Tikhonov regularization. Thus when two predictors are strongly correlated, our norm will behave like the Tikhonov regularization, while for almost uncorrelated predictors, it will behave like the Lasso.\nAlways having a unique minimum is an important property for a statistical estimator, as it is a first step towards stability. The trace Lasso, by adding strong convexity exactly in the direction of highly correlated covariates, always has a unique minimum, and is much more stable than the Lasso.\nProposition 1. If the loss function ` is strongly convex with respect to its second argument, then the solution of the empirical risk minimization penalized by the trace Lasso, i.e., Eq. (1), is unique.\nThe technical proof of this proposition is given in appendix B, and consists of showing that in the flat directions of the loss function, the trace Lasso is strongly convex."

      "heading" : "2.3 A new family of penalty functions",
      "text" : "In this section, we introduce a new family of penalties, inspired by the trace Lasso, allowing us to write the `1-norm, the `2-norm and the newly introduced trace Lasso as special cases. In fact, we note that ‖Diag(w)‖∗ = ‖w‖1 and ‖p−1/21>Diag(w)‖∗ = ‖w>‖∗ = ‖w‖2. In other words, we can express the `1 and `2-norms of w using the trace norm of a given matrix times the matrix Diag(w). A natural question to ask is: what happens when using a matrix P other than the identity or the line vector p−1/21>, and what are good choices of such matrices? Therefore, we introduce the following family of penalty functions:\nDefinition 1. Let P ∈ Rk×p, all of its columns having unit norm. We introduce the norm ΩP as\nΩP(w) = ‖P Diag(w)‖∗.\nProof. The positive homogeneity and triangle inequality are direct consequences of the linearity of w 7→ P Diag(w) and the fact that ‖ · ‖∗ is a norm. Since all the columns of P are not equal to zero, we have P Diag(w) = 0⇔ w = 0, and so, ΩP separates points and is a norm.\nAs stated before, the `1 and `2-norms are special cases of the family of norms we just introduced. Another important penalty that can be expressed as a special case is the group Lasso, with nonoverlapping groups. Given a partition (Sj) of the set {1, ..., p}, the group Lasso is defined by\n‖w‖GL = ∑ Sj ‖wSj‖2.\nWe define the matrix PGL by\nPGLij =\n{ 1/ √ |Sk| if i and j are in the same group Sk,\n0 otherwise.\nThen,\nPGL Diag(w) = ∑ Sj 1Sj√ |Sj | w>Sj . (3)\nUsing the fact that (Sj) is a partition of {1, ..., p}, the vectors 1Sj are orthogonal and so are the vectors wSj . Hence, after normalizing the vectors, Eq. (3) gives a singular value decomposition of PGL Diag(w) and so the group Lasso penalty can be expressed as a special case of our family of norms:\n‖PGL Diag(w)‖∗ = ∑ Sj ‖wSj‖2 = ‖w‖GL.\nIn the following proposition, we show that our norm only depends on the value of P>P. This is an important property for the trace Lasso, where P = X, since it underlies the fact that this penalty only depends on the correlation matrix X>X of the covariates.\nProposition 2. Let P ∈ Rk×p, all of its columns having unit norm. We have\nΩP(w) = ‖(P>P)1/2 Diag(w)‖∗.\nWe plot the unit ball of our norm for the following value of P>P (see figure (1)): 1 0.9 0.10.9 1 0.1 0.1 0.1 1   1 0.7 0.490.7 1 0.7 0.49 0.7 1   1 1 01 1 0 0 0 1  We can lower bound and upper bound our norms by the `2-norm and `1-norm respectively. This shows that, as for the elastic net, our norms interpolate between the `1-norm and the `2- norm. But the main difference between the elastic net and our norms is the fact that our norms are adaptive, and require a single regularization parameter to tune. In particular for the trace\nLasso, when two covariates are strongly correlated, it will be close to the `2-norm, while when two covariates are almost uncorrelated, it will behave like the `1-norm. This is a behavior close to the one of the pairwise elastic net [20].\nProposition 3. Let P ∈ Rk×p, all of its columns having unit norm. We have\n‖w‖2 ≤ ΩP(w) ≤ ‖w‖1."

      "text" : "The dual norm is an important quantity for both optimization and theoretical analysis of the estimator. Unfortunately, we are not able in general to obtain a closed form expression of the dual norm for the family of norms we just introduced. However we can obtain a bound, which is exact for some special cases:\nProposition 4. The dual norm, defined by Ω∗P(u) = max ΩP(v)≤1 u>v, can be bounded by:\nΩ∗P(u) ≤ ‖P Diag(u)‖op.\nProof. Using the fact that diag(P>P) = 1, we have\nu>v = tr ( Diag(u)P>P Diag(v) ) ≤ ‖P Diag(u)‖op‖P Diag(v)‖∗,\nwhere the inequality comes from the fact that the operator norm ‖ · ‖op is the dual norm of the trace norm. The definition of the dual norm then gives the result.\nAs a corollary, we can bound the dual norm by a constant times the `∞-norm:\nΩ∗P(u) ≤ ‖P Diag(u)‖op ≤ ‖P‖op‖Diag(u)‖op = ‖P‖op‖u‖∞.\nUsing proposition (3), we also have the inequality Ω∗P(u) ≥ ‖u‖∞."

It is straightforward to extend this algorithm to the family of norms indexed by P. The problem we consider is\nmin w\n1 2 ‖y −Xw‖22 + λ‖X Diag(w)‖∗.\nWe could optimize this cost function by subgradient descent, but this is quite inefficient: computing the subgradient of the trace Lasso is expensive and the rate of convergence of subgradient descent is quite slow. Instead, we consider an iteratively reweighted least-squares method. First, we need to introduce a well-known variational formulation for the trace norm [22]:\nProposition 5. Let M ∈ Rn×p. The trace norm of M is equal to:\n‖M‖∗ = 1\n2 inf S 0\ntr ( M>S−1M ) + tr (S) ,\nand the infimum is attained for S = ( MM> )1/2 .\nUsing this proposition, we can reformulate the previous optimization problem as\nmin w inf S 0\n1 2 ‖y −Xw‖22 + λ 2 w>Diag\n( diag(X>S−1X) ) w + λ\n2 tr(S).\nThis problem is jointly convex in (w, S) [23]. In order to optimize this objective function by alternating the minimization over w and S, we need to add a term λµi2 tr(S\n−1). Otherwise, the infimum over S could be attained at a non invertible S, leading to a non convergent algorithm.\nThe infimum over S is then attained for S = ( X Diag(w)2X> + µiI )1/2 .\nOptimizing over w is a least-squares problem penalized by a reweighted `2-norm equal to w>Dw, where D = Diag ( diag(X>S−1X) ) . It is equivalent to solving the linear system\n(X>X + λD)w = X>y.\nThis can be done efficiently by using a conjugate gradient method. Since the cost of multiplying (X>X +λD) by a vector is O(np), solving the system has a complexity of O(knp), where k ≤ p is the number of iterations needed to converge. Using warm restarts, k can be much smaller than p, since the linear system we are solving does not change a lot from an iteration to another. Below we summarize the algorithm:\nIterative algorithm for estimating w\nInput: the design matrix X, the initial guess w0, number of iteration N , sequence µi. For i = 1...N :\n• Compute the eigenvalue decomposition U Diag(sk)U> of X Diag(wi−1)2X>. • Set D = Diag(diag(X>S−1X)), where S−1 = U Diag(1/ √ sk + µi)U >.\n• Set wi by solving the system (X>X + λD)w = X>y.\nFor the sequence µi, we use a decreasing sequence converging to ten times the machine precision."

For the first experiment, Σ is set to the identity, for the second experiment, Σ is block diagonal with blocks equal to 0.2I + 0.811> corresponding to clusters of eight variables, finally for the third experiment, we set Σij = 0.95\n|i−j|, corresponding to a Toeplitz design. For each method, we choose the best λ for the estimation error, which is reported.\nOverall all methods behave similarly in the noiseless and the noisy settings, hence we only report results for the noisy setting. In all three graphs of Figure 2, we observe behaviors that are typical of Lasso, ridge and elastic net: the Lasso performs very well on sparse models, but its performance is rather poor for denser models, almost as poor as the ridge regression. The elastic net offers the best of both worlds since its two parameters allow it to interpolate adaptively between the Lasso and the ridge. In experiment 1, since the variables are uncorrelated, there is no reason to couple their selection. This suggests that the Lasso should be the most appropriate convex regularization. The trace Lasso approaches the Lasso as n goes to infinity, but the weak coupling induced by empirical correlations is sufficient to slightly decrease its performance compared to that of the Lasso. By contrast, in experiments 2 and 3, the trace Lasso outperforms other methods (including the pairwise elastic net) since variables that should be selected together are indeed correlated. As for the penalized elastic net, since it takes into account the correlations between variables it is not surprising that in experiment 2 and 3 it performs better than methods that do not. We do not have a compelling explanation for its superior performance in experiment 1."

In the future, we want to show that if a dedicated norm using prior knowledge such as the group Lasso can be used, the trace Lasso will behave similarly and its performance will not degrade too much, providing theoretical guarantees to such adaptivity.

We have\nΠC0(M̃ + ∆̃)−ΠC0(M̃) = 1\n2iπ ∮ C0 λ(λI− M̃)−1∆̃(λI− M̃)−1dλ\n+ 1\n2iπ ∮ C0 λ(λI− M̃)−1∆̃(λI− M̃)−1∆̃(λI− M̃)−1dλ\n+ 1\n2iπ ∮ C0 λ(λI− M̃)−1∆̃(λI− M̃)−1∆̃(λI− M̃− ∆̃)−1dλ.\nThen, if we note the first integral C and the second one D, we get C = ∑ j,k wjw > j ∆̃wkw > k 1 2iπ ∮ C0 λdλ (λ− sj)(λ− sk) .\nIf both sj and sk are outside int(C0), then the integral is equal to zero. If one of them is inside, say sj , then sj = 0 and the integral is equal to∮\nC0\ndλ\nλ− sk\nThen this integral is non nul if and only if sk is also inside int(C0). Thus C = ∑ j,k wjw > j ∆̃wkw > k 1sj∈int(C0)1sk∈int(C0)\n= ∑ sj=0 ∑ sk=0 wjw > j ∆̃wkw > k = W0W > 0 ∆̃W0W > 0 ,\nwhere W0 are the eigenvectors associated to the eigenvalue 0. We have D = ∑ j,k,l wjw > j ∆̃wkw > k ∆̃wlw > l 1 2iπ ∮ C0 λdλ (λ− sj)(λ− sk)(λ− sl) .\nThe integral is not equal to zero if and only if exactly one eigenvalue, say si, is outside int(C0). The integral is then equal to −1/si. Thus\nD = −W0W>0 ∆̃W0W>0 ∆̃WS−1W> −WS−1W>∆̃W0W>0 ∆̃W0W>0 −W0W>0 ∆̃WS−1W>∆̃W0W>0 ,\nwhere S = Diag(−s, s). Finally, putting everything together, we get\nProposition 6. Let M = U Diag(s)V> ∈ Rn×p, the singular value decomposition of M, with U ∈ Rn×r, V ∈ Rp×r. Let ∆ ∈ Rn×p. We have\n‖M + ∆‖∗ = ‖M‖∗ + ‖Q‖∗ + tr(VU>∆)+∑ sj>0 ∑ sk>0 (u>j ∆vk − u>k ∆vj)2 4(sj + sk) + ∑ sj=0 ∑ sk>0 (u>k ∆v0j) 2 + (u>0j∆vk) 2 2sk + o(‖∆‖2),\nwhere\nQ = U>0 ∆V0 − U>0 ∆V0V>0 ∆>U Diag(s)−1\n− Diag(s)−1V>∆>U0U>0 ∆V0 − U>0 ∆V Diag(s)−1U>∆V0."

      "text" : "In this section, we prove that if the loss function is strongly convex with respect to its second argument, then the solution of the penalized empirical risk minimization is unique.\nLet ŵ ∈ argminw ∑n i=1 `(yi,w\n>xi)+λ‖X Diag(w)‖∗. If ŵ is in the nullspace of X, then ŵ = 0 and the minimum is unique. From now on, we suppose that the minima are not in the nullspace of X.\nLet u,v ∈ argminw ∑n i=1 `(yi,w\n>xi) + λ‖X Diag(w)‖∗ and δ = v − u. By convexity of the objective function, all the w = u+tδ, for t ∈]0, 1[ are also optimal solutions, and so, we can choose an optimal solution w such that wi 6= 0 for all i in the support of δ. Because the loss function is strongly convex outside the nullspace of X, δ is in the nullspace of X.\nLet X Diag(w) = U Diag(s)V> be the SVD of X Diag(w). We have the following development around w:\n‖X Diag(w + tδ)‖∗ = ‖X Diag(w)‖∗ + tr(Diag(tδ)X>UV>)+∑ si>0 ∑ sj>0 tr(Diag(tδ)X>(uiv > j − ujv>i ))2 4(si + sj) + ∑ si>0 ∑ sj=0 tr(Diag(tδ)X>uiv > j ) 2 2si + o(t2).\nWe note S the support of w. Using the fact that the support of δ is included in S, we have X Diag(tδ) = X Diag(w) Diag(tγ), where γi =\nδi wi for i ∈ S and 0 otherwise. Then:\n‖X Diag(w + tδ)‖∗ = ‖X Diag(w)‖∗ + tγ> diag(V Diag(s)V>)+∑ si>0 ∑ sj>0 t2 tr ( (si − sj) Diag(γ)viv>j )2 4(si + sj) + ∑ si>0 ∑ sj=0 t2 tr ( si Diag(γ)viv > j )2 2si + o(t2).\nFor small t, w + tδ is also a minimum, and therefore, we have: ∀ si > 0, sj > 0, (si − sj) tr ( Diag(γ)viv > j ) = 0, (4)\n∀ si > 0, sj = 0, tr ( Diag(γ)viv > j ) = 0. (5)\nThis could be summarized as\n∀ si 6= sj , v>i (Diag(γ)vj) = 0. (6)\nThis means that the eigenspaces of Diag(w)X>X Diag(w) are stable by the matrix Diag(γ). Therefore, Diag(w)X>X Diag(w) and Diag(γ) are simultaneously diagonalizable and so, they commute. Therefore:\n∀ i, j ∈ S, σijγi = σijγj (7)\nwhere σij = [X >X]ij . We define a partition (Sk) of S, such that i and j are in the same set Sk if there exists a path i = a1, ..., am = j such that σan,an+1 6= 0 for all n ∈ {1, ...,m− 1}. Then, using equation (7), γ is constant on each Sk. δ being in the nullspace of X, we have:\n0 = δ>X>Xδ (8) = ∑ Sk ∑ Sl δ>SkX >XδSl (9)\n= ∑ Sk δ>SkX >XδSk (10)\n= ∑ Sk ‖XδSk‖22. (11)\nSo for all Si, XδSi = 0. Since a predictor Xi is orthogonal to all the predictors belonging to other groups defined by the partition (Sk), we can decompose the norm Ω:\n‖X Diag(w)‖∗ = ∑ Sk ‖X Diag(wSk)‖∗. (12)\nWe recall that γ is constant on each Sk and so δSk is colinear to wSi , by definition of γ. If δSi is not equal to zero, this means that wSi , which is not equal to zero, is in the nullspace of X. Replacing wSi by 0 will not change the value of the data fitting term but it will strictly decreases the value of the norm Ω. This is a contradiction with the optimality of w. Thus all the δSi are equal to zero and the minimum is unique."
