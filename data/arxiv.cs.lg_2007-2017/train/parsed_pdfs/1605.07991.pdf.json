      "text" : "We propose a novel, efficient approach for distributed sparse learning in high-dimensions, where observations are randomly partitioned across machines. Computationally, at each round our method only requires the master machine to solve a shifted `1 regularized M-estimation problem, and other workers to compute the gradient on local data. In respect of communication, the proposed approach provably matches the estimation error bound of centralized methods within constant rounds of communications (ignoring logarithmic factors). We conduct extensive experiments on both simulated and real world datasets, and demonstrate encouraging performances on high-dimensional regression and classification tasks."

Unfortunately the distribution D is generally not known and the minimizer, β , of (1.1) needs to be approximated on the basis of N observations txi, yiuNi 1 drawn from D. Modern massive data sets, where both N and p are huge, create challenges to classical approaches. One of the challenges, which we address in the paper, is that often observations cannot fit in memory of a single machine, but are rather distributed across m machines. For simplicity, we will assume that N nm and that j-th machine has access to observations txji, yjiuni 1. All of our results can be easily generalized for a general N . Our particular focus is on the high-dimensional setting where the ambient dimension p is as large, or even larger, as the sample size n, but only a subset of variables is predictive, that is, S : supportpβ q tj P rps | βj 0u and s |S| ! p. Learning a sparse β in a high-dimensional setting is a well studied statistical problem (Bühlmann and van de Geer, 2011; Hastie et al., 2015), however, it creates unique computational challenges in the distributed setting that we address here.\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n07 99\n1v 1\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n2 5\nThe main contribution of the paper is a novel algorithm for estimating the minimizer β of (1.1) in a distributed setting. Our estimator is able to achieve performance of a centralized procedure that has access to all data, while keeping computation and communication costs low. Compared to the existing one-shot estimation approach (Lee et al., 2015b), our method can achieve the same statistical performance faster. If the number of communication rounds is allowed to increase by logarithm on number of total machines, our procedure can keep increasing the statistical performance, until matching the centralized procedure, while keeping the computation time low. Furthermore, these results can be achieved under weaker assumptions on the data generating procedure.\nIn the paper, we assume the communication occurs in rounds, where in each round, machines exchange messages with the master machine and, between two rounds, the machines only compute based on their local information, which includes local data points and messages received before (Zhang et al., 2013b; Shamir and Srebro, 2014; Arjevani and Shamir, 2015). In a non-distributed setting, efficient estimation procedures need to balance statistical efficiency with computation efficiency (runtime). In a distributed setting, the situation gets more complicated and we need to balance two resources, local runtime and number of rounds of communication, with the statistical error. The local runtime refers to the amount of work each machine needs to do. The number of rounds of communication refers to how often do local machines need to exchange messages with the master machine. We compare our procedure to other algorithm using the aforementioned metrics.\nNotations We use rns to denote the set t1, . . . , nu. For a vector a P Rn, we let supportpaq tj : aj 0u be the support set, ||a||q, q P r1,8q, the `q-norm defined as ||a||q p ° iPrns |ai|qq1{q, and ||a||8 maxiPrns |ai|. For a matrix A P Rn1 n2 , we use the following element-wise `8 matrix norms ||A||8 maxiPrn1s,jPrn2s |aij |. Denote In as n n identity matrix. For two sequences of numbers tanu8n 1 and tbnu8n 1, we use an Opbnq to denote that an ¤ Cbn for some finite positive constant C, and for all n large enough. If an Opbnq and bn Opanq, we use the notation an bn. We also use an À bn for an Opbnq and an Á bn for bn Opanq."

The centralized approach achieves the optimal statistical error, however, it is impractical due to expensive communication.\nIn a related setting, Lee et al. (2015b) studied a one-shot approach to learning β based on averaging the debiased lasso estimators (Avg-Debias) (Zhang and Zhang, 2013). Under strong assumptions their approach matches the centralized error bound after one round of communication. While an encouraging result, there are limitations to this approach, which our method addresses. In particular, the Avd-Debias method has the following problems:\n• The debiasing step in Avg-Debias computationally heavy. In particular, the debiasing step requires solving Oppq generalized lasso problems, which is computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional problems (Zhang and Zhang, 2013; Javanmard and Montanari, 2014). Our\nprocedure, on the other hand, requires only solving one `1 penalized objective in each iteration, which has the same time complexity as computing β̂local in (1.2). See Section 2 for details.\n• Avg-Debias procedure only matches the statistical error of the centralized procedure when the sample size per machine satisfies n Á ms2 log p. Our approach improves this sample complexity to n Á s2 log p. • Avg-Debias procedure requires strong conditions on the data generating process. For example,\nthe generalized coherence condition is required 1 on the data matrix to make debiasing work. Such a condition is not needed for consistent high-dimensional estimation in a distributed setting as we show here.\nTable 1 summarizes the resources required for the approaches discussed above to solve the\ndistributed sparse linear regression problems."

      "text" : "Due to its importance, there is a large body of literature on distributed optimization for modern massive data sets. See for example, (Dekel et al., 2012; Duchi et al., 2012, 2014; Zhang et al., 2013b; Zinkevich et al., 2010; Boyd et al., 2011; Balcan et al., 2012; Yang, 2013; Jaggi et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2015; Shamir and Srebro, 2014; Zhang and Xiao, 2015; Lee et al., 2015a; Arjevani and Shamir, 2015) and reference there in. A popular approach to distributed estimation is averaging estimators\n1The generalized coherence requires there exists a matrix Θ, such that ||Σ̂Θ Ip||8 À b\nlog p n , where Σ̂ is the\nempirical covariance matrix.\nformed locally by different machines (Mcdonald et al., 2009; Zinkevich et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2012; Huang and Huo, 2015). Divide-and-conquer procedures also found applications in statistical inference (Zhao et al., 2014a; Cheng and Shang, 2015; Lu et al., 2016). Shamir and Srebro (2014) and Rosenblatt and Nadler (2014) showed that averaging local estimators at the end will have bad dependence on either condition number or dimensions. Yang (2013), Jaggi et al. (2014), and Ma et al. (2015) studied distributed optimization using stochastic dual coordinate descent. These approaches try to find a good balance between computation and communication. However, their communication complexity bounds have a bad dependence on the condition number, resulting in a procedure which is not better than first-order approaches in terms of communication, such as (proximal) accelerated gradient descent (Nesterov, 1983). Shamir et al. (2014) and Zhang and Xiao (2015) proposed truly communication-efficient distributed optimization algorithms which leveraged the local second-order information, resulting in milder dependence on the condition number, compared to the first-order approaches (Boyd et al., 2011; Shamir and Srebro, 2014; Ma et al., 2015). Lower bounds were studied in (Zhang et al., 2013a; Braverman et al., 2015; Arjevani and Shamir, 2015). However, it is not clear how to extend these approaches with non-smooth objectives, for example, the `1 regularized problems.\nMost of the above mentioned work is focused on estimators that are (asymptotically) linear. Averaging at the end reduces the variance of these estimators, resulting in an estimator that matches the performance of centralized procedure. With `2 regularization, Zhang et al. (2013c) studied the averaging the estimations with weaker regularization to avoid the large bias problem, under kernel ridge regression setting. The situation in a high-dimensional setting is not so straightforward, due to the biased induced by the sparsity inducing penalty. Zhao et al. (2014b) illustrated how averaging debiased composite quantile regression estimators can be used for efficient inference in a highdimensional setting. Averaging debiased high-dimensional estimators was subsequently used in Lee et al. (2015b) for distributed estimation, multi-task learning (Wang et al., 2015), and statistical inference (Battey et al., 2015). Concurrent work of (Jordan et al., 2016) (personal communication) also improved computational efficiency of Lee et al. (2015b) using ideas of Shamir et al. (2014)."

(2.1)\nA minimizer β̂0 is broadcasted to all other machines, which use it to compute a gradient of the local loss at β̂0.

(2.2)\nA minimizer β̂t 1 is communicated to other machines, which use it to compute the local gradient as before.\nFormulation (2.2) is inspired by the proposal in Shamir et al. (2014), where the authors studied distributed optimization for smooth and strongly convex empirical objectives. However, we do not use any averaging scheme, which require additional rounds of communication and, moreover, we add an `1 regularization term to ensure consistent estimation in high-dimensions. Different from the distributed first-order optimization approaches, the refined objective (2.2) leverages both global first-order information and local higher-order information. To see this, suppose we set λt 1 0 and that Ljpβq is a quadratic objective with invertible hessian. Then we have the following closed form solution for (2.2),\nβ̂t 1 β̂t ∇2L1pβ̂tq 1 m 1 ¸ jPrms ∇Ljpβ̂tq ,\nwhich is exactly a sub-sampled Newton updating rule. Unfortunately for high-dimensional problems, the Hessian is no longer invertible, and a `1 regularization is added to make the solution well behaved. The regularization parameter λt will be chosen in a way, so that it decreases with the iteration number t. As a result we will be able to show that the final estimator performs as well at the centralized solution. We discuss in details how to choose λt in the following section."

We start by providing a general estimation error bound on β̂ β , where β̂ is obtained using Algorithm 1 and β is a minimizer of (1.1). Consequences of the main result are illustrated on concrete examples in Section 4. To simplify the presentation, we assume that the domain X is bounded. Furthermore, our analysis relies on the smoothness conditions of the loss function `p , q. Assumption 3.1. The loss `p , q is L-smooth with respect to the second argument, that is, @a, b, c P R, we have `1pa, bq `1pa, cq ¤ L|b c|.

Widely studied graphical models are Gaussian graphical models (Meinshausen and Bühlmann, 2006; Yuan and Lin, 2007) for continuous data and Ising graphical models (Ravikumar et al., 2010) for binary observations. As shown in (Meinshausen and Bühlmann, 2006; Ravikumar et al., 2010), these model selection problems can be reduced to solving parallel `1 regularized linear regression and logistic regression problems, respectively. Thus the approach presented in this paper can be readily applicable for these tasks."

We run the algorithms for both distributed regression and classification problems. The algorithms to be compared are:\n• Local: the first machine just solves a related `1 regularized problem (lasso or `1 regularized logistic regression) with the optimal λ, and outputs the solution. Obviously this approach is\ncommunication free.\n• Centralize: the master gathers all data from different machines together, and solves a centralized `1 regularized loss minimization problem with the optimal λ, and outputs the solution.\nThis approach is communication expensive as all data needs to be communicated, but it usually gives us the best estimation and prediction performance.\n• Prox GD: the distributed proximal gradient descent is ran on the `1 regularized objective, where we initialized the starting point with the first machine’s solution.\n• Avg-Debias: the method proposed in Lee et al. (2015b), with fine tuned regularization and hard thresholding parameters. This approach only requires one round of communication,\nwhere each machine sends a p-dimensional vector. However, Avg-Debias is computationally prohibitive because of the debiasing operation.\n• EDSL: the proposed efficient distributed sparse learning approach, where the regularization level at each iteration is fine tuned."

We generate txjiujPrms,iPrns from multivariate normal distribution with mean zero vector, and covariance matrix Σ, which controls the condition number of the problem. We will varying Σ to see how it affects the performance of various methods. We set Σij 0.5|i j| for the well-conditioned setting, and Σij 0.5|i j|{5 for the ill-conditioned setting. The response variable tyjiujPrms,iPrns are drawn from (4.1) and (4.4) for regression and classification problems, respectively. For regression problems, the noise ji is sampled from a standard normal distribution. The true model β is set to be s-sparse, where the first s-entries are sampled i.i.d. from a uniform distribution in r0, 1s, and the other entries are set to zero. We run experiments with various pn, p,m, sq settings2, and plot how the estimation error ||β̂t β ||2 varies for Prox GD and the proposed EDSL algorithm with rounds of communications. We also plot the estimation error of Local, Avg-Debias, and Centralize as a horizontal line, where the communications are fixed for these algorithms3. Figure 1 and 2 summarize the results, where the plots are averaged across 10 independent trials. We have the following observations:\n• The Avg-Debias approach obtained much better estimation error than Local after one round of communication, and sometimes performed quite close to Centralize. However, in most\ncases there is still a gap compared with Centralize, especially when the problem is not wellconditioned, or the number of machines m is large.\n• When the problem is well conditioned (Σij 0.5|i j| case), Prox GD converges reasonably fast, however it becomes very slow when the condition number becomes bad (Σij 0.5|i j|{5 case). We expect similar phenomenon will to for other first-order distributed optimization\nalgorithms, such as accelerated proximal gradient or ADMM.\n• As theory suggested, EDSL obtains a solution that is competitive with Avg-Debias after one round of communication, The estimation error decreases to be truly competitive with\nthe Centralize within very few rounds of communications (typically less than 5, where the theory suggested EDSL will match the performance of Centralize within Oplogmq rounds of communications).\nAbove experiments validate the theoretical analysis that when the additional error term in AvgDebias is relatively large, one round of communication is not sufficient to match the performance of centralized procedure. However, EDSL could match the performance of Avg-Debias also with one round of communication, and further improves the estimation quality by exponentially reducing the additional error until matching the centralized lasso performance, within a few rounds of communications. Thus the proposed EDSL improves the Avg-Debias approach both computationally and statistically.\n2n: sample size per machine, p: problem dimension, m: number of machines, s: true support size. 3these algorithms have zero, one-shot and full communications, respectively."

      "text" : "In this section, we compare the distributed sparse learning algorithms on several real world datasets, which are publicly available from the LIBSVM website4 and UCI Machine Learning Repository5. The statistics of these datasets are summarized in Table 2, where some of the multi-class classification datasets are adopted under the regression setting with squared losses. For all of the data, we use 60% of them for training, and 20% as held-out validation set for tuning the parameters, and the remaining 20% for testing. We test 10 randomly partitions of the training, validation and testing sets and report the averaged performance on testing datasets. For regression tasks, the evaluation metric is the normalized Mean Squared Error (normalized MSE), for classification tasks we report the classification error. We randomly partition the data on m 10 machines and run various algorithms tested in the simulation. The results are plotted in Figure 3 where for some datasets the performance of Avg-Debias is significantly worse than others (mostly because the debiasing step fails), thus we omit these plots. We make the following observations based on Figure 3:\n• Since there is no well-specified model on these datasets, the curves behave quite differently on different datasets. But overall there is a large gap between the Local solution and Centralized\nprocedure, where the later uses 10 times more data.\n• Avg-Debias often fails on these real datasets, and performs much worse than in simulations. The main reason might be becasue when the assumptions such as well-specified model or\ngeneralized coherence condition fail, Avg-Debias can totally fail and produce solution even much worse than the local.\n• Prox GD approach still converges quite slow in most of the cases. 4https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/ cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/ 5http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/\n• The proposed EDSL are quite robust on real world datasets, and can output a solution which is highly competitive with the centralized model within a few rounds of communications.\n• There exits a “zig-zag” behavior for EDSL approach on some datasets, for example, on mushrooms dataset, the predictive performance of EDSL is not that stable.\nThe experimental results on real world datasets again verified that the proposed EDSL method is an effective method for distributed sparse learning, while maintain efficiency in both computation and communication."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion and Discussion",
      "text" : "We proposed a novel approach for distributed learning with sparsity, which is efficient in both computation and communication. Our theoretical analysis showed that the proposed method works under weaker conditions than the averaging the debiased estimator. Furthermore, estimation error can be improved over a few rounds of computation as the additional error term exponentially decreases, until matching the centralized procedure. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world data demonstrate that the proposed method improves the performance over one shot averaging approach within just a few rounds of communications.\nThere might be several ways to improve this work further. As we see in real data experiments, the proposed approach can still perform slightly worse than the centralized approach on certain datasets. It is interesting to explore how to make EDSL provably work under even weaker assumptions. For example, EDSL requires Ops2 log pq samples per machine to match the centralized method in Oplogmq rounds of communications, however, it is not clear whether the sample size requirement can be improved, while still maintaining low-communication cost. Last but not least, it is interesting to explore the ideas presented to improve the computational cost of communicationefficient distributed multi-task learning with shared support (Wang et al., 2015)."

    "abstractText" : "We propose a novel, efficient approach for distributed sparse learning in high-dimensions, where observations are randomly partitioned across machines. Computationally, at each round our method only requires the master machine to solve a shifted `1 regularized M-estimation problem, and other workers to compute the gradient on local data. In respect of communication, the proposed approach provably matches the estimation error bound of centralized methods within constant rounds of communications (ignoring logarithmic factors). We conduct extensive experiments on both simulated and real world datasets, and demonstrate encouraging performances on high-dimensional regression and classification tasks.",
