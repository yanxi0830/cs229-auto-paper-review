      "text" : "The areas of multi-agent planning and control have witnessed a recent wave of strong interest due to the practical desire to deal with complex real-world problems, such as smart-grid control, autonomous vehicles planning, managing teams of robots for emergency response, among others. From the learning perspective, (cooperative) multi-agent learning is not a new area of research (Stone & Veloso, 2000; Panait & Luke, 2005). However, compared to the progress in conventional supervised learning and singleagent reinforcement learning, the successes of multi-agent learning have remained relatively modest. Most notably, multi-agent learning suffers from extremely high dimensionality of both the state and actions spaces, as well as relative lack of data sources and experimental testbeds.\nThe growing availability of data sources for coordinated multi-agent behavior, such as sports tracking data\n1California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 2Disney Research, Pittsburgh, PA. Correspondence to: Hoang M. Le <hmle@caltech.edu>.\nFigure 1. Our motivating example of learning coordinating behavior policies for team sports from tracking data. Red is the attacking team, blue is the defending team, and yellow is the ball.\n(Bialkowski et al., 2014), now enables the possibility of learning multi-agent policies from demonstrations, also known as multi-agent imitation learning. One particularly interesting aspect of domains such as team sports is that the agents must coordinate. For example, in the professional soccer setting depicted in Figure 1, different players must coordinate to assume different roles (e.g., defend left field). However, the roles and role assignment mechanism are unobserved from the demonstrations. Furthermore, the role for a player may change during the same play sequence. In the control community, this issue is known as “index-free” multi-agent control (Kingston & Egerstedt, 2010).\nMotivated by these challenges, we study the problem of imitation learning for multiple coordinating agents from demonstrations. Many realistic multi-agent settings require coordination among collaborative agents to achieve some common goal (Guestrin et al., 2002; Kok et al., 2003). Beyond team sports, other examples include learning policies for game AI, controlling teams of multiple robots, or modeling collective animal behavior. As discussed above, we are interested in settings where agents have access to the outcome of actions from other agents, but the coordination mechanism is neither clearly defined nor observed, which makes the full state only partially observable.\nWe propose a semi-supervised learning framework that integrates and builds upon conventional imitation learning and unsupervised, or latent, structure learning. The latent structure model encodes a coordination mechanism, which approximates the implicit coordination in the demonstra-\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n03 12\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 9\nM ar\n2 01\n7\ntion data. In order to make learning tractable, we develop an alternating optimization method that enables integrated and efficient training of both individual policies and the latent structure model. For learning individual policies, we extend reduction-based single-agent imitation learning approaches into multi-agent domain, utilizing powerful black-box supervised techniques such as deep learning as base routines. For latent structure learning, we develop a stochastic variational inference approach.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in two settings. The first is a synthetic experiment based on the popular predator-prey game. The second is a challenging task of learning multiple policies for team defense in professional soccer, using a large training set of play sequences illustrated by Figure 1. We show that learning a good latent structure to encode implicit coordination yields significantly superior imitation performance compared to conventional baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an imitation learning approach has been applied to jointly learn cooperative multi-agent policies at large scale."

      "text" : "In coordinated multi-agent imitation learning, we have K agents acting in coordination to achieve a common goal (or sequence of goals). Training data D consists of multiple demonstrations of K agents. Importantly, we assume the identity (or indexing) of the K experts may change from one demonstration to another. Each (unstructured) set of demonstrations is denoted by U “ tU1, . . . , UKu, where Uk “ tut,kuTt“1 is the sequence of actions by agent k at time t. Note that each set of demonstrations can have varying sequence length T. Let C “ tctuTt“1 be the context associated with each demonstration sequence.\nPolicy Learning. Our ultimate goal is to learn a (largely) decentralized policy, but for clarity we first present the problem of learning a fully centralized multi-agent policy. Following the notation of (Ross et al., 2011), let ~πp~sq :“ ~a denote the joint policy that maps the joint state, ~s “ rs1, . . . , sKs, of all K agents into K actions ~a “ ra1, . . . , aKs. The goal is to minimize imitation loss:\nLimitation “ E~s„d~π r`p~πp~sqqs ,\nwhere d~π denotes the distribution of states experienced by joint policy ~π and ` is the imitation loss defined over the demonstrations (e.g., squared loss for deterministic policies, or cross entropy for stochastic policies).\nThe decentralized setting decomposes the joint policy ~π “ rπ1, . . . , πKs into K policies, each tailored to a specific agent index or “role”.1 The loss function is then:\n1It is straightforward to extend our formulation to settings where multiple agents can occupy the same role, and where not\nLimitation “ K ÿ\nk“1 Es„dπk r`pπkpskqqs .\nBlack-Box Policy Classes. In order to leverage powerful black-box policy classes such as random forests and deep learning, we take a learning reduction approach to training ~π. One consequence is that the state space representation s “ rs1, . . . , sKs must be consistently indexed, e.g., agent k in one instance must correspond to agent k in another instance. This requirement applies for both centralized and decentralized policy learning, and is often implicitly assumed in prior work on multi-agent learning.\nCoordination. Consider the task of imitating professional soccer players, where training data includes play sequences from different teams and games. Here the context C corresponds to the behavior of the opposing team and the ball. The demonstration data includes multiple sequences of Kset of trajectories U “ tU1, U2, . . . , UKu, where the actual identity of player generatingUk may not be consistent from one demonstration to the next. In addition, although team players tend to act in a coordinated fashion, we do not have information about which player is taking on which role, and roles can be switched in the same segment of play.\nOne important challenge is constructing a consistent indexing over the agents to yield a consistent state representation for black-box policy learning. For example, the same index should correspond to the left midfielder in all instances. Otherwise, the inputs to the policy will be inconsistent, making learning difficult if not impossible. A highly related issue arises in distributed control of index-free coordinating robots, e.g., to maintain a defined formation (Kloder & Hutchinson, 2006; Kingston & Egerstedt, 2010).\nCoordinated Policy Learning. We formulate the indexing mechanism as an assignment functionA maps the unstructured set U and some probabilistic structured model p to an indexed set of trajectory A rearranged from U , i.e.,\nA : tU1, .., UKu ˆ q ÞÑ rA1, .., AKs ,\nwhere the set tA1, .., AKu ” tU1, .., UKu. We view q as a latent variable model that infers the role assignments for each set of demonstrations. Thus, q drives the indexing mechanismA so that state vectors can be consistently constructed to facilitate optimizing for the imitation loss.\nNote that roles may change across within a demonstration, causing potential mis-alignment of expert demonstration to policy mapping. To resolve this confusion, we employ the well-known principle of maximum entropy (Jaynes, 1957), which is equivalent to regularizing the imitation loss function with some low entropy penalty (Grandvalet et al.,\nall roles are occupied across all execution sequences.\n2004; Dudik et al., 2004), yielding our overall objective:\nmin π1,..,πK ,A\nK ÿ k“1 Esk„dπk r`pπkpskqq|A,Ds´λHpA|Dq (1)\nwhere both imitation loss and entropy are measured with respect to the state distribution induced by the policies, and D is training data."

      "text" : "Optimizing (1) is challenging for two reasons. First, beyond the challenges inherited from single-agent settings, multi-agent imitation learning must account for multiple simultaneously learning agents, which is known to cause non-stationarity for multi-agent reinforcement learning (Busoniu et al., 2008). Second, the latent role assignment model, which forms the basis for coordination, depends on the actions of the learning policies, which in turn depend on the structured role assignment.\nWe propose an alternating optimization approach to solving (1), summarized in Figure 2. The main idea is to integrate imitation learning with unsupervised structure learning by taking turns to (i) optimize for imitation policies while fixing a structured model (minimizing imitation loss), and (ii) re-train the latent structure model and reassign roles while fixing the learning policies (maximizing role assignment entropy). The alternating nature allows us to circumvent the circular dependency between policy learning and latent structure learning.

Other variants of exist although we do not discuss them here.\nThe intuition behind the iterative reduction approach is to prevent a mismatch in training and prediction distributions due to sequential cascading errors (also called covariateshift). The main idea is to use learning policy’s own prediction in the construction of subsequent states, thus simulating the test-time performance during training. This mechanism enables the agent to learn a policy that is robust to its own mistakes. Reduction-based methods also accommodate any black-box supervised training subroutine. We focus on using expressive function classes such as Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) as the policy class.2\nAlgorithm 2 outlines the Learn procedure for stable multi-agent imitation learning. Assume we are given consistently indexed demonstrations A “ rA1, . . . , AKs, where each Ak “ tat,kuTt“1 corresponds action of policy πk at time t. Let the corresponding expert action be a˚t,k. To lighten the notation, we denote the per-agent state vector by st,k “ ϕkprat,1, . . . , at,k, . . . , at,K , ctsq3\nAlgorithm 2 employs a roll-out horizon j, which divides the entire trajectory into T {j segments. The following happens for every segment:\n• Iteratively performs roll-out at each time step i for all K policies (line 4) to obtain actions tpai,ku.\n• Each policy simultaneously updates its state psi,k, us2Note that conventional training of LSTMs does not address the cascading error problem. While LSTMs are very good at sequence-to-sequence prediction tasks, they cannot naturally deal with the drifting of input state distribution drift caused by action output feedback in dynamical systems (Bengio et al., 2015).\n3Generally, state vector st,k of policy πk at time t can be constructed as st,k “ rφkpra1:t,1, c1:tsq, . . . , φkpra1:t,K , c1:tsqs\ning the prediction from all other policies (line 5).\n• At the end of the current segment, all policies are updated using the error signal from the deviation between predicted pai,k versus expert action a˚i,k, for all i along the sub-segment (line 7).\nAfter policy updates, the training moves on to the next jlength sub-segment, using the freshly updated policies for subsequent roll-outs. The iteration proceeds until the end of the sequence is reached. In the outer loop the roll-out horizon j is incremented.\nTwo key insights behind our approach are:\n• In addition to the training-prediction mismatch issue in single-agent learning, each agent’s prediction must also be robust to imperfect predictions from other agents. This non-stationarity issue also arises in multiagent reinforcement learning (Busoniu et al., 2008) when agents learn simultaneously. We perform joint training by cross-updating each agent’s state using previous predictions from other agents.\n• Many single-agent imitation learning algorithms assume the presence of a dynamic oracle to provide onestep corrections a˚t along the roll-out trajectories. In practice, dynamic oracle feedback is very expensive to obtain and some recent work have attempted to relax this requirement (Le et al., 2016; Ho & Ermon, 2016). Without dynamic oracles, the rolled-out trajectory can deviate significantly from demonstrated trajectories when the prediction horizon j is large (« T ), leading to training instability. Thus j is gradually increased to allow for slowly learning to make good sequential predictions over longer horizons.\nFor efficient training, we focus on stochastic optimization, which can invoke base routine Train multiple times and thus naturally accommodates varying j. Note that the batch-training alternatives to Algorithm 2 can also employ similar training schemes, with similar theoretical guarantees lifted to the multi-agent case. The Appendix shows how to use DAgger (Ross et al., 2011) for Algorithm 2, which we used for our synthetic experiment."

      "heading" : "4.1. Predator-Prey Domain",
      "text" : "Setting. The predator-prey problem, also frequently called the Pursuit Domain (Benda, 1985), is a popular setting for multi-agent reinforcement learning. The traditional setup is with four predators and one prey, positioned on a grid board. At each time step, each agent has five moves:\nN,S,E,W or no move. The world is toroidal: the agents can move off one end of the board and come back on the other end. Agents make move simultaneously, but two agents cannot occupy the same position, and\ncollisions are avoided by assigning a random move priority to the agents at each time step. The predators can capture the prey only if the prey is surrounded by all four predators. The goal of the predators is to capture the prey as fast as possible, which necessarily requires coordination.\nData. The demonstration data is collected from 1000 game instances, where four experts, indexed 1 to 4, are prescribed the consistent and coordinated role as illustrated in the capture state of Figure 3. In other words, agent 1 would attempt to capture the prey on the right hand side, which allows for one fixed role for each expert throughout the game. However, the particular role assignment is hidden from the imitation learning task. Each expert is then exhaustively trained using Value Iteration (Sutton & Barto, 1998) in the reinforcement learning setting, with the reward of 1 if the agent is in the position next to the prey according to its defined role, and 0 otherwise. A separate set of 100 games was collected for evaluation. A game is terminated after 50 time steps if the predators fail to capture the prey. In the test set, the experts fail to capture the prey in 2% of the games, and on average take 18.3 steps to capture the prey.\nExperiment Setup. For this experiment, we use the batch version of Algorithm 1 (see appendix) to learn to imitate the experts using only demonstrations. Each policy is represented by a random forest of 20 trees, and were trained over 10 iterations. The expert correction for each rolled-out state is collected via Value Iteration. The experts thus act as dynamic oracles, which result in a multi-agent training setting analogous to DAgger (Ross et al., 2011). We compare two versions of multi-agent imitation learning:\n• Coordinated Training. We use our algorithm, with the latent structure model represented by a discrete Hidden Markov Model with binomial emission. We use Algorithm 4 to maximize the role consistency of the dynamic oracles across different games.\n• Unstructured Training. An arbitrary role is assigned to each dynamic oracle for each game, i.e., the agent index is meaningless.\nIn both versions, training was done using the same data aggregation scheme and batch training was conducted using the same random forests configuration.\nResults. Figure 4 compares the test performance of our method versus unstructured multi-agent imitation learning. We see that using a coordination mechanism results in substantially improved performance. Our method quickly approaches expert performance (average 22 steps with 8% failure rate in the last iteration), whereas unstructured multi-agent imitation learning performance did not improve beyond the first iteration (average 42 steps with 70% failure rate). Note that we even gave the unstructured baseline some advantage over our method, by forcing the prey to select the moves last after all predators make decisions (effectively making the prey slower). Without this advantage, the unstructured policies fail to capture the prey almost 100% of the time. Also, if the same restriction is applied to the policies obtained from our method, performance would be on par with the experts (100% success rate, with similar number of steps taken)."

RoboCup, the robotic and simulation soccer platform, is perhaps the most popular testbed for multi-agent reinforcement learning research to date (Stone, 2016). The success of MARL has been limited, however, due to the extremely high dimensionality of the problem. In this experiment, we aim to learn multi-agent policies for team soccer defense, based on tracking data from real-life professional soccer (Bialkowski et al., 2014). Unlike predatorprey, states and actions are continuous, the game sequence can be much longer, and the roles are not well-defined. The same player may also switch roles between sequences, and two players can swap roles within a sequence.\nData. We use the tracking data from 45 games of real professional soccer from a recent European league. The\ndata was chunked into sequences with one team attacking and the other defending. Our goal is to learn up to 10 policies for team defense (11 players per team, minus the goal keeper). The training data consists of 7500 sets of trajectories A “ tA1, . . . , A10u and contexts C, where Ak “ tat,kuTt“1 is the sequence of positions of one defensive player, and C is the context sequence consisting of opponents and the ball. Overall, there are about 1.3 million frames at 10 frames per second. The average sequence length is 176 steps, and the maximum is 1480.\nExperiment Setup. Each policy is represented by a recurrent neural network structure (LSTM), with two hidden layers of 512 units each. As LSTMs generally require fixed-length input sequences, we further chunk each trajectory into sub-sequences of length 50, with overlapping window of 25 time steps. The joint multi-agent imitation learning procedure follows Algorithm 2 closely. In this setup, without access to dynamic oracles for imitation learning in the style of SEARN (Daumé III et al., 2009) and DAgger (Ross et al., 2011), we gradually increase the horizon of the rolled-out trajectories from 1 to 10 steps lookahead. Empirically, this has the effect of stabilizing the policy networks early in training, and limits the cascading errors caused by rolling-out to longer horizons.\nThe structured model component is learned via stochastic variational inference on a continuous Hidden Markov Model, where the per-state emission distribution is a mixture of Gaussians. Training and inference operate on the same mini-batches used for joint policy learning.\nWe compare against two variations. The first is employs centralized policy that aggregates the state vectors of all decentralized learner and produces the actions for all players, i.e., a multi-task policy. The centralized approach generally requires more model parameters, but is potentially much more accurate. The second variation is to not employ joint multi-agent training: we modify Algorithm 2 to not cross-update states between agents, and each role is trained conditioned on the ground truth of the other agents.\nResults. Figure 5 shows the results. We see that our coordinated learning approach substantially outperforms conventional imitation learning without structured coordination. The imitation loss measures average distance of roll-outs and ground truth in meters (note the typical size of soccer field is 110 ˆ 70 meters). As expected, average loss increases with longer sequences, due to cascading errors. However, this error scales sub-linearly with the length of the horizon, even though the policies were trained on sequences of length 50. Note also that the performance difference between decentralized and centralized policies is insignificant compared to the gap between coordinated and unstructured policies, further highlighting the benefits of structured coordination in multi-agent settings. The loss of a single network, non-joint training scheme is very large and thus omitted from Figure 5 (see the appendix).\nVisualizations. Imitation loss, of course, is not a full reflection of the quality of the learned policies. Unlike predator-prey, the long-term reward signal is not available, so we rely on visual inspection as part of evaluation. Figure 6 overlays policy prediction on top of the actual game sequence from Figure 1. Additional test examples are included in our supplemental video. We note that learned policies are qualitatively similar to the ground truth demonstrations, and can be useful for applications such as counterfactual replay analysis (Le et al., 2017).\nFigure 7 displays the Gaussian components of the underlying HMM. The components correspond to the dominant modes of the roles assigned. Unlike the predator-prey domain, roles can be switched during a sequence of play. See the appendix for more details such as role swap frequency."

      "text" : "The problem of multi-agent imitation learning has not been widely considered, perhaps with the exception of (Chernova & Veloso, 2007) which focused on very different applications and technical challenges (i.e., learning a model\nof a joint task by collecting samples from direct interaction with teleoperating human teachers). The actual learning algorithm there requires the learner to collect enough data points from human teachers for confident classification of task. It is not clear how well the proposed method would translate to other domains.\nIndex-free policy learning is generally difficult for blackbox machine learning techniques. Some recent work has called attention to the importance of order to learning when input or output are sets (Vinyals et al., 2015), motivated by classic algorithmic and geometric problems such as learning to sort a set of numbers, or finding convex hull for a set of points, where no clear indexing mechanism exists. Other permutation invariant approaches include those for standard classification (Shivaswamy & Jebara, 2006)."

      "text" : "In principle, the training and inference of the latent structure model can accommodate different types of graphical models. However, the exact procedure varies depending on the graph structure. We rely on first-order Markov models to leverage well-studied inference techniques such as Viterbi. It would be interesting to find domains that can benefit from more general graphical models. Another possible direction is to develop fully end-to-end differentiable training methods that can accommodate our index-free policy learning formulation, especially deep learning-based method that could provide computational speed-up compared to traditional graphical model inference. One potential issue with the end-to-end approach is the need to depart from a learning-reductions style approach.\nAlthough we addressed learning from demonstrations in this paper, the proposed framework can also be employed for generative modeling, or more efficient structured exploration for reinforcement learning. Along that line, our proposed method could serve as a useful component of general reinforcement learning, especially in multi-agent settings where traditional exploration-based approaches such as Qlearning prove computationally intractable."

Unlike the predator-prey domain, however, the players are sometimes expected to switch and swap roles. Figure 8 displays the tendency that each learning policy k would takes on other roles outside of its dominant mode. Policies indexed 0´ 3 tend to stay most consistent with the prescribed latent roles. We observe that these also correspond to players with the least variance in their action trajectories. Imitation loss is generally higher for less consistent roles (e.g. policies indexed 8´9). Intuitively, entropy regularization encourages a decomposition of roles that result in learning policies as decoupled as possible, in order to minimize the imitation loss."

    "abstractText" : "We study the problem of imitation learning from demonstrations of multiple coordinating agents. One key challenge in this setting is that learning a good model of coordination can be difficult, since coordination is often implicit in the demonstrations and must be inferred as a latent variable. We propose a joint approach that simultaneously learns a latent coordination model along with the individual policies. In particular, our method integrates unsupervised structure learning with conventional imitation learning. We illustrate the power of our approach on a difficult problem of learning multiple policies for finegrained behavior modeling in team sports, where different players occupy different roles in the coordinated team strategy. We show that having a coordination model to infer the roles of players yields substantially improved imitation loss compared to conventional baselines.",
