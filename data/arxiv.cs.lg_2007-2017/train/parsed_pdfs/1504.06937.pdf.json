      "text" : "The contextual bandit problem [1, 2, 3] is an important extension of the classic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem [4], where the agent can observe a set of features, referred to as context, before making a decision. After the random arrival of a context, the agent chooses an action and receives a random reward with expectation depending on both the context and action. To maximize the total reward, the agent needs to make a careful tradeoff between taking the best action based on the historical performance (exploitation) and discovering the potentially better alternative actions under a given context (exploration). This model has attracted much attention as it fits the personalized service requirement in many applications such as clinical trials, online recommendation, and online hiring in crowdsourcing. Existing works try to reduce the regret of contextual bandits by leveraging the structure of the context-reward models such as linearity [5] or similarity [6], and more recent work [7] focuses on computationally efficient algorithms with minimum regret. For Markovian context arrivals, algorithms such as UCRL [8] for more general reinforcement learning problem can be used to achieve logarithmic regret.\nHowever, traditional contextual bandit models do not capture an important characteristic of real systems: in addition to time, there is usually a cost associated with the resource consumed by each action and the total cost is limited by a budget in many applications. Taking crowdsourcing [9] as an example, the budget constraint for a given set of tasks will limit the number of workers that an employer can hire. Another example is the clinical trials [10], where each treatment is usually costly and the budget of a trial is limited. Although budget constraints have been studied in non-contextual bandits where logarithmic or sublinear regret is achieved [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16], as we will see later, these results are inapplicable in the case with observable contexts.\nar X\niv :1\n50 4.\n06 93\n7v 3\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n9 O\nct 2\nIn this paper, we study contextual bandit problems with budget and time constraints, referred to as constrained contextual bandits, where the agent is given a budget B and a time-horizon T . In addition to a reward, a cost is incurred whenever an action is taken under a context. The bandit process ends when the agent runs out of either budget or time. The objective of the agent is to maximize the expected total reward subject to the budget and time constraints. We are interested in the regime where B and T grow towards infinity proportionally.\nThe above constrained contextual bandit problem can be viewed as a special case of Resourceful Contextual Bandits (RCB) [17]. In [17], RCB is studied under more general settings with possibly infinite contexts, random costs, and multiple budget constraints. A Mixture Elimination algorithm is proposed and shown to achieve O( √ T ) regret. However, the benchmark for the definition of regret in [17] is restricted to within a finite policy set. Moreover, the Mixture Elimination algorithm suffers high complexity and the design of computationally efficient algorithms for such general settings is still an open problem.\nTo tackle this problem, motivated by certain applications, we restrict the set of parameters in our model as follows: we assume finite discrete contexts, fixed costs, and a single budget constraint. This simplified model is justified in many scenarios such as clinical trials [10] and rate selection in wireless networks [18]. More importantly, these simplifications allow us to design easily-implementable algorithms that achieve O(log T ) regret (except for a set of parameters of zero Lebesgue measure, which we refer to as boundary cases), where the regret is defined more naturally as the performance gap between the proposed algorithm and the oracle, i.e., the optimal algorithm with known statistics.\nEven with simplified assumptions considered in this paper, the exploration-exploitation tradeoff is still challenging due to the budget and time constraints. The key challenge comes from the complexity of the oracle algorithm. With budget and time constraints, the oracle algorithm cannot simply take the action that maximizes the instantaneous reward. In contrast, it needs to balance between the instantaneous and long-term rewards based on the current context and the remaining budget. In principle, dynamic programming (DP) can be used to obtain this balance. However, using DP in our scenario incurs difficulties in both algorithm design and analysis: first, the implementation of DP is computationally complex due to the curse of dimensionality; second, it is difficult to obtain a benchmark for regret analysis, since the DP algorithm is implemented in a recursive manner and its expected total reward is hard to be expressed in a closed form; third, it is difficult to extend the DP algorithm to the case with unknown statistics, due to the difficulty of evaluating the impact of estimation errors on the performance of DP-type algorithms.\nTo address these difficulties, we first study approximations of the oracle algorithm when the system statistics are known. Our key idea is to approximate the oracle algorithm with linear programming (LP) that relaxes the hard budget constraint to an average budget constraint. When fixing the average budget constraint at B/T , this LP approximation provides an upper bound on the expected total reward, which serves as a good benchmark in regret analysis. Further, we propose an Adaptive Linear Programming (ALP) algorithm that adjusts the budget constraint to the average remaining budget bτ/τ , where τ is the remaining time and bτ is the remaining budget. Note that although the idea of approximating a DP problem with an LP problem has been widely studied in literature (e.g., [17, 19]), the design and analysis of ALP here is quite different. In particular, we show that ALP achieves O(1) regret, i.e., its expected total reward is within a constant independent of T from the optimum, except for certain boundaries. This ALP approximation and its regret analysis make an important step towards achieving logarithmic regret for constrained contextual bandits.\nUsing the insights from the case with known statistics, we study algorithms for constrained contextual bandits with unknown expected rewards. Complicated interactions between information acquisition and decision making arise in this case. Fortunately, the ALP algorithm has a highly desirable property that it only requires the ordering of the expected rewards and can tolerate certain estimation errors of system parameters. This property allows us to combine ALP with estimation methods that can efficiently provide a correct rank of the expected rewards. In this paper, we propose a UCB-ALP algorithm by combining ALP with the upper-confidence-bound (UCB) method [4]. We show that UCB-ALP achieves O(log T ) regret except for certain boundary cases, where its regret is O( √ T ). We note that UCB-type algorithms are proposed in [20] for non-contextual bandits with concave rewards and convex constraints, and further extended to linear contextual bandits. However, [20] focuses on static contexts1 and achieves O( √ T ) regret in our setting since it uses a fixed budget constraint in each round. In comparison, we consider random context arrivals and use an adaptive\n1After the online publication of our preliminary version, two recent papers [21, 22] extend their previous work [20] to the dynamic context case, where they focus on possibly infinite contexts and achieve O( √ T ) regret, and [21] restricts to a finite policy set as [17].\nbudget constraint to achieve logarithmic regret. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that shows how to achieve logarithmic regret in constrained contextual bandits. Moreover, the proposed UCB-ALP algorithm is quite computationally efficient and we believe these results shed light on addressing the open problem of general constrained contextual bandits.\nAlthough the intuition behind ALP and UCB-ALP is natural, the rigorous analysis of their regret is non-trivial since we need to consider many interacting factors such as action/context ranking errors, remaining budget fluctuation, and randomness of context arrival. We evaluate the impact of these factors using a series of novel techniques, e.g., the method of showing concentration properties under adaptive algorithms and the method of bounding estimation errors under random contexts. For the ease of exposition, we study the ALP and UCB-ALP algorithms in unit-cost systems with known context distribution in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. Then we discuss the generalization to systems with unknown context distribution in Section 5 and with heterogeneous costs in Section 6, which are much more challenging and the details can be found in the supplementary material."

At each round t, a context Xt arrives independently with identical distribution P{Xt = j} = πj , j ∈ X , and each action k ∈ A generates a non-negative reward Yk,t. Under a given context Xt = j, the reward Yk,t’s are independent random variables in [0, 1]. The conditional expectation E[Yk,t|Xt = j] = uj,k is unknown to the agent. Moreover, a cost is incurred if action k is taken under context j. To gain insight into constrained contextual bandits, we consider fixed and known costs in this paper, where the cost is cj,k > 0 when action k is taken under context j. Similar to traditional contextual bandits, the contextXt is observable at the beginning of round t, while only the reward of the action taken by the agent is revealed at the end of round t.\nAt the beginning of round t, the agent observes the context Xt and takes an action At from {0}∪A, where “0” represents a dummy action that the agent skips the current context. Let Yt and Zt be the reward and cost for the agent in round t, respectively. If the agent takes an action At = k > 0, then the reward is Yt = Yk,t and the cost is Zt = cXt,k. Otherwise, if the agent takes the dummy action At = 0, neither reward nor cost is incurred, i.e., Yt = 0 and Zt = 0. In this paper, we focus on contextual bandits with a known time-horizon T and limited budget B. The bandit process ends when the agent runs out of the budget or at the end of time T .\nA contextual bandit algorithm Γ is a function that maps the historical observations Ht−1 = (X1, A1, Y1; X2, A2, Y2; . . . ;Xt−1, At−1, Yt−1) and the current context Xt to an action At ∈ {0} ∪ A.

Note that we consider a “hard” budget constraint, i.e., the total costs should not be greater than B under any realization.\nWe measure the performance of the algorithm Γ by comparing it with the oracle, which is the optimal algorithm with known statistics, including the knowledge of πj’s, uj,k’s, and cj,k’s. Let U∗(T,B) be the expected total reward obtained by the oracle algorithm. Then, the regret of the algorithm Γ is defined as\nRΓ(T,B) = U ∗(T,B)− UΓ(T,B).\nThe objective of the algorithm is then to minimize the regret. We are interested in the asymptotic regime where the time-horizon T and the budget B grow to infinity proportionally, i.e., with a fixed ratio ρ = B/T ."

This will provide a benchmark for the regret analysis and insights into the design of constrained contextual bandit algorithms.\nAs a starting point, we focus on unit-cost systems, i.e., cj,k = 1 for each j and k, from Section 3 to Section 5, which will be relaxed in Section 6. In unit-cost systems, the quality of action k under context j is fully captured by its expected reward uj,k. Let u∗j be the highest expected reward under context j, and k∗j be the best action for context j, i.e., u ∗ j = maxk∈A uj,k and k ∗ j = arg maxk∈A uj,k. For ease of exposition, we assume that the best action under each context is unique, i.e., uj,k < u∗j for all j and k 6= k∗j . Similarly, we also assume u∗1 > u∗2 > . . . > u∗J for simplicity.\nWith the knowledge of uj,k’s, the agent knows the best action k∗j and its expected reward u ∗ j under any context j. In each round t, the task of the oracle is deciding whether to take action k∗Xt or not depending on the remaining time τ = T − t+ 1 and the remaining budget bτ . The special case of two-context systems (J = 2) is trivial, where the agent just needs to procrastinate for the better context (see Appendix D of the supplementary material). When considering more general cases with J > 2, however, it is computationally intractable to exactly characterize the oracle solution. Therefore, we resort to approximations based on linear programming (LP)."

We propose an Adaptive Linear Programming (ALP) algorithm that adjusts the threshold and randomization probability according to the instantaneous value of bτ/τ .\nSpecifically, when the remaining time is τ and the remaining budget is bτ = b, we consider an LP problem LPτ,b which is the same as LPT,B except that B/T in Eq. (2) is replaced with b/τ . Then, the optimal solution for LPτ,b can be obtained by replacing ρ in Eqs. (3), (4), and (5) with b/τ . The ALP algorithm then makes decisions based on this optimal solution.\nALP Algorithm: At each round twith remaining budget bτ = b, obtain pj(b/τ)’s by solvingLPτ,b; take action At = k∗Xt with probability pXt(b/τ), and At = 0 with probability 1− pXt(b/τ).\nThe above ALP algorithm only requires the ordering of the expected rewards instead of their accurate values. This highly desirable feature allows us to combine ALP with classic MAB algorithms such as UCB [4] for the case without knowledge of expected rewards. Moreover, this simple ALP algorithm achieves very good performance within a constant distance from the optimum, i.e., O(1) regret, except for certain boundary cases. Specifically, for 1 ≤ j ≤ J , let qj be the cumulative probability defined as qj = ∑j j′=1 πj′ with the convention that q0 = 0. The following theorem states the near optimality of ALP. Theorem 1. Given any fixed ρ ∈ (0, 1), the regret of ALP satisfies: 1) (Non-boundary cases) if ρ 6= qj for any j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , J − 1}, then RALP(T,B) ≤ u ∗ 1−u ∗ J\n1−e−2δ2 ,\nwhere δ = min{ρ− qj̃(ρ), qj̃(ρ)+1 − ρ}. 2) (Boundary cases) if ρ = qj for some j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , J − 1}, then RALP(T,B) ≤ Θ(o) √ T +\nu∗1−u ∗ J\n1−e−2(δ′)2 , where Θ(o) = 2(u∗1 − u∗J) √ ρ(1− ρ) and δ′ = min{ρ− qj̃(ρ)−1, qj̃(ρ)+1 − ρ}.\nTheorem 1 shows that ALP achieves O(1) regret except for certain boundary cases, where it still achieves O( √ T ) regret. This implies that the regret due to the linear relaxation is negligible in most cases. Thus, when the expected rewards are unknown, we can achieve low regret, e.g., logarithmic regret, by combining ALP with appropriate information-acquisition mechanisms.\nSketch of Proof: Although the ALP algorithm seems fairly intuitive, its regret analysis is nontrivial. The key to the proof is to analyze the evolution of the remaining budget bτ by mapping ALP to “sampling without replacement”. Specifically, from Eq. (4), we can verify that when the remaining time is τ and the remaining budget is bτ = b, the system consumes one unit of budget with probability b/τ , and consumes nothing with probability 1 − b/τ . When considering the remaining budget, the ALP algorithm can be viewed as “sampling without replacement”. Thus, we can show that bτ follows the hypergeometric distribution [23] and has the following properties: Lemma 2. Under the ALP algorithm, the remaining budget bτ satisfies: 1) The expectation and variance of bτ are E[bτ ] = ρτ and Var(bτ ) = T−τT−1 τρ(1− ρ), respectively. 2) For any positive number δ satisfying 0 < δ < min{ρ, 1− ρ}, the tail distribution of bτ satisfies\nP{bτ < (ρ− δ)τ} ≤ e−2δ 2τ and P{bτ > (ρ+ δ)τ} ≤ e−2δ 2τ .\nThen, we prove Theorem 1 based on Lemma 2. Note that the expected total reward under ALP is UALP(T,B) = E [∑T τ=1 v(bτ/τ) ] , where v(·) is defined in (5) and the expectation is taken over the distribution of bτ . For the non-boundary cases, the single-round expected reward satisfies E[v(bτ/τ)] = v(ρ) if the threshold j̃(bτ/τ) = j̃(ρ) for all possible bτ ’s. The regret then is bounded by a constant because the probability of the event j̃(bτ/τ) 6= j̃(ρ) decays exponentially due to the concentration property of bτ . For the boundary cases, we show the conclusion by relating the regret with the variance of bτ . Please refer to Appendix B of the supplementary material for details."

Specific representations of the regret bounds and proof details can be found in the supplementary material.\nRecall that qj = ∑j j′=1 πj′ (1 ≤ j ≤ J) are the boundaries defined in Section 3. We show that as the budget B and the time-horizon T grow to infinity in proportion, the proposed UCB-ALP algorithm achieves logarithmic regret except for the boundary cases.\nTheorem 2. Given πj’s, uj,k’s and a fixed ρ ∈ (0, 1), the regret of UCB-ALP satisfies: 1) (Non-boundary cases) if ρ 6= qj for any j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , J − 1}, then the regret of UCB-ALP is RUCB−ALP(T,B) = O ( JK log T ) . 2) (Boundary cases) if ρ = qj for some j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , J − 1}, then the regret of UCB-ALP is RUCB−ALP(T,B) = O (√ T + JK log T ) .\nTheorem 2 differs from Theorem 1 by an additional termO(JK log T ). This term results from using UCB to learn the ordering of expected rewards. Under UCB, each of the JK content-action pairs should be executed roughly O(log T ) times to obtain the correct ordering. For the non-boundary cases, UCB-ALP is order-optimal because obtaining the correct action ranking under each context will result in O(log T ) regret [26]. Note that our results do not contradict the lower bound in [17] because we consider discrete contexts and actions, and focus on instance-dependent regret. For the boundary cases, we keep both the √ T and log T terms because the constant in the log T term is typically much larger than that in the √ T term. Therefore, the log T term may dominate the regret particularly when the number of context-action pairs is large for medium T . It is still an open problem if one can achieve regret lower than O( √ T ) in these cases.\nSketch of Proof: We bound the regret of UCB-ALP by comparing its performance with the benchmark Û(T,B). The analysis of this bound is challenging due to the close interactions among different sources of regret and the randomness of context arrivals. We first partition the regret according to the sources and then bound each part of regret, respectively.\nStep 1: Partition the regret. By analyzing the implementation of UCB-ALP, we show that its regret is bounded as\nRUCB−ALP(T,B) ≤ R(a)UCB−ALP(T,B) +R (c) UCB−ALP(T,B),\nwhere the first part R(a)UCB−ALP(T,B) = ∑J j=1 ∑ k 6=k∗j (u∗j − uj,k)E[Cj,k(T )] is the regret from\naction ranking errors within a context, and the second part R(c)UCB−ALP(T,B) = ∑T τ=1 E [ v(ρ) −∑J\nj=1 p̂j(bτ/τ)πju ∗ j ] is the regret from the fluctuations of bτ and context ranking errors.\nStep 2: Bound each part of regret. For the first part, we can show that R(a)UCB−ALP(T,B) = O(log T ) using similar techniques for traditional UCB methods [25]. The major challenge of regret analysis for UCB-ALP then lies in the evaluation of the second part R(c)UCB−ALP(T,B).\nWe first verify that the evolution of bτ under UCB-ALP is similar to that under ALP and Lemma 2 still holds under UCB-ALP. With respect to context ranking errors, we note that unlike classic UCB methods, not all context ranking errors contribute to the regret due to the threshold structure of ALP. Therefore, we carefully categorize the context ranking results based on their contributions. We briefly discuss the analysis for the non-boundary cases here. Recall that j̃(ρ) is the threshold for the static LP problem LPT,B . We define the following events that capture all possible ranking results based on UCBs:\nErank,0(t) = { ∀j ≤ j̃(ρ), û∗j (t) > û∗j̃(ρ)+1(t);∀j > j̃(ρ) + 1, û ∗ j (t) < û ∗ j̃(ρ)+1 (t) } ,\nErank,1(t) = { ∃j ≤ j̃(ρ), û∗j (t) ≤ û∗j̃(ρ)+1(t);∀j > j̃(ρ) + 1, û ∗ j (t) < û ∗ j̃(ρ)+1 (t) } ,\nErank,2(t) = { ∃j > j̃(ρ) + 1, û∗j (t) ≥ û∗j̃(ρ)+1(t) } .\nThe first event Erank,0(t) indicates a roughly correct context ranking, because under Erank,0(t) UCBALP obtains a correct solution for LPτ,bτ if bτ/τ ∈ [qj̃(ρ), qj̃(ρ)+1]. The last two events Erank,s(t), s = 1, 2, represent two types of context ranking errors: Erank,1(t) corresponds to “certain contexts with above-threshold reward having lower UCB”, while Erank,2(t) corresponds to “certain contexts with below-threshold reward having higher UCB”. Let T (s) = ∑T t=1 1(Erank,s(t)) for 0 ≤ s ≤ 2. We can show that the expected number of context ranking errors satisfies E[T (s)] = O(JK log T ), s = 1, 2, implying that R(c)UCB−ALP(T,B) = O(JK log T ). Summarizing the two parts, we have RUCB−ALP(T,B) = O(JK log T ) for the non-boundary cases. The regret for the boundary cases can be bounded using similar arguments.\nKey Insights from UCB-ALP: Constrained contextual bandits involve complicated interactions between information acquisition and decision making. UCB-ALP alleviates these interactions by\napproximating the oracle with ALP for decision making. This approximation achieves near-optimal performance while tolerating certain estimation errors of system statistics, and thus enables the combination with estimation methods such as UCB in unknown statistics cases. Moreover, the adaptation property of UCB-ALP guarantees the concentration property of the system status, e.g., bτ/τ . This allows us to separately study the impact of action or context ranking errors and conduct rigorous analysis of regret. These insights can be applied in algorithm design and analysis for constrained contextual bandits under more general settings."

Using the method of bounded averaged differences based on coupling argument, we obtain the concentration property of the average remaining budget bτ/τ , and show that this truncated EALP algorithm achieves O(1) regret except for the boundary cases. The regret of the corresponding UCB-based version can by bounded similarly as UCB-ALP."

      "text" : "The insights obtained from unit-cost systems can also be used to design algorithms for heterogeneous cost systems where the cost cj,k depends on j and k. We generalize the ALP algorithm to approximate the oracle, and adjust it to the case with unknown expected rewards. For simplicity, we assume the context distribution is known here, while the empirical estimate can be used to replace the actual context distribution if it is unknown, as discussed in the previous section.\nWith heterogeneous costs, the quality of an action k under a context j is roughly captured by its normalized expected reward, defined as ηj,k = uj,k/cj,k. However, the agent cannot only focus on the “best” action, i.e., k∗j = arg maxk∈A ηj,k, for context j. This is because there may exist another action k′ such that ηj,k′ < ηj,k∗j , but uj,k′ > uj,k∗j (and of course, cj,k′ > cj,k∗j ). If the budget allocated to context j is sufficient, then the agent may take action k′ to maximize the expected reward. Therefore, to approximate the oracle, the ALP algorithm in this case needs to solve an LP problem accounting for all context-action pairs with an additional constraint that only one action can be taken under each context. By investigating the structure of ALP in this case and the concentration of the remaining budget, we show that ALP achieves O(1) regret in non-boundary cases, and O( √ T ) regret in boundary cases. Then, an -First ALP algorithm is proposed for the unknown statistics case where an exploration stage is implemented first and then an exploitation stage is implemented according to ALP."

Under simplified yet practical assumptions, we show that the close interactions between the information acquisition and decision making in constrained contextual bandits can be decoupled by adaptive linear relaxation. When the system statistics are known, the ALP approximation achieves near-optimal performance, while tolerating certain estimation errors of system parameters. When the expected rewards are unknown, the proposed UCB-ALP algorithm leverages the advantages of ALP and UCB, and achieves O(log T ) regret except for certain boundary cases, where it achieves O( √ T ) regret. Our study provides an efficient approach of dealing with the challenges introduced by budget constraints and could potentially be extended to more general constrained contextual bandits.\nAcknowledgements: This research was supported in part by NSF Grants CCF-1423542, CNS1457060, CNS-1547461, and AFOSR MURI Grant FA 9550-10-1-0573."

Thus, when focusing on the remaining budget, we can view the ALP algorithm as a sampling problem without replacement as follows.\nMapping ALP to Sampling without Replacement: Consider T balls in an urn, including B black balls and T − B white balls. Running ALP is equivalent to randomly drawing a ball without replacement. Taking an action At > 0 is equivalent to drawing a black ball and taking the dummy action At = 0 is equivalent to drawing a white ball. The event that bτ = b is equivalent to the event that the agent draws T − τ balls, and the number of drawn black balls is B − b.

Unlike traditional MABs, however, the context-action pair with the higher UCB in a round might not be executable, as the context of that round could be different. Fortunately, the following lemma will show that if the condition that causes the an context-action pair to be executed with a positive probability appears many times, the context-action pair will indeed be executed proportionally with high probability.\nLemma 5.

We only prove the conclusion for the case of s = 1 as the other case can be analyzed similarly. From Algorithm 1, we can see that the evolution of the remaining budget also affects the execution of the UCB-ALP algorithm. Under the assumption of known context distribution, it can be verified that Lemma 2 holds under UCB-ALP, i.e., the remaining budget bτ follows the hypergeometric distribution and has the properties described in Lemma 2. We define an event Ebudget,0(t) as follows,\nEbudget,0(t) = {(ρ− δ)τ ≤ bτ ≤ (ρ+ δ)τ},\nwhere δ is given by\nδ = 1\n2 min{ρ− qj̃(ρ), qj̃(ρ)+1 − ρ}.\nAccording to Lemma 2, we have\nP{qEbudget,0(t)} = P{bτ < (ρ− δ)τ}+ P{bτ > (ρ+ δ)τ} ≤ 2e−2δ 2(T−t+1).\nBack to the ranking event Erank,1(t), we have\nP(Erank,1(t)) ≤ P(qEbudget,0(t)) + P(Erank,1(t) ∩ Ebudget,0(t)).\nNote that the event Erank,1(t) can be divided as follow: Erank,1(t) ⊆ ⋃\n1≤j≤j̃(ρ),1≤k≤K\nE(j,k)rank,1(t),\nwhere for 1 ≤ j ≤ j̃(ρ) and 1 ≤ k ≤ K,\nE(j,k)rank,1(t) = { ∀j′ > j̃(ρ) + 1, û∗j′(t) < û∗j̃(ρ)+1(t); û ∗ j (t) ≤ û∗j̃(ρ)+1(t), k ∗ j (t) = k } .\nThus,\nE[T (1)] = T∑ t=1 P(Erank,1(t)) ≤ 2e−2δ 2 1− e−2δ2 + j̃(ρ)∑ j=1 K∑ k=1 E[N (1)j,k (T )],\n(31)\nwhere for 1 ≤ j ≤ j̃(ρ) and 1 ≤ k ≤ K,\nN (1) j,k (t) = t∑ t′=1 1(E(j,k)rank,1(t ′), Ebudget,0(t′)).\nLet ˆ̀(j1)j2,k = 2 log T\ngj2 (1− ) 2(∆ (j1) j2,k )2\n, where gj2 = min{πj2 , δ} and ∈ (0, 1). Similar to the analysis of\nUCB in [4], we have\nE[N (1)j,k (T )] ≤ ˆ̀ (j) j̃(ρ)−1,k + T∑ t=1 P { E(j,k)rank,1(t), Ebudget,0(t), N (1) j,k (t− 1) ≥ ˆ̀ (j) j̃(ρ)+1,k } . (32)\nFor each t in the second term, we have\nP{E(j,k)rank,1(t), Ebudget,0(t), N (1) j,k (t− 1) ≥ ˆ̀ (j) j̃(ρ)+1,k }\n≤ P{E(j,k)rank,1(t), Ebudget,0(t)|Cj̃(ρ)+1,k(t− 1) ≥ gj̃(ρ)+1(1− )ˆ̀ (j) j̃(ρ)+1,k }\n+ P{Cj̃(ρ)+1,k(t− 1) < gj̃(ρ)+1(1− )ˆ̀ (j) j̃(ρ)+1,k , N (1) j,k (t− 1) ≥ ˆ̀ (j) j̃(ρ)+1,k },\nwhere Cj̃(ρ)+1,k(t) = ∑t t′=1 1(Xt′ = j̃(ρ) + 1, At′ = k) is the number that the context-action pair\n(j̃(ρ) + 1, k) has been executed up to round t.\nFor the first term, we note that the event {E(j,k)rank,1(t), Ebudget,0(t)} implies that ûj,k∗j (t) ≤ ûj̃(ρ)+1,k(t). Because uj,k∗j > uj̃(ρ)+1,k for all j ≤ j̃(ρ) and k, according to Lemma 3, we have\nP{E(j,k)rank,1(t), Ebudget,0(t)|Cj̃(ρ)+1,k(t− 1) ≥ gj̃(ρ)+1(1− )ˆ̀ (j) j̃(ρ)+1,k }\n≤ P{ûj,k∗j (t) ≤ ûj̃(ρ)+1,k(t)|Cj̃(ρ)+1,k(t− 1) ≥ gj̃(ρ)+1(1− )ˆ̀ (j) j̃(ρ)+1,k }\n≤ 2t−1. (33)\nFor the second term, we note that since context j̃(ρ)+1 arrives with probability πj̃(ρ)+1 independent of the observations, we have\nP { Xt = j̃(ρ) + 1, At = k|E(j,k)rank,1(t), Ebudget,0(t) } = min{δ, πj̃(ρ)+1} = gj̃(ρ)+1.\nThus, according to Lemma 5, we have\nP{Cj̃(ρ)+1,k(t− 1) < gj̃(ρ)+1(1− )ˆ̀ (j) j̃(ρ)+1,k , N (1) j,k (t− 1) ≥ ˆ̀ (j) j̃(ρ)+1,k } ≤ e−2 2 ˆ̀(j) j̃(ρ)+1,k ≤ T−4.\n(34)\nSubstituting Eqs. (33) and (34) into Eq. (32), we have\nE[N (1)j,k (T )] ≤ ˆ̀ (j) j̃(ρ)+1,k + T∑ t=1 (2t−1 + T−4) ≤ ˆ̀(j) j̃(ρ)+1,k + 2 log T + 2 + T−3. (35)\nSubstituting Eq. (35) to Eq. (31) and letting = 2/3 in ˆ̀(j) j̃(ρ)−1,k, we have\nE[T (1)] ≤ 2e −2δ2\n1− e−2δ2 + j̃(ρ)∑ j=1 K∑ k=1 ˆ̀(j) j̃(ρ)+1,k + 2Kj̃(ρ) log T +O(1)\n≤ j̃(ρ)∑ j=1 K∑ k=1\n27 log T\n2gj̃(ρ)+1(∆ (j) j̃(ρ)+1,k )2\n+ 2Kj̃(ρ) log T +O(1). (36)\nCombining Lemma 4, Lemma 6, and Eq. (28), we have\nlim sup T→∞\nRUCB−ALP(T,B)\nlog T ≤ Θ(a) + Θ(c)nb ,\nwhere\nΘ(a) = J∑ j=1 ∑ k 6=k∗j ( 2 ∆ (j) j,k + 2∆ (j) j,k ) ,\nΘ (c) nb = [ū ∗ + v(ρ)] { j̃(ρ)∑ j=1 K∑ k=1\n27\n2gj̃(ρ)+1[∆ (j) j̃(ρ)+1,k ]2\n+ J∑ j=j̃(ρ)+2 K∑ k=1\n27\n2gj [∆ (j̃(ρ)+1) j,k ]\n2 + 2KJ\n} .\nThis completes the proof of Part 1 in Theorem 2.\nNext, we discuss the bound of R(c)UCB−ALP(T,B) for the boundary cases. The analysis is similar to the non-boundary cases with slight modification on the threshold.\nWe note that fundamentally, the context j̃(ρ) + 1 for ρ 6= qj and the context j̃(ρ) for ρ = qj are both the minimum context with positive probability in the static LP problem. Thus, we can define the context ranking events Erank,s(t) (0 ≤ s ≤ 2) similar to the analysis of Part 1, with j̃(ρ) + 1 replaced by j̃(ρ). Then, we have\nR (c) UCB−ALP(T,B) = T∑ τ=1 E[∆vτ ],\nwhere\nE[∆vτ ] = 2∑ s=0 E[∆vτ , Erank,s(T − τ + 1)].\nFor the case of s = 0, E[∆vτ , Erank,0(T − τ + 1)] = B∑ b=0 E[∆vτ |bτ = b, Erank,0(T − τ + 1)]P{bτ = b, Erank,0(T − τ + 1)}.\nWhen b/τ ∈ [ρ − δ, ρ + δ] and Erank,0(T − τ + 1) occurs, we have ∆vτ ≤ (u∗1 − u∗J)|ρ − b/τ |. Moreover, ∆vτ ≤ v(ρ) under any condition. Thus,\nE[∆vτ , Erank,0(T − τ + 1)] ≤ u∗1E[|bτ/τ − ρ|] + v(ρ) ∑\nb/∈[ρ−δ,ρ+δ]\nP{bτ = b}\n≤ u∗1\n√ Var(bτ )\nτ2 + 2v(ρ)e−2δ 2τ .\nFor the other cases of s = 1, 2, we have E[∆vτ , Erank,s(T − τ + 1)] ≤ v(ρ)P{Erank,s(T − τ + 1)}.\nOn the other hand, we extend Lemma 6 to the boundary cases:\nlim sup T→∞ E[T (1)] log T ≤ ∑ j<j̃(ρ) K∑ k=1\n27\n2gj̃(ρ)[∆ (j) j̃(ρ),k ]2\n+ 2K[j̃(ρ)− 1],\nlim sup T→∞ E[T (2)] log T\n≤ ∑\nj≥j̃(ρ)+1\nK∑ k=1\n27\n2gj [∆ (j̃(ρ)) j,k ]\n2 + 2K[J − j̃(ρ)],\nwhere\ngj = min { πj , 1\n2 (ρ− qj̃(ρ)−1),\n1 2 (qj̃(ρ)+1 − ρ)\n} .\nConsequently, we can bound R(c)UCB−ALP(T,B) by summing over the entire horizon and using the properties of T (1) and T (2). The conclusion of Part 2 of Theorem 2 then follows by adding the bound of R(a)UCB−ALP(T,B) and R (c) UCB−ALP(T,B)."

We show that the UCB-PB algorithm achieves logarithmic regret for any given ρ ∈ (0, 1). Theorem 3.

The proof of Theorem 3 is similar to that of Theorem 2, while the analysis on the error events is even simpler. Note that the regret is defined as the difference between the expected total rewards achieved by the UCB-PB algorithm and the oracle algorithm. For the oracle algorithm, let C∗j (t) = ∑t t′=1 1{Xt′ = j, At′ = k∗j } be the number of times that the context-action pair (j, k∗j )\nhas been executed up to round t. For the UCB-PB algorithm, Recall that Cj,k(t) = ∑t t′=1 1{Xt′ = j, At′ = kj} is the number of times that the context-action pair (j, k) has been executed up to round t, and let Cj(t) = ∑K k=1 Cj,k(t). Then the regret of UCB-PB can be expressed as\nRUCB-PB(T,B)\n= J∑ j=1 u∗jE[C∗j (T )]− J∑ j=1 K∑ k=1 uj,kE[Cj,k(T )]\n= J∑ j=1 K∑ k=1 ∆ (j) j,kE[Cj,k(T )] + J∑ j=1 u∗jE [ C∗j (T )− K∑ k=1 Cj,k(T ) ]\n= R (a) UCB-PB(T,B) +R (c) UCB-PB(T,B), (37)\nwhere R(a)UCB-PB(T,B) is the regret due to action-ranking errors, i.e.,\nR (a) UCB-PB(T,B) = J∑ j=1 ∑ k 6=k∗j ∆ (j) j,kE[Cj,k(T )],\nand R(c)UCB-PB(T,B) is the regret due to context-ranking errors, i.e.,\nR (c) UCB-PB(T,B) = J∑ j=1 u∗jE [ C∗j (T )− K∑ k=1 Cj,k(T ) ] = (u∗1 − u∗2)E [ C∗1 (T )− C1(T ) ] . (38)\nThe expression of R(c)UCB-PB(T,B) uses the fact that both the oracle algorithm and UCB-PB will exhaust their entire budget, i.e., ∑J j=1 C ∗ j (T ) = ∑J j=1 Cj(T ) = B.\nFor R(a)UCB-PB(T,B), we note that Lemma 4 also holds under UCB-PB, i.e.,\nR (a) UCB-PB(T,B) ≤ J∑ j=1 ∑ k 6=k∗j [( 2 ∆ (j) j,k + 2∆ (j) j,k ) log T + 2∆ (j) j,k ] . (39)\nNext, we show that R(c)UCB-PB(T,B) is also of order O(log T ). Let (X̂t, Ât) be the context-action pair that has the highest UCB in round t. Moreover, let Ĉj(t) be the number of events that context j has the maximum index up to round t, i.e., Ĉj(t) = ∑t t′=1 1(X̂t = j), and Ĉj,k(t) be the number of events that the context-action pair (j, k) has the highest UCB up to round t, i.e., Ĉj,k(t) =∑t t′=1 1(X̂t = j, Ât = k). We show that the UCB-PB algorithm mistakes the suboptimal context\nas the optimal context for at most O(log T ) times, i.e., E[Ĉ2(T )] = O(log T ), and then E [ C∗1 (T )−\nC1(T ) ] ≤ E[Ĉ2(T )] = O(log T ).\nSpecifically, consider the suboptimal context j = 2.

      "heading" : "E Constrained Contextual Bandits with Unknown Context Distribution",
      "text" : "In this section, we relax the assumption of known context distribution and study unit-cost systems with unknown context distribution. Since the arrival of contexts is independent of the actions taken by the agent. a natural idea is to implement the ALP or UCB-ALP algorithm based on the empirical distribution as follows:\nEALP and UCB-EALP Algorithms: the agent maintains the empirical distribution of the contexts, denoted by π̂t = (π̂1,t, π̂2,t, . . . , π̂J,t), where π̂j,t = 1t ∑t t′=1 1(Xt′ = j). In each round, the agent executes the ALP (when the expected rewards are known) or UCB-ALP (when the expected rewards are unknown) algorithms with the context distribution π in LPτ,b replaced by π̂t. These algorithms are referred to as Empirical ALP (EALP) and UCB-EALP, respectively.\nAs we can see from the numerical simulations in Appendix G, the above EALP and UCB-EALP algorithms have similar performance as ALP and UCB-ALP, respectively. However, the regret analysis for these algorithms is challenging because the empirical distribution introduces complex temporal dependency since the empirical distribution depends on the context arrivals in all the past rounds, which makes it difficult to analyze the evolution of the remaining budget. Thus, we focus on the non-boundary cases and consider truncated version of EALP and UCB-EALP. Specifically, we study algorithms that stop updating the empirical distribution from the T1-th (will be defined later) round and use the fixed estimate π̂T1 for the remaining rounds, which are referred to as EALP2 (as shown in Algorithm 3) and UCB-EALP2, respectively. We focus on the EALP2 algorithm for the case where the expected rewards are known, while the properties of UCB-EALP2 can be obtained by similar techniques in the analysis of UCB-ALP combined with the properties of EALP2.\nAlgorithm 3 EALP2 Input: Time horizon T , budget B, learning stage length T1, and expected rewards u∗j ’s; Init: τ = T ; b = B; π̂j,0 = 0, ∀j; for t = 1 to T do\nif t ≤ T1 then π̂j,t ← (t−1)π̂j,t−1+1(Xt=j)t , ∀j; end if if b > 0 then\nObtain the probabilities pj(b/τ)’s by solving LPτ,b with π replaced by π̂t. Take action k∗Xt with probability pXt(b/τ).\nend if end for\nNow we show that for a sufficiently large T and an appropriate chosen T1, the EALP2 algorithm achieves similar performance as ALP in the non-boundary cases. Let δ = min{qj̃(ρ)+1−ρ, ρ−qj̃(ρ)} be the gap between ρ and the boundaries. The following theorem shows that EALP2 achieves O(1) regret with appropriately chosen T and T1.\nTheorem 4. Given a fixed ρ ∈ (0, 1), ρ 6= qj , j = 1, 2, . . . , J − 1. If T1 = 16J2 log3 T/δ2 and T satisfies log3 T/T ≤ δ3/(64J2), then the regret of EALP2 satisfies REALP2(T,B) = O(1).\nNote that here we assume δ is known for the simplicity of presentation. When considering practical scenarios where δ is unknown, we can obtain a lower confidence bound of δ as follows. At round t, let q̂j,t = ∑j j′=1 π̂j,t be the empirical estimate of the cumulative probability. Further, let j̃ ′ t(ρ) =\nmax{j : q̂j,t ≤ ρ} be the threshold under the empirical estimate. Let δ̂t = min{q̂j̃′t(ρ)+1 − ρ, ρ − q̂j̃′t(ρ)} and δ̌t = 1 2 δ̂t. Then δ̌t is a lower confidence bound of δ with P{δ ≥ δ̌t} ≥ 1 − e −2δ̌2t t. We choose T1 which is the smallest t such that e−2δ̌ 2 t t ≤ 1T 2 and t ≥ 16J\n2 log3 T/δ̌2t . Then the following analysis holds, while the regret due to the event that δ ≥ δ̌t will be O(1). Moreover, such a t will appear with high probability after 64J2 log3 T/δ2 rounds for the non-boundary cases, and not appear with high probability for the boundary cases.\nSimilar to the non-boundary cases in Theorem 1, the key idea of proving Theorem 4 is to show that under EALP2, the average remaining budget bτ/τ will not cross the boundaries with high probability. To achieve this, we examine the expectation of bτ/τ and its concentration properties under EALP2.\nStep 1: Estimation error of π̂T1 . Let α = δ/(4J log T ). According to Hoeffding-Chernoff bound, we have\nP{|π̂j,T1 − πj | ≤ α,∀j} ≥ 1− 2J\nT 2 . (42)\nStep 2: Bound on the expectation of bτ/τ . Lemma 7. Assume |π̂j,T1 − πj | ≤ α for all j. Then, for all T1 ≤ t ≤ T , the expectation of the average remaining budget satisfies\n|E[bτ/τ ]− ρ| ≤ δ\n2 , (43)\nwhere τ = T − t+ 1.\nProof. First, we note that the average remaining budget bτ/τ is close to the initial value ρ at round T1, because we can verify that for all t ≤ T1,\nρ− δ 4 ≤ B − T1 T − T1 + 1 ≤ bτ τ ≤ B T − T1 + 1 ≤ ρ+ δ 4 . (44)\nNow we show by mathematical induction that, if |π̂j,T1 − πj | ≤ α for all j, then |E[bτ/τ ] − ρ| ≤ Jα ∑τ τ ′=T−T1+1 1 τ ′ + δ 4 for τ ≤ T − T1 + 1 (i.e., t ≥ T1).\nSpecifically, for t = T1, we have ∣∣E[ bT−T1+1T−T1+1 ]−ρ∣∣ ≤ δ4 according to Eq. (44). For any given t ≥ T1, we have τ = T − t+ 1, and E[bτ−1|bτ = b]\n= b− ( b/τ − ∑ j≤j̃(b/τ) π̂j,T1\nπ̂j̃(b/τ)+1,T1 πj̃(b/τ)+1 + ∑ j≤j̃(b/τ) πj\n)\n= b− b/τ + b/τ −\n∑ j≤j̃(b/τ) π̂j,T1\nπ̂j̃(b/τ)+1,T1 (π̂j̃(b/τ)+1,T1 − πj̃(b/τ)+1) + ∑ j≤j̃(b/τ) (π̂j,T1 − πj).\nNote that 0 < b/τ−\n∑ j≤j̃(b/τ) π̂j,T1\nπ̂j̃(b/τ)+1,T1 < 1. Thus, ∣∣E[bτ−1|bτ = b] − b(τ−1)τ ∣∣ ≤ Jα, implying that∣∣E[ bτ−1τ−1 |bτ = b]− bτ ∣∣ ≤ Jατ−1 . If ∣∣E[bτ/τ ]− ρ| ≤ Jα∑ττ ′=T−T1+1 1τ ′ + δ4 for 2 ≤ τ ≤ T −T1 + 1, then\n∣∣E[bτ−1/(τ − 1)]− ρ| ≤ Jα∑ττ ′=T−T1+1 1τ ′ + Jατ−1 + δ4 . The conclusion of Lemma 7 then follows because |E[bτ/τ ] − ρ| ≤ Jα ∑τ τ ′=T−T1+1 1 τ ′ + δ 4 ≤ Jα log T + δ4 ≤ δ 2 .\nStep 3: Concentration of bτ/τ . The next lemma shows the concentration of the average remaining budget bτ/τ . Lemma 8. Assume |π̂j,T1 − πj | ≤ α for all j. The average remaining budget bτ/τ in round t = T − τ + 1 satisfies\nP { |bτ τ − E[bτ τ ]| ≥ δ/4 } ≤ 2 exp ( − δ 2τ 32 ) . (45)\nTo show the concentration of bτ/τ , we first use the coupling argument to show the following lemma and then use the method of averaged bounded differences [23]. Lemma 9. Assume |π̂j,T1 − πj | ≤ α for all j. The remaining budget bτ in round t = T − τ + 1 satisfies∣∣E[bτ |Zt′−1, Zt′ = 1]− E[bτ |Zt′−1, Zt′ = 0]∣∣ ≤ 2( τ T − t′ )1−σ , T1 ≤ t′ < t. (46)\nwhere Zt′−1 = (Z1, Z2, . . . , Zt′−1) and σ = 1−minj πjπj+α .\nProof. We bound the difference by constructing a couplingM of the two conditional distributions (·|Zt′−1, Zt′ = 1) and (·|Zt′−1, Zt′ = 0). Let ζt′+1, ζt′+2, . . . , ζT−τ and ζ ′t′+1, ζ ′t′+2, . . . , ζ ′T−τ be the pair of random variables in the couplingM. We construct the coupling as follows:\nCoupling: We generate the value of ζt′′ ’s and ζ ′t′′ ’s sequentially. For each t′′ > t′, let b̃T−t′′+1 = B − 1 − ∑t′−1 s=1 Zs − ∑t′′−1 s=t′+1 ζs and b̃ ′ T−t′′+1 = B − ∑t′−1 s=1 Zs − ∑t′′−1 s=t′+1 ζ ′ s be the remaining budgets in round t′′ corresponding to the pair of random variables. For ζt′′ , We pick its value\nrandomly with distribution P{ζt′′ = 1} = h ( b̃T−t′′+1 T−t′′+1 ) and P{ζt′′ = 0} = 1 − h ( b̃T−t′′+1 T−t′′+1 ) , where h(ρ) is the probability that one unit of budget will be consumed under EALP2 when the average remaining budget is ρ, i.e.,\nh(ρ) = ρ−\n∑ j′≤j̃(ρ) π̂j,T1 π̂j̃(ρ)+1,T1 πj̃(ρ)+1 + ∑ j′≤j̃(ρ) πj . (47)\nFor ζ ′t′′ , we generate its value conditioned on ζt′′ . If b̃ ′ T−t′′+1 = b̃T−t′′+1, then ζ ′ t′′ = ζt′′ . If b̃′T−t′′+1 = b̃T−t′′+1 + 1, then\nP { ζ ′t′′ = ζt′′ |b̃′T−t′′+1 = b̃T−t′′+1 } = 1,\nP { ζ ′t′′ = 1|b̃′T−t′′+1 = b̃T−t′′+1 + 1, ζt′′ = 1 } = 1, P { ζ ′t′′ = 1|b̃′T−t′′+1 = b̃T−t′′+1 + 1, ζt′′ = 0 } = h ( b̃′ T−t′′+1 T−t′′+1 ) − h ( b̃T−t′′+1 T−t′′+1 ) 1− h ( b̃T−t′′+1 T−t′′+1\n) . Note that according to the above construction, b̃′T−t′′+1 − b̃T−t′′+1 could only be 0 or 1. We can verify that the marginals satisfy\n(ζt′′ , t ′′ > t′) ∼ (Zt′′ , t′′ > t′|Zt′−1, Zt′ = 1),\nand\n(ζ ′t′′ , t ′′ > t′) ∼ (Zt′′ , t′′ > t′|Zt′−1, Zt′ = 0).\nFrom the construction of the coupling, we know that b̃′τ − b̃τ = 1 if and only if ζt′′ = ζ ′t′′ for all t′ < t′′ ≤ T − τ . Thus, ∣∣E[bτ |Zt′−1, Zt′ = 1]− E[bτ |Zt′−1, Zt′ = 0]∣∣\n= P { ζt′′ = ζ ′ t′′ , t ′ < t′′ ≤ T − τ }\n= T−τ∏ t′′=t′+1 P { ζt′′ = ζ ′ t′′ |ζs = ζ ′s, t′ < s ≤ t′′ − 1 } .

The couplingM satisfies\nP { ζt′′ = ζ ′ t′′ |ζs = ζ ′s, t′ < s ≤ t′′ − 1 } ≤ 1− 1− σ\nT − t′′ + 1 ,\nwhere σ = 1−minj πjπj+α .\nProof. Conditioned on ζs = ζ ′s, t ′ < s ≤ t′′ − 1, we have b̃′T−t′′+1 = b̃T−t′′+1 + 1, and ζt′′ 6= ζ ′t′′ i.f.f. ζ ′t′′ = 0 and ζt′′ = 1. Thus,\nP { ζt′′ = ζ ′ t′′ |ζs = ζ ′s, t′ < s ≤ t′′ − 1 } = 1−\nh ( b̃′ T−t′′+1 T−t′′+1 ) − h ( b̃T−t′′+1 T−t′′+1 ) 1− h ( b̃T−t′′+1 T−t′′+1 ) [1− h( b̃T−t′′+1T − t′′ + 1) ]\n= 1− [ h ( b̃′T−t′′+1 T − t′′ + 1 ) − h ( b̃T−t′′+1 T − t′′ + 1 )] . (49)\nTo prove Lemma 10, it suffices to show that for any b and τ satisfying b ≤ τ −1, we have h ( b+1 τ ) −\nh ( b τ ) ≥ γ/τ , where γ = minj πjπj+α .\nSpecifically, from the definition of h(·) in Eq. (47), we know that if j̃ ( b+1 τ ) = j̃ ( b τ ) , we have\nh ( b+1 τ ) − h ( b τ ) = π j̃( b τ )\nπ̂ j̃( b τ ),T1\n· 1τ ≥ γ/τ .\nIf j̃ ( b+1 τ ) > j̃ ( b τ ) , we have bτ − ∑ j≤j̃( bτ ) π̂j,T1 < π̂j̃( bτ )+1,T1 and b+1τ − ∑ j≤j̃( b+1τ )\nπ̂j,T1 > 0. Therefore,\nh (b+ 1\nτ ) − h ( b τ ) =\nj̃( b+1τ )∑ j=j̃( bτ )+1 πj + b+1 τ −\n∑ j≤j̃( b+1τ ) π̂j,T1\nπ̂j̃( b+1τ )+1,T1 πj̃( b+1τ )+1\n− b τ −\n∑ j≤j̃( bτ ) π̂j,T1 π̂j̃( bτ )+1,T1 πj̃( bτ )+1\n= j̃( b+1τ )∑ j=j̃( bτ )+2 πj + πj̃( bτ )+1 π̂j̃( bτ )+1,T1 [ π̂j̃( bτ )+1,T1 − ( b τ − ∑ j≤j̃( bτ ) π̂j,T1 )] + πj̃( b+1τ )+1 π̂j̃( b+1τ )+1,T1 [ b+ 1 τ − ∑ j≤j̃( b+1τ ) π̂j,T1 ] ≥ j̃( b+1τ )∑\nj=j̃( bτ )+2\nπj π̂j,T1 π̂j,T1 + γ\n( 1\nτ − j̃( b+1τ )∑ j=j̃( bτ )+2 π̂j,T1 ) ≥ γ/τ. (50)\nUsing Lemma 10, we have∣∣E[bτ |Zt′−1, Zt′ = 1]− E[bτ |Zt′−1, Zt′ = 0]∣∣ ≤ T−τ∏ t′′=t′+1 ( 1− 1− σ T − t′′ + 1 )\n(a) =\nτ + σ T − t′ T−t′−τ−1∏\ns=1\n( 1 + σ\nτ + s ) (b) ≤ τ + σ T − t′ (T − t′ − 1 τ\n)σ ≤ 2\n( τ T − t′ )1−σ .\nEquality (a) is obtained by merging the numerator of each term with the denominator of the next term. Inequality (b) is true because σ < 1, and\nlog T−t′−τ−1∏ s=1 ( 1 + σ τ + s ) = T−t′−τ−1∑ s=1 log ( 1 + σ τ + s ) ≤ T−t′−τ−1∑ s=1 σ τ + s ≤ σ log (T − t′ − 1 τ ) .\nTo use the method of averaged bounded differences [23], we note that T−τ∑ t′=T1 [ 2 ( τ T − t′ )1−σ]2 ≤ 4τ2−2α · [ 1 τ1−2σ − 1 (T − T1 + 1)1−2σ ] ≤ 4τ. (51)\nThen, according to Corollary 5.1 in [23] and Lemma 9, we have\nP { |bτ − E[bτ ]| ≥ δτ/4 } ≤ 2 exp ( − 2(δτ/4) 2\n4τ\n) = 2 exp ( − δ 2τ\n32\n) .\nimplying Eq. (45) in Lemma 8.\nStep 4: Upper bound ofREALP2(T,B). Now we bound the regretREALP2(T,B) using the results obtained in the previous steps. We analyze the event of “boundary-crossing” in round t, denoted as Ecross,t, which is the event that j̃(bτ/τ) 6= j̃(ρ). The event of “boundary-crossing” may happen when the estimates of empirical distribution is inaccurate or the average remaining budget bτ/τ deviates far from ρ. We study the probability of Ecross,t for t ≤ T1 and t > T1, respectively.\nFor t ≤ T1, the average remaining budget satisfies ρ − δ/4 ≤ bτ/τ ≤ ρ + δ/4, as discussed in Step 2. The event Ecross,t may occur only when there is some j such that |π̂j,t − πj | ≥ δ/(4J). Thus,\nP{Ecross,t} ≤ P{∃j, |π̂j,t − πj | ≥ δ/(4J)} ≤ 2J exp(−δ2t/8J2), t ≤ T1. (52)\nFor t > T1, if the empirical distribution |π̂j,T1 − πj | ≤ α (< δ/(4J) for sufficiently large T ) for all j, then the average remaining budget satisfies P { | bττ − E[ bτ τ ]| ≥ 3δ/4 } ≤ 2 exp ( − δ 2τ 32 ) due to Lemma 7 and Lemma 8. Thus,\nP{Ecross,t} ≤ P{∃j, |π̂j,T1 − πj | ≥ α}+ P { |bτ τ − E[bτ τ ]| ≥ 3δ/4|∀j, |π̂j,T1 − πj | ≥ α } ≤ 2J\nT 2 + 2 exp\n( − δ 2τ\n32\n) , t > T1.

      "text" : "With known statistics, the agent knows the context distribution πj’s, the costs cj,k’s, and the expected rewards uj,k’s. In heterogeneous-cost systems, the quality of a context-action pair (j, k) is roughly captured by the normalized reward, denoted by ηj,k = uj,k/cj,k. However, unlike the unit-cost case, the agent cannot only focus on the “best” action with highest normalized reward, i.e., k∗j = arg maxk ηj,k, when making a decision under context j. This is because there may exist another action k such that ηj,k < ηj,k∗j , but uj,k > uj,k∗j (and of course, cj,k > cj,k∗j ). If there is sufficient budget allocated for context j, then the agent may take action k to maximize the expected reward. Therefore, the agent needs to consider all actions under each context. Let pj,k be the probability that action k is taken under context j. We define the following LP problem:\n(LP ′T,B) maximize J∑ j=1 πj K∑ k=1 pj,kuj,k, (55)\nsubject to J∑ j=1 πj K∑ k=1 pj,kcj,k ≤ B/T, (56)\nK∑ k=1 pj,k ≤ 1, ∀j, (57)\npj,k ∈ [0, 1].\nThe above LP problem LP ′T,B can be solved efficiently by optimization tools. Let v̂(ρ) be the maximum value of LP ′T,B . Similar to Lemma 1, we can show that T v̂(ρ) is an upper bound of the expected total reward, i.e., T v̂(ρ) ≥ U∗(T,B).\nTo obtain insight from the solution of LP ′T,B , we derive an explicit representation for the solution by analyzing the structure of LP ′T,B . Note that there are two types of (non-trivial) constraints in LP ′T,B , one is the “inter-context” budget constraint (56), the other is the “intra-context” constraint (57). These constraints can be decoupled by first allocating budget for each context, and then solving a subproblem with the allocated budget constraint for each context. Specifically, let ρj be the budget allocated to context j, then LP ′T,B can be decomposed as follows:\nmaximize J∑ j=1 πj v̂j(ρj), subject to J∑ j=1 πjρj ≤ B/T,\nwhere\n(SPj) vj(ρj) = maximize K∑ k=1 pj,kuj,k, (58)\nsubject to K∑ k=1 pj,kcj,k ≤ ρj , (59)\nK∑ k=1 pj,k ≤ 1, (60)\npj,k ∈ [0, 1].\nNext, by analyzing sub-problem SPj , we show that some actions can be deleted without affecting the performance, i.e., the probability is 0 in the optimal solution.\nLemma 11. For any given ρj ≥ 0, there exists an optimal solution of SPj , i.e., p∗j = (p∗j,1, p ∗ j,2, . . . , p ∗ j,K), satisfies: (1) For k1, if there exists another action k2, such that ηj,k1 ≤ ηj,k2 and uk1 ≤ uk2 , then p∗j,k1 = 0; (2) For k1, if there exists two actions k2 and k3, such that ηj,k2 ≤ ηj,k1 ≤ ηj,k3 , uj,k2 ≥ uj,k1 ≥ uj,k3 , and\nuj,k1−uj,k3 cj,k1−cj,k3 ≤ uj,k2−uj,k3cj,k2−cj,k3 , then p ∗ j,k1 = 0.\nIntuitively, the first part of Lemma 11 shows that if an action has small normalized and original expected reward, then it can be removed. The second part of Lemma 11 shows that if an action has small normalized expected reward and medium original expected reward, but the increasing rate is smaller than another action with larger expected reward, then it can also be removed.\nProof. The key idea of this proof is that, if the conditions is satisfied, and there is a feasible solution pj = (pj,1, pj,2, . . . , pj,K) such that pj,k1 > 0, then we can construct another feasible solution p ′ j such that p′j,k1 = 0, without reducing the objective value vj(ρj).\nWe first prove part (1). Under the conditions of part (1), if pj is a feasible solution of SPj with pj,k1 > 0, then consider another solution p ′ j , where p ′ j,k = pj,k for k /∈ {k1, k2}, p′j,k1 = 0, and p′j,k2 = pj,k2 + pj,k1 min{ cj,k1 cj,k2\n, 1}. Then, we can verify that p′j is a feasible solution of (SPj), and the objective value under p′j is no less than that under pj .\nFor the second part, if the conditions are satisfied and pj,k1 > 0, then we construct a new solution p ′ j by re-allocating the budget consumed by action k1 to actions k2 and k3, without violating the constraints. Specifically, we set the probability the same as the original solution for other actions, i.e., p′j,k = pj,k for k /∈ {k1, k2, k3}, and set p′j,k1 = 0 for action k1. For k2 and k3, to maximize the objective function, we would like to allocate as much budget as possible to k3 unless there is remaining budget. Therefore, we set p′j,k2 = pj,k2 and p ′ j,k3 = pj,k3 + pj,k1cj,k1 cj,k3 , if ∑ k 6=k1 pj,k+ pj,k1cj,k1 cj,k3 ≤ 1; or, p′j,k2 = pj,k2 + pj,k1cj,k1−(1− ∑ k 6=k1 pj,k)cj,k3 cj,k2−cj,k3 and p′j,k3 = pj,k3 + (1− ∑ k 6=k1 pj,k)cj,k2−pj,k1cj,k1 cj,k2−cj,k3 ,\nif ∑ k 6=k1 pj,k + pj,k1cj,k1 cj,k3\n> 1. We can verify that pj satisfies the constraints of (SPj) but the objective value is no less than that under pj .\nWith Lemma 11, the agent can ignore some actions that will obviously be allocated with zero probability under a given context j. We call the set of the remaining actions as candidate set for context j, denoted as Aj . We propose an algorithm to construct the candidate action set for context j, as shown in Algorithm 4.\nFor context j, assume that the candidate setAj = {kj,1, kj,2, . . . , kj,Kj} has been sorted in descending order of their normalized rewards, i.e., ηj,kj,1 ≥ ηj,kj,2 ≥ . . . ≥ ηj,kj,Kj . From Algorithm 4, we know that uj,kj,1 < uj,kj,2 < . . . < uj,kj,Kj , and cj,kj,1 < cj,kj,2 < . . . < cj,kj,Kj .\nThe agent now only needs to consider the actions in the candidate set Aj . To decouple the “intracontext” constraint (57), we introduce the following transformation:\npj,kj,a = { p̃j,kj,a − p̃j,kj,a+1 , if 1 ≤ a ≤ Kj − 1, p̃j,kj,Kj , if a = Kj ,\nAlgorithm 4 Find Candidate Set for Context j Input: cj,k’s, uj,k’s, for all 1 ≤ k ≤ K; Output: Aj ; Init: Aj = {1, 2, . . . ,K} ; Calculate normalized rewards: ηj,k = uj,k/cj,k; Sort actions in descending order of their normalized rewards:\nηj,k1 ≥ ηj,k2 ≥ . . . ≥ ηj,kK .\nfor a = 2 to K do if ∃a′ < a such that uj,ka ≤ uj,ka′ then Aj = Aj\\{ka};\nend if end for a = 1; while a ≤ K − 1 do\nFind the action with highest increasing rate:\na∗ = arg max a′:a′>a,ka′∈Aj uj,ka′ − uj,ka cj,ka′ − cj,ka .\nRemove the actions in between:\nAj = Aj\\{ka′ : a < a′ < a∗}.\nMove to the next candidate action: a = a∗; end while\nwhere p̃j,kj,a ∈ [0, 1], and p̃j,kj,a ≥ p̃j,kj,a+1 for 1 ≤ a ≤ Kj − 1. Substituting the transformations into (SPj) and reorganize it as\n(S̃Pj) maximize Kj∑ a=1 p̃j,kj,a ũj,kj,a ,\nsubject to Kj∑ a=1 p̃j,kj,a c̃j,kj,a ≤ ρj ,\np̃j,kj,a ≥ p̃j,kj,a+1 , 1 ≤ a ≤ Kj − 1, (61) p̃j,kj,a ∈ [0, 1], ∀a,\nwhere\nũj,kj,a = { uj,kj,1 , if a = 1, uj,kj,a − uj,kj,a−1 , if 2 ≤ a ≤ Kj ,\nc̃j,kj,a = { cj,kj,1 , if a = 1, cj,kj,a − cj,kj,a−1 , if 2 ≤ a ≤ Kj .\nNext, we show that the constraint (61) can indeed be removed. For each kj,a, we can view c̃j,kj,a and ũj,kj,a as the cost and expected reward of a virtual action. Let η̃j,kj,a = ũj,kj,a/c̃j,kj,a be the normalized expected reward of virtual action kj,a. For a = 1, using\nuj,kj,1 cj,kj,1 ≥ uj,kj,2cj,kj,2 , we can show\nthat η̃j,kj,1 ≥ η̃j,kj,2 . For 2 ≤ a ≤ Kj − 1, using uj,kj,a−uj,kj,a−1 cj,kj,a−cj,kj,a−1 ≥ uj,kj,a+1−uj,kj,a−1cj,kj,a+1−cj,kj,a−1 , we can show that η̃j,kj,a ≥ η̃j,kj,a+1 . In other words, we can verify that η̃j,kj,1 ≥ η̃j,kj,2 ≥ . . . ≥ η̃j,kj,Kj . Thus, without constraint (61), the optimal solution p̃∗j = [p̃ ∗ j,k1 , p̃∗j,k2 , . . . , p̃ ∗ j,kKj\n] automatically satisfies p̃∗j,k1 ≥ p̃ ∗ j,k2 ≥ . . . ≥ p̃∗j,kKj . Hence, we can remove the constraint (61), and thus decouple the probability constraint under a context.\nWith the above transformations, we can thus rewrite the global LP problem\n(L̃P ′ T,B) maximize J∑ j=1 Kj∑ a=1 πj p̃j,kj,a ũj,kj,a ,\nsubject to J∑ j=1 Kj∑ a=1 πj p̃j,kj,a c̃j,kj,a ≤ B/T,\np̃j,kj,a ∈ [0, 1], ∀j, and 1 ≤ a ≤ Kj .\nThe solution of L̃P ′ T,B follows a threshold structure. We sort all context-(virtual-)action pairs (j, ka) in descending order of their normalized expected reward. Let j(i), k(i) be the context index and action index of the i-th pair, respectively. Namely, η̃j(1),k(1) ≥ η̃j(2),k(2) ≥ . . . ≥ η̃j(M),k(M) , where M = ∑J j=1Kj is the total number of candidate actions for all contexts. Define a threshold corresponding to ρ = B/T ,\nĩ(ρ) = max{i : i∑\ni′=1\nπj(i′) c̃j(i′),k(i′) ≤ ρ}, (62)\nwhere ρ = B/T is the average budget. We can verify that the following solution is optimal for L̃P ′ T,B :\np̃j(i),k(i)(ρ) =  1, if 1 ≤ i ≤ ĩ(ρ), ρ− ∑ĩ(ρ) i′=1 πj(i′) c̃ j(i ′),k(i′) π j(ĩ(ρ)+1) c̃ j(ĩ(ρ)+1),k(ĩ(ρ)+1) , if i = ĩ(ρ) + 1,\n0, if i > ĩ(ρ) + 1.\nThen, the optimal solution of L̃P ′ T,B can be calculated using the reverse transformation from p̃j,k(ρ)’s to pj,k(ρ)’s"

As a special case, when all actions have the same cost under a given context, i.e., cj,k = cj for all k and j, the normalized expected reward ηj,k represents the quality of action k under context j. In this case, the candidate set for each context only contains one action, which is the action with the highest expected reward. Thus, the ALP algorithm for the known statistics case is simple. When the expected rewards are unknown, we can extend the UCB-ALP algorithm by managing the UCB for the normalized expected rewards.\nWhen the costs for different actions under the same context are heterogeneous, it is difficult to combine ALP with the UCB method since the ALP algorithm in this case not only requires the ordering of ηj,k’s, but also the ordering of uj,k’s and the ratios\nuj,k1−uj,k2 cj,k1−cj,k2\n. We propose an -First ALP Algorithm that explores and exploits separately: the agent takes actions under all contexts in the first (T ) rounds to estimate the expected rewards, and runs ALP based on the estimates in the remaining T − (T ) rounds.\nFor the ease of exposition, we assume cj,k1 6= cj,k2 for any j and k1 6= k2 2, and let ∆ (c) min be the minimal difference, i.e., ∆\n(c) min = min\nj∈X k1,k2∈{0}∪A\n{|cj,k1 − cj,k2 |}.\n2For the case with cj,k1 = cj,k2 for some j and k1 6= k2 (and uj,k1 6= uj,k2 ), we can correctly remove the suboptimal action with high probability by comparing their empirical rewards ūj,k1 = ūj,k2 .\nAlgorithm 5 -First ALP Input: Time horizon T , budget B, exploration stage length (T ), and cj,k’s, for all j and k; Init: Remaining budget b = B; Cj,k = 0, ūj,k = 0; for t = 1 to (T ) do\nif b > 0 then Take action At = arg mink∈A CXt,k (with random tie-breaking); Observe the reward YAt,t; Update counter CXt,At = CXt,At + 1; update remaining budget b = b− cXt,At ; Update the reward estimate:\nūXt,At = (CXt,At − 1)ūXt,At + YAt,t\nCXt,At .\nend if end for for t = (T ) + 1 to T do\nRemaining time τ = T − t+ 1; if b > 0 then\nObtain the probabilities pj,k(b/τ)’s by solving the problem (LP ′τ,b) with uj,k replaced by ūj,k; Take action k with probability pXt,k(b/τ); Remaining budget b = b− cXt,At ;\nend if end for\nLet ξj,k1,k2 = uj,k1−uj,k2 cj,k1−cj,k2\nfor j ∈ X , k1, k2 ∈ {0} ∪ A, and k1 6= k2 (recall that uj,0 = 0 and cj,0 = 0 for the dummy action), ξ̄j,k1,k2 be its estimate at the end of the exploration stage, i.e., ξ̄j,k1,k2 =\nūj,k1−ūj,k2 cj,k1−cj,k2 . Let ∆(ξ)min be the minimal difference between any ξj1,k11,k12 and ξj2,k21,k22 , i.e.,\n∆ (ξ) min = min\nj1,j2∈X k11,k12,k21,k22∈{0}∪A\n{|ξj1,k11,k12 − ξj2,k21,k22 |}.\nMoreover, let πmin = minj∈X πj and let ∆∗ = ∆ (c) min∆ (ξ) min. Then, the following lemma states that under -First ALP with a sufficiently large (T ), the agent will obtain a correct ordering of ξj,k1,k2 ’s with high probability at the end of the exploration stage.\nLemma 13. Let 0 < δ < 1. Under -First ALP, if\n(T ) =\n⌈ K\n(1− δ)πmin + log T max { 1 δ2 ,\n16K (1− δ)πmin(∆∗)2 }⌉ ,\nthen for any contexts j1, j2 ∈ X , and actions k11, k12, k21, k22 ∈ {0}∪A, if ξj1,k11,k12 < ξj2,k21,k22 , then at the end of the (T )-th round, we have\nP { ξ̄j1,k11,k12 ≥ ξ̄j2,k21,k22 } ≤ (J + 4)T−2.\nMoreover, the agent ranks all the ξj,k1,k2 ’s correctly with probability no less than 1−(4K+1)JT−2.\nProof. We first analyze the number of executions for each context-action pair (j, k) in the exploration stage. Let Nj = ∑ (T ) t=1 1(Xt = j) be the number of occurrences of context j up to round\n(T ). Recall that the contexts Xt arrive i.i.d. in each round. Thus, using Hoeffding-Chernoff Bound\nfor each context j, we have\nP { ∀j ∈ X , Nj ≥ (1− δ)πj (T ) } ≥ 1−\nJ∑ j=1 P { Nj < (1− δ)πj (T ) } ≥ 1− Je−2δ 2 (T )\n≥ 1− Je−2 log T\n= 1− JT−2 (68)\nOn the other hand, the lower bound (1 − δ)πj (T ) ≥ K + 16K log T(∆∗)2 . From the implementation of the exploration stage in Algorithm 5, we know that if Nj ≥ (1− δ)πj (T ), then\nCj,k ≥ ⌊ 1 + 16 log T (∆∗)2 ⌋ ≥ 16 log T (∆∗)2 , ∀k ∈ A. (69)\nTherefore,\nP { ∀j ∈ X ,∀k ∈ A, Cj,k ≥ 16 log T\n(∆∗)2 } ≥ 1− JT−2 (70)\nNext, we study the relationship between the estimates ξ̄j1,k11,k12 and ξ̄j2,k21,k22 at the end of the exploration stage. We note that\nξ̄j1,k11,k12 ≥ ξ̄j2,k21,k22 ⇔ ( ξ̄j1,k11,k12 − ξj1,k11,k12 −\nξj2,k21,k22 − ξj1,k11,k12 2 ) − ( ξ̄j2,k21,k22 − ξj2,k21,k22 +\nξj2,k21,k22 − ξj1,k11,k12 2\n) ≥ 0\n⇔ ( ūj1,k11 − uj1,k11 cj1,k11 − cj1,k12 − ξj2,k21,k22 − ξj1,k11,k12 4 ) − ( ūj1,k12 − uj1,k12 cj1,k11 − cj1,k12 + ξj2,k21,k22 − ξj1,k11,k12 4\n) − ( ūj2,k21 − uj2,k21 cj2,k21 − cj2,k22 + ξj2,k21,k22 − ξj1,k11,k12 4\n) + ( ūj2,k22 − uj2,k22 cj2,k21 − cj1,k22 − ξj2,k21,k22 − ξj1,k11,k12 4 ) ≥ 0.\n(71)\nThus, for the event ξ̄j1,k11,k12 ≥ ξ̄j2,k21,k22 to be true, we require that at least one term (with the sign) in the last inequation above is no less than zero. Conditioned on Cj,k ≥ 16 log T(∆∗)2 , we can bound the probability of each term according to the Hoeffding-Chernoff bound. For example, for the first term, we have\nP { ūj1,k11 − uj1,k11 cj1,k11 − cj1,k12 − ξj2,k21,k22 − ξj1,k11,k12 4 ≥ 0\n|Cj1,k11 ≥ 16 log T (∆∗)2 }\n≤ P { ūj1,k11 ≥ uj1,k11 + ∆∗\n4 |Cj1,k11 ≥\n16 log T (∆∗)2 }\n≤ e−2 log T = T−2. The conclusion then follows by considering the event { Cj,k ≥ 16 log T(∆∗)2 ,∀j ∈ X ,∀k ∈ X } and its negation.\nTheorem 5. Let 0 < δ < 1. Under -First ALP, if\n(T ) ≥ K (1− δ)πmin + log T max\n{ 1\nδ2 ,\n16K\n(1− δ)πmin(∆∗)2\n} ,\nthen the regret of -First ALP satisfies: 1) if ρ = B/T 6= Qi, then R −FirstALP(T,B) = O(log T ); 2) if ρ = B/T = Qi, then R −FirstALP(T,B) = O( √ T ).\nProof. (Sketch) The key idea of proving this theorem is considering the event where the ξj,k1,k2 ’s are ranked correctly and its negation. When the ξj,k1,k2 ’s are ranked correctly, we can use the properties of the ALP algorithm with modification on the time horizon and budget (subtracting the time and budget in the exploration stage, which is O(log T )); otherwise, if the agent obtains a wrong ranking results, the regret is bounded as O(1) because the probability is O(T−2) and the reward in each round is bounded."

This is usually impractical since the expected rewards are unknown a priori. Thus, without the knowledge of ∆(ξ)min, we propose a Confidence Level Test (CLT) algorithm for deciding when to end the exploration stage.\nSpecifically, assume ∆(ξ)min > 0 and is unknown by the agent. In each round of the exploration stage, the agent tries to solve the problem (LP ′τ,b) with uj,k replaced by ūj,k using comparison, i.e., using Algorithm 4 and sorting the virtual actions. For each comparison, the agent tests the confidence level according to Algorithm 6. If all comparisons pass the test, i.e., flagSucc = true for all comparisons, then the agent ends the exploration stage and starts the exploitation stage.\nAlgorithm 6 Confidence Level Test (CLT) Input: Time horizon T , estimates ξ̄j1,k11,k12 , ξ̄j2,k21,k22 , number of executions Cj1,k11 , Cj1,k12 , Cj2,k21 , and Cj2,k22 ; Output: flagSucc; Init: flagSucc = false,\n∆′ = ∆\n(c) min(ξ̄j1,k11,k12−ξ̄j2,k21,k22 )\n2 ; if e−2(∆\n′)2 min{Cj1,k11 ,Cj1,k12} ≤ T−2 & e−2(∆′)2 min{Cj2,k21 ,Cj2,k22} ≤ T−2 then flagSucc = true;\nend if return flagSucc;\nNext, we show that the -First policy with CLT will achieveO(log T ) regret except for the boundary cases, where it achieves O( √ T ) regret. On one hand, according to Hoeffding-Chernoff bound, if all comparisons pass the confidence level test, then with probability at least 1−JK2T−2, the algorithm obtains the correct rank and provide a right solution for the problem (LP ′τ,b). On the other hand, because ∆∗ > 0, from the analysis in the previous section, we know that the exploration stage will end within O(log T ) rounds with high probability.

In the case with known statistics, we compare the proposed PB (two-context case) and ALP algorithms with Fixed LP (FLP) algorithm that uses a fixed average budget constraint B/T since both [17] and [20] use fixed average budget constraint. Then, the UCB-based FLP, i.e., UCB-FLP, is evaluated in the case without\nknowledge of expected rewards. We also evaluate algorithms for the case without knowledge of context distribution. When the context distribution is unknown to the agent, we use the Empirical ALP (EALP) algorithm, that uses the empirical distribution (histogram) of context for making decisions, in the case with known expected rewards.

The boundary is q1 = π1 = 0.4 and we study the cases with normalized budget ρ = 0.39, 0.4, and 0.41, respectively.\nFigure 1 shows the regret of different algorithms in the case with known expected rewards. In the non-boundary cases (i.e., ρ = 0.39, 0.41), the ALP algorithm achieves near optimal performance. Even without the knowledge of context distribution, the EALP algorithm performs much better than FLP. In the boundary case, i.e., ρ = 0.4, the regret of ALP increases with T but is still lower than that of FLP. The EALP algorithm achieves higher regret than ALP and FLP due to the empirical distribution errors.\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nx 10 5\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\nHorizon T\nR eg\nre t\nUCB−FLP UCB−PB UCB−ALP UCB−EALP\n(a)\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nx 10 5\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\nHorizon T\nR eg\nre t\nUCB−FLP UCB−PB UCB−ALP UCB−EALP\n(b)\n0 2 4 6 8 10\nx 10 5\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\nHorizon T\nR eg\nre t\nUCB−FLP UCB−PB UCB−ALP UCB−EALP\n(c)\nFigure 2: Comparison of algorithms for the two-context systems without perfect knowledge (π1 = 0.4, π2 = 0.6), (a) ρ = 0.39, (b) ρ = 0.4, (c) ρ = 0.41.\nFigure 2 shows the regret of different algorithms in the case without knowledge of expected rewards. We can see that in the non-boundary cases, UCB-ALP and UCB-EALP achieves regret that is very close to UCB-PB and outperforms UCB-FLP. Interestingly, we can even see that UCB-ALP achieves slightly lower regret than UCB-PB in the case with ρ = 0.41. This is because under UCB-PB, the better context may be skipped and wasted if it does not have the highest UCB. In contrast, the UCBALP algorithm may allocate certain resource to the better context, even when it does not have the highest UCB.

One boundary in this system is q5 = 0.5. We study the cases with average budget ρ = 0.49, 0.5, and 0.51, respectively. In this case, it is difficult to calculate the expected total reward obtained by the oracle solution. Thus, we calculate the regret by comparing with the upper bound, i.e., Û(T,B) = Tv(ρ).\nFigure 3 shows the regret of different algorithms in the case with known expected rewards. In the non-boundary cases, both the ALP and EALP algorithm achieve similar performance as in the twocontext case. The regret of EALP is even lower than FLP in the boundary case, since the ratio of contexts that are executed with correct probability is higher than that in the two-context systems.\nFigure 4 shows the regret of different algorithms in the case without knowledge of expected rewards. We can see that all algorithms achieve sublinear regret, but the difference between the non-boundary cases and the boundary case is small. This is rooted in the fact that when the number of contexts and the number of actions are large, it requires more time to learn the expected rewards. Hence, the constant in the log T term is much larger than that in the √ T term, and the log T term dominates the regret and the impact of the √ T term could be small. Exploring the structure of the reward function in contextual bandits, e.g., similarity [6] and linearity [5], to reduce the exploration time is part of our future work."

    "abstractText" : "We study contextual bandits with budget and time constraints, referred to as constrained contextual bandits. The time and budget constraints significantly complicate the exploration and exploitation tradeoff because they introduce complex coupling among contexts over time. To gain insight, we first study unit-cost systems with known context distribution. When the expected rewards are known, we develop an approximation of the oracle, referred to Adaptive-Linear-Programming (ALP), which achieves near-optimality and only requires the ordering of expected rewards. With these highly desirable features, we then combine ALP with the upper-confidence-bound (UCB) method in the general case where the expected rewards are unknown a priori. We show that the proposed UCB-ALP algorithm achieves logarithmic regret except for certain boundary cases. Further, we design algorithms and obtain similar regret bounds for more general systems with unknown context distribution and heterogeneous costs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that shows how to achieve logarithmic regret in constrained contextual bandits. Moreover, this work also sheds light on the study of computationally efficient algorithms for general constrained contextual bandits.",
