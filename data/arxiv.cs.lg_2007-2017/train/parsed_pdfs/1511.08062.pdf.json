      "text" : "MM has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems. Mairal (2013) has given a comprehensive review on MM. Conceptually, the MM methods consist of two steps (see Algorithm 1). First, construct a surrogate function gk(x) of f(x) at the current iterate xk. Second, minimize the surrogate gk(x) to update x. The choice of surrogate is crit-\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n08 06\n2v 1\n[ m\nat h.\nO C\n] 2\n5 N\nov 2\n01 5\nical for the efficiency of solving (1) and also the quality of solution. The most popular choice of surrogate is the class of “first order surrogates”, whose difference from the objective function is differentiable with a Lipschitz continuous gradient (Mairal, 2013). For non-smooth and non-convex objectives, to the best of our knowledge, “first order surrogates” are only used to approximate the differentiable part f̃(x) of the objective f(x) in (2). More precisely, denoting g̃k(x) as an approximation of f̃(x) at iteration k, the surrogate is\ngk(x) = g̃k(x) + f̂(x). (3)\nSuch a split approximation scheme has been successfully applied, e.g., to minimizing the difference of convex functions (Candes, Wakin, and Boyd, 2008) and in the proximal splitting algorithm (Attouch, Bolte, and Svaiter, 2013). In parallel to (Mairal, 2013), Razaviyayn, Hong, and Luo (2013) also showed that many popular methods for minimizing non-smooth functions could be regarded as MM methods. They proposed the block coordinate descent method, where the traditional MM could be regarded as a special case by gathering all variables in one block. Different from (Mairal, 2013), they suggested using the directional derivative to ensure the first order smoothness between the objective and the surrogate, which is weaker than the condition in (Mairal, 2013) that the difference between the objective and the surrogate should be smooth. However, Razaviyayn, Hong, and Luo (2013) only discussed the choice of surrogates by approximating f(x) as (3)."

      "heading" : "Contributions",
      "text" : "The contributions of this paper are as follows: (a) We further relax the condition on the difference between\nthe objective and the surrogate. We only require that the directional derivative of the difference vanishes when the number of iterations approaches infinity (see (8)). Our even weaker condition ensures that the non-smooth and non-convex objective can be approximated directly. Our relaxed MM is general enough to include the existing MM methods (Mairal, 2013; Razaviyayn, Hong, and Luo, 2013).\n(b) We also propose the conditions ensuring that the iterates produced by our relaxed MM converge to stationary points2, even for general non-smooth and non-convex objectives.\n(c) As a concrete example, we apply our relaxed MM to the robust matrix factorization (RMF) problem with different regularizations. Experimental results testify to the robustness and effectiveness of our locally majorant algorithm over the state-of-the-art algorithms for RMF. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that ensures convergence to stationary points without extra assumptions, as the objective and the constructed surrogate naturally fulfills the convergence conditions of our relaxed MM.\n2For convenience, we say that a sequence converges to stationary points meaning that any limit point of the sequence is a stationary point.\nTable 1 summarizes the differences between our relaxed MM and the existing MM. We can see that ours is general enough to include existing works (Mairal, 2013; Razaviyayn, Hong, and Luo, 2013). In addition, it requires less smoothness on the difference between the objective and the surrogate and has higher approximation ability and better convergence property."

      "heading" : "Our Relaxed MM",
      "text" : "Before introducing our relaxed MM, we recall some definitions that will be used later.\nDefinition 1. (Sufficient Descent) {f(xk)} is said to have sufficient descent on the sequence {xk} if there exists a constant α > 0 such that:\nf(xk)− f(xk+1) ≥ α‖xk − xk+1‖2, ∀k. (4)\nDefinition 2. (Directional Derivative (Borwein and Lewis, 2010, Chapter 6.1)) The directional derivative of function f(x) in the feasible direction d (x + d ∈ C) is defined as:\n∇f(x;d) = lim inf θ↓0 f(x + θd)− f(x) θ . (5)\nDefinition 3. (Stationary Point (Razaviyayn, Hong, and Luo, 2013)) A point x∗ is a (minimizing) stationary point of f(x) if∇f(x∗;d) ≥ 0 for all d such that x∗ + d ∈ C.\nThe surrogate function in our relaxed MM should satisfy the following three conditions:\nf(xk) = gk(xk), (6)\nf(xk+1) ≤ gk(xk+1), (Locally Majorant) (7)\nlim k→∞\n(∇f(xk;d)−∇gk(xk;d)) = 0,\n∀xk + d ∈ C. (Asymptotic Smoothness) (8)\nBy combining conditions (6) and (7), we have the nonincrement property of MM:\nf(xk+1) ≤ gk(xk+1) ≤ gk(xk) = f(xk). (9)\nHowever, we will show that with a careful choice of surrogate, {f(xk)} can have sufficient descent, which is stronger than non-increment and is critical for proving the convergence of our MM.\nIn the traditional MM, the global majorization condition (Mairal, 2013; Razaviyayn, Hong, and Luo, 2013) is assumed:\nf(x) ≤ gk(x), ∀x ∈ C, (Globally Majorant) (10)\nwhich also results in the non-increment of the objective function, i.e., (9). However, a globally majorant surrogate cannot approximate the object well (Fig. 1). Moreover, the step length between successive iterates may be too small. So a globally majorant surrogate is likely to produce an inferior solution and converges slower than a locally majorant one ((Mairal, 2013) and our experiments).\nCondition (8) requires very weak first order smoothness of the difference between gk(x) and f(x). It is weaker than that in (Razaviyayn, Hong, and Luo, 2013, Assumption 1.(A3)), which requires that the directional derivatives of gk(x) and f(x) are equal at every xk. Here we only require the equality when the number of iterations goes to infinity, which provides more flexibility in constructing the surrogate function. When f(·) and gk(·) are both smooth, condition (8) can be satisfied when the two hold the same gradient at xk. For non-smooth functions, condition (8) can be enforced on the differentiable part f̃(x) of f(x). These two cases have been discussed in the literature (Mairal, 2013; Razaviyayn, Hong, and Luo, 2013). If f̃(x) vanishes, the case not yet discussed in the literature, the condition can still be fulfilled by approximating the whole objective function f(x) directly, as long as the resulted surrogate satisfies certain properties, as stated below3.\nProposition 1. Assume that ∃ K > 0, +∞ > γu, γl > 0, and > 0, such that\nĝk(x)+γu‖x−xk‖22 ≥ f(x) ≥ ĝk(x)−γl‖x−xk‖22 (11)\nholds for all k ≥ K and x ∈ C such that ‖x − xk‖ ≤ , where the equality holds if and only if x = xk. Then condition (8) holds for gk(x) = ĝk(x) + γu‖x− xk‖22.\nWe make two remarks. First, for sufficiently large γu and γl the inequality (11) naturally holds. However, a larger γu leads to slower convergence. Fortunately, as we only require the inequality to hold for sufficiently large k, adaptively increasing γu from a small value is allowed and also beneficial. In many cases, the bounds of γu and γl may be deduced from the objective function. Second, the above proposition does not specify any smoothness property on either ĝk(x) or the difference gk(x)−f(x). It is not odd to add the proximal term ‖x − xk‖22, which has been widely used, e.g. in proximal splitting algorithm (Attouch, Bolte, and Svaiter, 2013) and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) (Lin, Liu, and Li, 2013).\nFor general non-convex and non-smooth problems, proving the convergence to a global (or local) minimum is out of reach, classical analysis focuses on converging to stationary points instead. For general MM methods, since only nonincrement property is ensured, even the convergence to stationary points cannot be guaranteed. Mairal (Mairal, 2013)\n3The proofs of the results in this paper can be found in Supplementary Materials.\nproposed using strongly convex surrogates and thus proved that the iterates of corresponding MM converge to stationary points. Here we have similar results, as stated below. Theorem 1. (Convergence) Assume that the surrogate gk(x) satisfies (6) and (7), and further is strongly convex, then the sequence {f(xk)} has sufficient descent. If gk(x) further satisfies (8) and {xk} is bounded, then the sequence {xk} converges to stationary points. Remark 1. If gk(x) = ġk(x)+ρ/2‖x−xk‖22, where ġk(x) is locally majorant (not necessarily convex) as (7) and ρ > 0, then the strongly convex condition can be removed and the same convergence result holds.\nIn the next section, we will give a concrete example on how to construct appropriate surrogates for the RMF problem."

      "heading" : "Solving Robust Matrix Factorization by Relaxed MM",
      "text" : "Matrix factorization is to factorize a matrix, which usually has missing values and noises, into two matrices. It is widely used for structure from motion (Tomasi and Kanade, 1992), clustering (Kong, Ding, and Huang, 2011), dictionary learning (Mairal et al., 2010), etc. Normally, people aim at minimizing the error between the given matrix and the product of two matrices at the observed entries, measured in squared `2 norm. Such models are fragile to outliers. Recently, `1- norm has been suggested to measure the error for enhancing robustness. Such models are thus called robust matrix factorization (RMF). Their formulation is as follows:\nmin U∈Cu,V ∈Cv\n‖W (M −UV T )‖1 +Ru(U)+Rv(V ), (12)\nwhere M ∈ Rm×n is the observed matrix and ‖ · ‖1 is the `1-norm, namely the sum of absolute values in a matrix. U ∈ Rm×r and V ∈ Rn×r are the unknown factor matrices. W is the 0-1 binary mask with the same size as M . The entry value 0 means that the corresponding entry in M is missing, and 1 otherwise. The operator is the Hadamard entry-wise product. Cu ⊆ Rm×r and Cv ⊆ Rn×r are some closed convex sets, e.g., non-negative cones or balls in some norm. Ru(U) and Rv(V ) represent some convex regularizations, e.g., `1-norm, squared Frobenius norm, or elastic net. By combining different constraints and regularizations, we can get variants of RMF, e.g., low-rank matrix recovery (Ke and Kanade, 2005), non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) (Lee and Seung, 2001), and dictionary learning (Mairal et al., 2010).\nSuppose that we have obtained (Uk, Vk) at the k-th iteration. We split (U, V ) as the sum of (Uk, Vk) and the unknown increment (∆U,∆V ):\n(U, V ) = (Uk, Vk) + (∆U,∆V ). (13)\nThen (12) can be rewritten as:\nmin ∆U+Uk∈Cu,∆V+Vk∈Cv\nFk(∆U,∆V ) = ‖W (M − (Uk+\n∆U)(V Tk + ∆V ) T )‖1 +Ru(Uk + ∆U) +Rv(Vk + ∆V ).\n(14)\nNow we aim at finding an increment (∆U,∆V ) such that the objective function decreases properly. However, problem (14) is not easier than the original problem (12). Inspired by MM, we try to approximate (14) with a convex surrogate. By the triangular inequality of norms, we have the following inequality:\nFk(∆U,∆V ) ≤ ‖W (M − UkV Tk −∆UV Tk − Uk∆V T )‖1 + ‖W (∆U∆V T )‖1 +Ru(Uk + ∆U) +Rv(Vk + ∆V ),\n(15)\nwhere the term ‖W (∆U∆V T )‖1 can be further approximated by ρu/2‖U‖2F + ρv/2‖V ‖2F , in which ρu and ρv are some positive constants. Denoting\nĜk(∆U,∆V ) = ‖W (M − UkY Tk −∆UV Tk − Uk∆V T )‖1 +Ru(Uk + ∆U) +Rv(Vk + ∆V ), (16)\nwe have a surrogate function of Fk(∆U,∆V ) as follows:\nGk(∆U,∆V ) = Ĝk(∆U,∆V ) + ρu 2 ‖∆U‖2F + ρv 2 ‖∆V ‖2F ,\ns.t. ∆U + Uk ∈ Cu,∆V + Vk ∈ Cv. (17)\nDenoting #W(i,.) and #W(.,j) as the number of observed entries in the corresponding column and row of M , respectively, and > 0 as any positive scalar, we have the following proposition.\nProposition 2. Ĝk(∆U,∆V ) + ρ̄u/2‖∆U‖2F + ρ̄v/2‖∆V ‖2F ≥ Fk(∆U,∆V ) ≥ Ĝk(∆U,∆V ) − ρ̄u/2‖∆U‖2F − ρ̄v/2‖∆V ‖2F holds for all possible (∆U,∆V ) and the equality holds if and only if (∆U,∆V ) = (0,0), where ρ̄u = max{#W(i,.), i = 1, . . . ,m}+ , and ρ̄v = max{#W(.,j), j = 1, . . . , n}+ .\nBy choosing ρu and ρv in different ways, we have two versions of relaxed MM for RMF: RMF by globally majorant MM (RMF-GMMM for short) and RMF by locally majorant MM (RMF-LMMM for short). In RMF-GMMM, ρu and ρv are fixed to be ρ̄u and ρ̄v in Proposition 2, respectively, throughout the iterations. In RMF-LMMM, ρu and ρv are instead initialized with relatively small values and then increase gradually, using the line search technique in (Beck and Teboulle, 2009) to ensure the locally majorant condition (7). ρu and ρv eventually reach the upper bounds ρ̄u and ρ̄v in Proposition 2, respectively. As we will show, RMFLMMM significantly outperforms RMF-GMMM in all our experiments, in both convergence speed and quality of solution.\nSince the chosen surrogate Gk naturally fulfills the conditions in Theorem 1, we have the following convergence result for RMF solved by relax MM. Theorem 2. By minimizing (17) and updating (U, V ) according to (13), the sequence {F (Uk, Vk)} has sufficient descent and the sequence {(Uk, Vk)} converges to stationary points.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first convergence guarantee for variants of RMF without extra assumptions. In the following, we will give two examples of RMF in (12).\nTwo Variants of RMF\nLow Rank Matrix Recovery exploits the fact r min(m,n) to recover the intrinsic low rank data from the measurement matrix with missing data. When the error is measured by the squared Frobenius norm, many algorithms have been proposed (Buchanan and Fitzgibbon, 2005; Mitra, Sheorey, and Chellappa, 2010). For robustness, Ke and Kanade (2005) proposed to adopt the `1-norm. They minimized U and V alternatively, which could easily get stuck at non-stationary points (Bertsekas, 1999). So Eriksson and van den Hengel (2012) represented V implicitly with U and extended the Wiberg Algorithm to `1-norm. They only proved the convergence of the objective function value, not the sequence {(Uk, Vk)} itself. Moreover, they had to assume that the dependence of V on U is differentiable, which is unlikely to hold everywhere. Additionally, as it unfolds matrix U into a vector and adopt an () its memory requirement is very high, which prevents it from large scale computation. Recently, ADMM was used for matrix recovery. By assuming that the variables are bounded and convergent, Shen, Wen, and Zhang (2014) proved that any accumulation point of their algorithm is the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point. However, the method was only able to handle outliers with magnitudes comparable to the low rank matrix (Shen, Wen, and Zhang, 2014). Moreover, the penalty parameter was fixed, which was not easy to tune for fast convergence. Some researches (Zheng et al., 2012; Cabral et al., 2013) further extended that by adding different regularizations on (U, V ) and achieved state-of-the-art performance. As the convergence analysis in (Shen, Wen, and Zhang, 2014) cannot be directly extended, it remains unknown whether the iterates converge to KKT points. In this paper, we adopt the same formulation as (Cabral et al., 2013):\nmin U,V ‖W (M − UV T )‖1 + λu 2 ‖U‖2F + λv 2 ‖V ‖2F , (18)\nwhere the regularizers ‖U‖2F and ‖V ‖2F are for reducing the solution space (Buchanan and Fitzgibbon, 2005).\nNon-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) has been popular since the seminal work of Lee and Seung (2001). Kong, Ding, and Huang (2011) extended the squared `2 norm to the `21-norm for robustness. Recently, Pan et al. (2014) further introduced the `1-norm to handle outliers in non-negative dictionary learning, resulting in the following model:\nmin U≥0,V≥0 ‖M − UV T ‖1 + λu 2 ‖U‖2F + λv‖V ‖1, (19)\nwhere ‖U‖2F is added in to avoid the trivial solution and ‖V ‖1 is to induce sparsity. All the three NMF models use multiplicative updating schemes, which only differ in the weights used. The multiplicative updating scheme is intrinsically a globally majorant MM. Assuming that the iterates converge, they proved that the limit of sequence is a stationary point. However, Gonzalez and Zhang (2005) pointed out that with such a multiplicative updating scheme is hard to reach the convergence condition even on toy data."

      "text" : "Now we show how to find the minimizer of the convex Gk(∆U,∆V ) in (17). This can be easily done by using the linearized alternating direction method with parallel splitting and adaptive penalty (LADMPSAP) (Lin, Liu, and Li, 2013). LADMPSAP fits for solving the following linearly constrained separable convex programs:\nmin x1,··· ,xn n∑ j=1 fj(xj), s.t. n∑ j=1 Aj(xj) = b, (20)\nwhere xj and b could be either vectors or matrices, fj is a proper convex function, and Aj is a linear mapping.

Here we use the famous Oxford Dinosaur sequence 4, which consists of 36 images with a resolution of 720× 576 pixels. We pick out a portion of the raw feature points which are observed by at least 6 views (Fig. 3(a)). The observed matrix is of size 72 × 557 with a missing data ratio 79.5% and shows a band diagonal pattern. We register the image origin to the image center, (360, 288). We adopt the same initialization and parameter setting as the synthetic data above.\nFigures 3(b)-(d) show the full tracks reconstructed by all algorithms. As the dinosaur sequence is taken on a turntable,\n4http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/˜vgg/data1. html\nall the tracks are supposed to be circular. Among them, the tracks reconstructed by RMF-GMMM are the most inferior. UNuBi gives reasonably good results. However, most of the reconstructed tracks in large radii do not appear closed. Some tracks in the upper part are not reconstructed well either, including one obvious failure. In contrast, almost all the tracks reconstructed by RMF-LMMM are circular and appear closed, which are the most visually plausible. The lowest relative error also confirms the effectiveness of RMFLMMM.\nNon-negative Matrix Factorization: We test the performance of robust NMF by clustering (Kong, Ding, and Huang, 2011; Pan et al., 2014). The experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets of face images, which includes: AT&T, UMIST, a subset of PIE 5 and a subset of AR 6. We use the first 10 images in each class for PIE and the first 13 images for AR. The descriptions of the datasets are summarized in the second row of Table 2. The evaluation metrics we use here are accuracy (ACC), normalized mutual information (NMI) and purity (PUR) (Kong, Ding, and Huang, 2011; Pan et al., 2014). We change the regularization parameter λu to 2000/(m + n) and maintain λv as 20/(m + n). The number r of clusters is equal to the number of classes in each dataset. We adopt the initializations in (Kong, Ding, and Huang, 2011). Firstly, we use the principal component analysis (PCA) to get a subspace with dimension r. Then we employ k-means on the PCA-reduced data to get the clustering results V ′. Finally, V is initialized as V = V ′ + 0.3 and U is by computing the clustering centroid for each class. We empirically terminate `1-NMF, RMF-GMMM, and RMF-LMMM after 5000, 500, and 20 iterations, respectively. The clustering results are shown in the last three rows of Table 2. We can see that RMF-LMMM achieves tremendous improvements over the two majorant algorithms across all datasets. RMF-GMMM is also better than `1-NMF. The lowest relative error in the third row shows that RMF-LMMM can always approximate the measurement matrix much better than the other two.\n5http://www.zjucadcg.cn/dengcai/Data/data. html\n6http://www2.ece.ohio-state.edu/˜aleix/ ARdatabase.html"

Besides the local majorization condition, we only require that the difference between the directional derivatives of the objective function and its surrogate function vanishes when the number of iterations approaches infinity, which is a very weak condition. So our method can use a surrogate function that directly approximates the non-smooth objective function. In comparison, all the existing MM methods construct the surrogate function by approximating the smooth component of the objective function. We apply our relaxed MM methods to the robust matrix factorization (RMF) problem with different regularizations, where our locally majorant algorithm shows great advantages over the state-of-the-art approaches for RMF. This is the first algorithm for RMF ensuring, without extra assumptions, that any limit point of the iterates is a stationary point. Introduction Consider the following optimization problem:",
