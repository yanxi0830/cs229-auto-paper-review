      "text" : "In many machine learning and data mining applications, such as face recognition [1] [2], conceptual indexing [3], collaborative filtering [4], the dimensionality of the input data is usually very high. It is computationally expensive to analyze the highdimensional data directly. Meanwhile, the noise in a representation may dramatically increase as the dimensionality is getting high [5] [6] [7]. To improve the efficiency and accuracy, researchers have demonstrated that dimensionality reduction is one of the most effective approaches for data analysis, and plays a significant role in data mining. Because of its simplicity and effectiveness, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been widely applied to various applications. The goal of PCA is to find a projection matrix that maximizes the variance of the samples after the projection, while preserving the structure of the original dataset as much as possible. PCA seeks a linear projection for the original highdimensional feature vectors so as to obtain a low dimensional representation of data, which captures as much information as possible. One may obtain principal components (PCs) by performing singular value decomposition (SVD) of the original data matrix and choose the first k PCs to represent the data, which is a more compact feature representation. There are two main reasons why PCA usually obtains good\n• Xiaojun Chang and Yi Yang are with School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering, The University of Queensland, Australia.

(E-mail: feipingnie@gmail.com, heng@uta.edu).\nperformance in the real world applications: (1) all the PCs are uncorrelated; (2) minimal information loss is guaranteed by the fact that PCs sequentially capture maximum variability among columns of data matrix. Nevertheless, PCA still has some inherent drawbacks, which this paper will address. One problem of the classical PCA is that each PC is obtained by a linear combination of original variables and loadings are normally non-zero, which makes it often difficult to interpret the results. To address this problem, Hui Zou etal. integrate the lasso penalty [8], which is a variable selection technique, into the regression criterion in [9]. In their paper, they propose a new approach for estimating PCs with sparse loadings, sparse principal component analysis (SPCA). Lasso penalty is implemented via elastic net, which is a generalization of lasso proposed in [10]. However, their algorithm is non-convex and it is difficult to obtain the global optima. Thus the performance may vary dramatically with different local optima. Another drawback of the classical PCA methods is that they are least square estimation approaches, which are commonly known not to be robust in the sense that outlying measurements can arbitrarily skew the solution from the desired solution [11]. To make PCA robust to outliers, Xu etal. [12] propose to recover a low-rank matrix from highly corrupted measurements. It has been experimentally demonstrated in [11] that robust PCA gains promising performance on noisy data analysis. However, despite of its robustness to the outliers, the algorithm proposed in [11] is transductive, and is not able to deal with the out-of-sample data which are unseen during the training phrase. It is very restrictive to have all the data beforehand. Therefore, the robust PCA algorithm proposed in [12] is less practical for many real world\napplication. In this paper, we propose a novel convex sparse PCA for feature analysis. It has been demonstrated in [9] that the sparse model is a good measure for feature analysis, especially for feature weighting. We therefore impose the l2,1-norm on the regression coefficient so as to make our algorithm able to evaluate the importance of each feature. Besides, we adopt the l2,1norm based loss function, which is robust to the outliers, to achieve robust performance. Different from [13], our algorithm is inductive and can be directly used to map the unseen data which are outside the training set. We name the proposed algorithm Convex Sparse PCA (CSPCA). The main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:\n1) We have theoretically proved the equivalence of the classical PCA and low rank regression. 2) The proposed algorithm combines the recent advances of sparsity and robust PCA into a joint framework to leverage the mutual benefit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first convex sparse and robust PCA algorithm, which ensures our algorithm always achieves the global optima. 3) Different from the existing robust PCA algorithms [13] [14], which can only deal with the in-sample data, our algorithm is capable of mapping the data which are unseen during the training phase. 4) We propose an effective iterative algorithm to optimize the objective function, which simultaneously optimizes the l2,1-norm minimization and the trace norm minimization.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. We briefly review related work on PCA, sparse PCA and robust PCA in Section 2. Then we elaborate the formulation of our method in Section 3, followed by the proposed solution in Section 4. Extensive experiments are conducted in Section 5 to evaluate performance of the proposed algorithm. Section 6 concludes this paper."

Classical PCA techniques, also\nknown as Karhunen-Loeve methods, look for a dimensionality reducing linear projection that maximizes the total scatter of all projected data points. To be more specific, PCA computes the PCs by performing eigen-value decomposition of covariance of the convariance matrix of all training data.

      "text" : "A common limitation of the classical PCA is the lack of interpretability. All principal components are a linear combination of variables and most of the factor coefficients are non-zero. To get more interpretable results, sparse PCA is proposed, which leads to reduced computation time and improved generalization. There are numerous implementations of sparse PCA in the literature [15] [16] [17] [15] [18] [19]. The objectives of all the methods aim to reduce the dimensionality reduction and the number of explicitly used variables. A straightforward way is to manually set factor coefficients with values below a threshold to zero. This simple and naive thresholding method is often adopted in various applications. Nevertheless, it could be potentially misleading in different aspects. Jolliffe etal. propose SCoTLASS to obtain modified principal components with possible zero factor coefficients [18]. Lasso [8] has shown to be a effective variable selection method, which has been shown effective in a variety of applications. To further improve lasso, Zou etal. propose the elastic net in [10] for sparsity based mining. Based on the fact that PCA can be reformulated as regression-type optimization problem, Zou etal. [9] propose sparse PCA (SPCA) for estimating PCs with sparse factor coefficients, which can be formulated as follows:\nmin A,B\nn∑\ni=1\n‖xi −AB Txi‖ 2 + λ\nk∑\nj=1\n‖βj‖ 2 +\nk∑\nj=1\nλ1,j‖βj‖1,\ns.t. ATA = I\nwhere β is lasso estimates. All k components share the same λ and different λ1,j ’s are allowed for penalizing the loadings of different principal components. Although the algorithm has good performance and attracted more and more attention, it is non-convex and difficult to find the global optima."

      "text" : "The goal of robust PCA is to recover a low-rank matrix D from highly corrupted measurements X = D + E. The errors E are supposed to be sparsely supported.\nMotivated by recent research on the robust solution of over-determined linear systems of equations in the presence of arbitrary but sparse errors and computing low-rank matrix solutions to underdetermined linear equations, John etal. [13] propose exact recovery of corrupted low-rank matrices by convex optimization. A straightforward solution to robust PCA is to seek the matrix with the lowest rank that could have generated the data under the constraint of sparse errors. The objective function of robust PCA is formulated as follows:\nmin D ‖X −D‖0 + γrank(D) (1)\nHowever, since Eq. (1) involves l0-norm, the objective function is highly non-convex and it is difficult to find an efficient solution. To obtain a tractable optimization problem, it is nature to replace the l0norm with l1-norm and the rank with the trace norm. The objective function can be rewritten as:\nmin D ‖X −D‖1 + γ‖D‖∗ (2)\nTo make the objective function robust to outliers, we further replace l1-norm with l2,1-norm as l2,1-norm is indicated to make the objective function robust to outliers in [14]. The objective function arrives at:\nmin D ‖X −D‖2,1 + γ‖D‖∗ (3)\nAlthough the robust PCA has attracted much research attention in recent years, it still has a major limitation. As the robust PCA is transductive, despite of its good performance, it cannot be applied to outof-sample problems. In other words, it cannot map the data, which are outside the training set, into the low dimensional subspace."

      "text" : "The proposed CSPCA is designed upon our recent finding that the classical PCA can be reformulated as a regression problem. This conclusion provides us with new insights of PCA in a different perspective, and enables us to design the new convex sparse PCA algorithm. We begin the following theorem.\nTheorem 1. The classical PCA can be reformulated as a low-rank regression optimization problem as follows:\nmin rank(W )=k\n‖WTX −X‖2F (4)\nProof: As we have the constraint rank(W ) = k, we can easily write W = BAT , where A ∈ Rd×k is an orthogonal matrix, B ∈ Rd×k and the rank of both A and B are k. The above objective function can be rewritten as follows:\nmin A,B∈Rd×k,ATA=I\n‖ABTX −X‖2F\n= min A,b∈Rd×k,ATA=I\nTr(BTXXTB)− 2Tr(BTXXTA).\n(5) By setting the derivatives of (5) w.r.t B to zero, we\nhave:\nXXTB = XXTA (6)\nBy denoting X = UΣV T , U⊥ as orthogonal complement standard basis vectors of U and B = Uα+U⊥β (β is an arbitrary vector), we have the following mathematical deduction:\nXXTB = XXTA\n⇒UΣ2UT (Uα+ U⊥β) = UΣ2UTA\n⇒UΣ2α = UΣ2UTA\n⇒α = UTA.\n(7)\nHence, we have B = UUTA+U⊥β. By incorporating B into (4), we obtain:\nmin β,ATA=I\n‖AATUUTX +AβT (U⊥)TX −X‖2F\n⇒ min β,ATA=I\n‖AATUUTUΣV T +AβT (U⊥)TUΣV T −X‖2F\n⇒ min ATA=I\n‖AATX −X‖2F .\n(8) Hence, we have A = U1Q, where Q is an arbitrary orthogonal matrix. And we can get\nB = UUTA+ U⊥β = UUTU1Q+ U ⊥β = U1Q+ U ⊥β (9) With the obtained A and B, we can get:\nW = ABT = U1Q(U1Q+ U ⊥β)T\n= U1U T 1 + U1Qβ\nTU⊥ T (10)\nThe projected samples can be obtained as follows:\nWTX = ABTX = U1U T 1 UΣV T + U1Qβ TU⊥\nT UΣV T\n= U1Σ1V1, (11)\nwhich is equivalent to projected samples obtained by classical PCA.\nThe connection between the stated Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 in [9]: Zou etal. claim that when λ > 0, PCA problem can be transformed into a regressiontype problem by the following Theorem:\nTheorem 2. For any λ > 0, let\n(α̂, β̂) = min α,β\nn∑\ni=1\n‖xi − αβ T xi‖ 2 + λ‖β‖2\ns.t. ‖α‖2 = 1.\n(12)\nIn the above theorem, β is the lasso estimates and β̂ ∝ the space of PCA. Compared with Theorem 2 proposed in [9], our contribution is that we prove that when λ = 0, PCA problem is completely equivalent to a regression-type problem."

      "heading" : "3.2 The Proposed Objective Function",
      "text" : "In this section, we detail the proposed objective function of SCPCA. Motivated by previous work [20], which demonstrate that l2,1-norm of W is capable of making W sparse, we propose our sparse PCA algorithm as follows:\nmin rank(W )=k\n‖(WTX −X)T ‖22 + α‖W‖2,1, (13)\nwhere l2,1-norm of W is defined as\n‖W‖2,1 =\nd∑\ni=1\n√√√√ d∑\nj=1\nW 2ij .\nIn the above function, ‖WTX−X‖22 is the most commonly used least square loss function and is mathematically tractable and easily implemented. However, there are still some existing issues which need to take into further consideration. For example, it is well known that the least square loss function is very sensitive to outliers [20]. To address this issue, it is important for us to adopt a more robust loss function in the objective. In [20], Nie etal. demonstrate that l2,1norm is more capable of dealing with the noisy data. Therefore, our proposed algorithm is rewritten as follows:\nmin rank(W )=k\n‖(WTX −X)T ‖2,1 + α‖W‖2,1 (14)\nIn the above formulation, the loss function ‖WTX− X‖2,1 is robust to outliers, as proven in [20]. Meanwhile, ‖W‖2,1 in the regularization term is guaranteed to make W sparse in rows. Next, we first give the definition of trace norm. The trace norm of W is defined as\n‖W‖∗ = Tr(WW T )\n1 2 . (15)\nFollowing the work in [13] [21], we restrict W to be a low rank matrix. To have the problem tackable, we propose to minimize the trace norm ofW , which is the convex hull of the rank of W . The objective function of the proposed algorithm is then given by:\nmin W\n‖(WTX −X)T ‖2,1 + α‖W‖2,1 + β‖W‖∗ (16)\nCompared with directly minimizing the rank of W , our proposed objective function as shown in (16) is convex. We therefore name the proposed algorithm\nconvex sparse PCA (CSPCA). Different from the previous robust PCA algorithms [13] [14], the proposed algorithm is inductive, and able to deal with the out-of-sample data which are unseen in the training phase. Given a new testing data point xt, we can get its low dimensional representation by WTxt directly."

Hence, we proposed to solve this problem as follows. For an arbitrary matrix A, we denote A = [A1, · · · , Ad], where d is the number of features. By setting the derivatives w.r.t W to zero, we have\nXD1X TW + αD2W + βD3W = XD1X.\nThen we have\nW = (XD1X T + αD2 + βD3) −1(XD1X T ), (17)\nwhere D1, D2 and D3 are diagonal matrices defined as follows.\nD1 =   1 2‖e1‖2\n. . . 1\n2‖ed‖2\n ,\nwhere E = (WTX −X)T .\nD2 =   1 2‖w1‖2\n. . . 1\n2‖wd‖2\n \nD3 = 1 2 (WW T )− 1 2\nBased on the above mathematical deduction, we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize the objective function Eq.

Once W is obtained and a new data point xi, we get the projected representation by computing WTxi. As the project matrix W is sparse, it actually assigned a weight to each feature dimension and thus can be used for feature analysis. The importance score of each feature can be computed by ‖wi‖2(1 ≤ i ≤ d). Then we can rank each feature according to this score. In this sense, W can be readily used for feature selection and we only select the top k features based on the score ‖wi‖2(1 ≤ i ≤ d)."

From the experimental results, we have the following observations.\n1) The feature selection algorithms generally have better performance than the baseline All-Fea, which demonstrates that feature selection is necessary and effective. It can significantly reduce feature number as well as improve the performance. 2) Both SPEC and MCFS utilize a two-step approach (spectral regression) for feature selection. The difference between them is MCFS select features in a batch mode but SPEC conduct this task separately. We can see MCFS gets better results than SPEC because it is a better way to analyze features jointly for feature selection. 3) We can see from the result tables that UDFS gains the second best result, which indicates that it is beneficial to analyze features jointly and simultaneously adopt discriminative information and local structure of data distribution. 4) From the experimental results, we can observe that the proposed CSPCA consistently outperform the other compared algorithms. This phenomenon demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to select the most informative features."

      "text" : "As the goal of feature selection is to boost accuracy and computation efficiency, experiments are conducted to learn how the number of selected features can affect the clustering performance. From these experiments we can see the general trade-off between performance and computational efficiency over all the used dataset. Fig. 1 shows the performance variance with right to the number of selected features in terms of clustering ACC. From the results, we have the following observations:\n1) When the number of selected features is too small, the clustering ACC is not competitive with using all features without feature selection, which is mainly caused by too much information loss. For example, when only 500 features are selected on YaleB, the clustering ACC is relatively low, at only 0.164. 2) As the number of selected features increases, the clustering ACC rises before its peak in general\non all the used datasets. How many features are selected to get the peak level is different on different datasets. 3) The trend of clustering ACC are varying when different datasets are used. For example, the clustering ACC keeps stable from using 800 features to using 1000 features for YaleB while drops for the other used datasets. The different variance shown on the six datasets are supposed to be related to the properties of the datasets. 4) After all the features are used (without feature selection), the clustering ACC are generally lower than the peak level on all the datasets. We can safely conclude that as the clustering ACC increases, the proposed algorithm is capable of reducing noise and selecting the most discriminating features."

From this figure, we learn that the clustering performance changes corresponding to different combinations of α and β. The impact of different combinations of regularization parameters are supposed to be related to the individual properties of the datasets. On the used datasets, we can observe that better experimental results are obtained when the two regularization parameters α and β are comparable."

      "text" : "In this paper, we have proposed a novel convex sparse PCA and applied it to feature analysis. We first prove that PCA can be formulated as a low-rank regression\noptimization problem. We further incorporate the l2,1norm minimization into the proposed algorithm to make the regression coefficients sparse and make the model robust to the outliers. Different from state-ofthe-art robust PCA, the proposed algorithm is capable of solving out-of-sample problems. Additionally, we propose an efficient algorithm to optimize the objective function.\nTo validate the performances of our algorithm for feature analysis, we conduct experiments on six realworld datasets on clustering. It can be seen from the experimental reuslts that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection as well as the baseline using all features. Therefore, we conclude that the proposed algorithm is a robust sparse feature analysis method,\nand its benefits make it especially suitable for feature selection."

    "abstractText" : "Principal component analysis (PCA) has been widely applied to dimensionality reduction and data pre-processing for different applications in engineering, biology and social science. Classical PCA and its variants seek for linear projections of the original variables to obtain a low dimensional feature representation with maximal variance. One limitation is that it is very difficult to interpret the results of PCA. In addition, the classical PCA is vulnerable to certain noisy data. In this paper, we propose a convex sparse principal component analysis (CSPCA) algorithm and apply it to feature analysis. First we show that PCA can be formulated as a low-rank regression optimization problem. Based on the discussion, the l2,1-norm minimization is incorporated into the objective function to make the regression coefficients sparse, thereby robust to the outliers. In addition, based on the sparse model used in CSPCA, an optimal weight is assigned to each of the original feature, which in turn provides the output with good interpretability. With the output of our CSPCA, we can effectively analyze the importance of each feature under the PCA criteria. The objective function is convex, and we propose an iterative algorithm to optimize it. We apply the CSPCA algorithm to feature selection and conduct extensive experiments on six different benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection algorithms.",
