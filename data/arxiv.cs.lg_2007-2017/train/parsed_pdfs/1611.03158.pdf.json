      "text" : "In recent years, rapid progress in robotics and artificial intelligence have accelerated the need for efficient path-planning algorithms in high-dimensional spaces. In particular, there has been vast interest in the development of autonomous cars and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for civilian purposes [3,4,7,21,23,25]. As such systems grow in complexity, development of algorithms that can tractably control them in high-dimensional state spaces will become necessary.\nHamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a theoretically important and practically powerful tool for analyzing a large\n∗* All three authors contributed equally to this work.\nACM ISBN 978-1-4503-2138-9.\nDOI: 10.1145/1235\nrange of systems. It has been extensively studied in [5, 9, 20, 22, 27, 30, 35, 36], and successfully applied to many lowdimensional real world systems [12,16,30]. The core idea of reachability analysis is to compute the reachable set, which represents the set of states from which the system can be driven into a target set. From the reachable set, the optimal control for reaching the target set can be synthesized. Unfortunately, current state-of-the-art numerical methods for computing reachable sets discretize the state space, resulting in space and time complexities that scale exponentially with the system dimension.\nIn an effort to overcome the curse of dimensionality, many methods which heavily restrict the system at hand have been proposed. For example, one method requires the system dynamics to be polynomial [18, 26], while another method requires the Hamiltonian to be a function of only the controlled variable [15]. There are also less restrictive methods using projections, approximate dynamic programming, and approximate systems decoupling [11, 28, 31], each with its own limitations in flexibility, scalability, and degree of conservatism.\nOne of the main drawbacks of reachability analysis and other dynamic programming-based approaches is the need to compute a value function over a large portion of the state space. This is computationally wasteful since the value function, from which the optimal controller is derived, is only needed along a trajectory from the system’s initial state to the target set. A more efficient approach would be to only compute the value function local to the trajectory from the initial state to the target set. However, there is no way of knowing where such a trajectory will lie before thoroughly computing the value function.\nMethods that exploit machine learning have great potential because they are state discretization-free and do not depend on the dynamic programming principle. Unfortunately, many machine learning techniques cannot make the guarantees provided by reachability analysis. For instance, [8] and [24] use neural networks (NNs) as nonlinear optimizers to synthesize trajectories which may not be dynamically feasible. The authors in [2] propose a supervised learningbased algorithm that depends heavily on feature tuning and design, making its application to high-dimensional problems cumbersome. In [17] and [32], the authors successfully use NNs for approximating the value function, but the approximation is not guaranteed to be conservative.\nIn this paper, we attempt to combine the best features of both reachability and machine learning using an NN-based algorithm. Our proposed grid-free method conservatively\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n03 15\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n0 N\nov 2\n01 6\napproximates the time-to-reach (TTR) representation of a reachable set in only a region around a feasible trajectory. Unlike previous machine learning techniques, our technique guarantees a direction of conservatism, and unlike previous dynamic programming-based methods, our approach involves an NN that effectively figures out the relevant region in which a value function is required. Our contributions will be presented as follows:\n• In Section 2, we summarize HJ reachability as well as the formalisms used for this work.\n• In Sections 3 and 4, we present the two phases of our proposed algorithm and the underlying design choices. In particular, we show the guaranteed feasibility and conservatism properties of our framework.\n• In Section 5, we develop, apply, and validate our method on the Dubins car model and discuss our numerical results. Here, we will illustrate our guaranteed-conservative approximation of the TTR function, and the resulting near-optimal trajectories.\n• Finally, in Section 6, we discuss future directions, including applying the method to higher-dimensional systems."

      "text" : "2.1.1 System Dynamics Consider a dynamical system governed by the following\nordinary differential equation (ODE):\nẋ = f(x, u), u ∈ U (1)\nHere, x ∈ Rn is the state of the system and the control function u(·) is assumed to be drawn from the set of measurable functions1. Let us further assume that the system dynamics f : Rn × U → Rn are uniformly continuous, bounded, and Lipschitz continuous in x for fixed u. Denote the function space from which f is drawn as F.\nWith these assumptions, given some initial state x, initial time t0, and control function u(·) ∈ U, there exists a unique trajectory solving (1). We refer to trajectories of (1) starting from state x and time t0 as ξ(t;x, t0, u(·)). Trajectories satisfy an initial condition and (1) almost everywhere:\nd dt ξf (t;x, t0, u(·)) = f(ξf (t;x, t0, u(·)), u(t))\nξf (t0;x, t0, u(·)) = x (2)\nThroughout the paper, we will extensively use the backwardtime dynamics ẋ = −f(x, u), whose trajectories will be denoted ξ−f (t;x, t0, u(·)). Note that 1A function f : X → Y between two measurable spaces (X,ΣX) and (Y,ΣY ) is said to be measurable if the preimage of a measurable set in Y is a measurable set in X, that is: ∀V ∈ ΣY , f1(V ) ∈ ΣX , with ΣX ,ΣY σ-algebras on X,Y .\nxf = ξ f (tf ;x0, t0, u(·))⇔ x0 = ξ−f (tf ;xf , t0, u(·)) (3)\n2.1.2 Minimum Time-To-Reach In this paper we consider a particular formulation of the\nreachability problem, which we will refer to as the time-toreach (TTR) problem. In this context, we would like to find the minimum time the system needs to reach a target set L from a starting point x. Without loss of generality (WLOG), we assume the starting time is t0 = 0, and define the TTR function as follows:\nDefinition 1. Time-to-reach function.\nφ(x) = min u(·)∈U min t {ξf (t;x, 0, u(·)) ∈ L} (4)\nThere are many HJ formulations for obtaining the TTR function φ(x) [6, 10, 30]. For example, φ(x) is the viscosity solution [13] of the following HJ PDE [37]:\nmin u∈U {−∇φ(x) · f(x, u)− 1} = 0 ∀x /∈ L\nφ(x) = 0 ∀φ ∈ L (5)\nAfter obtaining the solution φ(x), the optimal control, which drives the system to the set L in minimum, can be extracted as follows:\nu∗(x) = arg min u∈U ∇φ(x) · f(x, u) (6)\nIn general, numerical methods for finding φ(x) such as the one outlined in [37], as well as many others [29, 33, 34], involve representing the state space on a grid, leading to an exponentially scaling computation complexity with respect to the system dimension."

      "heading" : "2.2 Goal",
      "text" : "In this paper, we seek to overcome the exponentially scaling computation complexity. Our approach is inspired by two inherent challenges that dynamic programming-based methods face.\nFirst, since only relatively mild assumptions are placed on the system dynamics (1), optimal trajectories are a priori unknown and could essentially trace out any arbitrary path in the state space. Dynamic programming ignores this issue by considering all possible behaviors of the trajectory. Numerical methods are needed to obtain dynamic programming solutions, leading to the necessity of discretizing the state space.\nSecond, in a practical setting, the system starts at some particular state x. Thus, the optimal control, and in particular∇φ(x) in (6), is needed only along the optimal trajectory. However, again, since the optimal trajectory is a priori unknown, dynamic programming-based approaches resort to computing φ(x) over a very large portion of the state space so that the ∇φ(x) is available regardless of where the optimal trajectory happens to be.\nIn this paper, we propose a method that, in contrast to dynamic programming-based methods,\n1. has a sub-exponential complexity scaling with repsect to the state space dimension;\n2. is applicable to higher-order or more complex systems without changing the NN architecture or dynamic training procedure;\n3. generates an approximate TTR function from which a controller that drives the system to the target can be synthesized;\n4. guarantees a direction of conservatism, despite the use of an NN.\nWe enforce 1) by avoiding operations that exhaustively search the state space. As seen in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, the training and final data sets are either generated randomly or outputted by the NN, both constant time operations. Furthermore, we rely on NNs being universal function approximators [14] to make our method general to the system dynamics, thus satisfying 2). While our method does have some limitations, as discussed at the end of Section 3.1, we do not believe that these limitations are restrictive in the context of reachability analysis. Our post processing of the NN outputs outlined in Section 4 satisfies 3). Finally, we use the dynamics of the system to ensure our final output satisfies 4); this is detailed in Section 3.3.\nOur method overcomes the challenges faced by dynamic programming-based in two phases: the NN training phase, which allows the NN to learn the inverse backward system dynamics, and the controller synthesis phase, which uses the NN to obtain TTR approximations that can be used to synthesize a controller."

      "text" : "Given a target state xL and assuming the system starts at some initial state x̄, we want to design an NN that can produce a control function u(·) that drives the system from x̄ to xL. Equivalently, u(·) should drive the backward system from xL to x̄. Since the NN is not perfect, it can only be expected to produce approximate control functions ûi(·) that drive the backward system from xL to x̂i. If the NN is well-trained, then each x̂i would be very close to x̄.\nMore concretely, consider the inverse backward dynamics of the system, denoted g : Rn × F→ U, and defined to be\ng(x̄, xL;−f(·, ·)) = u∗(·) (7)\nwhere the optimal control u∗(·) is defined in the time interval [0, φ(x̄)]. Given the u∗(·), we have x̄ = ξ−f (φ(x̄);xL, 0, u∗(·)).\nOur NN is an approximation to g, and we will denote the NN as ĝ. Let û(·) be the control produced by ĝ, and let the time interval for which û(·) is defined be denoted [0, T̂ ] . In general, applying û(·) brings the backward system from xL to some x̂ 6= x̄. Regardless of what x̂ happens to be, T̂ is guaranteed to be an over-approximation of φ(x̂): φ̂(x̂) = T̂ ≥ φ(x̂). This is because the point x̂ is generated from simulation, and therefore the corresponding TTR T̂ cannot possibly be smaller than the optimal TTR φ(x̂). If\nwe can obtain the φ̂(x) for many values of x near x̄, then we would be able to synthesize a suboptimal control via (6).\nDenote the maximum value of φ we would like to approximate as T̄ . To reduce the space in which the NN needs to look for candidate control functions, we assume that û(·) returned by the NN is composed of two finite sequences {uj}Kj=1, {τ j}Kj=1 called the sequence of control primitives\nx\nu PRIMITIVE DURATION\n0\nn\nN\nPLANT\nx U[N]\nPRIMITIVE DURATION\n0\nn\nN\nPLANT\nOUTPUT\nn\nP [n] D [n]\nn\nP [n] ~\nn\nFigure 1: Four-layer RRNN which takes input states and outputs discretized control.\nand the sequence of time durations respectively.

The input of the RRNN is x̄ (X [0] = x̄), and the output is some û(·) (U [N ] = û(·)), that approximately brings the system from x̄ to xL. The parameters we learn through training are the weights WP , WD1 , WD2 , WL, WX and biases bP , bD, bL, bX . All weights and biases will be collectively denoted W. The training is performed with the mean squared error as the cost function.\nAs already mentioned, the primitive layer takes a state as input and computes a control primitive. The duration layer takes in the primitive layer’s output and the same input state, and outputs a time duration. This time duration is then passed through the control (also called output) linear layer, which outputs the sequences {uj}, {τ j} representing the control function û(·). Afterwards, the control function is fed into the plant layer, which attempst to encode the backward dynamics −f . The plant’s output state, X [n+1], is then fed back to the primitive layer.\nIn order to ensure WX , or the plant layer weights, are accurate, they are initialized by an isolated supervised train-\ning process. The training set we use to perform the isolated training is detailed in 3.2. Intuitively, by initializing WX , we are giving the RRNN an initial idea of the backward dynamics before learning the inverse backward dynamics. Explicitly, the RRNN can be written as\nĝ(x̄, xL;−f(·, ·),W) = û(·) = U [N ] (9) where û(·) is given in the form of the sequences {uj}, {τ j}, from which we can obtain T̂ = ∑N j=1 τ\nj .

A state x, an accept region R, and a decay rate λ are required as inputs.\nIn Alg. 1, we first compute xproj, the Euclidean projection of the state x onto the set R as follows:\nxproj = min x′ ‖x′ − x‖2 : x′ ∈ R (10)\nUsing the accept-reject algorithm, we generate two training sets.

The result of dynamic training is a set of states X which contains many points near x̄, and the corresponding set of controls V that drives the system from the states X to xL. The procedure is shown in detail in Alg. 2, and can bebroken down into the following steps:\n1. Initialization (lines 3-5)\n2. Train RRNN by updating the weights W (line 8)\n3. Filter RRNN outputs Xnew in current iteration (lines 9-24)\n4. Filter RRNN training set X from previous iterations (line 25-32)\n5.

Dynamic training initialization requires the following inputs: the dataset D2, the state x̄, the desired accept region radius , the number of desired samples M in that region, the iteration iterps after which we want to activate pruning of the D2, the maximum desired number of states Mmax near x̄, and the maximum number of training iterations itermax. In addition, three different accept regions, denoted RO,RPS,RITS, are required. Suggestions on choosing RO,RPS,RITS for the Dubins car example are given in Section 5.4.1.\nWe first initialize X to be X = D2. Next, we uniformly sample M states within a distance of to x̄ to produce a set of states denoted E .\n3.3.2 Neural Network and Output Filtering We now input the states in E to the RRNN to produce M\ncontrols, {ûi(·)}M i=1, from which we compute the resulting set of states {x̂i}M i=1 according to the dynamics (1). Next, we add {x̂i}M i=1 to a temporary set denoted Xnew.\nTo avoid training on data points far from the target, the exponential accept-reject filter (Alg. 1) is applied to the states in Xnew, with the accept region RO. RO depends on the system dynamics and is generally tuned; usually, it should contains states that could lie on a feasible path from x̄ to xL. For general high-dimensional systems with complicated dynamics, it may be difficult to estimate RO, and RO can be tuned based on the performance of RRNN.\n3.3.3 Previous State Filtering This part of the algorithm filters out states from previous\ntraining iterations using the accept region RPS. Such a filter reduces the likelihood that old data from many iterations ago affect the performance of the RRNN adversely.\n3.3.4 Initial Training Set Filtering In early iterations of training, states from the initial train-\ning set D2 provide the general information about the system dynamics needed for the RRNN to explore the state space. However, after sufficient exploration, the RRNN gains information about the system dynamics specific for reaching x̄; thus, the data in D2 becomes less important. Hence, once the number of training iterations exceeds a threshold iterps, we prune states from the D2 using the accept region denoted by RITS, chosen to remove states in D2 that are far from xL.\nAt this point in the algorithm, we also update the set X by adding to it the states in Xnew. We do the same for the corresponding set of controls V. We then feed the updated X and V back into the RRNN and the algorithm begins a new iteration."

      "text" : "In [19], the author shows that all optimal trajectories of the Dubins car utilize controls that represent going straight or turning maximally left or right. Thus, the set of controls that are valid for generating optimal trajectories can be reduced down to three motion primitives, {‘L’, ‘S’, ‘R’}, encoding the controls u = 1 (max left), u = 0 (straight), and u = −1 (max right) respectively. Furthermore, [19] also shows that for any given x̄ and xL, the optimal control is a sequence of at most three of these motion primitives. In other words, the optimal control for any given target state is simply a permutation of {‘L’, ‘S’, ‘R’} with an appropriate\ntime duration associated with each primitive. Since these motion primitives correspond to arcs and line segments, the optimal trajectories for Dubins car can be geometrically interpreted as concatenated sequences of arcs and line segments.\nFollowing our notation in Section 3, any optimal control sequence can be written as {u1, u2, u3}, {τ1, τ2, τ3} where ui denotes the ith control primitive and τ i denotes the duration of ith control primitive. We choose ui from the three possible optimal values {−1, 0, 1}. The initial dataset D2 for dynamic training is composed of control primitives with duration randomly sampled from the interval [0, T ], T = 2π. With our choice of T , the maximum time horizon considered is then 3T = 6π."

Since the controls and dynamics of Dubins car are simple, we have chosen the hidden sizes of P,D,U,X to be [10, 10, 6, 75], respectively.

The training function used for the full NN is resilient back-propagation and the performance function used is mean squared error."

      "text" : "Running the dynamic training algorithm on even the lowdimensional Dubins Car results in significant memory usage savings compared to using dynamic programming-based methods. As the NN learns the inverse backward system dynamics g, a dynamically feasible “corridor” between the initial state x̄ and target state xL is picked out, as shown in Fig. 4. Without our proposed method, if one chooses some arbitrary region enclosing x̄ and xL, and naively computes the TTR function φ(x) using level set methods, it is unlikely that the a solution can be found throughout the entire corridor, since the region may not contain dynamically feasible trajectories.\nBefore dynamic training, we first initialize the weights WX . This is done using the dataset D1, which is generated by random sampling. Exploiting the fact that there are only six optimal control primitives for the Dubins car, we sample the u = ±1 primitives 25 times less frequently than the u = 0 primitive. For the possible durations of each primitive, τ i, we randomly sampled in the interval [0, T ], T = 100 according to a linearly increasing probability distribution on [0, T ]. This distribution is chosen so that starting from xL, the backward dynamics drive the system to a relatively uniform distribution of states x̄.\nFor generating the dataset D2, we follow a similar procedure to generating D1, except we sample time durations τ i in the interval [0, T ], T = 2π.\nTo initialize the dynamic training process, we chose = 1, and M = 500, itermax = 50, Mmax = 10000, iterps = 5.\n5.4.1 Filtering Algorithms For the exponential filtering process, RO is chosen to be\nthe cone of minimum size that contains the epsilon ball, with the tip of the cone located at x̄. The choice of using a conical filter is based on the hypothesis that a trajectory taking the system from x̄ to xL is likely to stay in the cone RO. RPS was chosen to be a sphere around x̄ to serve as a\nmore stringent filter than the cone filter. RITS was chosen to be a spherical target filter as well, since the initial training set is supposed to be pruned only when the NN has already learned to drive the system to x̄ reasonably well. The conical and spherical target filters are shown in Fig. 5a and Fig. 5b respectively.\n5.4.2 Filter Decay Rate: Setting and Timing Although RO,RPS,RITS are chosen before the dynamic\ntraining process, the filtering of the training set X can still be adjusted while training. This is done by varying the parameters λO, λPS, λITS. In early training iterations, we want to decrease λO slightly to ensure that we are not filtering out states needed for the NN to explore the state space. Once the NN has gained a better understanding of how to reach x̄, we increase λO and λITS slightly to further encourage the NN to drive states near x̄. When the dataset is mostly near x̄, we increase λPS and λITS significantly."

      "text" : "5.5.1 Training Process In Fig. 6a, 6b, 6c, the process by which the training set X\nchanges from the initial training set D2 to an -ball around x̄ = (15, 12, 3) is shown. Here, the red states represent the set E and the black states represent the states in X . In the\nearly iterations (Fig. 6a), the NN explores outward from the initial training set, frequently making mistakes, resulting in the states in X being very far away from x̄. As the iteration number increases, the training set D2 is filtered out, and eventually the NN tends to output controls ûi(·) that produces states x̂i in an arc. This can be seen in Fig. 6b. By the end of the training process, the RO conical target filter prunes the states outside of the -ball. This can be seen in Fig. 6c.\n5.5.2 TTR Value Comparison The true TTR values φ(x) and the approximate TTR val-\nues φ̂(x) determined by the NN output of several states are compared in Table 1.\nThe difference between φ(x) and φ̂(x) is not very large. In\nfact, φ̂(x) is sometimes even smaller than φ(x). Our method\nguarantees that φ̂(x) is a conservative approximation – an over-approximation. The larger φ(x) values are likely due to numerical error in the level set methods used. In our particular example, the target set is a single state, making a level set representation of the target set very difficult. However, a singleton target set does not limit our NN-based approach in any way.\n5.5.3 Computation Complexity Synthesizing control using our NN-based approach allows\nfor large time complexity improvements in comparison to using level set methods. On a 2012 MacBook Pro laptop, data generation requires approximately 3 minutes, and controller synthesis from this data and simulation requires approximately 23 minutes. Since the region of the state space we are considering is quite large, and the target set is quite small (a singleton), the level set methods approach is intractable on this laptop, and requires 4 days on a desktop computer with a Core i7-5820K processor and 128 GB of RAM.\nThere are also large spatial savings by using the NN. For example, X and φ̂(x), x ∈ X for one particular corridor computed between (10,−1,−3) and (0, 0, 0) requires only 179 MB of RAM, while a reachable set computed over that horizon on a very low resolution grid requires approximately 7 GB of RAM.\nAs can be seen from this and the previous sections, using level set methods not only is more time-consuming compared to using our NN-based approach, but also does not guarantee a more shorter trajectory due to discretization error."

      "text" : "Our NN-based grid-free method computes an upper bound of the optimal TTR function in a region of the state space that contains the initial state, the target set, and a feasible trajectory. By combining the strengths of dynamic programming-based and machine learning-based approaches,\nwe greatly alleviate the curse of dimensionality while maintaining a desired direction of conservatism, effectively avoiding the shortcomings of both types of approaches.\nUsing a numerical example, we demonstrate that our approach can successfully generate near-optimal TTR values in multiple test cases for the Dubins car. Due to our method being grid-free, in some cases the estimated TTR values are even smaller than the those computed by level set methods, which suffer from discretization error. In addition, we are able to approximate TTR values in regions that are very far from the target set, a very computationally expensive task for dynamic programming-based approaches. Our approximate TTR function is able to drive the Dubins car from many different initial conditions to the target set.\nAlthough our current results are promising, much more investigation is still needed to make our approach more practical and applicable to more scenarios. For example, better intuition for the choice of accept regions in the filtering process is needed to extend our approach to other systems. We currently plan to investigate applying our method to the 6D engine-out plane [1] as well as a 12D quadrotor model. In addition to path planning, we also hope to extend our theory to provide safety guarantees and robustness against disturbances. Such extensions are non-trivial due to the different roles that the control and disturbance inputs play in the system dynamics."

Unfortunately, using the state-of-the-art dynamic programming-based approaches, HJ reachability is intractable for systems with more than five dimensions because its computational complexity scales exponentially with system dimension. To sidestep the curse of dimensionality, we propose an algorithm that leverages a neural network to approximate the minimum time-to-reach function to synthesize controls. We show that our neural network generates near optimal controls which are guaranteed to successfully drive the system to a target state. Our framework is not dependent on state space discretization, leading to a significant reduction in computation time and space complexity in comparison with dynamic programming-based approaches. Using this grid-free approach also enables us to plan over longer time horizons with relatively little additional computation overhead. Unlike many previous neural network reachability formulations, our approximation is conservative and hence any trajectories we generate will be strictly feasible. For demonstration, we specialize our new general framework to the Dubins car model and discuss how the general framework can be applied to other models with higher-dimensional state spaces.",
