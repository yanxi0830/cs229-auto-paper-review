      "text" : "Cleaning noise-corrupted data, i.e., denoising, is a ubiquotous problem in signal processing and machine learning. Discrete denoising, in particular, focuses on the cases in which both the underlying clean and noisy data take their values in some finite set. Such setting covers several applications in different domains, such as image denoising [17, 14], DNA sequence denoising[12], and channel decoding[16].\nA conventional approach for addressing the denoising problem is the Bayesian approach, which can often yield a computatioanlly efficient algorithm with reasonable performance. However, limitations can arise when the assumed stochastic models do not accurately reflect the real data distribution. Particularly, while the models for the noise can often be obtained relatively reliably, obtaining the accurate model for the original clean data is more tricky; the model for the clean data may be wrong, changing, or may not exist at all.\nIn order to alleviate the above mentioned limitations, [22] proposed a universal approach for discrete denoising. Namely, they first considered a general setting that the clean finite-valued source symbols are corrupted by a discrete memoryless channel (DMC), a noise mechanism that corrupts each source symbol independently and statistically identically. Then, they devised an algorithm called DUDE (Discrete Universal DEnoiser) and showed rigorous performance guarantees for the semi-stochastic setting; namely, that where no stochastic modeling assumptions are made on the underlying source data, while the corruption mechanism is assumed to be governed by a known DMC. DUDE is shown to universally attain the optimum denoising performance for any source data as the data size grows.\nIn addition to the strong theoretical performance guarantee, DUDE can be implemented as a computationally efficient sliding window denoiser; hence, it has been successfully applied and extended to some practical applications, e.g., [17, 12, 16, 14]. However, it also had limitations; namely, the performance is sensitive on the choice of sliding window size k, which has to be hand-tuned without any systematic rule. Moreover, when k becomes large and the alphabet size of the signal increases, DUDE suffers from the data sparsity problem, which significantly deteriorates the performance.\n∗Corresponding author.\nar X\niv :1\n60 5.\n07 77\n9v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n4 A\nug 2\n01 6\nIn this paper, we present a novel framework of addressing above limitations of DUDE by adopting the machineries of deep neural networks (DNN) [7], which recently have seen great empirical success in many practical applications. While there have been some previous attempts of applying neural networks to grayscale image denoising [4, 24], they all remained in supervised learning setting, i.e., large-scale training data that consists of clean and noisy image pairs was necessary. Such approach requires significant computation resources and training time and is not always transferable to other denoising applications, in which collecting massive training data is often expensive, e.g., DNA sequence denoising [11].\nHenceforth, we stick to the setting of DUDE, which requires no additional data other than the given noisy data. In this case, however, it is not straightforward to adopt DNN since there is no ground-truth label for supervised training of the networks. Namely, the target label that a denoising algorithm is trying to estimate from the observation is the underlying clean signal, hence, it can never be observed to the algorithm. Therefore, we carefully exploit the known DMC assumption and the finiteness of the data values, and devise “pseudo-labels” for training DNN. They are based on the unbiased estimate of the true loss a denoising algorithm is incurring, and we show that it is possible to train a DNN as a universal discrete denoiser using the devised pseudo-labels and generalized cross-entropy objective function. As a by-product, we also obtain an accurate estimator of the true denoising performance, with which we can systematically choose the appropriate window size k. In results, we experimentally verify that our DNN based denoiser, dubbed as Neural DUDE, can achieve significantly better performance than DUDE maintaining robustness with respect to k. Furthermore, we note that although the work in this paper is focused on discrete denoising, we believe the proposed framework can be extended to the denoising of continuous-valued signal as well, and we defer it to the future work.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we set up some necessary notations as well as give a more concrete explanation on DUDE and related work. In Secion 3, we give an alternative interpretation of the DUDE algorithm, and Section 4 presents the main idea of Neural DUDE. Section 5 gives the experimental results and concretely examines the benefits of our method. Finally, Section 6 concludes with potential future research directions."

      "text" : "Throughout this paper, we will generally denote a sequence (n-tuple) as, e.g., an = (a1, . . . , an), and aji refers to the subsequence (ai, . . . , aj). In discrete denoising problem, we denote the clean, underlying source data as xn and assume each component xi takes a value in some finite set X. The source sequence is corrupted by a DMC and results in a noisy version of the source zn, of which each component zi takes a value in , again, some finite set Z. The DMC is completely characterized by the channel transition matrix Π ∈ R|X|×|Z|, of which the (x, z)-th element, Π(x, z), stands for Pr(Zi = z|Xi = x), i.e., the conditional probability of the noisy symbol taking value z given the original source symbol was x. An essential but natural assumption we make is that Π is of the full row rank.\nAs shown in Fig. 1, upon observing the entire noisy data zn, a discrete denoiser reconstructs the original data with X̂n = (X̂1(zn), . . . , X̂n(zn)), where each reconstructed symbol X̂i(zn) also takes its value in a finite set X̂. The goodness of the reconstruction by a discrete denoiser X̂n is measured by the average loss, LX̂n(X n, Zn) = 1n ∑n i=1 Λ(xi, X̂i(z n)), where Λ(xi, x̂i) is a single-letter loss function that measures the loss incurred by estimating xi with x̂i at location i. The loss function can\nbe also represented with a loss matrix Λ ∈ R|X|×|X̂|. Throughout the paper, for simplicity, we will assume X = Z = X̂, thus, assume that Π is invertible."

The form of (2) shows that DUDE is a sliding window denoiser with window size 2k + 1; namely, DUDE returns the same denoised symbol at all locations i’s with the same value of zi+ki−k . We will call such denoisers as the k-th order sliding window denoiser from now on.\nDUDE is shown to be universal, i.e., for any underlying clean sequence xn, it can always attain the performance of the best k-th order sliding window denoiser as long as k|Z|2k = o(n/ log n) holds [22, Theorem 2].

Namely, they generated clean and noisy image patches and trained neural networks to learn a mapping from noisy to clean patches. While such approach attained the state-of-the-art performance, as mentioned in Introduction, it has several limitations. That is, it typically requires massive amount of training data, and multiple copies of the data need to be generated for different noise types and levels to achieve robust performance. Such requirement of large training data cannot be always met in other applications, e.g., in DNA sequence denoising, collecting large scale clean DNA sequences is much more expensive than obtaining training images on the web. Moreover, for image denoising, working in the small patch level makes sense since the image patches may share some textual regularities, but in other applications, the characterstics of the given data for denoising could differ from those in the pre-collected training set. For instance, the characteristics of substrings of DNA sequences vary much across different species and genes, hence, the universal setting makes more sense in DNA sequence denoising."

Consider a single letter case, namely, a clean symbol x is corrupted by Π and resulted in the noisy observation Z†. Then, suppose a single-symbol denoiser s : Z→ X̂ is applied and obtained the denoised symbol X̂ = s(Z). In this case, the true loss incurred by s for the clean symbol x and the noisy observation Z is Λ(x, s(Z)). It is clear that s cannot evaluate its loss since it does not know what x is, but the following shows an unbiased estimate of the expected true loss, which is only based on Z and s, can be derived.\n†We use uppercase letter to stress it is a random variable\nFirst, denote S as the set of all possible single-symbol denoisers. Note |S| = |X̂||Z|. Then, we define a matrix ρ ∈ R|X|×|S| with\nρ(x, s) = ∑ z∈Z Π(x, z)Λ(x, s(z)) = ExΛ(x, s(Z)), x ∈ X, s ∈ S. (3)\nThen, we can define an estimated loss matrix‡ L , Π−1ρ ∈ R|Z|×|S|. With this definition, we can show that L(Z, s) is an unbiased estimate of ExΛ(x, s(Z)) as follows (as shown in [23]): ExL(Z, s) =\n∑ z Π(x, z) ∑ x′ Π−1(z, x′)ρ(x′, s) = δ(x, x′)ρ(x′, s) = ρ(x, s) = ExΛ(x, s(Z))."

Generally, we can denote such k-th order sliding window denoiser as sk : Z2k+1 → X̂, which obtains the reconstruction at the i-th location as\nX̂i(z n) = sk(z i+k i−k) = sk(ci, zi). (4)\nTo recall, ci = (zi−1i−k, z i+k i+1 ). Now, from the formulation (4), we can interpret that sk defines a single-symbol denoiser at location i, i.e., sk(ci, ·), depending on ci. With this view on sk, as derived in [13], we can show that the DUDE defined in (2) is equivalent to finding a single-symbol denoiser\nsk,DUDE(c, ·) = arg min s∈S ∑ {i:ci=c} L(zi, s), (5)\nfor each context c ∈ Ck , {(lk, rk) : (lk, rk) ∈ Z2k} and obtaining the reconstruction at location i as X̂i,DUDE(zn) = sk,DUDE(ci, zi). The interpretation (5) gives some intuition on why DUDE enjoys strong theoretical guarantees in [22]; since L(Zi, s) is an unbiased estimate of ExiΛ(xi, s(Zi)),∑\ni∈{i:ci=c} L(Zi, s) will concentrate on ∑\ni∈{i:ci=c} Λ(xi, s(Zi)) as long as |{i : ci = c}| is sufficiently large. Hence, the single symbol denoiser that minimizes the sum of the estimated losses for each c (i.e., (5)) will also make the sum of the true losses small, which is the goal of a denoiser.\nWe can also express (5) using vector notations, which will become useful for deriving the Neural DUDE in the next section. That is, we let ∆|S| be a probability simplex in R|S|. (Suppose we have uniquely assigned each coordinate of R|S| to each single-symbol denoiser in S from now on.) Then, we can define a probability vector for each c,\np̂(c) , arg min p∈∆|S| ( ∑ {i:ci=c} 1>ziL ) p, (6)\nwhich will be on the vertex of ∆|S| that corresponds to sk,DUDE(c, ·) in (5). The reason is because the objective function in (7) is a linear function in p. Hence, we can simply obtain sk,DUDE(c, ·) = arg maxs p̂(c)s, where p̂(c)s stands for the s-th coordinate of p̂(c)."

      "text" : "As seen in the previous section, DUDE utilizes the estimated loss matrix L, which does not depend on the clean sequence xn. However, the main drawback of DUDE is that, as can be seen in (5), it treats each context c independently from others. Namely, when the context size k grows, then the number of different contexts |Ck| = |Z|2k will grow exponentially with k, hence, the sample size for each context |{i : ci = c}| will decrease exponentially for a given sequence length n. Such phenomenon will hinder the concentration of ∑ i∈{i:ci=c} L(Zi, s) mentioned in the previous section, which causes the performance of DUDE deteriorate when k grows too large.\nIn order to resolve above problem, we develop Neural DUDE, which adopts a single neural network such that the information from similar contexts can be shared via network parameters. We note that our usage of DNN resembles that of the neural language model (NLM) [2], which improved upon the conventional N -gram models. The difference is that NLM is essentially a prediction problem, hence the ground truth label for supervised training is easily availble, but in denoising, this is not the case. Before describing the algorithm more in detail, we need one following lemma. ‡For general case in which Π is not a square matrix, Π−1 can be replaced with the right inverse of Π."

That is, we assume X = Z = X̂ = {0, 1} and Π is a binary symmetric channel (BSC) with crossover probability δ = 0.1. We set Λ as the Hamming loss. We generated the clean binary\nsequence xn of length n = 106 from a binary symmentric Markov chain (BSMC) with transition probability α = 0.1. The noise-corrupted sequence zn is generated by passing xn through Π. Since we use the Hamming loss, the average loss of a denoiser X̂n, 1n ∑n i=1 Λ(xi, X̂i(z\nn)), is equal to the bit error rate (BER). Note that in this setting, the noisy sequence zn is a hidden Markov process. Therefore, when the stochastic model of the clean sequence is exactly known to the denoiser, the Viterbi-like Forward-Backward (FB) recursion algorithm can attain the optimum BER.\nFigure 2 shows the denoising results of DUDE and Neural DUDE, which do not know anything about the characteristics of the clean sequence xn. For DUDE, the window size k is the single hyperparameter to choose. For Neural DUDE, we used the feed-forward fully connected neural networks for p(w, ·) and varied the depth of the network between 1 ∼ 4 while also varying k. Neural DUDE(1L) corresponds to the simple linear softmax regression model. For deeper models, we used 40 hidden nodes in each layer with Restricted Linear Unit (ReLU) activations. We used Adam [10] with default setting in Keras as an optimizer to minimize (10). We used the mini-batch size of 100 and ran 10 epochs for learning. The performance of Neural DUDE was robust to the initializtion of the parameters w.\nFigure 2(a) shows the BERs of DUDE and Neural DUDE with respect to varying k. Firstly, we see that minimum BERs of both DUDE and Neural DUDE(4L), i.e., 0.563δ with k = 5, get very close to the optimum BER (0.558δ) obtained by FB recursion. Secondly, we observe that Neural DUDE quickly approaches the optimum BER as we increase the depth of the network. This shows that as the descriminative power of the model increases with the depth of the network, p(w, ·) can successfully learn the denoising rule for each context c with a shared parameter w. Thirdly, we clearly see that in contrast to the performance of DUDE being sensitive to k, that of Neural DUDE(4L) is robust to k by sharing information across contexts. Such robustness with respect to k is obviously a very desirable property in practice.\nFigure 2(b) and Figure 2(c) plot the average estimated BER, 1n ∑n\ni=1 L(Zi, sk(ci, ·)), against the true BER for DUDE and Neural DUDE (4L), respectively, to show the concentration phenomenon described in (12). From the figures, we can see that while the estmated BER drastically diverges from\ntrue BER for DUDE as k increases, it strongly concentrates on true BER for Neural DUDE (4L) for all k.

We observe that Neural DUDE with large k’s (around k = 100) can achieve less than half of the error rate of DUDE. Furthermore, as the complexity of model increases, the performance of Neural DUDE gets significantly better. We could not find right baseline scheme, since most of nanopore error correction tool, e.g., nanocorr [6], did not produce read-by-read correction sequence, but returns downstream analyses results after denoising. Coral [19], which gives read-by-read denoising result for Illumina data, completely failed for nanopore data. Given that DUDE ourperforms state-of-the-art schemes, including Coral, for Illumina sequenced data as shown in [12], we expect the improvement of Neural DUDE over DUDE could translate into fruitful downstream analyses gain for nanopore data."

      "text" : "We showed Neural DUDE significantly improves upon DUDE and has a systematic mechanism for choosing the best k. There are several future research directions. First, we plan to do thorough experiments on DNA sequence denoising and quantify the impact of Neural DUDE in the downstream analysis. Second, we plan to give theoretical analyses on the concentration (12) and justify the derived k selection rule. Third, extending the framework to deal with continuous-valued signal and finding connection with SURE principle [20] would be fruitful. Finally, applying recurrent neural networks (RNN) in place of DNNs could be another promising direction."

Unlike other approaches that utilize supervised learning for denoising, we do not require any additional training data. In such setting, while the ground-truth label, i.e., the clean data, is not available, we devise “pseudolabels” and a novel objective function such that DNN can be trained in a same way as supervised learning to become a discrete denoiser. We experimentally show that our resulting algorithm, dubbed as Neural DUDE, significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art in several applications with a systematic rule of choosing the hyperparameter, which is an attractive feature in practice.",
