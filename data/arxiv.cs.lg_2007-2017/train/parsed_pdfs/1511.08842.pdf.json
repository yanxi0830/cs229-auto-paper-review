INTRODUCTION\nThe sparsity of natural signals and images in a transform domain or dictionary has been extensively exploited in several applications such as compression [1], denoising, compressed sensing and other inverse problems. Well-known models for sparsity include the synthesis, analysis [2], and the transform [3], [4] (or generalized analysis) models. More recently, the data-driven adaptation of sparse signal models has benefited many applications [4]–[12] compared to fixed or analytical models. In this work, we focus on the data-driven adaptation of the synthesis model and present a simple and highly efficient algorithm with convergence analysis and applications. In the following, we first briefly review the topic of synthesis dictionary learning before summarizing the contributions of this work."

We say that x ∈ RJ is sparse if ‖x‖\n0 ≪ n, where the ℓ0 “norm”\ncounts the number of non-zero entries in x. Since different candidate signals may be approximately spanned by different subsets of columns in the dictionary D, the synthesis model is also known as a union of subspaces model [14], [15]. When n = J and D is full rank, it is a basis. Else when J > n, D is called an overcomplete dictionary. Because of their richness, overcomplete dictionaries can provide highly sparse (i.e., with few non-zeros) representations of data and are popular.\nFor a given signal y and dictionary D, the process of finding a sparse representation x involves solving the wellknown synthesis sparse coding problem. This problem is to minimize ‖y −Dx‖2\n2 subject to ‖x‖ 0 ≤ s, where s is\nsome set sparsity level. The synthesis sparse coding problem is NP-hard (Non-deterministic Polynomial-time hard) [16], [17]. Numerous algorithms [18]–[25] including greedy and relaxation algorithms have been proposed for this problem. While some of these algorithms are guaranteed to provide the correct solution under certain conditions, these conditions are often restrictive and violated in applications. Moreover, these sparse coding algorithms typically tend to be computationally expensive for large-scale problems.\nMore recently, the data-driven adaptation of synthesis dictionaries, called dictionary learning, has been investigated in several works [8], [26]–[29]. Dictionary learning has shown promise in several applications including compression, denoising, inpainting, deblurring, demosaicing, super-resolution, and classification [5], [6], [30]–[37]. It has also been demonstrated to be useful in inverse problems such as those in tomography [38], and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [9], [39]–[41].\nGiven a collection of training signals {yi} N\ni=1 that are represented as columns of the matrix Y ∈ Rn×N , the dictionary learning problem is often formulated as follows [28]\n(P0) min D,X\n‖Y −DX‖2F s.t. ‖xi‖0 ≤ s ∀ i, ‖dj‖2 = 1 ∀ j.\nHere, dj and xi denote the columns of the dictionary D ∈ R\nn×J and sparse code matrix X ∈ RJ×N , respectively, and s denotes the maximum sparsity level (non-zeros in representations xi) allowed for each training signal. The columns of the dictionary are constrained to have unit norm to avoid the scaling ambiguity [42]. Variants of Problem (P0) include replacing the ℓ0 “norm” for sparsity with an ℓ1 norm or an alternative sparsity criterion, or enforcing additional properties\n2 (e.g., incoherence [35], [43]) for the dictionary D, or solving an online version (where the dictionary is updated sequentially as new training signals arrive) of the problem [8].\nAlgorithms for Problem (P0) or its variants [8], [27]– [29], [44]–[52] typically alternate in some form between a sparse coding step (updating X), and a dictionary update step (solving for D). Some of these algorithms (e.g., [28], [48], [50]) also partially update X in the dictionary update step. A few recent methods attempt to solve for D and X jointly in an iterative fashion [53], [54]. The K-SVD method [28] has been particularly popular in numerous applications [5]–[7], [9], [30], [39]. However, Problem (P0) is highly nonconvex and NP-hard, and most dictionary learning approaches lack proven convergence guarantees. Moreover, the algorithms for (P0) tend to be computationally expensive (particularly alternating-type algorithms), with the computations usually dominated by the synthesis sparse coding step.\nSome recent works [52], [55]–[59] have studied the convergence of (specific) synthesis dictionary learning algorithms. However, these dictionary learning methods have not been demonstrated to be useful in applications such as image denoising. Bao et al. [52] find that their method, although a fast proximal scheme, denoises less effectively than the KSVD method [5]. Many prior works use restrictive assumptions (e.g., noiseless data, etc.) for their convergence results."

      "text" : "This work focuses on synthesis dictionary learning and investigates a dictionary learning problem with an ℓ0 sparsity penalty instead of constraints. Our approach first models the training data set as an approximate sum of sparse rank-one matrices (or outer products). Then, we use a simple and exact block coordinate descent approach to estimate the factors of the various rank-one matrices. In particular, the sparse coding step in the algorithm uses a simple form of thresholding, and the dictionary atom update step involves a matrix-vector product that is computed efficiently. We provide a convergence analysis of the proposed block coordinate descent method. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the promising performance and significant speed-ups provided by our method over the classicial K-SVD dictionary learning scheme in sparse signal representation and image denoising. Importantly, our algorithm is similar to just the dictionary update step of KSVD, and yet performs comparably or much better and faster than K-SVD in applications.\nOur work shares similarities with a recent dictionary learning approach [60] that exploits a sum of outer products model for the training data. However, the specific problem formulation and algorithm studied in this work differ from the prior work [60]. Importantly, unlike the previous approach [60], we provide a detailed convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm and also demonstrate its usefulness (both in terms of speed and quality of results) in sparse representation of natural signals and in image denoising. The sum of outer products model and related algorithm can accomodate various structures or constraints on the dictionary or sparse codes."

      "text" : "We consider a sparsity penalized variant of Problem (P0) [52]. Specifically, by replacing the sparsity constraints in (P0) with an ℓ0 penalty ∑N\ni=1 ‖xi‖0 and introducing a variable C = XT ∈ RN×J , where (·)T denotes the matrix transpose operation, we arrive at the following formulation:\nmin D,C\n∥ ∥Y −DCT ∥ ∥ 2\nF + λ2 ‖C‖ 0 s.t. ‖dj‖2 = 1 ∀ j. (1)\nwhere ‖C‖ 0 counts the number of non-zeros in the matrix C, and λ2 > 0 is a weight for the sparsity penalty that controls the number of non-zeros in the sparse representation.\nNext, we express the matrix DCT in (1) as a sum of (sparse) rank-one matrices or outer products ∑J\nj=1 djc T j , where cj\nis the jth column of C. This is a natural representation of the training data Y because it separates out the contributions of the various atoms in representing the data. It may also provide a natural way to set the number of atoms (degrees of freedom) in the dictionary. In particular, atoms of a dictionary whose contributions to the data (Y ) representation error or modeling error are small could be dropped. Such a Sum of OUter Products (SOUP) representation has been exploited in previous dictionary learning algorithms [28], [48]. With this model, we rewrite (1) as follows, where ‖C‖\n0 =\n∑J\nj=1 ‖cj‖0:\n(P1) min {dj ,cj}\n∥ ∥ ∥Y − ∑J\nj=1 djc T j\n∥ ∥ ∥ 2\nF + λ2\nJ ∑\nj=1\n‖cj‖0\ns.t. ‖dj‖2 = 1, ‖cj‖∞ ≤ L ∀ j.\nAs in Problem (P0), the matrix djcTj in (P1) is invariant to joint scaling of dj and cj as αdj and (1/α)cj , for α 6= 0. The constraint ‖dj‖2 = 1 helps remove this scaling ambiguity. We also enforce the constraint ‖cj‖∞ ≤ L, with L > 0, in (P1) [52] (e.g., L = ‖Y ‖F ). Consider a dictionary D that has a column dj that repeats. Then, in this case, the outer product expansion of Y in (P1) could have both the terms djcTj and −djcTj with cj that is highly sparse, and the objective would be invariant to (arbitrarily) large scalings1 of cj (i.e., noncoercive objective). The ℓ∞ constraints on the columns of C (that constrain the magnitudes of entries of C) prevent such a scenario. Problem (P1) is designed to learn the factors {dj} J\nj=1\nand {cj} J\nj=1 that enable the best SOUP sparse representation\nof Y . 1Such degenerate representations of Y , however, cannot be minimizers in the problem because they simply increase the ℓ0 sparsity penalty without affecting the fitting error (the first term) in the cost.\n3"

      "text" : "Several variants of the SOUP learning Problem (P1) could be constructed, with interesting effects. For example, the ℓ0 “norm” for sparsity could be replaced by the ℓ1 norm [60]. Another interesting alternative to (P1) involves enforcing p-block-orthogonality constraints on the dictionary D. The dictionary in this case is split into blocks (instead of individual atoms), each of which has p atoms that are orthogonal to each other. For p = 2, the constraints take the form dT2j−1d2j = 0, 1 ≤ j ≤ J/2. In the extreme (more constrained) case of p = n, the dictionary would be made of several (square) orthonormal blocks. For tensor-type data, Problem (P1) can be modified by enforcing the dictionary atoms to be in the form of a Kronecker product. The algorithm proposed in Section III can be easily extended to accomodate such variants of Problem (P1). We do not fully explore such alternatives in this work due to space constraints, and a more detailed investigation of these will be presented elsewhere."

      "text" : "We propose a block coordinate descent method to estimate the unknown variables in Problem (P1). For each j (1 ≤ j ≤ J), our algorithm has two key steps. First, we solve (P1) with respect to cj keeping all the other variables fixed. We refer to this step as the sparse coding step in our method. Once cj is updated, we solve (P1) with respect to dj keeping all other variables fixed. This step is referred to as the dictionary atom update step or simply dictionary update step. The algorithm updates the factors of the various rank-one matrices one-byone. We next describe the sparse coding and dictionary atom update steps.\n1) Sparse Coding Step: Minimizing (P1) with respect to cj leads to the following non-convex problem, where Ej , Y − ∑\nk 6=j dkc T k is a fixed matrix based on the most recent\nvalues of all other atoms and coefficients:\nmin cj\n∥ ∥Ej − djcTj ∥ ∥ 2 F + λ2 ‖cj‖0 s.t. ‖cj‖∞ ≤ L. (2)\nThe following proposition provides the solution to Problem (2), where the hard-thresholding operator Hλ(·) is defined as\n(Hλ(b))i =\n{\n0, |bi| < λ bi, |bi| ≥ λ (3)\nwith b ∈ RN , and the subscript i indexes vector entries. We assume that the bound L > λ and let 1N denote a vector of ones of length N . The operation “⊙” denotes element-wise multiplication, sign(·) computes the signs of the elements of a vector, and z = min(a, u) for vectors a, u ∈ RN denotes the element-wise minimum operation, i.e., zi = min(ai, bi), 1 ≤ i ≤ N .\nProposition 1: Given Ej ∈ Rn×N and dj ∈ Rn, and assuming L > λ, a global minimizer of the sparse coding problem (2) is obtained by the following truncated hardthresholding operation:\nĉj = min (∣ ∣Hλ ( ETj dj )∣ ∣ , L1N ) ⊙ sign ( Hλ ( ETj dj )) (4)\nThe minimizer of (2) is unique if and only if the vector ETj dj has no entry with a magnitude of λ. Proof: First, for a vector dj that has unit ℓ2 norm, we have the following equality\n∥ ∥Ej − djc T j ∥ ∥ 2 F = ‖Ej‖ 2 F + ‖cj‖ 2 2 − 2cTj E T j dj\n= ∥ ∥cj − E T j dj ∥ ∥ 2 2 + ‖Ej‖ 2 F − ∥ ∥ETj dj ∥ ∥ 2 F (5)\nBy substituting (5) into (2), it is clear that Problem (2) is equivalent to\nmin cj\n∥ ∥cj − E T j dj ∥ ∥ 2 2 + λ2 ‖cj‖0 s.t. ‖cj‖∞ ≤ L. (6)\nDefine b , ETj dj . Then, the objective in (6) simplifies to ∑N\ni=1\n{\n|cji − bi| 2 + λ2 θ(cji)\n}\nwith\nθ (a) =\n{\n0, if a = 0 1, if a 6= 0 (7)\nTherefore, we solve for each entry cji of cj as\nĉji = argmin cji\n|cji − bi| 2 + λ2 θ(cji) s.t. |cji| ≤ L. (8)\nIt is straightforward to show that when |bi| ≤ L (case (a)),\nĉji =\n{\n0, if b2i < λ 2 bi, if b 2 i > λ 2 (9)\nWhen |bi| = λ (λ < L), the optimal ĉji can be either bi or 0 (non-unique), and both these settings achieve the minimum objective value λ2 in (8). Next, when |bi| > L (case (b)), we have\nĉji =\n{\n0, if b2i < (L sign(bi)− bi) 2 + λ2\nL sign(bi), if b 2 i > (L sign(bi)− bi) 2 + λ2\n(10)\nSince L > λ, clearly b2i > (L sign(bi)− bi) 2 + λ2 in (10).\nThus, an optimal ĉji in (8) is compactly written as ĉji = min (∣ ∣Hλ (bi) ∣ ∣ , L )\n· sign (bi), thereby establishing (4). The condition for uniqueness of the sparse coding solution follows from the arguments for case (a) above.\n2) Dictionary Atom Update Step: Minimizing (P1) with respect to dj leads to the following non-convex problem:\nmin dj\n∥ ∥Ej − djc T j ∥ ∥ 2 F s.t. ‖dj‖2 = 1 (11)\nProposition 2 provides the closed-form solution for (11). Proposition 2: Given Ej ∈ Rn×N and cj ∈ RN , a global minimizer of the dictionary atom update problem (11) is\nd̂j =\n{\nEjcj ‖Ejcj‖2 , if cj 6= 0\nv1, if cj = 0 (12)\nwhere v1 is the first column of the n×n identity matrix. The solution is unique if and only if cj 6= 0.

The SOUP-DIL Algorithm (or SOUP-DILLO Algorithm, due to the use of the ℓ0 “norm”) for Problem (P1). Superscript of t denotes the iterates in the algorithm. Although we perform the sparse coding step prior to the dictionary update step, one could also potentially switch this order. The vectors bt and ht above can be computed very efficiently via sparse operations.\nUpon substituting (13) into (11), Problem (11) simplifies to\nmax dj\ndTj Ejcj s.t. ‖dj‖2 = 1. (14)\nBy the Cauchy Schwarz inequality dTj Ejcj ≤ ‖Ejcj‖2 for unit norm dj . Thus, a solution to (14) that achieves the value ‖Ejcj‖2 for the objective is\nd̂j =\n{\nEjcj ‖Ejcj‖2 , if Ejcj 6= 0\nv1, if Ejcj = 0 (15)\nObviously, any d ∈ Rn would be a minimizer (non-unique) in (14) when Ejcj = 0. In particular d̂j = v1 works.\nNext, we show that Ejcj = 0 in our algorithm if and only if cj = 0. This result together with (15) immediately establishes the proposition. Since the cj used in the dictionary atom update step (11) was obtained as a minimizer in the preceding sparse coding step (2), we have the following inequality for all c ∈ R\nN with ‖c‖∞ ≤ L, and d̃j denotes the jth atom in the preceding sparse coding step: ∥ ∥Ej − d̃jcTj ∥ ∥ 2 F + λ2 ‖cj‖0 ≤ ∥ ∥Ej − d̃jcT ∥ ∥ 2 F + λ2 ‖c‖ 0 (16)\nIf Ejcj = 0, the left hand side above simplifies to ‖Ej‖ 2\nF\n+ ‖cj‖ 2 2 +λ2 ‖cj‖0, which is clearly minimal when cj = 0. Thus, when Ejcj = 0, we must also have cj = 0. While Propositions 1 and 2 provide the minimizers of (2) and (11) for the case of real-valued matrices/vectors in\nthe problems, these solutions are trivially extended to the complex-valued case (that may be useful in applications such as magnetic resonance imaging [9]) by using a Hermitian transpose.\nFig. 1 shows the Sum of OUter Products DIctionary Learning (SOUP-DIL) Algorithm (or SOUP-DILLO Algorithm, due to the use of the ℓ0 “norm”) for Problem (P1). The algorithm assumes that an initial estimate {\nd0j , c 0 j\n}J\nj=1 for the variables\nis provided. For example, the initial sparse coefficients could be set to zero, and the initial dictionary could be a known analytical dictionary such as the overcomplete DCT [5]. When ctj = 0, setting d t j = v1 in (20) in the algorithm could also be replaced with other (equivalent) settings such as dtj = d t−1 j or setting dtj to a random unit norm vector. All of these settings have been observed to work well in practice. A random ordering of the atom/sparse coefficient updates in Fig. 1 (i.e., random j sequence) also helps in practice (in accelerating convergence) compared to cycling in the same order 1 through J every iteration. One could also alternate several times between the sparse coding and dictionary atom update steps for each j in Fig. 1. However, this would increase computation."

      "text" : "For each iteration t in Fig. 1, our algorithm involves J sparse code and dictionary atom updates. The sparse coding and atom update steps involve matrix-vector products for computing bt and ht, respectively. An alternative approach to the one in Fig. 1 involves computing the matrix Etj = Y − ∑\nk<j d t k (c t k)\nT − ∑ k>j d t−1 k ( ct−1k )T\n(as in Propositions 1 and 2) directly at the beginning of each inner j iteration. This matrix can be updated sequentially and efficiently for each j by adding and subtracting appropriate sparse rank-one matrices. However, this alternative approach requires storing Etj ∈ R\nn×N , which is often a large matrix for large N and n. Instead, the procedure adopted by us in Fig. 1 helps save memory usage. We now discuss the cost of each sparse coding and atom update procedure in Fig. 1.\nConsider the tth iteration and the jth inner iteration in Fig. 1, consisting of the update of the jth dictionary atom and its corresponding sparse coefficients. As in Fig. 1, let D ∈ Rn×J be the dictionary whose columns are the current estimates of the atoms (at the start of the jth inner iteration), and let C ∈ RN×J be the corresponding sparse coefficients matrix. (The index t on D and C is dropped to keep the notation simple.) Assume that the matrix C has αNn nonzeros, with α ≪ 1 typically. This translates to an average of αn non-zeros per row of C or αNn/J non-zeros per column of C. We refer to α as the sparsity factor of C.\nThe sparse coding step involves computing the right hand side of (17). While computing Y Tdt−1j in (17) requires Nn multiply-add operations, computing CDT dt−1j using matrixvector products requires Jn+ αNn multiply-add operations. Computing the difference of these vectors and summing that result with the sparse ct−1j requires less than 2N additions. The hard thresholding-type operation (18) to obtain ctj requires at most 2N comparisons.\n5 Next, when ctj 6= 0, the dictionary atom update step requires computing the right hand side of (19). Since ctj is sparse with say rj non-zeros, computing Y ctj in (19) requires nrj multiply-add operations, and computing DCT ctj using matrixvector products requires less than Jn + αNn multiply-add operations. The cost of the remaining operations in (19) and for normalizing ht (20) is negligible.\nThus, the net cost of the J ≥ n inner iterations in iteration t in Fig. 1 is dominated (for N ≫ J, n) by NJn+2αmNJn+ βNn2, where αm is the maximum sparsity factor of the estimated C’s during the inner iterations, and β is the sparsity factor of the estimated C at the end of iteration t. Thus, the cost per iteration of the block coordinate descent SOUP-DIL Algorithm is about (1 + α′)NJn, with α′ ≪ 1 typically. On the other hand, the proximal alternating algorithm proposed very recently2 by Bao et al. [52], [61] has a per-iteration computational cost of at least 2NJn + 6αNJn + 4αNn2. This is clearly more computation than SOUP-DIL.\nAssuming J ∝ n, the cost per iteration of the SOUP-DIL Algorithm scales as O(Nn2). This is lower than the periteration cost of learning an n × J synthesis dictionary D using K-SVD [28], which scales3 (assuming that the synthesis sparsity level s ∝ n and J ∝ n in K-SVD) as O(Nn3).\nAs illustrated in Section V-B, our algorithm converges in few iterations in practice. Therefore, the per-iteration computational advantages also translate to net computational advantages in practice. The low computational cost of our approach could be particularly useful for big data applications, or higher dimensional (3D or 4D) applications."

We thus have the following corollary of Theorem 1 that holds because\n6 the distance between a bounded sequence and its (non-empty and compact) set of accumulation points converges to zero.\nCorollary 1: For each (C0, D0), the iterate sequence in the SOUP-DIL Algorithm converges to an equivalence class of accumulation points.\nThe following Theorem 2 considers a very special case of SOUP dictionary learning, where the dictionary has a single atom. In this case, the SOUP learning Problem (P1) is the problem of obtaining a sparse rank-one approximation of the training matrix Y . In this case, Theorem 2 establishes that the iterates in the algorithm converge to the set of critical points (i.e., the distance between the iterates and the set converges to zero) of the objective f .\nTheorem 2: Consider the SOUP-DIL Algorithm with J = 1. Let {ct, dt} denote the bounded iterate sequence generated by the algorithm in this case with data Y ∈ Rn×N and initial (c0, d0). Then, every accumulation point of the iterate sequence is a critical point of the objective f , i.e., the iterates converge to the set of critical points of f .\nProof: See Appendix B. For the general case (J 6= 1), we have the following result. Theorem 3: Let {Ct, Dt} denote the bounded iterate sequence generated by the SOUP-DIL Algorithm with training data Y ∈ Rn×N and initial (C0, D0). Suppose each accumulation point (C,D) of the iterate sequence is such that the matrix B with columns bj = ETj dj and Ej = Y −DC T + djc T j , has no entry with magnitude λ. Then every accumulation point of the iterate sequence is a critical point of the objective f(C,D). Moreover, the two sequences with terms ∥ ∥Dt −Dt−1 ∥ ∥\nF and ∥ ∥Ct − Ct−1 ∥ ∥\nF respectively, both converge to zero.\nProof: See Appendix C. Theorem 3 establishes that the iterates in SOUP-DIL converge to the set of critical points of f(C,D). For each initial (C0, D0), the iterate sequence in the algorithm converges (using Corollary 1) to an equivalence class of critical points of f . Theorem 3 also establishes that ∥ ∥Dt −Dt−1 ∥ ∥\nF → 0\nand ∥ ∥Ct − Ct−1 ∥ ∥\nF → 0, thereby implying that the sparse\napproximation to the training data Zt = Dt (Ct)T is such that ∥ ∥Zt − Zt−1 ∥ ∥\nF → 0. These are necessary but not sufficient\nconditions for the convergence of the entire sequences {Dt}, {Ct}, and {Zt}. The assumption on the entries of the matrix B in Theorem 3 is equivalent to assuming that for every 1 ≤ j ≤ J , there is a unique minimizer of f with respect to cj with all other variables fixed to their values in the accumulation point (C,D).\nAlthough Theorem 3 uses a uniqueness condition, the following conjecture postulates that provided the following Assumption 1 (that uses a probabilistic model for the data) holds, the uniqueness condition holds with probability 1, i.e., the probability of a tie in assigning sparse codes is zero.\nAssumption 1. The training signals yi ∈ Rn for 1 ≤ i ≤ N , are drawn independently from an absolutely continuous probability measure over the n-dimensional ball S , {y ∈ Rn : ‖y‖\n2 ≤ β0} for some β0 > 0.\nConjecture 1: Let Assumption 1 hold. Then, with probability 1, every accumulation point (C,D) of the iterate sequence in the SOUP-DIL Algorithm is such that for each 1 ≤ j ≤\nJ , the minimizer of f(c1, ..., cj−1, c̃j , cj+1, ..., cJ , d1, ..., dJ ) with respect to c̃j is unique.\nIf Conjecture 1 holds, then every accumulation point of the iterate sequence in the SOUP-DIL Algorithm is immediately a critical point of f(C,D) with probability 1."

For demonstrating the convergence behavior and quality of sparse signal representations, we consider data formed using vectorized 2D patches of natural images. The SOUP-DIL Algorithm is used to learn sparse representations for such data, and we study the signal representation ability of the proposed algorithm at various values of λ (i.e., various sparsities). We also present results for patch-based image denoising using Problem (P1).\nOur dictionary learning implementation was coded in Matlab version R2015a. We compare the performance of dictionaries learned using our method to those learned using the classical K-SVD4 method [5], [28]. For K-SVD learning and denoising [5], [28], we consider the original Matlab implementation of the methods available from Michael Elad’s website [68]. A fast version5 of K-SVD [62] that also uses MEX/C implementations of sparse coding and some sub-steps of dictionary update, is publicly available [69]. The Matlab implementation of our method is not currently optimized for efficiency. Therefore, we compare the runtimes achieved by our unoptimized Matlab implementation to both the original Matlab and the efficient (partial MEX/C) implementations of K-SVD for a fair and instructive comparison. For KSVD, we used the built-in parameter settings of the author’s implementations, unless otherwise stated. All computations were performed with an Intel Xeon CPU X3230 at 2.66 GHz and 8 GB memory, employing a 64-bit Windows 7 operating system.\nFor sparse representation of data Y , we use the normalized sparse representation error (NSRE) ∥ ∥Y −DCT ∥ ∥\nF / ‖Y ‖F to\nmeasure the performance of the learned dictonaries.

Mairal et al. [33] proposed a nonlocal method for image denoising that also exploits learned dictionaries and achieves denoising performance comparable to the well-known BM3D [67] denoising method. Similar extensions to our proposed method for denoising and other applications are left for future work.\n5This version [69] was observed to typically provide similar quality of results in our experiments as [68].\n7 Barbara Boat Couple\nHill Lena\nFig. 2.

Specifically, the initial estimate for C is an allzero matrix, and the initial estimate for D is the overcomplete DCT [5], [68].\nFig. 3 illustrates the convergence behavior of SOUP-DIL. The objective in our method (Fig. 3(a)) converged monotonically and quickly over the iterations. Fig. 3(b) shows the normalized sparse representation error and sparsity factor (for C), both expressed as percentages. Both these components of the objective converged quickly for the algorithm, and the NSRE improved by 1 dB beyond the first iteration, indicating the success of the SOUP-DIL approach in representing data using a small number of non-zero coefficients (sparsity factor of 3.14% at convergence).\nImportantly, both the quantities ∥ ∥Dt −Dt−1 ∥ ∥\nF (Fig. 3(c))\nand ∥ ∥Ct − Ct−1 ∥ ∥\nF (Fig. 3(d)) converge towards 0, as pre-\ndicted by Theorem 3.

We compare the NSRE values achieved by our algorithm to those achieved by the K-SVD dictionary learning scheme [28] for the same data.

As expected, the NSRE values for the SOUP-DIL Algorithm decreased monotonically (Fig. 4(a)) when the average column sparsity level in CT increased\n8 (i.e., as λ decreased). Importantly, the SOUP-DIL Algorithm provided better data representations (Fig. 4(b)) than K-SVD at the various tested sparsity levels. Large improvements of about 14 dB and 1 dB are observed at low and mid sparsity levels, respectively.\nFinally, Fig. 4(c) compares the runtimes of our method to those of the unoptimized Matlab implementation of K-SVD [68] as well as the efficient (partial) MEX/C implementation [69] of K-SVD demonstrating large speedups of 40-50 times for SOUP-DIL over the first K-SVD implementation (at most sparsities), while the runtimes for the SOUP-DIL method are about the same as those of the second K-SVD implementation. Since these results were obtained using only an unoptimized Matlab implementation of SOUP-DIL, we expect significant speed-ups for our scheme with code optimization or C/C++ implementations.\nD. Image Denoising\nIn image denoising, the goal is to recover an estimate of an image x ∈ RM (2D image represented as a vector) from its corrupted measurements y = x+ h, where h is the noise. For example, the entries of h may be i.i.d. Gaussian with zero mean and standard deviation σ.\nTo perform image denoising using (P1), we first extract all the overlapping patches (with maximum overlap) of the noisy image y, and construct the training set Y ∈ Rn×N as a matrix whose columns are those noisy patches. We then use Problem (P1) to learn a dictionary and sparse codes for Y . To obtain the denoised image estimate, we then solve the following least squares problem, where D̂ and α̂j denote the learned dictionary and patch sparse codes obtained from the noisy patches, and Pj is an operator that extracts a patch as a vector:\nmin x\nN ∑\nj=1\n∥ ∥Pjx− D̂α̂j ∥ ∥ 2 2 + ν ‖x− y‖2 2 (22)\nThe optimal x̂ is obtained [5] by summing together the denoised patch estimates D̂α̂j at their respective 2D locations, and computing a weighted average between this result and the noisy image.\nK-SVD based denoising [5] involves a similar methodology as described above for (P1), but differs in the dictionary learning procedure, where the ℓ0 “norms” of the sparse codes are minimized so that a fitting constraint or error constraint of ∥ ∥Pjy − D̂α̂j ∥ ∥ 2\n2 ≤ ǫ is met for representing the noisy patches.\nIn particular, when the noise is i.i.d. Gaussian, ǫ = nC2σ2 is used, with C > 1 a constant. Such a constraint serves as a strong prior [5], [6], and is a key reason for the denoising capability of K-SVD. Hence, in our method based on (P1), we set λ ∝ σ (noise standard deviation) in (P1) during learning, and once the dictionary D̂ is learned from noisy patches, we estimate the patch sparse codes α̂j using a single pass (over the noisy patches) of orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) by employing an error constraint criterion like in K-SVD. Although we only use information on the noise statistics in a sub-optimal way for (P1), we still show good denoising performance (vis-a-vis K-SVD) in the following with this\nImage σ Noisy O-DCT K-SVD SOUP-DIL\nCouple\n5 34.16 37.25 37.29 37.28 10 28.11 33.40 33.49 33.50 20 22.11 29.71 30.01 29.99 25 20.17 28.53 28.88 28.92 30 18.58 27.53 27.88 27.97\n100 8.13 22.59 22.58 22.71\nBarbara 5 34.15 37.94 38.08 38.04 10 28.14 33.96 34.43 34.37 20 22.13 29.95 30.83 30.79 25 20.17 28.68 29.63 29.64 30 18.59 27.62 28.54 28.63\n100 8.11 21.87 21.87 21.97\nBoat\n5 34.15 37.09 37.21 37.16 10 28.13 33.43 33.62 33.60 20 22.10 29.92 30.36 30.37 25 20.17 28.79 29.28 29.30 30 18.60 27.93 28.41 28.43\n100 8.13 22.79 22.81 22.96\nHill\n5 34.15 37.02 37.08 37.05 10 28.14 33.26 33.45 33.44 20 22.10 29.85 30.17 30.20 25 20.18 28.89 29.23 29.31 30 18.57 28.14 28.43 28.56\n100 8.16 24.00 23.98 24.03\nLena\n5 34.16 38.52 38.62 38.55 10 28.12 35.30 35.48 35.47 20 22.11 32.02 32.40 32.40 25 20.18 30.89 31.32 31.32 30 18.59 29.98 30.41 30.46\n100 8.14 24.45 24.51 24.63\nAvg.\n5 34.16 37.56 37.66 37.61 10 28.13 33.87 34.09 34.07 20 22.11 30.29 30.75 30.75 25 20.17 29.16 29.67 29.70 30 18.58 28.24 28.74 28.81\n100 8.13 23.14 23.15 23.26\nTABLE I PSNR VALUES IN DECIBELS FOR DENOISING WITH OVERCOMPLETE DCT (O-DCT), K-SVD [5], AND SOUP-DIL.

Note that for both our method and for K-SVD [5], [68], the means of the patches are removed prior to learning and added back afterwards to obtain the denoised estimates.\nFor the denoising experiments, we work with the images Couple, Barbara, Boat, Hill, and Lena in Fig. 2, and simulate i.i.d. Gaussian noise at six different noise levels (σ = 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 100) for each of the images. We then denoise these images using both the SOUP-DIL denoising method outlined above and K-SVD [5], [68]. SOUP-DIL denoising uses patches of size 8 × 8, a 64 × 256 overcomplete dictionary, λ = 5σ, ν = 20/σ (in (22)), an overcomplete DCT initial dictionary in learning, and 10 iterations of the learning algorithm. These parameter settings6 were found to work well for our method.\nTable I lists the denoising PSNRs obtained by the SOUP-\n6The built-in parameter settings in the K-SVD denoising implementation [5], [68] are very similar except that K-SVD uses a subset of the patches for training. We found that the denoising performance of K-SVD changes by at most few hundredths of a dB when all the patches are used in learning. However, this setting also leads to increased runtimes.\n9 (a) (b)\nFig. 5. Learned dictionaries for Barbara at σ = 20: (a) SOUP dictionary; and (b) K-SVD dictionary.

For comparison, we also list the denoising PSNRs obtained by employing the overcomplete DCT dictionary for denoising. In the latter case, the same strategy (and parameter settings [68]) as used by K-SVD based denoising is adopted but while skipping the learning process.\nThe various methods denoise about the same in Table I for a low noise level of σ = 5. For σ > 5, the SOUP-DIL method denoises about 0.4 dB better on the average than the overcomplete DCT. While the SOUP-DIL method and K-SVD denoise about the same at low and mid noise levels, the SOUPDIL scheme performs about 0.1 dB better on average at higher noise levels such as σ = 30 or 100 in Table I. Importantly, SOUP-DIL based denoising is highly efficient and the learning procedure has good convergence properties. We have observed similar effects as in Section V-C for the runtimes of SOUPDIL denoising vis-a-vis the unoptimized Matlab [68] or the efficient (partial MEX/C) [69] implementations of the K-SVD approach.\nFig. 5 shows the dictionaries learned from noisy patches using the SOUP-DIL method and K-SVD for the image Barbara at σ = 20. Both dictionaries show frequency and textural features that are specific to the image Barbara. By learning such image-specific features, the SOUP-DIL method (and K-SVD) easily outperforms fixed dictionaries such as the overcomplete DCT in denoising."

      "text" : "This paper proposed a fast method for synthesis dictionary learning. The training data set is approximated by a sum of sparse rank-one matrices. The proposed formulation learns the left and right singular vectors of these rank-one matrices using an ℓ0 penalty to enforce sparsity. We adopted a block coordinate descent method to efficiently update the unknown sparse codes and dictionary atoms in the problem. In particular, the sparse coding step in our algorithm is performed cheaply by truncated hard-thresholding, and the dictionary atom update involves a single sparse vector-matrix product that is computed efficiently. A convergence analysis was presented for the proposed block coordinate descent algorithm for a highly nonconvex problem. The proposed approach had comparable or superior performance and significant speed-ups over the classical K-SVD method [5], [28] in sparse signal representation\nand image denoising. The usefulness of our method in other applications such as blind compressed sensing [70] or other inverse problems in imaging merits further study. Extensions of the proposed method for online learning [8] are also of potential interest."

At every iteration t and inner iteration j in Fig. 1, we solve the sparse coding and dictionary atom update subproblems exactly. Thus, we have the following two inequalities:\nf ( ct1, ..., c t j−1, c t j , c t−1 j+1, ..., c t−1 J , d t 1, ..., d t j−1, d t−1 j , ..., d t−1 J ) ≤\nf ( ct1, ..., c t j−1, c t−1 j , c t−1 j+1, ..., c t−1 J , d t 1, ..., d t j−1, d t−1 j , ..., d t−1 J ) f (\nct1, ..., c t j , c t−1 j+1, ..., c t−1 J , d t 1, ..., d t j−1, d t j , d t−1 j+1, ..., d t−1 J\n)\n≤\nf ( ct1, ..., c t j , c t−1 j+1, ..., c t−1 J , d t 1, ..., d t j−1, d t−1 j , d t−1 j+1, ..., d t−1 J )\nCombining these inequalities for the tth iteration and for each 1 ≤ j ≤ J yields f(Ct, Dt) ≤ f(Ct−1, Dt−1). Thus, the sequence {f(Ct, Dt)} is monotone decreasing. Because it is lower bounded (by 0), it converges to a finite value f∗ = f∗(C0, D0) (that may depend on the initial conditions).\nNext, the boundedness of the {Dt} and {Ct} sequences is obvious from the constraints in Problem (P1), so the accumulation points of the iterates form a non-empty and compact set.\nFinally, we show that each accumulation point achieves the same value f∗ of the objective. Consider a subsequence {Cqt , Dqt} of the iterate sequence that converges to the accumulation point (C∗, D∗). Because ∥\n∥dqtj ∥ ∥ 2 = 1 and ∥ ∥cqtj ∥ ∥ ∞ ≤ L for 1 ≤ j ≤ J and every t, therefore, due to the continuity of the norms, we also have ∥\n∥d∗j ∥ ∥ 2 = 1 and ∥ ∥c∗j ∥ ∥ ∞ ≤ L for all j.

In this proof, for simplicity, we denote the objective f (21) in the jth sparse coding step of iteration t (Fig. 1) as\nf ( Etj , cj , d t−1 j ) , ∥ ∥Etj − d t−1 j c T j ∥ ∥ 2 F + λ2\n∑\nk<j\n∥ ∥ctk ∥ ∥\n0\n+ λ2 ∑\nk>j\n∥ ∥ct−1k ∥ ∥ 0 + λ2 ‖cj‖0 + ψ(cj) (28)\nAll but the jth atom and sparse vector cj are represented via Etj on the left hand side in this notation. The objective that is minimized in the dictionary atom update step is similarly denoted as f (\nEtj , c t j, dj\n)\nwith\nf ( Etj , c t j , dj ) ,\n∥ ∥ ∥Etj − dj ( ctj )T ∥ ∥ ∥ 2\nF + λ2\n∑\nk≤j\n∥ ∥ctk ∥ ∥\n0\n+ λ2 ∑\nk>j\n∥ ∥ct−1k ∥ ∥ 0 + χ(dj). (29)\nFinally, the functions f ( E∗j , cj, d ∗ j ) and f ( E∗j , c ∗ j , dj )\nare defined in a similar way with respect to the accumulation point (C∗, D∗).\nTo establish the critical point property of (C∗, D∗), we first show the partial global optimality of each column of the matrices C∗ and D∗ for f . By partial global optimality, we mean that each column of C∗ or D∗ is a global minimizer of f , when all other variables are kept fixed to the values in (C∗, D∗). First, for j = 1 and iteration qnt + 1, we have the following result for the sparse coding step for all c1 ∈ RN :\nf ( E qnt+1\n1 , c qnt+1 1 , d qnt 1\n) ≤ f ( E qnt+1\n1 , c1, d qnt 1\n)\n(30)\nTaking the limit t → ∞ above and using (24) to obtain limits of ℓ0 terms in the cost (28), and using (23), and the fact that E qnt+1\n1 → E ∗ 1 , we have\nf (E∗1 , c ∗∗ 1 , d ∗ 1) ≤ f (E ∗ 1 , c1, d ∗ 1) ∀ c1 ∈ R N . (31)\nThis means that c∗∗1 is a minimizer of f with all other variables fixed to their values in (C∗, D∗). Because of the (uniqueness) assumption in the theorem, we have\nc∗∗1 = argmin c1 f (E∗1 , c1, d ∗ 1) (32)\nFurthermore, because of the equivalence of accumulation points, f (E∗1 , c ∗∗ 1 , d ∗ 1) = f (E ∗ 1 , c ∗ 1, d ∗ 1) = f\n∗ holds. This result together with (32) implies that c∗∗1 = c ∗ 1 and thus\nc∗1 = argmin c1 f (E∗1 , c1, d ∗ 1) (33)\nTherefore, c∗1 is a partial global minimizer of f . Next, for the first dictionary atom update step (j = 1) in iteration qnt + 1, we have the following for all d1 ∈ R n:\nf ( E qnt+1\n1 , c qnt+1 1 , d qnt+1 1\n) ≤ f ( E qnt+1\n1 , c qnt+1 1 , d1\n)\n(34)\nJust like in (30), upon taking the limit t → ∞ above and using c∗∗1 = c ∗ 1, we get\nf (E∗1 , c ∗ 1, d ∗∗ 1 ) ≤ f (E ∗ 1 , c ∗ 1, d1) ∀ d1 ∈ R n. (35)\nThus, d∗∗1 is a minimizer of the cost f (E ∗ 1 , c ∗ 1, d1) with respect to d1. Because of the equivalence of accumulation points, we\n11\nhave f (E∗1 , c ∗ 1, d ∗∗ 1 ) = f (E ∗ 1 , c ∗ 1, d ∗ 1) = f ∗. This implies that d∗1 is also a partial global minimizer of f in (35) satisfying\nd∗1 ∈ argmin d1 f (E∗1 , c ∗ 1, d1) (36)\nBy Proposition 2, the minimizer of the dictionary atom update cost is unique as long as the corresponding sparse code (in (33)) is non-zero. Therefore, d∗∗1 = d ∗ 1 is the unique minimizer in (36), except when c∗1 = 0. When c∗1 = 0, we use (24) to conclude that c qt 1 = 0 for all sufficiently large t values. Since c∗∗1 = c ∗ 1, we must also have that c qnt+1\n1 = 0 for all large enough t. Therefore, for sufficiently large t, dqt1 and d qnt+1\n1 are the minimizers of dictionary atom update steps (11), wherein the corresponding sparse coefficients cqt1 and c qnt+1\n1 are zero, implying that dqt1 = d qnt+1\n1 = v1 (Fig. 1) for all sufficiently large t. Thus, the limits satisfy d∗1 = d ∗∗ 1 = v1. Therefore, d ∗∗ 1 = d ∗ 1 holds, even when c∗1 = 0. Therefore, for j = 1,\nd∗∗1 = d ∗ 1, c ∗∗ 1 = c ∗ 1. (37)\nNext, we repeat the above procedure by considering first the sparse coding step and then the dictionary update step for j = 2 and iteration qnt +1. For j = 2, we consider the matrix\nE qnt+1 2 = Y − ∑\nk>2\nd qnt k ( c qnt k )T − d qnt+1 1\n(\nc qnt+1\n1\n)T\nIt follows from (37) that E qnt+1\n2 → E ∗ 2 as t → ∞. Then,\nby repeating the steps (30) - (37), we can easily show that c∗2 and d ∗ 2 are each partial global minimizers of f when all other variables are fixed to their values in (C∗, D∗). Moreover, c∗∗2 = c ∗ 2 and d ∗∗ 2 = d ∗ 2. Similar such arguments can be made sequentially for all other values of j until j = J . Finally, the partial global optimality of each column of C∗ and D∗ for the objective f implies that 0 ∈ ∂f (C∗, D∗), i.e., (C∗, D∗) is a critical point of the function f ."

More recently, data-driven adaptation of synthesis dictionaries has shown promise in many applications compared to fixed or analytical dictionary models. However, dictionary learning problems are typically non-convex and NP-hard, and the usual alternating minimization approaches for these problems are often computationally expensive, with the computations dominated by the NP-hard synthesis sparse coding step. In this work, we investigate an efficient method for l0 “norm”-based dictionary learning by first approximating the training data set with a sum of sparse rank-one matrices and then using a block coordinate descent approach to estimate the unknowns. The proposed block coordinate descent algorithm involves efficient closed-form solutions. In particular, the sparse coding step involves a simple form of thresholding. We provide a convergence analysis for the proposed block coordinate descent approach. Our numerical experiments show the promising performance and significant speed-ups provided by our method over the classical K-SVD scheme in sparse signal representation and image denoising.",
