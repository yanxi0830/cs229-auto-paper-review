      "text" : "Watermarking is the process of imperceptibly embedding a watermark signal into a host signal (audio segment, pixel patch from image or video frame). The watermark signal should only introduce tolerable distortion to the host signal and it should be recoverable by the intended receiver. Watermark-\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\ning techniques differ by the way they modulate the host signal to embed information. There are two major classes of watermark embedding schemes, namely spread spectrum and quantization index modulation (QIM) (Chen & Wornell, 2001).\nSpread spectrum watermarking (Cox et al., 2007; Hartung et al., 1999) constitutes a popular class of watermarking algorithms. In their simplest form, the watermarked signal is constructed by adding the host and watermark signals together, i.e. additive watermark embedding. Although, in terms of additive noise attacks they have been outperformed by the more robust QIM watermarking techniques (Chen & Wornell, 2001), spread-spectrum techniques have advantageous features that make them preferable in some watermarking scenarios. Examples of such inherent features include their simplicity and robustness to removal attacks. Another advantage is that spread-spectrum watermarking can be applied in different forms (multiplicative watermarking (Huang & Zhang, 2007)) that can further improve performance in some cases. They can also effectively exploit the human visual system (HVS) (Podilchuk & Zheng, 1998) to reduce perceptual degradation of the host signal.\nMany attacks have been designed to hamper the performance of watermarking in general and spreadspectrum watermarking in particular. The attacks are usually classified with respect to the attacker’s assumed knowledge about the watermark scheme. Robustness attacks pertain to the class of attacks under which the attacker has no knowledge of the watermark scheme. Examples of such attacks include adding random noise (Chen & Wornell, 2001) to the watermarked signal, replacing signal blocks with perceptually similar blocks computed in a certain way (Kirovski et al., 2007), applying a geometric transformation (cropping, scaling, translation, etc.) to the watermarked signal, or applying a malicious filtering operation (Su et al., 2001), to name a few. Other attacks belong to the\nso called worst case class of attacks, where the attacker has knowledge about the watermark technique and designs the attack such that the watermark detector (decoder) performance is minimized, under suitably defined distortion constraints. Usually, this type of attack is based on game theory (Cohen & Lapidoth, 2002) and is mostly of theoretical importance.\nA third class of attacks aims at compromising the watermark system security (security attacks) (Cayre et al., 2005; Freire & Gonzalez, 2009). Under this scenario, the attacker has access only to the watermarked data and tries to estimate the secret key used for embedding the watermark. Having estimated the secret key, he can then reconstruct the watermark and remove it from the watermarked data (the so called removal attacks), thus creating a forgery of the host signal, which can then be freely copied and distributed by pirates. Although (Cayre et al., 2005; Freire & Gonzalez, 2009) develop theoretical security attack frameworks, the proposed algorithms do not perform well with real correlated host signals.\nAnother type of attack is the so called sensitivity analysis attack, which constitutes a powerful subclass of removal attacks (Kalker et al., 1998; Linnartz & van Dijk, 1998; Choubassi & Moulin, 2007). In their attempt to estimate the watermark signal, they rely on unlimited access to the decoder.\nIn this paper, we consider the scenario in which a watermark signal is repeatedly embedded in specific (possibly secretly chosen) host signals. The host signal can represent a patch of pixels from image or video frame. The host signals may be perceptually similar or quite disparate, as the watermark algorithm may choose, for security reasons, to embed the watermark in specific signals of the host data based on a secret message bitstream. Repetitive watermark embedding is of particular interest in image and video watermarking (Voloshynovskiy et al., 2001; Lu & Hsu, 2007; Bas et al., 2002; Tang & Hang, 2003; Doerr & Dugelay, 2004; Kalker et al., 1999), where the watermark signal is repeatedly allocated into small blocks to ensure robustness and resistance to geometric (desynchronization) attacks. However, the proposed attacks related to this scenario assume that the watermark signal is not secretly hidden but is added to every host signal and therefore do not try to estimate an embedded message bitstream.\nThe attack model proposed in this paper jointly estimates the embedded message bitstream and watermark signal from the watermarked data, without access to the decoder. We develop a probabilistic model based on Bayesian statistics. The algorithm models\nthe host signal as having a multivariate Gaussian distribution with unknown mean and full covariance matrix. The watermark signal itself is also modeled as having a multivariate Gaussian distribution, but with separate unknown mean and full covariance matrix. The model parameters are updated sequentially from their respective conjugate full conditional posterior distributions, via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. To further increase the convergence speed of the proposed algorithm, we develop a variational Bayesian (VB) (Beal & Ghahramani, 2003) solution to it. In addition to its suitability for large scale data analysis, the VB solution also allows for diagnosing convergence, via the lower bound to the log-likelihood. Both MCMC and VB solutions perform comparably with respect to probability of bit error and relative watermark reconstruction error, with both synthetic and real host data.\nOur model borrows similar ideas from sparse factor regression formulations (sparse models) used in gene expression data analysis (West, 2003; Carvalho et al., 2008). The objective of such sparse models is to specify a prior for the elements of a highly sparse factor loadings matrix, with most elements being exactly zero and few of them having relatively large variances. To contrast with our model, the role of the zero elements here is taken by the data points (signals) that are not watermarked, which do not necessarily constitute the majority of all data points. The watermarked data points have the interpretation of the non-zero elements in the factor loadings matrix. However in our case, they are a sum of the host and the watermark signals, with the watermark signal being much weaker than the host signal. The problem becomes that of a joint identification-estimation of a subtle signal."

The watermark encoder is shown in Fig. 1. Considering\nthe ith data point and depending on the message bit bi ∈ {0, 1}, the encoder adds (bi = 1) the watermark signal w to the host signal xi, or leaves the host signal unchanged (bi = 0). The watermarked signal can therefore be written as\nyi =\n{\nxi +w if bi = 1, xi if bi = 0,\n(1)\nwhere i ∈ {1, . . . , n} and n is the number of available data points.\nThe watermark decoder is shown in Fig. 2. The decoder has access to the watermark signal w. Based on the received (watermarked) signal yi and the watermark signal, the decoder computes a detection test statistic f(yi,w) and compares it to a suitably chosen threshold τ . The decoder then outputs an estimate b̂i of the embedded message bit bi in the following way\nb̂i =\n{\n1 if f(yi,w) > τ, 0 if otherwise.\n(2)\nThroughout the paper, the document-to-watermark (DWR) ratio is defined as DWR = 10 log10 σ 2 x/σ 2 w, where σ2x is the variance of a single element in xi, for i ∈ {1, . . . , n}, and σ2w is the variance of a single element in w."

The proposed algorithm jointly estimates the watermark signal and message bitstream, directly from the watermarked signal and without access to the watermark decoder. We developed MCMC and VB solutions that perform comparably in terms of probability of error and relative watermark reconstruction error, on both synthetic and real host signals. Fast convergence is observed in both solutions, particularly in the VB solution where the algorithm converges in less than 20 iterations, with both synthetic and real host signals. While the MCMC solution is expected to result in more accurate estimates for infinite number of iterations, the VB solution is computationally more efficient and therefore more appropriate for large data sets. We demonstrated that the attack model is able\nto correctly infer a large part of the message bitstream while at the same time obtaining a good estimate of the watermark signal."

The proposed attack is based on Bayesian statistics. We consider the scenario in which a watermark signal is repeatedly embedded in specific, possibly chosen based on a secret message bitstream, segments (signals) of the host data. The host signal can represent a patch of pixels from an image or a video frame. We propose a probabilistic model that infers the embedded message bitstream and watermark signal, directly from the watermarked data, without access to the decoder. We develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler for updating the model parameters from their conjugate full conditional posteriors. We also provide a variational Bayesian solution, which further increases the convergence speed of the algorithm. Experiments with synthetic and real image signals demonstrate that the attack model is able to correctly infer a large part of the message bitstream and obtain a very accurate estimate of the watermark signal.",
