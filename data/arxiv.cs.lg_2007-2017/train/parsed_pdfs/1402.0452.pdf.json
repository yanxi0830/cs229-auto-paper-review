INTRODUCTION\nNakagami-m distribution is a versatile distribution which is used for modelling a variety of physical phenomena in communication engineering. An algorithm for estimation of the parameters of Nakagami-m distribution has been recently proposed in [1]. However many seminal papers like [2] have adressed this topic as well. The types of estimators proposed in the literature can be catagorised into two types: a)moment-based [3]–[8] b) algebraic maximal likelihood [2], [9] methods. In [9] the authors have studied many preexisting parameter estimators for the Nakagami-m distribution which belonged to both of the above mentioned category of estimators. The problem with moment based estimators is that it requires a large number of samples to estimate the moments accurately. On the other hand, the algebraic methods suffer from errors due to truncation of Taylor’s series.\nAn interesting work, [9], concludes that none of the many estimators discussed in it gives better performance than the Greenwood and Durand estimator [9] (which will be one of the many algorithms against which we will compare our approach in this paper). Also, [4], [6] deal with parameter estimation of noisy Nakagami-m signals. However, in noisy conditions, a) the distribution is no longer Nakagami-m, hence it is out of context for our study for now; and b) It uses moment based parameter estimates which require a significant number of samples to achieve a low variance; and lastly c) it needs\nknowledge of the variance of noise which corrupts the signal which could be Gaussian/Non-Gaussian.\nThe suitability of our approach in [1] against these previously existing algorithms has not been tested. In the current paper we we derive a new simple theoretical lower bound for variance of the m parameter estimates for this algorithm. It is seen that our proposed algorithm has two advantages; viz. a) It performs better than other estimators with low amounts of data in highly testing scenarios; and, b) as it is an online algorithm which considers one sample at a time the parameter ∆ in [2] is zero. Also, it does not make any algebraic approximations. This prevents error propagation between blocks in block processing scenarios. Due to these intuitive reasons, our proposed algorithm is better than the state of art in low-data/block scenarios.\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. Section II describes the conditions in which we simulated our algorithm. Section III describes the final algorithm. Section IV gives some heuristics which should be used. Section V gives the comparison of the variance of our algorithm with some existing estimators. Finally in the Appendix we give an expression for the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) based lower bound of the variance of our algorithm.\nII. NAKAGAMI-m DISTRIBUTION AND THE PORPOSED PARAMETER ESTIMATION ALGORITHM\nThe multivariate Nakagami-m distriution is approximated as the product of L individual Nakagami distributions (assuming that the data is i.i.d).\nP (x) = ΠLi=1 2L\nΓ(mi)σ mi i x2mi−1i exp(− x2i σi ) (1)\nHere, σi and mi are the spread factors and the centrality factors for each of the component Nakagami-m distributions.\nAs we take the derivative of the log-likelihood with respect to each of the components, and equate it to zero and solve the differential equation for the Γ(m), we get the following equations, which are solved numerically.\nΓ(mi) = x2mii σmii\n(2)\nand,\nσi = 1\nmi x2i (3)\nDetails of the derivation are provided in [1]."

      "text" : "In this section, we give a description of our simulation set up for comparison of our algorithm with the state of art. At a time we receive a limited parallel block of data. The deployed (“competing”) algorithms have to infer from a subset of such limited data blocks. A desirable property of an estimation algorithm in such a case is increased learnability with the number of blocks it sees (apart from less Mean Squared Error (MSE)). Further, in such limited data conditions, we may like to use a moving average estimator (which is the most simple and recursive approach to smoothing) to smooth the estimates. However, if the deployed algorithm has errors from factors like truncation of Taylor’s series, these errors will get propagated from block to block.\nThis intuition is caught by our algorithm. Our algorithm never uses series truncation. It relies on numerical methods and hence has the ability to learn improvably from multiple blocks. Also, our algorithm does not require large datasets for the moments to converge (unlike its moment based counterparts). Our simulations presented in this section confirm to this intuitive reasons for the success of our algorithm against its counterparts.\nThe algorithm to be followed in our comparison of parameter estimation methods can be given as below.\nAlgorithm 1 Parameter Estimation for m for {x}Ni=1 1: for i = 1 to N do 2: if i == 1 then 3: Estimate m̂1 via any of the candidate estimators\ndescribed. 4: else 5: Estimate m̂i via any of the candidate estimators. 6: Update current mean as m̂i = i−1i m̂i−1 + 1 i m̂i 7: end if 8: end for"

Also its performance is better than the Greenwood and Durand estimators given in [9](which were the most superior in that paper) and equivalent to the moment based estimator in most of the m regimes. Hence our algorithm has sufficient credibility in scenarios where block data processing is common like Orthogonal Frequency Division multiplexing (OFDM) and data is limited.\nFor the sake of completeness, the normalized variance plots are also shown in Fig. 2. In Figs. 3 and 4 we compare the performance of all the estimators in the setting 20X7 block size (i.e in reference of Sec. III, the ith block is of size 20 and N = 7). We see that in this scenario, our estimator even outperforms the moment based estimator."

In such cases, we must use an algorithm which is a) exact b) iterative (for robustness and tracking non-stationarity). Also, one of the secondary objectives of our algorithm is to omit the role of P/S converter before parameter estimation for performing detection."

This implies,\nlog(Γ(m+ 0.5)) ≥ log(Γ(m)) + 0.5ψ(m) (14)\nor,\n2(log(Γ(m+ 0.5))− log(Γ(m))) ≥ ψ(m) (15)\nor,\nψ(m) ≤ 2log( Γ(m+ 0.5)σ0.5\nΓ(m) )− log(σ) (16)\nor,\nψ(m) ≤ 2log(E[x])− log(σ) (17)\nBy Jensen’s inequality,\nE[log(x)] ≤ log(E[x]) (18)\nThis implies that the inequality in Equation. must hold for the least possible value of log(E[x]). Thus,\nψ(m) ≤ log( x2\nσ ) (19)\nor ψ(m) lies in a δ1 neighborhood of log(x 2\nσ ), i.e.,\nψ(m) + δ1 = E[log( x2\nσ )] (20)\nwhere δ1 is a non-zero number. From concavity of ψ(m),\nψ ′ (m) ≥ 2(ψ(m+ 0.5)− ψ(m)) (21)\nor,\nψ ′\n(m) = 2(ψ(m+ 0.5)− ψ(m)) + δ2 (22)\nIt is trivial to see,\nδ1 → 0 ⇔ δ2 → 0 (23)\nbecause,\nψ ′ (m) = 2(ψ(m+ 0.5)− ψ(m)) ⇔ ψ(m) ≈ log( x2\nσ ) (24)\nThen, after a simple analysis our approximate lower bound for variance becomes,\nCRLB ′ = 1\nN [2ψ(m+ 0.5)− 2ψ(m)− 1 m ]\n(25)\nThis is the modified expression for the lower bound for the variance of this estimator.\nThis expression is obtained by putting the minimum possible value of the ψ ′\n(m). This situation occurs iff the equations in [1] are exactly solved. This expression is clearly greater than the CRLB for the Nakagami-m distribution.\nWe can see from the previous simulations that our estimator almost faithfully follows this curve as a function of m."

In these scenarios, the estimator should be able to give accurate estimates (in the mean square sense) with less amount of data. Also, the estimates should improve with increase in number of blocks received. In this paper, we see through our simulations, that our proposal is well designed for meeting such requirements. Further, it is well known in the literature that an efficient estimator does not exist for the Nakagami-m distribution.
