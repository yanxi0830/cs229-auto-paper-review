      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "In pattern recognition problems, we try to design a classification function to predict the class label of a data sample, so that the misclassification errors of a set of training samples can be minimized [3,11,12,20,30,4]. A popular assumption for the learning of a classifier is that the loss of misclassifying any data sample in the training set is equal. However, in real-world applications, different misclassifications may result in significant different costs. For example, in the problem of breast cancer diagnosis, misclassifying a malignant tumor sample may cause much more cost than misclassifying a benign tumor sample. Thus it is necessary to take the costs of different types of misclassifications into account when a classifier is trained. This problem is named cost-sensitive learning in machine learning community [33,16,48,13,58]. Given the cost setting, i.e., costs of different misclassifications, the target of cost-sensitive learning is to train a classifier so that the cost of overall misclassification can be minimized. In cost-sensitive binary classification, we can have different costs for misclassifications of positive and negative samples. In this case, misclassifying a positive sample to a negative sample incorrectly may results much higher cost than misclassifying a negative sample to a positive sample. So we must design a classify to correctly classify most of the positive samples, while allow some misclassification of negative samples. In this way, the overall misclassification cost can be minimized. Lots of cost-sensitive learning algorithms have been proposed to take account of different misclassification costs. For example, Zhou et al. [58] proposed to train cost-sensitive neural networks by using technologies of sampling and threshold-moving (STM), so that the distribution of the training data samples can be modify, and the costs of different types of misclassifications can be conveyed by the appearances of the examples. Sun et al. [32] provided a comprehensive analysis of the AdaBoost algorithm regarding its application in the class imbalance problem, and developed three cost-sensitive boosting algorithms (CSB), by introducing cost items into the learning framework of AdaBoost. Masnadi-Shirazi and Vasconcelos [25] also proposed a AdaBoost-based cost-sensitive learning algorithm (ABC) to design cost-sensitive boosting algorithms, by considering two necessary conditions for optimal cost-sensitive learning, which are the minimization of expected losses by optimal cost-sensitive decision rules, and the minimization of empirical loss to emphasize the neighborhood of the desired cost-sensitive boundary. Ting [34] introduced a sample-weighting method (SW) to induce cost-sensitive trees, by generalizing the standard tree induction process and initial instance weights determine the type of tree to be induced-minimum error trees or minimum high cost error trees. Chen eta al. [10] proposed a supervised learning algorithm fast flux discriminant, for large-scale nonlinear cost-sensitive classification problems, by decomposing the kernel density estimation in the original feature space into selected low-dimensional subspaces. This method archives the efficiency, interpretability and accuracy simultaneously, and meanwhile it is also sparse and naturally handles mixed data types.\nWith rapid development of internet technology, more and more data is generated continuously, and the training set of data samples is been increased every day with new data samples added to the training set. Moreover, the cost setting can also be changed from time to time. This proposed tow new challenges to the cost sensitive learning problems:\n1. When the cost setting is changed, the learned classifier cannot be adapted to the new cost setting. A possible strategy to solve this problem is to learn a new classifier according to the new cost setting using the entire training set from the very beginning and ignores the previous learned classifier with previous cost setting. However this strategy is time-consuming, especially when the training set is large. When we already have a classifier learned according to a cost setting, can we utilize it to learn another classifier with regard to a different cost setting? This problem is defined as classifier adaption. Actually, classifier adaptation has been applied to performance measures optimization [21] and cross-domain learning [47]. In [21], a classifier is learned to optimize a performance measure, and then adapted to optimize another performance measure, while in [47], a classifier is learned from a domain, and then adapted to a different domain. In this paper, we propose the problem of adapting a learned classifier to a different cost setting. 2. When the data samples are generated and added to the training set one by one, the transitional cost sensitive learning methods cannot be applied, since they assumes that the entire training set is given to the algorithm once. Recently, cost-sensitive online classification (CSOC) method was proposed by Wang et al. [39]. This method takes the training set one by one and update the cost sensitive classifier online [29,49,14]. However, CSOC is also constrained to fixed cost setting. When a cost setting is given, it learn a new classifier online, and ignores the other classifiers learned with different cost settings. Can we learn a classifier from a base classifier trained with different cost sensitive setting online? This problem remains an open problem.\nTo solve the above two problems simultaneously, in this paper, we propose the first online cost-sensitive classier adaption method. We assume that we have a existed cost-sensitive classifier, and we try to adapt it to another classifier with regard to a different cost setting, with help of data samples appearing one by one in an online way. The adaptation is implemented by adding an adaptation function, and the it is learned by updating the adaptation function parameter with the coming training samples with different misclassification costs. We construct an objective function by considering the respecting previous learned and minimizing cost weighted hinge loss with coming training samples. By solving the objective function with a gradient descent method and we develop an iterative algorithm. The contributions of this paper are of two folds:\n1. We proposed the problem of online cost-sensitive classifier adaptation.\n2. We proposed a novel algorithm to solve this problem.\nThe rest parts of this paper are organized as follows: in Section 2, we introduce the proposed novel method. In Section 3, the proposed method is evaluated on some benchmark data sets. In Section 4, the paper is concluded with some future works.\n2 Proposed Method\n2.1 Problem Formulation\nIn this paper, instead of learning a novel cost-sensitive classifier from the given training set and the cost setting, we hope to use the existed classifier by employing the framework of classifier adaptation to learn the cost-sensitive classifier effectively. Suppose that we already have a classifier f0(x) learned without consider the different costs of misclassifications of positive and negative samples, or a classifier learned with different cost setting, we want to adapt it to a problem with a new cost setting. To this end, we construct a new classifier f(x) by adding a linear adaptation function w⊤x to f0(x), i.e.\nf(x) = f0(x) +w ⊤x (1)\nwhere w ∈ Rd is the adaptation function parameter. Please note that f0(x) can be any type of classifier, for example, SVM, Adaboost, etc. In this way, we transfer the problem of cost-sensitive classifier adaptation to the learning of w.\nIn the traditional cost-sensitive learning problem, a training data set composed of many positive and negative training samples are given. The cost factors of misclassification of positive and negative samples are denoted as C+ and C− respectively. Please note that when we train f0(x), C+ and C− are set to different values. The target of cost-sensitive learning is to learn a classifier which could minimize the overall cost of misclassification of the training samples. However, in the online learning scene, we do not have the entire training data set during the training procedure. Instead, the training data samples are given sequentially, and the algorithm is run in an iterative way. In each iteration, only one training sample is given, and the classifier is updated only with regard to this training sample. In the t-th iteration, we assume that wa have a training sample (xt, yt), where xt ∈ R\nd is its d-dimensional feature vector, and yt ∈ {+1,−1} is its corresponding class label. The corresponding misclassification cost is also given as Ct,\nCt =\n{\nC+,if yi = +1; C−,if yi = −1. (2)\nMoreover, we also assume that we already learned an adaptation function parameter from the previous iteration wt−1. To update w, we consider the following two problems.\n– Respecting previous learned wt−1: To make the learned w consistent, we hope the updated wt to respect the previous wt−1. To this end, we minimize the squared ℓ2 distance between them,\nmin w\n1 2 ‖w−wt−1‖ 2 2 . (3)\n– Minimizing Cost Weighted Hinge Loss: To measure the loss of misclassification, we apply the hinge loss function to (xt, yt), which is defined as\nL(yt, f(xt)) = max(0, 1− ytf(xt))\n= max ( 0, 1− yt ( f0(xt) +w ⊤xt )) . (4)\nSince positive and negative samples have different misclassification costs, we weight the hinge loss of the t-th sample by its corresponding cost factor Ct, and minimize the weighted loss,\nmin w\nCt ×max(0, 1− yt ( f0(xt) +w ⊤xt ) ) (5)\nBy introducing a nonnegative slack variable ξ, the optimization problem with a cost weighted hinge loss is transferred to\nmin w,ξ Ctξ,\ns.t. 1− yt ( f0(xt) +w ⊤xt ) ≤ ξ, 0 ≤ ξ. (6)\nHere the cost factor Ct is similar to the penalty factor of SVM. However, we must note that this penalty factor is cost-sensitive.\nBy considering the problems in (3) and (6) simultaneously, we obtain the optimization problem for the updating of w in the t-th iteration,\n(wt, ξt) = argmin w,ξ\n1 2 ‖w−wt−1‖ 2 2 + αCtξ,\ns.t. 1− yt ( f0(xt) +w ⊤xt ) ≤ ξ, 0 ≤ ξ.\n(7)\nwhere α is a tradeoff parameter, and it is chosen by cross-fold validation on a training set. By solving this problem, we can obtain an adaptation function parameter wt with regard to the training sample input in the t-th iteration. We should note that the obtained wt is learned from both the previous wt−1 and the training sample (xt, yt). Most importantly, the updating of wt relies on the cost of misclassification cost of (xt, yt) by considering the cost factor as a loss weight. When different samples come, different cost factor is used and the hinge loss is weighted correspondingly.\n2.2 Optimization\nTo optimize the objective function in (7), we use the Lagrange multiplier method. The Lagrange function is\nL(w, ξ, τ, λ) = 1\n2 ‖w−wt−1‖\n2 2 + αCtξ\n+ τ ( 1− yt ( f0(xt) +w ⊤xt ) − ξ ) − λξ. (8)\nwhere τ is the nonnegative Lagrangemultiplier for the constrain of 1−yt ( f0(xt) +w ⊤xt )\n≤ ξ, and λ is the nonnegative Lagrange multiplier for the constrain of 0 ≤ ξ. According to the dual theory of optimization, the minimization of (7) can be achieved by solving the following dual problem,\nmax τ,λ min w,ξ L(w, ξ, τ, λ)\ns.t. τ ≥ 0, λ ≥ 0. (9)\nTo solve this problem, we set the divertive of the Lagrange function L(w, ξ, τ, λ) with regard to w to zero, and we have\n∂L ∂w =(w−wt−1)− τytxt = 0 ⇒ w = wt−1 + τytxt. (10)\nRemark: The motivation of setting the divertive of the Lagrange function with regard to w to zero is to solve the inner minimization problem. In equation (9), the problem is coupled with two optimization problems, which is a inner minimization problem, and an outer maximization problem. To solve this coupled problem, our strategy is first solving the inner problem, and then substituting the results to the objective to solve the outer problem. According to the optimization theory, the minimization of L with regard to w is reached at a solution making its divertive zero, thus we should set the divertive of the L with regard to w to zero to obtain the optimal w.\nMoreover, we also set its divertive with regard to ξ to zero, and obtain\n∂L ∂ξ =αCt − τ − λ = 0 ⇒ αCt − τ = λ ≥ 0 ⇒ τ ≤ αCt. (11)\nSubstituting results of both (10) and (11) to the Lagrange function in (8), we can rewrite it as the function of only variable τ ,\nL(τ) = 1\n2 ‖τytxt‖\n2 2 + τ\n[\n1− yt\n(\nf0(xt) + (wt−1 + τytxt) ⊤ xt\n)]\n= 1\n2 τ2x⊤t xt + τ\n[ 1− yt ( f0(xt) +w ⊤ t−1xt )] − τ2x⊤t xt\n=− 1\n2 τ2x⊤t xt + τ\n[ 1− yt ( f0(xt) +w ⊤ t−1xt )] .\n(12)\nBy setting the divertive of L(τ) with regard to τ to zero, we have the initial solution of τ ,\n∂L(τ)\n∂τ = −τx⊤t xt +\n[ 1− yt ( f0(xt) +w ⊤ t−1xt )] = 0\n⇒ τ = 1− yt\n(\nf0(xt) +w ⊤ t−1xt\n)\nx⊤t xt .\n(13)\nMoreover, we should also note that in (8), we have a constrain τ ≥ 0, and in (11) we have another constrain τ ≤ αCt. Thus the solution of τ must fall in the following range,\n0 ≤ τ ≤ αCt. (14)\nIn this way, the solution of τ t can be obtained by discussing the following three cases:\n1. Case I: When 1−yt(f0(xt)+w⊤t−1xt)\nx ⊤\nt xt\n≤ 0, the solution of τt is\nτt = 0, (15)\nso that the constrain τ ≥ 0 can be satisfied.\n2. Case II: When 0 < 1−yt(f0(xt)+w⊤t−1xt)\nx ⊤\nt xt\n≤ αCt, the solution of τt is\nτt = 1− yt\n(\nf0(xt) +w ⊤ t−1xt\n)\nx⊤t xt , (16)\nso that the minimization of (7) can be archived.\n3. Case III: When αCt < 1−yt(f0(xt)+w⊤t−1xt)\nx ⊤\nt xt\n, we have the solution of τt as\nτt = αCt, (17)\nso that the constrain τt ≤ αCt can be satisfied.\nAfter τt is determined, we can then update wt using the result in (10) as follows,\nwt = wt−1 + τtytxt. (18)\nIt could be note that the new classifier adaptation function parameter is obtained by adding a bias term ytxt determined by the t-th sample to the previous wt−1. The bias term is weighted by a Lagrange multiplier τt which is further controlled by the cost factor of the t-th sample.\n2.3 Algorithm\nBased on the optimization results, we can develop an online cost-sensitive classifier adaptation algorithm which can take training samples one by one. The algorithm takes an initial classifier f(x) as an input, and operates on a iterative way. In each iteration, one new training sample is input to update the classifier adaptation function parameter, based on the updating rules in (15) - (17), and (18).\nAlgorithm 1 Online Cost-Sensitive Classifier Adaptation algorithm (OCSCA).\nInput: An initial classifier function f0(x); Input: Tradeoff parameter α; Initialize t = 0 and w0 = 0 while A new training sample (xt, yt) with its corresponding misclassification cost Ct is input do\nCompute the initial solution of Lagrange multiplier τ as\nτ ′ t =\n1− yt ( f0(xt) +w⊤t−1xt )\nx⊤ t xt\n. (19)\nUpdate τt as\nτt =\n  \n \n0,if τ ′ t ≤ 0,\nτ ′ t ,if 0 < τ ′ t ≤ αCt\nαCt,if τ ′ t > αCt.\n(20)\nUpdate wt as\nwt = wt−1 + τtytxt. (21)\nUpdate t = t+ 1; end while Output: Output the learned cost-sensitive classifier function f(x) = f0(x) +wt−1⊤x"

The problem of face detection is to classify a given candidate image to face or non-face. Moreover, we set the cost of misclassifying a face to non-face as 5, and that of misclassifying a non-face to fact to 1."

The problem of car detection\nis to classify a given candidate image to car or non-car. In this problem car images are defined as positive images, and the non-car images are defined as negative images. In this case, we set the cost of misclassification of a car image to 8, and that of a non-car image to 1.\n3.2 Experiment setup\nTo conduct the experiment, we used the 10-fold cross validation. An entire data set was split into 10 folds randomly, and then each set is used as a test set, while the remaining 9 sets were combined as a training set. Moreover, since the proposed method is based on the adaption of a classifier f0(x) trained with different cost setting, we further split the training set to two subsets. The first subset contains 2 folds, and we used it to train f0(x) with different cost setting. For the first data set, we used the cost setting of C+ = 2 and C− = 1 to train f0(x), and for the second data set, used C+ = 3 and C− = 1. The second subset contains 7 folds, and we used it to learn w using the proposed online learning algorithm, by inputting the training samples of the second training subset to the algorithm one by one.\nThe classification performances were measured by the average classification accuracies and the average misclassification costs. They are defined as follows,\nAverage classification accuracy =\n∑\ni:xin∈T I(yi = y ∗ i )\n∑\ni:xi∈T 1\n,\nAverage misclassification cost =\n∑\ni:xin∈T CiI(yi 6= y ∗ i )\n∑\ni:xi∈T 1\n,\n(22)\nwhere T is the test set, y∗i is the predicted class label, and I(yi = y ∗ i ) = 1 if yi = y ∗ i , and 0 otherwise.\n3.3 Results\nWe first compared the purposed online cost sensitive learning algorithm based on classifier adaptation to an online cost sensitive learning algorithm without considering the existed classifier f0(x), and then compared it to some transitional cost sensitive learning algorithm. Because the proposed algorithm is the only method that can take advantage of f0(x), for fear comparison, when we used the other algorithm, both f0(x) and the 2 folds in the training set used to train f0(x) were ignored."

From this\nfigure, we can see that the proposed method outperforms the CSOC algorithm on both average accuracy and misclassification cost. Especially in the case of misclassification cost, the proposed algorithm achieves completely lower average misclassification cost then CSOC. This is because the proposed method takes advantage of an existing predictor learned from more data points by adapting it to a given cost setting. Even the existing predictor is learned according to a different cost setting. This is an strong evidence of the fact that classifier adaptation can benefit cost sensitive learning."

      "heading" : "3.3.2 Comparison to off-line cost sensitivity classification method",
      "text" : "We also compare the proposed OCSCA to four most popular off-line costsensitive learning algorithms, which are STM proposed by Zhou et al. [58], CSB proposed by Sun et al. [32], ABC proposed by Masnadi-Shirazi and Vas-\nconcelos [25], and SW proposed by Ting [34]. The boxplots the classification accuracies and misclassification costs are given in Fig. 2. It is clear that in both the two figures, the proposed algorithm outperforms the compared algorithms on both classification accuracies and misclassification costs. The outperforming is even more significant on the misclassification costs. A main reason for this phenomenon lies on the fact that the proposed OCSCA algorithm starts learning from a base classifier f0(x), and then adapt it to the given cost setting via a training set, while the rest algorithms ignores f0(x) and directly learn the classifier from the training set. This means using a base classifier and adapting it to a training set can significantly boost the performance of cost-sensitive learning. Moreover, among the compared algorithms, it seems ABC and CSB performs slightly better than the other two ones. A possible reason is that they use the formula of Adaboost algorithm [31,26,2,9], which performs well on detection problems."

Thus we also compared the running time of these methods and the results are given in Fig. 3. It is obverse that the running time of the two online learning algorithms OCSCA and CSOC is much less than that of the off-line learning algorithms. Both of OCSCA and CSOC take less than 200 seconds, while all the off-line learning algorithms take more than 800 seconds. This is not surprising because in each iteration, OCSCA and CSOC update the classifier using only one data sample, while the off-line learning algorithms needs to consider all the training samples."

    "abstractText" : "In this paper, we propose the problem of online cost-sensitive classifier adaptation and the first algorithm to solve it. We assume we have a base classifier for a cost-sensitive classification problem, but it is trained with respect to a cost setting different to the desired one. Moreover, we also have some training data samples streaming to the algorithm one by one. The problem is to adapt the given base classifier to the desired cost setting using the steaming training samples online. To solve this problem, we propose to learn a new classifier by adding an adaptation function to the base classifier, and update the adaptation function parameter according to the streaming data samples. Given a input data sample and the cost of misclassifying it, we update the adaptation function parameter by minimizing cost weighted hinge loss and respecting previous learned parameter simultaneously. The proposed algorithm is compared to both online and off-line cost-sensitive algorithms on two cost-sensitive classification problems, and the experiments show that it not only outperforms them one classification performances, but also requires significantly less running time.",
