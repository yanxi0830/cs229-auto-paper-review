      "text" : "Online convex optimization is a powerful paradigm for sequential decision making (Shalev-Shwartz, 2011). It can be viewed as a game between a learner and an adversary: In the t-th round, the learner selects a decision wt ∈ Ω, simultaneously the adversary chooses a function ft(·) : Ω 7→ R, and then the learner suffers an instantaneous loss ft(wt). This study focuses on the full-information setting (Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi, 2006), where the function ft(·) is revealed to the leaner at the end of each round. The goal of the learner is to minimize the cumulative loss over T periods. The standard performance measure is regret, which is the difference between the loss incurred by the learner and that of the best fixed decision in hindsight, i.e.,\nRegret(T ) =\nT∑\nt=1\nft(wt)− min w∈Ω\nT∑\nt=1\nft(w).\nThe above regret is typically referred to as static regret in the sense that the comparator is time-invariant. The rationale behind this evaluation metric is that one of the decision in Ω is reasonably good over the T rounds. However, when the underlying distribution of loss functions changes, the static regret may be too optimistic and fails to capture the hardness of the problem.\nTo address this limitation, new forms of performance measure, including adaptive regret (Hazan and Seshadhri, 2007, 2009) and dynamic regret (Zinkevich, 2003), were proposed and received significant interest recently. Given a parameter τ , which is the length of the interval, the strong version of adaptive regret is defined as\nSA-Regret(T, τ) = max [s,s+τ−1]⊆[T ]\n( s+τ−1∑\nt=s\nft(wt)− min w∈Ω\ns+τ−1∑\nt=s\nft(w)\n) . (1)\nFrom the definition, we observe that minimizing the adaptive regret enforces the learner has small static regret over any interval of length τ . Since the best decision for different intervals could be different, the learner is essentially competing with a changing comparator.\nA parallel line of research introduces the concept of dynamic regret, where the cumulative loss of the learner is compared against a comparator sequence u1, . . . ,uT ∈ Ω, i.e.,\nD-Regret(u1, . . . ,uT ) = T∑\nt=1\nft(wt)− T∑\nt=1\nft(ut). (2)\nIt is well-known that in the worst case, a sublinear dynamic regret is impossible unless we impose some regularities on the comparator sequence or the function sequence (Jadbabaie et al., 2015). A representative example is the functional variation defined below\nVT =\nT∑\nt=2\nmax w∈Ω\n|ft(w)− ft−1(w)|. (3)\nBesbes et al. (2015) have proved that as long as VT is sublinear in T , there exists an algorithm that achieves a sublinear dynamic regret. Furthermore, under the noisy gradient feedback, a general restarting procedure is developed, and it enjoys O(T 2/3V 1/3 T ) and\nO(log T √ TVT ) rates for convex functions and strongly convex functions, respectively. This result is very strong in the sense that these rates are (almost) minimax optimal. However, the restarting procedure can only be applied when an upper bound of VT is known beforehand, thus limiting its application in practice.\nWhile both the adaptive and dynamic regrets aim at coping with changing environments, little is known about their relationship. This paper makes a step towards understanding their connections. Specifically, we show that the strongly adaptive regret in (1), together with the functional variation, can be used to upper bound the dynamic regret in (2). Thus, an algorithm with a small strongly adaptive regret is automatically equipped with a tight dynamic regret. As a result, we obtain a series of algorithms for minimizing the dynamic regret that do not need any prior knowledge of the functional variation. The main contributions of this work are summarized below.\n• We provide a general theorem that upper bounds the dynamic regret in terms of the strongly adaptive regret and the functional variation.\n• For convex functions, we show that the strongly adaptive algorithm of Jun et al. (2016) has a dynamic regret of O(T 2/3V\n1/3 T log 1/3 T ), which matches the minimax rate, up to a polylogarithmic factor. • For exponentially concave functions, we propose a strongly adaptive algorithm that allows us to control the tradeoff between the adaptive regret and the computational cost explicitly. Furthermore, we demonstrate that its dynamic regret is O( √ TVT log T ),\nand this is the first time such kind of dynamic regret bound is established for exponentially concave functions. • Since strongly convex functions with bounded gradients are also exponentially concave, our previous result immediately implies a dynamic regret of O( √ TVT log T ),\nwhich is also minimax optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor. It also indicates our bound for exponentially concave functions is almost optimal."

For general convex functions, the classical online gradient descent achieves O( √ T ) and O(log T ) regret bounds for convex and strongly convex functions, respectively (Zinkevich, 2003; Hazan et al., 2007; Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2007). Both the O( √ T ) and O(log T ) rates are known to be minimax optimal (Abernethy et al., 2009).

      "text" : "The concept of adaptive regret is introduced by Hazan and Seshadhri (2007), and later strengthened by Daniely et al. (2015). To distinguish between them, we refer to the definition of Hazan and Seshadhri (2007) as weakly adaptive regret and the one of Daniely et al. (2015) as strongly adaptive regret. The weak version is given by\nWA-Regret(T ) = max [s,q]⊆[T ]\nq∑\nt=s\nft(wt)− min w∈Ω\nq∑\nt=s\nft(w).\nTo minimize the adaptive regret, Hazan and Seshadhri (2007) have developed two metaalgorithms: an efficient algorithm with O(log T ) computational complexity per iteration and an inefficient one with O(T ) computational complexity per iteration. These metaalgorithms use an existing online method (that was possibly designed to have small static regret) as a subroutine.1 For convex functions, the efficient and inefficient meta-algorithms\n1. For brevity, we ignored the factor of subroutine in the statements of computational complexities. The O(·) computational complexity should be interpreted as O(·) × s space complexity and O(·) × t time complexity, where s and t are space and time complexities of the subroutine per iteration, respectively.\nhave O( √ T log3 T ) and O( √\nT log T ) regret bounds, respectively. For exponentially concave functions, those rates are improved to O(log2 T ) and O(log T ), respectively. We can see that the price paid for the adaptivity is very small: The rates of weakly adaptive regret differ from those of static regret only by logarithmic factors.\nA major limitation of weakly adaptive regret is that it does not respect short intervals well. Taking convex functions as an example, the O( √ T log3 T ) and O( √ T log T ) bounds\nare meaningless for intervals of length O( √ T ). To overcome this limitation, Daniely et al. (2015) proposed a refined adaptive regret that takes the length of the interval as a parameter τ , as indicated in (1). If the strongly adaptive regret is small for all τ < T , we can guarantee the learner has small regret over any interval of any length. In particular, Daniely et al. (2015) introduced the following definition.\nDefinition 1 Let R(τ) be the minimax static regret bound of the learning problem over τ periods. An algorithm is strongly adaptive, if\nSA-Regret(T, τ) = O(poly(log T ) ·R(τ)).\nIt is easy to verify that the meta-algorithms of Hazan and Seshadhri (2007) are strongly adaptive for exponentially concave functions,2 but not for convex functions. Thus, Daniely et al. (2015) developed a new meta-algorithm that satisfies SA-Regret(T, τ) = O( √ τ log T ) for convex functions, and thus is strongly adaptive. The algorithm is also efficient and the computational complexity per iteration is O(log T ). Later, the strongly adaptive regret of convex functions was improved to O( √ τ log T ) by Jun et al. (2016)."

      "text" : "In a seminal work, Zinkevich (2003) proposed to use the path-length defined as\nP(u1, . . . ,uT ) = T∑\nt=2\n‖ut − ut−1‖2\nto upper bound the dynamic regret. Specifically, Zinkevich (2003) proved that for any sequence of convex functions, the dynamic regret of online gradient descent can be upper bounded by O( √ TP(u1, . . . ,uT )). Another regularity of the comparator sequence, which is similar to the path-length, is defined as\nP ′(u1, . . . ,uT ) = T∑\nt=2\n‖ut − Φt(ut−1)‖2\nwhere Φt(·) is a dynamic model that predicts a reference point for the t-th round. Hall and Willett (2013) developed a novel algorithm named dynamic mirror descent and proved that its dynamic regret is on the order of √ TP ′(u1, . . . ,uT ) . The advantage of P ′(u1, . . . ,uT ) is that when the comparator sequence follows the dynamical model closely, it can be much smaller than the path-length P(u1, . . . ,uT ). 2. That is because (i) SA-Regret(T, τ ) ≤ WA-Regret(T ), and (ii) there is a poly(log T ) factor in the\ndefinition of strong adaptivity.\nLetw∗t ∈ argminw∈Ω ft(w) be a local minimizer of ft(·). For any sequence of u1, . . . ,uT ∈ Ω, we have\nD-Regret(u1, . . . ,uT ) =\nT∑\nt=1\nft(wt)− T∑\nt=1\nft(ut)\n≤D-Regret(w∗1, . . . ,w∗T ) = T∑\nt=1\nft(wt)− T∑\nt=1\nmin w∈Ω ft(w).\nThus, D-Regret(w∗1, . . . ,w ∗ T ) can be treated as the worst case of the dynamic regret, and there are many work that were devoted to minimizing D-Regret(w∗1, . . . ,w ∗ T ) (Jadbabaie et al., 2015; Mokhtari et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016).\nWhen a prior knowledge of P(w∗1, . . . ,w∗T ) is available, D-Regret(w∗1, . . . ,w∗T ) can be upper bounded by O( √ TP(w∗1, . . . ,w∗T )) (Yang et al., 2016). If all the functions are strongly convex and smooth, the upper bound can be improved to O(P(w∗1, . . . ,w∗T )) (Mokhtari et al., 2016). The O(P(w∗1, . . . ,w∗T )) rate is also achievable when all the functions are convex and smooth, and all the minimizersw∗t ’s lie in the interior of Ω (Yang et al., 2016). In a recent study, Zhang et al. (2016) introduced a new regularity—squared pathlength\nS(w∗1, . . . ,w∗T ) = T∑\nt=2\n‖w∗t −w∗t−1‖22\nwhich could be much smaller than the path-length P(w∗1, . . . ,w∗T ) when the difference between successive local minimizers is small. Zhang et al. (2016) developed a novel algorithm named online multiple gradient descent, and proved that D-Regret(w∗1, . . . ,w ∗ T ) is on the order of min(P(w∗1, . . . ,w∗T ),S(w∗1, . . . ,w∗T )) for (semi-)strongly convex and smooth functions.\nAlthough closely related, adaptive regret and dynamic regret are studied independently and there are few discussions of their relationships. In the literature, dynamic regret is also referred to as tracking regret or shifting regret (Littlestone and Warmuth, 1994; Herbster and Warmuth, 1998, 2001). In the setting of “prediction with expert advice”, Adamskiy et al. (2012) have shown that the tracking regret can be derived from the adaptive regret. In the setting of “online linear optimization in the simplex”, Cesa-bianchi et al. (2012) introduced a generalized notion of shifting regret which unifies adaptive regret and shifting regret. Different from previous work, this paper considers the setting of online convex optimization, and illustrates that the dynamic regret can be upper bounded by the adaptive regret and the functional variation."

For a specific type of problems, we can plug in the corresponding upper bound of strongly adaptive regret, and then choose any sequence of intervals to obtain a concrete upper bound. In particular, the choice of the intervals may depend on the (possibly unknown) functional variation.\nBefore proceeding to specific bounds, we introduce the following common assumption.\nAssumption 1 Both the gradient and the domain are bounded. • The gradients of all the online functions are bounded by G, i.e., maxw∈Ω ‖∇ft(w)‖ ≤\nG for all ft. • The diameter of the domain Ω is bounded by B, i.e., max w,w′∈Ω ‖w −w′‖ ≤ B."

Similar to the approach of following the leading history (FLH) (Hazan and Seshadhri, 2007), at any time t, we will instantiate an expert by applying the online learning algorithm E to the sequence of loss functions\nft, ft+1, . . ., and utilize the strategy of learning from expert advice to combine solutions of different experts (Herbster and Warmuth, 1998). Our method is named as improved following the leading history (IFLH), and is summarized in Algorithm 1.\nLet Et be the expert that starts to work at time t. To control the computational complexity, we will associate an ending time et for each Et. The expert Et is alive during the period [t, et − 1]. In each round t, we maintain a working set of experts St, which contains all the alive experts, and assign a probability pjt for each E\nj ∈ St. In Steps 6 and 7, we remove all the experts whose ending times are no larger than t. Since the number of alive experts has changed, we need to update the probability assigned to them, which is performed in Steps 12 to 14.

Recall that E10(111) = 120, E10(120) = 200, and E10(200) = 1000.\nBased on Lemma 6, we have the following theorem regarding the adaptive regret of exp-concave functions.\nTheorem 6 Suppose Assumption 1 holds, Ω ⊂ Rd, all the functions are α-exp-concave. If online Newton step is used as the subroutine in Algorithm 1, we have\ns∑\nt=r\nft(wt)− min w∈Ω\ns∑\nt=r\nft(w) ≤ ( (5d+ 1)m+ 2\nα + 5dmGB\n) log T\nwhere m ≤ ⌊logK s⌋+ 1. And thus,\nSA-Regret(T, τ) ≤ ( (5d+ 1)m̄+ 2\nα + 5dm̄GB\n) log T = O ( log2 T\nlogK\n)\nwhere m̄ = (⌊logK T ⌋+ 1). From Lemma 6 and Theorem 6, we observe that the adaptive regret is a decreasing function of K, while the computational cost is an increasing function of K. Thus, we can control the tradeoff by tuning the value of K.\nFor strongly convex functions, we have a similar guarantee but without any dependence on the dimensionality d, as indicated below.\nTheorem 7 Suppose Assumption 1 holds, and all the functions are λ-strongly convex. If online gradient descent is used as the subroutine in Algorithm 1, we have\ns∑\nt=r\nft(wt)− min w∈Ω\ns∑\nt=r\nft(w) ≤ G2\n2λ\n( m+ (3m+ 4) log T )\nwhere m ≤ ⌊logK s⌋+ 1.

As a result, we are able to derive dynamic regret bounds for convex functions, exponentially concave functions, and strongly convex functions. All of these upper bounds are almost minimax optimal and this is the first time that such kind of dynamic regret bound is proved for exponentially concave functions.\nThe adaptive-to-dynamic conversion leads to a series of dynamic regret bounds in terms of the functional variation. As we mentioned in Section 2.3, dynamic regret can also be upper bounded by other regularities such as the path-length. It is interesting to investigate whether those kinds of upper bounds can also be established for strongly adaptive algorithms. Since we derive dynamic regret from adaptive regret, we conjecture that adaptive regret is more fundamental, and will try to give a rigorous proof in the future."

(2012) have introduced a similar strategy for deciding the ending time of experts. The main difference is that their strategy is built upon base-2 number system and introduces an additional parameter g to compromise between the computational complexity and the regret, in contrast our method relies on base-K number system and uses K to control the tradeoff. Lemma 2 of György et al. (2012) indicates an O(g log t) bound on the number of alive experts, which is worse than our O(K log t/ logK) bound by a logarithmic factor."

    "abstractText" : "To cope with changing environments, recent developments in online learning have introduced the concepts of adaptive regret and dynamic regret independently. In this paper, we illustrate an intrinsic connection between these two concepts by showing that the dynamic regret can be expressed in terms of the adaptive regret and the functional variation. This observation implies that strongly adaptive algorithms can be directly leveraged to minimize the dynamic regret. As a result, we present a series of strongly adaptive algorithms whose dynamic regrets are minimax optimal for convex functions, exponentially concave functions, and strongly convex functions, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such kind of dynamic regret bound is established for exponentially concave functions. Moreover, all of those adaptive algorithms do not need any prior knowledge of the functional variation, which is a significant advantage over previous specialized methods for minimizing dynamic regret.",
