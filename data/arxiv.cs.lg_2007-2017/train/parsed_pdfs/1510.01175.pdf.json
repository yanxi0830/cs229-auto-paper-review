      "text" : "Understanding the usage and transition between those devices is essential to develop efficient applications in a multi-device world. In this paper we present a solution to deal with the cross-device identification of users based on semi-supervised machine learning methods to identify which cookies belong to an individual using a device. The method proposed in this paper scored third in the ICDM 2015 Drawbridge Cross-Device Connections challenge proving its good performance.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nWith the rapid adoption of multiple devices (such as desktop computers, laptops, smartphones and tablets) the consumptions habits have changed [1]. People have access to different devices almost anytime anywhere [2], and they employ multiple devices to complete their online objectives. For these reasons, the data used to understand their behaviors are fragmented and the identification of users becomes challenging.\nSome works [3][4][5][6][7][8] have been dedicated to study and understand the behavior of the users and how they perform different tasks through different devices.\nThe goal of cross-device targeting or tracking is to know if the person using computer X is the same one that uses mobile phone Y and tablet Z. This is an important emerging technology challenge and a hot topic right now because this information could be especially valuable for marketers, due to the possibility of serving targeted advertising to consumers regardless of the device that they are using. Empirically, marketing campaigns tailored for a particular user have proved themselves to be much more effective than general strategies based on the device that is being used.\nCurrently, some big companies like Facebook or Google offer this kind of services [9][10], but they need the user to be signed in to their websites and apps. This requirement is not met in several cases.\nThe usual way to tackle this problem is by using deterministic information and exact match rules [11] (credit cards numbers, email addresses, mobile phone numbers, home addresses,...). These solutions can not be used for all users or platforms.\nWithout personal information about the users, cross-device tracking is a complicated process that involves the building of predictive models that have to process many different signals.\nIn this paper, to deal with this problem, we make use of relational information about cookies, devices, as well as other information like IP addresses to build a model able to predict which cookies belong to a user handling a device by employing semi-supervised machine learning techniques.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we talk about the dataset and we briefly describe the problem. Section 3 presents the algorithm and the training procedure. The experimental results are presented in section 4. In section 5, we provide some conclusions and further work. Finally, we have included two appendices, the first one contains information about the features used for this task and in the second a detailed description of the database schema provided for the challenge.\nII.

      "text" : "Users are likely to have multiple identifiers across different domains, including mobile phones, tablets and computing devices. Those identifiers can illustrate common behaviors, to a greater or lesser extent, because they often belong to the same user. Usually deterministic identifiers like names, phone numbers or email addresses are used to group these identifiers.\nIn this challenge the goal was to infer the identifiers belonging to the same user by learning which cookies belong to an individual using a device. Relational information about users, devices, and cookies was provided, as well as other information on IP addresses and behavior. See appendix Dataset and the official challenge webpage [14] for more information about the dataset provided in this challenge."

Initial selection of candidates\nIt is not possible to create a training set containing every combination of devices and cookies due to the high number of them. In order to reduce the initial complexity of the problem and to create a more manageable dataset, some basic rules have been created to obtain an initial reduced set of eligible cookies for every device.\nThe rules are based on the IP addresses that both device and cookie have in common and how frequent they are in other devices and cookies. Table I summarizes the list of rules created to select the initial candidates.\nThis selection of candidates is very effective in an initial stage, as it reduces the size of the training set to a number of 3664022 device/cookie and to a number 1505453 pairs in the test set. In 98.3% of the devices, the set of candidates contains the device’s cookies."

      "heading" : "E. Bagging",
      "text" : "Bootstrap aggregating [19], also called bagging, is a technique that allows us to improve the stability of machine learning algorithms. It reduces the variance, and it helps avoid overfitting, resulting in an accuracy improvement.\nHaving a training set X with n samples it is possible to generate different training sets sampling from X, then a model for every dataset can be built and all of them can be combined by averaging the output. Experimental and theoretical results suggest that this technique can push unstable procedures towards optimality.\nFor this problem, we have used eight baggers in the training procedure."
    }, {
      "heading" : "F. Semi-Supervised Learning",
      "text" : "Semi-supervised learning is a class of supervised learning that also makes use of unlabeled data. In our case we make use of the data contained in the test set. After scoring the eligible cookies, if the highest score is close to 1 and the second highest score is close to 0, is very likely that the first cookie belongs to the device.\nFigure 1 shows the F0.5 score and the percentage of devices that we are using in its evaluation when we take into account only the devices whose second candidate scores less than a certain threshold. For devices where the second candidate scores less than 0.1 the average F0.5 score is higher than 0.99 and 62% of the devices satisfy that condition.\nIn our case, we have taken the devices of the test set where the first candidate scores higher than 0.4 and the second candidate scores less than 0.05 and we have considered them to recalculate some features of the training set and retrain the algorithm again (see the sets O, IO and PO in the appendix Features)."

      "text" : "After obtaining the predictions of the Regularized Boosted Trees, we select the device’s cookies using the procedure described in table II.\nIV. RESULTS The score of this competition was evaluated using a test set of 61156 devices. During the challenge, the leaderboard was calculated on 30% of the test devices (called public leaderboard). After the competition ended, the final result was known and was based on the other 70% of the test data (called private leaderboard).\nTable III shows the scores in both public and private leaderboard of the different procedures described in section III.\nUsing just the initial selection of candidates described in section III-B the F0.5 score is 0.5.\nWhen we use the supervised learning procedure described in section III-D and we select the cookie with the highest score and other cookies with the same handle than this one, the F0.5 is 0.875.\nIncluding the bagging procedure the F0.5 score increases to 0.876.\nThe full procedure, (Selection of candidates + SemiSupervised Learning + Bagging + Post Processing) reached an F0.5 score of 0.88 in the private leaderboard finishing in third position.\nV. CONCLUSIONS\nIn this paper we have presented the design, implementation and evaluation of a way to match devices and cookies to deal with the Cross-Device tracking problem.\nThe source code is publicly available at https://github.com/RobeDM/ICDM2015/ .\nThis procedure has proved its good performance in the ICDM 2015 Drawbridge Cross-Device Challenge finishing in third place among the solutions of 340 teams and reaching an F0.5 score of 0.88.\nAfter these initial results, we can suggest some future research lines:\n• The dataset contained information about the device, cookies and IP addresses. As a first research line we propose to explore other features (for example temporal information) that could be useful for this task. • In our solution we have used one single algorithm. An ensemble of different algorithms could be an interesting option because these techniques obtain better results if there is diversity among the classifiers.\nThe goal was to determine which cookies belong to an individual using a device.

As people move across devices to complete these tasks, their identities becomes fragmented. Understanding the usage and transition between those devices is essential to develop efficient applications in a multi-device world. In this paper we present a solution to deal with the cross-device identification of users based on semi-supervised machine learning methods to identify which cookies belong to an individual using a device. The method proposed in this paper scored third in the ICDM 2015 Drawbridge Cross-Device Connections challenge proving its good performance.",
