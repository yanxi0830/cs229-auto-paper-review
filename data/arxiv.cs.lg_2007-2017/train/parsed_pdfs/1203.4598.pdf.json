      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "In this paper, we study adaptive mixture methods based on “Bregman divergences” [1,2] that combine outputs of m constituent filters running in parallel on the same task. The overall system has two stages [3–8]. The first stage contains adaptive filters running in parallel to model a desired signal. The outputs of these adaptive filters are then linearly combined to produce the final output of the overall system in the second stage. We use Bregman divergences and obtain certain multiplicative updates [9], [2], [10] to train these linear combination weights under an affine constraint [11] or without any constraints [12]. We use unnormalized [2] and normalized relative entropy [9] to define two different Bregman divergences that produce the unnormalized exponentiated gradient update (EGU) and the exponentiated gradient update (EG) on the mixture weights [9], respectively. We then perform the mean and the meansquare transient analysis of these adaptive mixtures when they are used to combine outputs of m constituent filters. We emphasize that to the best of our knowledge, this is the first mean and mean-square transient analysis of the EGU algorithm and the EG algorithm in the mixture framework (which naturally covers the classical framework also [13,14]). We illustrate the accuracy of our results through simulations in different configurations and demonstrate advantages of the introduced algorithms for sparse mixture systems.\nAdaptive mixture methods are utilized in a wide range of signal processing applications in order to improve the steady-state and/or convergence performance over the constituent filters [11,12,15]. An adaptive convexly constrained mixture of two filters is studied in [15], where the convex combination is shown to be “universal” such that the combination performs at least as well as its best constituent filter in the steady-state [15]. The transient analysis of this adaptive convex combination is studied in [16], where the time evolution of the mean and variance of the mixture weights is provided. In similar lines,\nan affinely constrained mixture of adaptive filters using a stochastic gradient update is introduced in [11]. The steady-state mean square error (MSE) of this affinely constrained mixture is shown to outperform the steady-state MSE of the best constituent filter in the mixture under certain conditions [11]. The transient analysis of this affinely constrained mixture for m constituent filters is carried out in [17]. The general linear mixture framework as well as the steady-state performances of different mixture configurations are studied in [12].\nIn this paper, we use Bregman divergences to derive multiplicative updates on the mixture weights. We use the unnormalized relative entropy and the relative entropy as distance measures and obtain the EGU algorithm and the EG algorithm to update the combination weights under an affine constraint or without any constraints. We then carry out the mean and the mean-square transient analysis of these adaptive mixtures when they are used to combine m constituent filters. We point out that the EG algorithm is widely used in sequential learning theory [18] and minimizes an approximate final estimation error while penalizing the distance between the new and the old filter weights. In network and acoustic echo cancellation applications, the EG algorithm is shown to converge faster than the LMS algorithm [14, 19] when the system impulse response is sparse [13]. Similarly, in our simulations, we observe that using the EG algorithm to train the mixture weights yields increased convergence speed compared to using the LMS algorithm to train the mixture weights [11, 12] when the combination favors only a few of the constituent filters in the steady state, i.e., when the final steady-state combination vector is sparse. We also observe that the EGU algorithm and the LMS algorithm show similar performance when they are used to train the mixture weights even if the final steady-state mixture is sparse.\nTo summarize, the main contributions of this paper are as follows:\n• We use Bregman divergences to derive multiplicative updates on affinely constrained and unconstrained mixture weights adaptively combining out-\nputs of m constituent filters.\n• We use the unnormalized relative entropy and the relative entropy to define two different Bregman divergences that produce the EGU algorithm and the\nEG algorithm to update the affinely constrained and unconstrained mixture weights. • We perform the mean and the mean-square transient analysis of the affinely constrained and unconstrained mixtures using the EGU algorithm and the\nEG algorithm.\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. In Section II, we first describe the mixture framework. In Section III, we study the affinely constrained and unconstrained mixture methods updated with the EGU algorithm and the EG algorithm. In Section IV, we first perform the transient analysis of the affinely constrained mixtures and then continue with the transient analysis of the unconstrained mixtures. Finally, in Section V, we perform simulations to show the accuracy of our results and to compare performances of the different adaptive mixture methods. The paper concludes with certain remarks in Section VI."

For presentation purposes, we work only with real data. Given a vector w, w(i) denotes the ith individual entry of w, wT is the transpose of w, ‖w‖1 △=\n∑ i |w(i)| is the l1 norm; ‖w‖ △ = √ wTw is the l2 norm. For a matrix W , tr(W ) is the trace. For a vector w, diag(w) represents a diagonal matrix formed using the entries of w. For a matrix W , diag(W ) represents a column vector that contains the diagonal entries of W . For two vectors v1 and v2, we define the concatenation [v1; v2] △ = [vT1 v T 2 ] T . For a random variable v, v̄ is the expected value. For a random vector v (or a random matrix V ), v̄ (or V̄ ) represents the expected value of each entry. Vectors (or matrices) 1 and 0, with an abuse of notation, denote vectors (or matrices) of all ones or zeros, respectively, where the size of the vector (or the matrix) is understood from the context."

      "text" : "The framework that we study has two stages. In the first stage, we have m adaptive filters producing outputs ŷi(t), i = 1, . . . , m, running in parallel to\nmodel a desired signal y(t) as seen in Fig. 1. The second stage is the mixture stage, where the outputs of the first stage filters are combined to improve the steady-state and/or the transient performance over the constituent filters. We linearly combine the outputs of the first stage filters to produce the final output as ŷ(t) = wT (t)x(t), where x(t) △ = [ŷ1(t), . . . , ŷm(t)] T and train the mixture weights using multiplicative updates (or exponentiated gradient updates) [2]. We point out that in order to satisfy the constraints and derive the multiplicative updates [9], [20], we use reparametrization of the mixture weights as w(t) = f (z(t)) and perform the update on z(t) as\nz(t + 1) = argmin z\n{\nd(z, z(t)) + µ l ( y(t), fT (z)x(t) )\n}\n, (1)\nwhere µ is the learning rate of the update, d(·, ·) is an appropriate distance measure and l(·, ·) is the instantaneous loss. We emphasize that in (1), the updated vector z is forced to be close to the present vector z(t) by d(z(t + 1), z(t)), while trying to accurately model the current data by l ( y(t), fT (z)x(t) ) . However, instead of directly minimizing (1), a linearized version of (1)\nz(t+ 1) = argmin z\n{\nd(z, z(t)) + l ( y(t), fT (z(t))x(t) )\n+ µ∇z l ( y(t), fT (z)x(t) )T\n∣ ∣ ∣ ∣\nz=z(t) (z − z(t))\n}\n(2)\nis minimized to get the desired update. As an example, if we use the l2-norm as the distance measure, i.e., d(z, z(t)) = ‖z − z(t)‖2, and the square error as the instantaneous loss, i.e., l ( y(t), fT (z)x(t) )\n= [y(t) − fT (z)x(t)]2 with f (z) = z, then we get the stochastic gradient update on w(t), i.e.,\nw(t + 1) = w(t) + µe(t)x(t),\nin (2).\nIn the next section, we use the unnormalized relative entropy\nd1(z, z(t)) =\n{\nm ∑\ni=1\n[\nz(i) ln\n(\nz(i)\nz(i)(t)\n) + z(i)(t)− z(i) ]}\n(3)\nfor positively constrained z and z(t), z ∈ Rm+ , z(t) ∈ Rm+ , and the relative entropy\nd2(z, z(t)) =\n{\nm ∑\ni=1\n[\nz(i) ln\n(\nz(i)\nz(i)(t)\n)]}\n, (4)\nwhere z is constrained to be in an extended simplex such that z(i) ≥ 0, ∑m\nk=1 z (i) = u for some u ≥ 1 as the distance measures, with appropriately selected f (·) to derive updates on mixture weights under different constraints. We first investigate affinely constrained mixture ofm adaptive filters, and then continue with the unconstrained mixture using (3) and (4) as the distance measures."

(31)\nCollecting the weights in wa(t) = [w1(t);w2(t)], using the updates (30) and (31), we can write update on wa(t) as\nwa(t + 1) = ( I + µe(t)diag ( u(t) )) wa(t), (32)\nwhere u(t) is defined as u(t) △ = [x(t);−x(t)].\nFor the desired signal y(t), we can write y(t) = wT0 (t)x(t) + e0(t), where w0(t) is the optimum MSE solution at time t such that w0(t) △ = R−1(t)p(t),\nR(t) △ = E\n[ x(t)xT (t) ] , p(t) △ = E {x(t)y(t)} and e0(t) is zero-mean disturbance\nuncorrelated to x(t). To show that the mixture weights converge to the optimum solution in the steady-state such that limt→∞ E [ w(t) ] = limt→∞w0(t), we follow similar lines as in the Section 4.1.1. We modify (14), (15), (16) and (17) such that λ will be replaced by w, δ(t) will be replaced by x(t) and ε(t) = w0(t)−w(t). After these replacements, we obtain\nE [ ε(t + 1) ] = E [ I − µdiag ( w1(t) +w2(t) ) x(t)xT (t) ] E [ ε(t) ]\n+ E [ w0(t+ 1)−w0(t) ] . (33)\nSince, we have limt→∞E [ w0(t + 1) −w0(t) ] = 0 for most adaptive filters in the first stage [14] and if µ is chosen so that all the eigenvalues of E [\nI − µdiag ( w1(t) + w2(t) ) x(t)xT (t) ] have strictly less than unit magnitude for every t, then limt→∞E [ w(t) ] = limt→∞ w0(t).\nFor the transient analysis of MSE, defining γ(t) △ = E {u(t)y(t)} and Γ(t) △= E [ u(t)uT (t) ] , (18) is modified as\nE[e2(t)] = E { y2(t) } − 2w̄Ta (t)γ(t) + tr ( E [ wa(t)w T a (t) ] Γ(t) ) .

      "heading" : "5 Simulations",
      "text" : "In this section, we illustrate the accuracy of our results and compare performances of different adaptive mixture methods through simulations. In our simulations, we observe that using the EG algorithm to train the mixture weights yields better performance compared to using the LMS algorithm or the EGU algorithm to train the mixture weights for combinations having more than two filters and when the combination favors only a few of the constituent filters. The LMS algorithm and the EGU algorithm perform similarly in our simulations when they are used to train the mixture weights. We also observe in our simulations that the mixture weights under the EG update converge to the optimum combination vector faster than the mixture weights under the\nLMS algorithm.\nTo compare performances of the EG and LMS algorithms and illustrate the accuracy of our results in (27), (28) and (29) under different algorithmic parameters, the desired signal as well as the system parameters are selected as follows. First, a seventh-order linear filter, wo = [0.25,−0.47,−0.37, 0.045,−0.18, 0.78, 0.147]T , is chosen as in [17]. The underlying signal is generated using the data model y(t) = τ wTo a(t) + n(t), where a(t) is an i.i.d. Gaussian vector process with zero mean and unit variance entries, i.e., E[a(t)aT (t)] = I, n(t) is an i.i.d. Gaussian noise process with zero mean and variance E[n2(t)] = 0.3, and τ is a positive scalar to control SNR. Hence, the SNR of the desired signal is given by SNR △ = 10 log(E[τ 2(wTou(t))2 ]\n0.01 ) = 10 log( τ 2‖wo‖2 0.01 ). For the first experiment, we have\nSNR = -10dB. To model the unknown system we use ten linear filters using the LMS update as the constituent filters. The learning rates of these two constituent filters are set to µ1 = 0.002 and µ6 = 0.002 while the learning rates for the rest of the constituent filters are selected randomly in [0.1, 0.11]. Therefore, in the steady-state, we obtain the optimum combination vector approximately as λo = [0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0.5, 0, 0, 0, 0] T , i.e., the final combination vector is sparse. In the second stage, we train the combination weights with the EG and LMS algorithms and compare performances of these algorithms. For the second stage, the learning rates for the EG and LMS algorithms are selected as µEG = 0.0008 and µLMS = 0.005 such that the MSEs of both mixtures converge to the same final MSE to provide a fair comparison. We select u = 500 for the EG algorithm. In Fig. 2a, we plot the weight of the first constituent filter with µ1 = 0.002, i.e. E[λ (1)(t)], updated with the EG and LMS algorithms. In Fig. 2b, we plot the MSE curves for the adaptive mixture updated with the EG algorithm, the adaptive mixture updated with the LMS algorithm, the first constituent filter with µ1 = 0.002 and the second constituent filter with µ2 ∈ [0.1, 0.11]. From Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b, we see\nthat the EG algorithm performs better than the LMS algorithm such that the combination weight under the update of the EG algorithm converges to 0.5 faster than the combination weight under the update of the LMS algorithm. Furthermore the MSE of the adaptive mixture updated with the EG algorithm converges faster than the MSE of the adaptive mixture updated with the LMS algorithm. In Fig. 2c, to test the accuracy of (27), we plot the theoretical values for λ̄(1)a (t) and λ̄ (10) a (t) along with simulations. Note in Fig. 2c we observe that λ̄(1)(t) = λ̄(1)a (t)− λ̄(10)a (t) converges to 0.5 as predicted in our derivations. In Fig. 2d, to test the accuracy of (28) and (29), as an example, we plot the theoretical values of E [\nλ(1)a (t) 2 ] and E [ λ(1)a (t)λ (3) a (t) ] along with simulations.\nAs we observe from Fig. 2c and Fig. 2d, there is a close agreement between our results and simulations in these experiments. We observe similar results for the other cross terms.\nWe next simulate the unconstrained mixtures updated with the EGU and EG algorithms. Here, we have two linear filters and both using the LMS update to train their weight vectors as the constituent filters. The learning rates for two constituent filters are set to µ1 = 0.002 and µ2 = 0.1 respectively. Therefore, in the steady-state, we obtain the optimum vector approximately as wo = [1, 0]. We have SNR = 1 for these simulations. The unconstrained mixture weights are first updated with the EGU algorithm. For the second stage, the learning rate for the EGU algorithm is selected as µEGU = 0.01. The theoretical curves in the figures are produced using Γ(t) and γ(t) that are calculated from the simulations, since our goal is to illustrate the validity of derived equations. In Fig. 3a, we plot the theoretical values of w̄(1)a (t), w̄ (2) a (t), w̄ (3) a (t) and w̄ (4) a (t) along with simulations. In Fig. 3b, as an example, we plot the theoretical values of E [\nw(1)a (t) 2 ] , E [ w(1)a (t)w (2) a (t) ] , E [ w(2)a (t)w (3) a (t) ] and E [ w(3)a (t)w (4) a (t) ]\nalong with simulations. We continue to update the mixture weights with the EG algorithm. For the second stage, the learning rate for the EG algorithm is selected as µEG = 0.01. We select u = 3 for the EG algorithm. In Fig. 3c,\nwe plot the theoretical values of w̄(1)a (t), w̄ (2) a (t), w̄ (3) a (t) and w̄ (4) a (t) along with simulations. In Fig. 3d, as an example, we plot the theoretical values of E [\nw(2)a (t) 2 ] , E [ w(1)a (t)w (2) a (t) ] , E [ w(2)a (t)w (3) a (t) ] and E [ w(2)a (t)w (4) a (t) ] along with simulations. We observe a close agreement between our results and simulations.\nTo test the accurateness of the assumptions in (9) and (10), we plot in Fig. 4a, the difference\n‖ exp {µe(t)(ŷi(t)− ŷm(t))} − {1 + µe(t)(ŷi(t)− ŷm(t)))} ‖2 √\n‖ exp {µe(t)(ŷi(t)− ŷm(t))} ‖2‖ {1 + µe(t)(ŷi(t)− ŷm(t)))} ‖2\nfor i = 1 with the same algorithmic parameters as in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. To test the accurateness of the separation assumption in (27), we plot in Fig. 4b, the first parameter of the difference\n∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ E { u\n[ I+µe(t)diag ( u(t) )]\nλa(t) [\n1 T +µe(t)uT (t)\n]\nλa(t)\n}\n− u E\n{\n[ I+µe(t)diag ( u(t) )] λa(t) }\nE\n{\n[\n1 T +µe(t)uT (t)\n] λa(t) }\n∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ 2\n√ √ √ √ ∥ ∥\n∥ ∥\nE\n{\nu\n[ I+µe(t)diag ( u(t) )]\nλa(t) [\n1 T +µe(t)uT (t)\n]\nλa(t)\n} ∥\n∥ ∥ ∥\n2∥ ∥\n∥ ∥\nu E\n{\n[ I+µe(t)diag ( u(t) )] λa(t) }\nE\n{\n[\n1 T +µe(t)uT (t)\n] λa(t) }\n∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ 2\nwith the same algorithmic parameters as in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. We observe\nthat assumptions are fairly accurate for these algorithms in our simulations.\nIn the last simulations, we compare performances of the EGU, EG and LMS algorithms updating the affinely mixture weights under different algorithmic parameters. Algorithmic parameters and constituent filters are selected as in Fig. 2 under SNR = -5 and 5. For the second stage, under SNR = -5, learning rates for the EG, EGU and LMS algorithms are selected as µEG = 0.0005, µEGU = 0.005 and µLMS = 0.005 such that the MSEs converge to the same final MSE to provide a fair comparison. We choose u = 500 for the EG algorithm. In Fig. 5a, we plot the MSE curves for the adaptive mixture updated with the EG algorithm, the adaptive mixture updated with the EGU algorithm, the adaptive mixture updated with the LMS algorithm, first constituent filter\nwith µ1 = 0.002 and second constituent filter with µ2 ∈ [0.1, 0.11] under SNR = -5. Under SNR = 5, learning rates for the EG, EGU and LMS algorithms are selected as µEG = 0.002, µEGU = 0.005 and µLMS = 0.005. We choose u = 100 for the EG algorithm. In Fig. 5b, we plot same MSE curves as in Fig. 5a. We observe that the EG algorithm performs better than the EGU and LMS algorithms such that MSE of the adaptive mixture updated with the EG algorithm converges faster than the MSE of adaptive mixtures updated with the EGU and LMS algorithms. We also observe that the EGU and LMS algorithms show similar performances when they are used to train the mixture weights."
