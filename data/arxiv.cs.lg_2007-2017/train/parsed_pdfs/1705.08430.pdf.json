      "text" : "A basic task in machine learning is to learn an unknown distribution µ, given access to samples from it. A natural and widely studied criterion for learning a distribution is approximating its Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). The seminal Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem (Glivenko, 1933; Cantelli, 1933) addresses this question when the distribution µ is over the real numbers. It determines the behavior of the empirical distribution function as the number of samples grows: let X1, X2, . . . be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables drawn from a distribution µ on R ∗Tel Aviv University, Israel and Microsoft Research, Herzliya, Israel. nogaa@tau.ac.il.

The empirical distribution µn is\nµn , 1\nn n∑ i=1 δxi ,\nwhere δxi is the constant distribution supported on xi. Let Fn denote the CDF of µn, i.e., Fn(t) , 1 n · ∣∣{1 ≤ i ≤ n : xi ≤ t}∣∣. The Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem formalizes the statement that µn converges to µ as n grows, by establishing that Fn(t) converges to F (t), uniformly over all t ∈ R:\nTheorem 1.1 (Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem, 1933). Almost surely,\nlim n→∞ sup t ∣∣Fn(t)− F (t)∣∣ = 0. Some twenty years after Glivenko and Cantelli discovered this theorem, Dvoretzky, Kiefer, and Wolfowitz (DKW) strengthened this result by giving an almost1 tight quantitative bound on the convergence rate. In 1990, Massart proved a tight inequality, confirming a conjecture due to Birnbaum and McCarty (1958):\nTheorem 1.2 (Massart, 1990). Pr [ supt ∣∣Fn(t)−F (t)∣∣ > ] ≤ 2 exp(−2n 2) for all > 0, n ∈ N. The above theorems show that, with high probability, F and Fn are close up to some additive error. We would have liked to prove a stronger, multiplicative bound on the error:\n∀t : ∣∣F (t)− Fn(t)∣∣ ≤ · F (t).\nHowever, for some distributions, the above event has probability 0, no matter how large n is. For example, assume that µ satisfies F (t) > 0 for all t. Since the empirical measure µn has finite support, there is t with Fn(t) = 0; for such a value of t, such a multiplicative approximation fails to hold.\nSo, the above multiplicative requirement is too strong to hold in general. A natural compromise is to consider a submultiplicative bound:\n∀t : ∣∣F (t)− Fn(t)∣∣ ≤ · F (t)α,\nwhere 0 ≤ α < 1. When α = 0, this is the additive bound studied in the context of the Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem. When α = 1, this is the unattainable multiplicative bound. Our first main result shows that the case of α < 1 is attainable:\nTheorem 1.3 (Submultiplicative Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem). Let > 0, δ > 0 and 0 ≤ α < 1. There exists n0( , δ, α) such that for all n > n0, with probability 1− δ:\n∀t : ∣∣F (t)− Fn(t)∣∣ ≤ · F (t)α.\nIt is worth pointing out a central difference between Theorem 1.3 and other generalizations of the Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem: for example, the seminal work of Vapnik and Chervonenkis (1971) shows that for every class of events F of VC dimension d, there is n0 = n0( , δ, d) such that for every n ≥ n0, with probability 1− δ it holds that ∀A ∈ F :\n∣∣p(A)− pn(A)∣∣ ≤ . This yields Glivenko-Cantelli by plugging F = { (−∞, t] : t ∈ R } , which has VC dimension 1. In contrast, the submultiplicative bound from Theorem 1.3 does not even extend to the VC dimension 1 class F = { {t} : t ∈ R } . Indeed, pick any distribution p over R such that p ( {t} )\n= 0 for every t, and observe that for every sample x1, . . . , xn, it holds that pn ( {xi} ) ≥ 1/n, however p ( {xi} ) = 0,\nand therefore, as long as α > 0, it is never the case that ∣∣∣p({xi}) − pn({xi})∣∣∣ ≤ p({xi})α. Theorem 1.3 is proven in Section 3, which also includes other extensions. Our second main result gives an explicit upper bound on n0( , δ, α):\n1The inequality due to Dvoretzky et al. (1956) has a larger constant C in front of the exponent on the right hand side.\nTheorem 1.4 (Submultiplicative Glivenko-Cantelli Bound). Let , δ ≤ 1/4, and α < 1. Then\nn0( , δ, α) ≤ max  ln ( 6/δ ) 2 2 ( δ3 ) − 4α 1−α , (D + 1) ( 10 · ln ( 12 · D + 4 δ(1− α) )) 4α1−α , where D = ln(\n6/δ) 2 2 ( δ 6 · ln ( 1+α 2α ))− 4α1−α .\nNote that for fixed , δ, when α → 0 the above bound approaches the familiar O ( ln(1/δ) 2 ) bound by DKW and Massart for α = 0. On the other hand, when α → 1 the above bound tends to ∞, reflecting the fact that the multiplicative variant of Glivenko-Cantelli (α = 1) does not hold. Theorem 1.4 is proven in Appendix A.\nNote that the dependency of the above bound on the confidence parameter δ is polynomial. This contrasts with standard uniform convergence rates, which, due to applications of concentration bounds such as Chernoff/Hoeffding, achieve logarithmic dependencies on δ. These concentration bounds are not applicable in our setting when the CDF values are very small, and we use Markov’s inequality instead. The following example shows that a polynomial dependency on δ is indeed necessary and is not due to a limitation of our proof.\nExample 1.5. For large n, consider n independent samples x1, . . . , xn from the uniform distribution over [0, 1], and set α = 1/2 and = 1. The probability of the event\n∃i : xi ≤ 1/n3\nis roughly 1/n2: indeed, the complementary event has probability (1− 1/n3)n ≈ exp(−1/n2) ≈ 1 − 1/n2. When this happens, we have: Fn(1/n3) ≥ 1/n >> 1/n3 + 1/n3/2 = F (1/n3) +[ F (1/n3) ]1/2 . Note that this happens with probability inverse polynomial in n (roughly 1/n2) and not inverse exponential.\nAn application to revenue learning. We demonstrate an application of our Submultiplicative Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem in the context of a widely studied problem in economics and algorithmic game theory: the problem of revenue learning. In the setting of this problem, a seller has to decide which price to post for a good she wishes to sell. Assume that each consumer draws her private valuation for the good from an unknown distribution µ. We envision that a consumer with valuation v will buy the good at any price p ≤ v, but not at any higher price. This implies that the expected revenue at price p is simply r(p) , p · q(p), where q(p) , PrV∼µ[V ≥ p].\nIn the language of machine learning, this problem can be phrased as follows: the examples domain Z , R+ is the set of all valuations v. The hypothesis space H , R+ is the set of all prices p. The revenue (which is a gain, rather than loss) of a price p on a valuation v is the function p · 1{p≤v}.\nThe well-known revenue maximization problem is to find a price p∗ that maximizes the expected revenue, given a sample of valuations drawn i.i.d. from µ. In this paper, we consider the more demanding revenue estimation problem: the problem of well-approximating r(p), simultaneously for all prices p, from a given sample of valuations. (This clearly also implies a good estimation of the maximum revenue and of a price that yields it.) More specifically, we address the following question: when do the empirical revenues, rn(p) , p · qn(p), where qn(p) , PrV∼µn [V ≥ p] = 1n ·\n∣∣{1 ≤ i ≤ n : xi ≥ t}∣∣, uniformly converge to the true revenues r(p)? More specifically, we would like to show that for some n0, for n ≥ n0 we have with probability 1− δ that ∣∣r(p)− rn(p)∣∣ ≤ .\nThe revenue estimation problem is a basic instance of the more general problem of uniform convergence of empirical estimates. The main challenge in this instance is that the prices are unbounded (and so are the private valuations that are drawn from the distribution µ).\nUnfortunately, there is no (upper) bound on n0 that is only a function of and δ. Moreover, even if we add the expectation of valuations, i.e., E[V ] where V is distributed according to µ, still there is no bound on n0 that is a function of only those three parameters (see Section 2.3 for an example). In contrast, when we consider higher moments of the distribution µ, we are able to derive bounds on the value of n0. These bounds are based on our Submultiplicative Glivenko-Cantelli Bound. Specifically, assume that EV∼µ[V 1+θ] ≤ C for some θ > 0 and C ≥ 1. Then, we show that for any , δ ∈ (0, 1), we have\nPr [ ∃v : ∣∣r(v)− rn(v)∣∣ > ] ≤ Pr[∃v : ∣∣q(v)− qn(v)∣∣ > C 1 1+θ q(v) 1 1+θ ] .\nThis essentially reduces uniform convergence bounds to our Submultiplicative Glivenko-Cantelli variant. It then follows that there exists n0(C, θ, , δ) such that for any n ≥ n0, with probability at least 1− δ,\n∀v : ∣∣rn(v)− r(v)∣∣ ≤ .\nWe remark that when θ is large, our bound yields n0 ≈ O ( ln(1/δ) 2 ) , which recovers the standard sample complexity bounds obtainable via DKW and Massart. When θ → 0, our bound diverges to infinity, reflecting the fact (discussed above) that there is no bound on n0 that depends only on , δ, and E[V ]. Nevertheless, we find that E[V ] qualitatively determines whether uniform convergence occurs in the limit. Namely, we show that\n• If Eµ[V ] <∞, then almost surely limn→∞ supv ∣∣r(v)− rn(v)∣∣ = 0,\n• Conversely, if Eµ[V ] =∞, then almost never limn→∞ supv ∣∣r(v)− rn(v)∣∣ = 0."

      "text" : "Generalizations of Glivenko-Cantelli. Various generalizations of the Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem were established. These include uniform convergence bounds for more general classes of functions as well as more general loss functions (for example, Vapnik and Chervonenkis, 1971; Vapnik, 1998; Koltchinskii and Panchenko, 2000; Bartlett and Mendelson, 2002). The results that concern unbounded loss functions are most relevant to this work (for example, Cortes et al., 2010, 2013; Vapnik, 1998). We next briefly discuss the relevant results from Cortes et al. (2013) in the context of this paper; more specifically, in the context of Theorem 1.3. To ease presentation, set α in this theorem to be 1/2. Theorem 1.3 analyzes the event where the empirical quantile is bounded by2\nqn(p) ≤ q(p) + √ q(p),\nqn(p) ≥ q(p)− √ q(p).\nwhereas, Cortes et al. (2013) analyzes the event where it is bounded it by: qn(p) ≤ Õ ( q(p) + √ q(p)/n+ 1/n ) ,\nqn(p) ≥ Ω̃ ( q(p)− √ qn(p)/n− 1/n ) 2For consistency with the canonical statement of the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem, we stated our submultiplicative variants of this theorem with regard to the CDFs Fn and F . However, these results also hold when replacing these CDFs with the respective quantiles (tail CDFs) qn and q. See Section 2.2 for details.\nThus, the main difference is the additive 1/n term in the bound from Cortes et al. (2013). In the context of uniform convergence of revenues, it is crucial to use the upper bound on the empirical quantile as we do, as it guarantees that large prices will not overfit, which is the main challenge in proving uniform convergence in this context. In particular, the upper bound from Cortes et al. (2013) does not provide any guarantee on the revenues of prices p >> n, as for such prices p · 1/n >> 1.\nIt is also worth pointing out that our lower bound on the empirical quantile implies that with high probability the quantile of the maximum sampled point is at least 1/n2 (or more generally, at least 1/n1/α when α 6= 1/2), while the bound from Cortes et al. (2013) does not imply any non-trivial lower bound.\nAnother, more qualitative difference is that unlike the bounds in Cortes et al. (2013) that apply for general VC classes, our bound is tailored for the class of thresholds (corresponding to CDF/quantiles), and does not extend even to other classes of VC dimension 1 (see the discussion after Theorem 1.3).\nUniform convergence of revenues. The problem of revenue maximization is a central problem in economics and Algorithmic Game Theory (AGT). The seminal work of Myerson (1981) shows that given a valuation distribution for a single good, the revenue-maximizing selling mechanism for this good is a posted-price mechanism. In the recent years, there has been a growing interest in the case where the valuation distribution is unknown, but the seller observes samples drawn from it. Most papers in this direction assume that the distribution meets some tail condition that is considered “natural” within the algorithmic game theory community, such as boundedness (Morgenstern and Roughgarden, 2015; Roughgarden and Schrijvers, 2016; Morgenstern and Roughgarden, 2016; Balcan et al., 2016; Gonczarowski and Nisan, 2017; Devanur et al., 2016)3, such as a condition known as Myerson-regularity (Dhangwatnotai et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2015; Cole and Roughgarden, 2014; Devanur et al., 2016), or such as a condition known as monotone hazard rate (Huang et al., 2015).4 These papers then go on to derive computation- or sample-complexity bounds on learning an optimal price (or an optimal selling mechanism from a given class) for a distribution that meets the assumed condition.\nA recurring theme in statistical learning theory is that learnability guarantees are derived via a, sometimes implicit, uniform convergence bound. However, this has not been the case in the context of revenue learning. Indeed, while some papers that studied bounded distributions (Morgenstern and Roughgarden, 2015; Roughgarden and Schrijvers, 2016; Morgenstern and Roughgarden, 2016; Balcan et al., 2016) did use uniform convergence bounds as part of their analysis, other papers, in particular those that considered unbounded distributions, had to bypass the usage of uniform convergence by more specialized arguments. This is due to the fact that many unbounded distributions do not satisfy any uniform convergence bound. As a concrete example, the (unbounded, Myerson-regular) equal revenue distribution5 has an infinite expectation and therefore, by our Theorem 2.3, satisfies no uniform convergence, even in the limit. Thus, it turns out that the works that studied the popular class of Myerson-regular distributions (Dhangwatnotai et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2015; Cole and Roughgarden, 2014; Devanur et al., 2016) indeed could not have hoped to establish learnability via a uniform convergence argument. For instance, the way Dhangwatnotai et al. (2015) and Cole and Roughgarden (2014)\n3The analysis of Balcan et al. (2016) assumes a bound on the realized revenue (from any possible valuation profile) of any mechanism/auction in the class that they consider. For the class of posted-price mechanisms, this is equivalent to assuming a bound on the support of the valuation distribution. Indeed, for any valuation v, pricing at v gives realized revenue v (from the valuation v), and so unbounded valuations (together with the ability to post unbounded prices) imply unbounded realized revenues.\n4Both Myerson-regularity and monotone hazard rate are conditions on the second derivative of the revenue as a function of the quantile of the underlying distribution. In particular, they impose restrictions on the tail of the distribution.\n5This is a distribution that satisfies the special property that all prices have the same expected revenue.\nestablish learnability for Myerson-regular distributions is by considering the guarded ERM algorithm (an algorithm that chooses an empirical revenue maximizing price that is smaller than, say, the √ nth largest sampled price), and proving a uniform convergence bound, not for all prices, but only for prices that are, say, smaller than the √ nth largest sampled price, and then arguing that larger prices are likely to have a small empirical revenue, compared to the guarded empirical revenue maximizer. This means that the guarded ERM will output a good price, but it does not (and cannot) imply uniform convergence for all prices.\nWe complement the extensive literature surveyed above in a few ways. The first is generalizing the revenue maximization problem to a revenue estimation problem, where the goal is to uniformly estimate the revenue of all possible prices, when no bound on the possible valuations is given (or even exists). The problem of revenue estimation arises naturally when the seller has additional considerations when pricing her good, such as regulations that limit the price choice, bad publicity if the price is too high (or, conversely, damage to prestige if the price is too low), or willingness to suffer some revenue loss for better market penetration (which may translate to more revenue in the future). In such a case, the seller may wish to estimate the revenue loss due to posting a discounted (or inflated) price.\nThe second, and most important, contribution to the above literature is that we consider arbitrary distributions rather than very specific and limited classes of distributions (e.g., bounded, Myerson-regular, monotone hazard rate, etc.). Third, we derive finite sample bounds in the case that the expected valuation is bounded for some moment larger than 1. We further derive a zero-one law for uniform convergence in the limit that depends on the finiteness of the first moment. Technically, our bounds are based on an additive error rather than multiplicative ones, which are popular in the AGT community."

Technically, it is assumed that V is a nonnegative random variable, and we denote by µ its induced distribution over R+. A consumer who values g at a valuation v is willing to buy the good at any price p ≤ v, but not at any higher price. This implies that the realized revenue to the seller from a (posted) price p is the random variable p · 1{p≤V }. The quantile of a value v ∈ R+ is\nq(v) = q(v;µ) , µ ( {x : x ≥ v} ) .\nThis models the fraction of the consumers in the population that are willing to purchase the good if priced at v. The expected revenue from a (posted) price p ∈ R+ is\nr(p) = r(p;µ) , E µ\n[ p · 1{p≤V } ] = p · q(p).\nLet V1, V2, . . . be a sequence of i.i.d. valuations drawn from µ, and let v1, v2, . . . be their realizations. The empirical quantile of a value v ∈ R+ is\nqn(v) = q(v;µn) , 1n · ∣∣{1 ≤ i ≤ n : vi ≥ v}∣∣.\nThe empirical revenue from a price p ∈ R+ is\nrn(p) = r(p;µn) , E µn\n[ p · 1{p≤V } ] = p · qn(p).\nThe revenue estimation error for a given sample of size n is\nn , sup p ∣∣rn(p)− r(p)∣∣. It is worth highlighting the difference between revenue estimation and revenue maximization. Let p∗ be a price that maximizes the revenue, i.e., p∗ ∈ arg supp r(p). The maximum revenue is r∗ = r(p∗). The goal in many works in revenue maximization is to find a price p̂ such that r∗ − r(p̂) ≤ , or alternatively, to bound r∗/r(p̂).\nGiven a revenue-estimation error n, one can clearly maximize the revenue within an additive error of 2 n by simply posting a price p ∗ n ∈ arg maxp rn(p), thereby attaining revenue r∗n = r(p∗n). This follows since\nr∗n = r(p ∗ n) ≥ rn(p∗n)− n ≥ rn(p∗)− n ≥ r(p∗)− 2 n = r∗ − 2 n.\nTherefore, good revenue estimation implies good revenue maximization. We note that the converse does not hold. Namely, there are distributions for which revenue maximization is trivial but revenue estimation is impossible. One such case is the equal revenue distribution, where all values in the support of µ have the same expected revenue. For such distributions, the problem of revenue maximization becomes trivial, since any posted price is optimal. However, as follows from Theorem 2.3, since the expected revenue of such distributions is infinite, almost never do the empirical revenues uniformly converge to the true revenues."

      "text" : "Recall that we are interested in deriving sample bounds that would guarantee uniform convergence for the revenue estimation problem. We will show that given an upper bound on the kth moment of V for some k > 1, we can derive a finite sample bound. To this end we utilize our Submultiplicative Glivenko-Cantelli Bound (Theorem 1.4).\nWe also consider the case of k = 1, namely that E[V ] is bounded, and show that in this case there is still uniform convergence in the limit, but that there cannot be any guarantees on the convergence rate. Interestingly, it turns out that E[V ] < ∞ is not only sufficient but also necessary so that in the limit, the empirical revenues uniformly converge to the true revenues (see Section 2.3).\nWe begin by showing that bounds on the kth moment for k > 1 yield explicit bounds on the convergence rate. It is convenient to parametrize by setting k = 1 + θ, where θ > 0.\nTheorem 2.1. Let EV∼µ[V 1+θ] ≤ C for some θ > 0 and C ≥ 1, and let , δ ∈ (0, 1).

For example, if all moments are uniformly bounded, then the convergence is roughly as fast as in standard uniform convergence settings (e.g., VCdimension based bounds).\nThe proof of Theorem 2.1 follows from Theorem 1.4 and the next proposition, which reduces bounds on the uniform convergence rate of the empirical revenues to our Submultiplicative Glivenko-Cantelli.\nProposition 2.2. Let EV∼µ[V 1+θ] ≤ C for some θ > 0 and C ≥ 1, and let , δ ∈ (0, 1).

We then plug ← C 1 1+θ\nand α← 11+θ into this variant of Theorem 1.4 to yield a bound on the right-hand side of the inequality in Proposition 2.2, whose application concludes the proof.\nProof of Proposition 2.2.

Indeed, as the following example shows, there is no bound on the uniform convergence sample complexity that depends only on the first moment of V , i.e., its expectation.\nConsider a distribution ηp so that with probability p we have V = 1/p and otherwise V = 0. Clearly, E[V ] = 1. However, we need to sample mp = O(1/p) valuations to see a single nonzero value. Therefore, there is no bound on the sample size mp as a function of the expectation, which is simply 1.\nWe can now consider the higher moments of ηp. Consider the kth moment, for k = 1 + θ and θ > 0, so k > 1. For this moment, we have Ap,θ = E[V 1+θ] = pθ/(1+θ), which implies that mp = O ( 1/(Ap,θ) (1+θ)/θ ) .

Let µ be a distribution such that Eµ [ V ]\n= ∞. If supv v · q(v) =∞ then for every realization v1, . . . , vn there is some v ≥ max{v1, . . . , vn} such that v · q(v) ≥ 1, but v · qn(v) = 0. So, we may assume supv v · q(v) <∞. Without loss of generality we may assume that supv v·q(v) = 1/2 by rescaling the distribution if needed. Consider the sequence of events E1, E2, . . . where En denotes the event that Vn ≥ n. Since Eµ [ V ]\n=∞, Lemma 2.4 implies that ∑∞ n=1 Pr[En] = ∞. Thus, since these events are independent, the second Borel-Cantelli Lemma (Borel, 1909; Cantelli, 1917) implies that almost surely, infinitely many of them occur and so infinitely often\nVn · qn(Vn) ≥ 1 ≥ Vn · q(Vn) + 12 .\nTherefore, the probability that v · qn(v) uniformly converge to v · q(v) is 0. Item 1 follows from the following monotone domination theorem:\nTheorem 2.5. Let F be a family of nonnegative monotone functions, and let F be an upper envelope7 for F . If Eµ[F ] <∞, then almost surely:\nlim n→∞ sup f∈F ∣∣E µ [f ]− E µn [f ] ∣∣ = 0.\nIndeed, item 1 follows by plugging F = { v · 1x≥v : v ∈ R+ } , which is uniformly bounded by\nthe identity function F (x) = x. Now, by assumption Eµ[F ] <∞, and therefore, almost surely\nlim n→∞ sup v∈R+\n∣∣r(v)− rn(v)∣∣ = lim n→∞ sup f∈F ∣∣E µ [f ]− E µn [f ] ∣∣ = 0.\nTheorem 2.5 follows by known results in the theory of empirical processes (for example, with some work it can be proved using Theorem 2.4.3 from Vaart and Wellner (1996)). For completeness, we give a short and basic proof in Appendix B.\n7F is an upper envelope for F if F (v) ≥ f(v) for every v ∈ V and f ∈ F ."

Let , α, q, p, n be as in the statement of the lemma. We partition the event in question to three parts, depending on the value of t as follows. Partition R to\nI[0,q/n] = { t ∈ R : 0 ≤ F (t) ≤ q\nn\n} , I(q/n,p) = { t ∈ R : q\nn < F (t) ≤ p } and\nI[p,1] = {t ∈ R : p < F (t) ≤ 1} .\nThere are three corresponding events E[0,q/n], E(q/n,p) and E[p,1]; for example, E[0,q/n] is the event that ∃t ∈ I[0,q/n] : B(t) = 1, where B(t) is the indicator of ∣∣F (t)− Fn(t)∣∣ > · F (t)α. The following three claims bound from above the probabilities of these three events. The three claims and the union bound complete the proof of the theorem.\nClaim 3.3. Pr [ E[0,q/n] ] ≤ q.\nProof. Let t ∈ I[0,q/n] be so that B(t) = 1. For any t ∈ I[0,q/n] we have that F (t) ≤ q/n ≤ 1/n ≤ 1 1−α , where the last inequality is by our assumption on n and . This implies that\nF (t) ≤ F (t)α. Since B(t) = 1 it must be the case that Fn(t) > F (t) + ( F (t) )α ≥ 0, and therefore at least one sample xi satisfies xi ≤ t ≤ q/n. Now, by the union bound,\nPr [ E[0,q/n] ] ≤ Pr [ ∃i ∈ [n] : xi ∈ I[0,q/n] ] ≤ n · q\nn = q.\nClaim 3.4. Pr [ E(q/n,p) ] ≤ ⌈ ln ln(n q )\nln( 1+α 2α )\n⌉ p 1−α 2\n.\nProof. If q/n ≥ p then this event is empty and its probability is 0. Therefore, assume that q/n < p, and that this event is not empty.\nFor all t ∈ I(q/n,p) since F (t) ≤ p ≤ 1\n1−α we have F (t) − F (t)α ≤ 0. So, it suffices to consider the event\n∃t ∈ I(q/n,p) : Fn(t) > F (t) + · F (t)α.\nConsider the decreasing sequence of numbers p0, p1, . . . , pm defined by\npi = p\n( 1+α 2α )i ,\nwhere m is such that pm < q/n ≤ pm−1. Since p ≤ 1/e, we can bound m ≤ ⌈ ln ln(n q )\nln( 1+α 2α )\n⌉ . Let\nti = inf { t ∈ I(q/n,p) : F (t) ≥ pi } .\nLet F−n (t) = µn ( {x : x < t} ) . We claim that\n∃t ∈ I(q/n,p) : B(t) = 1 =⇒ ∃i < m : F−n (ti) > · pαi+1,\nIndeed, assume that t ∈ I(q/n,p) satisfies Fn(t) > F (t) + · F (t)α. Since pm < t < p0, there is some 0 ≤ i ≤ m−1 such that pi+1 ≤ F (t) < pi. Note that ti+1 ≤ t < ti. Indeed, ti+1 ≤ t follows since pi+1 ≤ F (t), and t < ti follows since F (ti) ≥ pi (which is implied by right continuity of F ). Hence,\nF−n (ti) ≥ Fn(t) > F (t) + · F (t)α ≥ pi+1 + · pαi+1 ≥ · pαi+1.\nIt hence remains to upper bound the union of these events. Note that E [ F−n (ti) ] = µ ( {x : x < ti} ) ≤ pi.\nTherefore, by Markov’s inequality:\nPr [ F−n (ti) > · pαi+1 ] ≤ pi pαi+1 = 1 p ( 1−α 2 )( 1+α 2α )i .\nBy the union bound,\nPr [ ∃i < m : Fn(ti) > pi+1 + · pαi+1 ] ≤ 1 m−1∑ i=0 p ( 1−α 2 )( 1+α 2α )i ≤ m p 1−α 2 ≤ ⌈ ln ln(nq ) ln(1+α2α ) ⌉ p 1−α 2 .\nClaim 3.5. Pr [ E[p,1] ] ≤ 2 exp ( −2n( pα)2 ) .\nProof. For all t ∈ I[p,1] we have F (t)α ≥ pα. The claim follows by Theorem 1.2.\nLemma 3.1 follows from combining Claims 3.3, 3.4, and 3.5."

      "text" : "Our main result is a submultiplicative variant of the Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem, which allows for tighter convergence bounds for extreme values of the CDF. We show that for the revenue learning setting our submultiplicative bound can be used to derive uniform convergence sample complexity bounds, assuming a finite bound on the kth moment of the valuations, for any (possibly fractional) k > 1. For uniform convergence in the limit, we give a complete characterization, where uniform convergence almost surely occurs if and only if the first moment is finite.\nIt would be interesting to find other applications of our submultiplicative bound in other settings. A potentially interesting direction is to consider unbounded loss functions (e.g., the squared-loss, or log-loss). Many works circumvent the unboundedness in such cases by ensuring (implicitly) that the losses are bounded, e.g., through restricting the inputs and the hypotheses. Our bound offers a different perspective of addressing this issue. In this paper we consider revenue learning, and replace the boundedness assumption by assuming bounds on higher moments. An interesting challenge is to prove uniform convergence bounds for other practically interesting settings. One such setting might be estimating the effect of outliers (which correspond to the extreme values of the loss).\nIn the context of revenue estimation, this work only considers the most näıve estimator, namely of estimating the revenues by the empirical revenues. One can envision other estimators, for example ones which regularize the extreme tail of the sample. Such estimators may have a potential of better guarantees or better convergence bounds. In the context of uniform convergence of selling mechanism revenues, this work only considers the basic class of postedprice mechanisms. While for one good and one valuation distribution, it is always possible to maximize revenue via a selling mechanism of this class, this is not the case in more complex auction environments. While in many more-complex environments, the revenue-maximizing mechanism/auction is still not understood well enough, for environments where it is understood (Cole and Roughgarden, 2014; Devanur et al., 2016; Gonczarowski and Nisan, 2017) (as well as for simple auction classes that do not necessarily contain a revenue-maximizing auction (Morgenstern and Roughgarden, 2016; Balcan et al., 2016)) it would also be interesting to study relaxations of the restrictive tail or boundedness assumptions currently common in the literature."

Our variant allows for tighter convergence bounds for extreme values of the CDF. We apply our bound in the context of revenue learning, which is a well-studied problem in economics and algorithmic game theory. We derive sample-complexity bounds on the uniform convergence rate of the empirical revenues to the true revenues, assuming a bound on the kth moment of the valuations, for any (possibly fractional) k > 1. For uniform convergence in the limit, we give a complete characterization and a zeroone law: if the first moment of the valuations is finite, then uniform convergence almost surely occurs; conversely, if the first moment is infinite, then uniform convergence almost never occurs.",
