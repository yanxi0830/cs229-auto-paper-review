      "text" : "Recognizing human actions has remained one of the most important and challenging tasks in computer vision. It facilitates a wide range of applications such as intelligent video surveillance, human-computer interaction, and video understanding (Poppe 2010; Weinland, Ronfard, and Boyerc 2011).\nTraditional studies on action recognition mainly focus on recognizing actions from RGB videos recorded by 2D cameras (Weinland, Ronfard, and Boyerc 2011). However, capturing human actions in the full 3D space in which they actually occur can provide more comprehensive information. Biological observations suggest that humans can recognize actions from just the motion of a few light displays attached to the human body (Johansson 1973). Motion capture systems (CMU 2003) extract 3D joint positions using markers and high precision camera arrays. Although slightly higher in price, such systems provide highly accurate joint positions for skeletons. Recently, the Kinect device has gained much\n∗This work was done when W.

All rights reserved.\npopularity thanks to its excellent accuracy in human body modeling and affordable price. The bundled SDK for Kinect v2 can directly generate accurate skeletons in real-time. Due to the prevalence of these devices, skeleton based representations of the human body and its temporal evolution has become an attractive option for action recognition.\nIn this paper, we focus on the problem of skeleton based action recognition. The key to this problem lies mainly in two aspects. One is to design robust and discriminative features from the skeleton (and the corresponding RGBD images) for intra-frame content representation (Müller, Röder, and Clausen 2005; Wang, Liu, and Junsong 2012; Sung et al. 2012; Yang and Tian 2014; Ji, Ye, and Cheng 2014). The other is to explore temporal dependencies of the interframe content for action dynamics modeling, using hierarchical maximum entropy Markov model (Sung et al. 2011), hidden Markov model (Xia, Chen, and Aggarwal 2012) or Conditional Random Fields (Sminchisescu et al. 2005). Inspired by the success of deep recurrent neural networks (RNNs) using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture for speech feature learning and time series modeling (Graves, Mohamed, and Hinton 2013; Graves and Schmidhuber 2005), we intend to build an effective action recognition model based on deep LSTM network.\nTo this end, we propose an end-to-end fully connected deep LSTM network to perform automatic feature learning and motion modeling (Fig. 1). The proposed network is constructed by inheriting many insights from recent successful networks (Graves 2012; Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012; Szegedy et al. 2015; Du, Wang, and Wang 2015) and is designed to robustly model complex relationships among different joints. The LSTM layers and feedforward layers are alternately deployed to construct a deep network to capture the motion information. To ensure the model learns effective features and motion dynamics, we enforce different types of strong regularization in different parts of the model, which effectively mitigates over-fitting.\nSpecifically, two types of regularizations are proposed. (i) For the fully connected layers, we introduce regularization to drive the model to learn co-occurrence features of the joints at different layers. (ii) For the LSTM neurons, we derive a new dropout and apply it to the LSTM neurons in the last LSTM layer, which helps the network to learn complex motion dynamics. With these forms of regularization, we\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n07 77\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.C V\n] 2\n4 M\nar 2\n01 6\nvalidate our deep LSTM networks on three public datasets for human action recognition. The proposed model has been shown to consistently outperform other state-of-the-art algorithms for skeleton based human action recognition."

      "text" : "In contrast to the handcrafted features, there is a growing trend of learning robust feature representations from raw data with deep neural networks, and excellent performance has been reported in image classification (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012) and speech recognition (Graves, Mohamed, and Hinton 2013). However, there are only few works which leverage neural networks for skeleton based action recognition. A multi-layer perceptron network is trained to classify each frame (Cho and Chen 2014); however, such a network cannot explore temporal dependencies very well. In contrast, a gesture recognition system (Lefebvre et al. 2013) employs a shallow bidirectional LSTM with only one forward hidden layer and one backward hidden layer to explore long-range temporal dependencies. A deep recurrent neural network architecture with handcrafted subnets is utilized for skeleton based action recognition (Du, Wang, and Wang 2015). However, the handcrafted hierarchical subnets and their fusion ignore the inherent cooccurrences of joints. This motivates us to design a deep fully connected neural network which is capable of fully exploiting the inherent correlations among skeleton joints in various actions."

      "text" : "An action is usually only associated with and characterized by the interactions and combinations of a subset of the skeleton joints. For example, the joints “hand”, “arm” and “head” are associated with the action “making telephone call”. An actionlet ensemble model exploits this trait by mining some particular conjunctions of the features corresponded to some subsets of the joints (Wang, Liu, and Junsong 2012). Similarly, actions involving two people can be characterized by the interactions of a subset of the two persons’ joints (Yun et al. 2012; Ji, Ye, and Cheng 2014). Inspired by the actionlet ensemble model, we introduce a new exploration mechanism in the deep LSTM architecture to achieve automatic co-occurrence mining as opposed to pre-specifying in advance which joints should be grouped."

      "text" : "Dropout has been demonstrated to be quite effective in deep convolutional neural networks (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012), but there has been relatively little research on applying it to RNNs. In order to preserve the ability of RNNs to model sequences, dropout applied only to the feedforward (along layers) connections but not to the recurrent (along time) connections is proposed (Pham et al. 2014). This is to avoid erasing all the information from the units (due to dropout). Note that the previous work only considers dropout at the output response for an LSTM neuron\n(Zaremba, Sutskever, and Vinyals 2014). However, considering that an LSTM neuron consists of internal cell and gate units, we believe one should not only look at the output of the neuron but also into its internal structure to design effective dropout schemes. In this paper, we design an in-depth dropout for LSTM to address this problem."

Fig. 1 shows the architecture of the proposed network, which has three bidirectional LSTM layers, two feedforward layers, and a softmax layer that gives the predictions. The proposed full connection architecture enables one to fully exploit the inherent correlations among skeleton joints. In the network, the co-occurrence exploration is applied to the connections prior to the second LSTM layer to learn the co-occurrences of joints/features. LSTM dropout is applied to the last LSTM layer to enable more effective learning. Note that each LSTM layer uses bidirectional LSTM and we do not explicitly distinguish the forward and backward LSTM neurons in Fig. 1. At each time step, the input to the network is a vector denoting the 3D positions of the skeleton joints in a frame.\nIn the following, we first review LSTM briefly to make the paper self-contained. Then we introduce our method for cooccurrence exploration in the deep LSTM network. Lastly we describe our dropout algorithm which is designed for the LSTM neurons and enables effective learning of the model."

      "text" : "The RNN is a successful model for sequential learning (Graves 2012). For the recurrent neurons at some layer, the output responses ht are calculated based on the inputs xt to this layer and the responses ht−1 from the previous time slot\nht = θ (Wxhxt + Whhht−1 + bh) , (1)\nwhere θ (·) denotes the activation function, bh denotes the bias vector, Wxh is the matrix of weights between the input and hidden layer and Whh is the matrix of recurrent weights from the hidden layer to itself at adjacent time steps which is used for exploring temporal dependency.\nLSTM is an advanced RNN architecture which can learn long-range dependencies (Graves, Mohamed, and Hinton 2013). Fig. 2 shows a typical LSTM neuron, which contains an input gate it, a forget gate ft, a cell ct, an output gate ot and an output response ht. The input gate and forget gate govern the information flow into and out of the cell. The output gate controls how much information from the cell is passed to the output ht. The memory cell has a selfconnected recurrent edge of weight 1, ensuring that the gradient can pass across many time steps without vanishing or exploding. Therefore, it overcomes the difficulties in training the RNN model caused by the “vanishing gradient” effect. For all the LSTM neurons in some layer, at time t, the recursive computation of activations of the units is\nit = σ (Wxixt + Whiht−1 + Wcict−1 + bi) ,\nft = σ (Wxfxt + Whfht−1 + Wcfct−1 + bf ) ,\nct = ft ct−1+ it tanh(Wxcxt+Whcht−1+bc) , ot = σ (Wxoxt + Whoht−1 + Wcoct + bo) ,\nht = ot tanh (ct) ,\n(2)\nwhere denotes element-wise product, σ (x) is the sigmoid function defined as σ (x) = 1/(1+e−x), Wαβ is the weight matrix between α and β (e.g., Wxi is the weight matrix from the inputs xt to the input gates it), and bβ denotes the bias term of β with β ∈ {i, f, c, o}. Four weight matrixes are associated with input xt. To allow the information from both the future and the past to determine the output, bidirectional LSTM can be utilized (Graves 2012)."

      "heading" : "3.2 Co-occurrence Exploration",
      "text" : "The fully connected deep LSTM network in Fig. 1 has very powerful learning capability. However, it is difficult to learn directly due to the huge parameter space. To overcome this problem, we introduce a co-occurrence exploration process to ensure the deep model learns effective features.\nThe co-occurrence of some joints can intrinsically characterize a human action. Fig. 3 shows two examples. For “walking”, the joints from hands and feet have high correlations but they all have low correlations with the joint of root. The sets of correlated joints for “walking” and “drinking” are very different, indicating the discriminative subset of joints varies for different types of actions. Two main aspects have been considered in our design of the network and the specialized regularization we propose. (i) We expect the network can automatically explore the conjunctions of discriminative joints. (ii) We expect the network can explore different co-occurrences for different types of actions.\nTherefore, we design the fully connected network to allow each neuron being connected to any joints (for the first layer) or responses of the previous layer (for the second or higher layer) to automatically explore the co-occurrences. Note that the output responses are also referred to as features which are the input of the next layer. We divide the neurons in the same layer into K groups to allow different groups to focus on exploration of different conjunctions of discriminative joints. Taking the kth group of neurons as an example (see Fig. 4 (a)), the neurons will automatically connect the discriminative joints/features. In our design, we incorporate the co-occurrence regularization into the loss function\nmin Wxβ L+ λ1 ∑ β∈S ‖Wxβ‖1+λ2 ∑ β∈S K∑ k=1 ∥∥∥Wxβ,kT∥∥∥ 2,1 , (3)\nwhereL is the maximum likelihood loss function of the deep LSTM network (Graves 2012). The other two terms are used for the co-occurrence regularization which can be applied to each layer. Wxβ = [Wxβ,1; · · · ;Wxβ,K ] ∈ RN×J is the connection weight matrix from inputs to the units associated with β ∈ S, with N indicating the number of neurons and J the dimension of inputs (e.g., for the first layer, J is the number of joints multiplied by 3). The N neurons are partitioned into K groups and the number of neurons in a group\nis L=dN/Ke, with d·e representing the rounding up operation. Wxβ,k is the matrix composed of the (L(k−1)+1)th to (Lk)th rows of Wxβ . Wxβ,kT denotes its transpose. S denotes the set of internal units which are directly connected to the input of a neuron. For the LSTM layer, S={i, f, c, o} denotes the gates and cell in LSTM neurons. For the feedforward layer, S={h} denotes the neuron itself.\nIn the third term, for each group of units, a structural `21 norm, which is defined as ‖W‖2,1= ∑ i √∑ jw 2 i,j (Cotter et\nal. 2005), is used to drive the units to select a conjunction of descriptive inputs (joints/features) since the `21 norm can encourage the matrix Wxβ,k to be column sparse. Different groups explore different connection (co-occurrence) patterns in order to acquire the capability of recognizing multiple categories of actions. The `1 norm constraint (the second term) helps to learn discriminative joints/features.\nThe stochastic gradient descent method is then employed to solve (3). The advantage of the co-occurrence learning is that the model can automatically learn the discriminative joint/feature connections, avoiding the fixed a priori blocking of joint co-occurrences across human parts (Du, Wang, and Wang 2015) as illustrated in Fig. 4 (b)."

      "heading" : "3.3 In-depth Dropout for LSTM",
      "text" : "Dropout tries to combine the predictions of many “thinned” networks to boost the performance. During training, the network randomly drops some neurons to force the remaining sub-network to compensate. During testing, the network uses all the neurons together to make predictions.\nTo extend this idea to LSTM, we propose a new dropout algorithm to allow the dropping of the internal gates, cell and output response for an LSTM neuron, encouraging each unit to learn better parameters. For clarity, an LSTM neuron is shown in Fig. 5 (a) in the unfolded form, where the units are explicitly connected. For recurrent neural networks, the erasing of all the information from a unit is not expected, especially when the unit remembers events that occurred many timesteps back in the past (Pham et al. 2014). Therefore, we allow the influence of dropout in LSTM to flow along layers (marked by dashed arrows) but prohibit it to flow along the time axis (marked by solid arrows) as illustrated in Fig. 5\n(b). To control the influence flows, in the feedforward process, the network calculates and records two types of activations as follows. The responses of units to be transmitted along the time without dropout are\nĩt = σ ( Wxixt + Whih̃t−1 + Wcic̃t−1 + bi ) ,\nf̃t = σ ( Wxfxt + Whf h̃t−1 + Wcf c̃t−1 + bf ) ,\nc̃t= f̃t c̃t−1 + ĩt tanh ( Wxcxt+Whch̃t−1+bc ) ,\nõt = σ ( Wxoxt + Whoh̃t−1 + Wcoc̃t + bo ) ,\nh̃t = õt tanh (c̃t) .\n(4)\nThe responses of units to be transmitted across layers with dropout applied are\ni̊t = σ ( Wxixt + Whih̃t−1 + Wcic̃t−1 + bi ) mi,\nf̊t = σ ( Wxfxt+Whf h̃t−1+Wcf c̃t−1 + bf ) mf ,\nc̊t= (̊ ft c̃t−1+̊it tanh ( Wxcxt+Whch̃t−1+bc )) mc,\no̊t = σ ( Wxoxt + Whoh̃t−1 + Wco̊ct + bo ) mo,\nh̊t = o̊t tanh (̊ct) mh,\n(5)\nwhere mi,mf ,mc,mo, and mh are dropout binary mask vectors for input gates, forget gates, cells, output gates and output responses, respectively, with an element value of 0 indicating that dropout happens. Note that for the first LSTM layer, the inputs xt are the skeleton joints of a frame; for the higher LSTM layer, the inputs xt are the response outputs of the previous layer.\nDuring the training process, the errors back-propagated to the output responses ht are\nth = ̊ t h + ̃ t h,\n̊th = hier h mh, ̃th = recurh ,\n(6)\nwhere hierh denotes the vector of errors back-propagated from the upper layer at the same time slot, recurh denotes the vector of errors from the next time slot in the same layer, ̊t and ̃t denote the dropout errors from the upper layer and recurrent errors from the next time slot, respectively.\nBy taking derivative of h̊t with respect to o̊t based on (5), we get the errors from h̊t to o̊t which represent the errors from upper layer with dropout involved\n̊to = (̊ t h ∂h̊t ∂o̊t ) mo = ̊th tanh (̊ct) mo.

(8)\nThen, the errors back-propagated to the output gates are the summation of the two types of errors\nto = ̊ t o + ̃ t o. (9)\nIn the same way, we derive the errors propagated to the cells, forget gates, and input gates, based on (4) and (5).\nDuring the testing process, we use all the neurons but multiplying the units of LSTM neurons (in the LSTM layer where dropout is applied) by the probability values of 1− p, where p is the dropout probability of that unit. Note that the simple dropout which only drops the output responses ht (Zaremba, Sutskever, and Vinyals 2014) is a special case of our proposed dropout."

We have also tested our model on the Berkeley MHAD action recognition dataset (Ofli et al. 2013) and achieved 100% accuracy. To investigate the impact of each component in our model, we conduct experiments under different configurations represented as follows:\n• Deep LSTM is our basic scheme without regularizations; • Deep LSTM + Co-occurrence is the scheme with our pro-\nposed co-occurrence regularization applied;\n• Deep LSTM + Simple Dropout is the scheme with the dropout algorithm proposed by Zaremba et al.

To reduce the influence of noise in the captured skeleton data, we smooth each joint’s position of the raw skeleton using the filter (−3, 12, 17, 12,−3) /35 in the temporal domain (Savitzky and Golay 1964; Du, Wang, and Wang 2015).

We summarize the results in terms of the average recognition accuracy (5-fold cross validation) in Table 1.\nTable 1 shows that our basic scheme of Deep LSTM achieves comparable performance to the method using handcrafted complex features (Ji, Ye, and Cheng 2014). The proposed schemes of Deep LSTM + Co-occurrence and Deep LSTM + In-depth Dropout can improve the recognition accuracy by 3.4% and 4.1% respectively over Deep LSTM, indicating that the co-occurrence exploration boosts the discrimination of features and the proposed LSTM dropout is capable of learning a more effective model. Deep LSTM + In-depth Dropout is superior to Deep LSTM + Simple Dropout. Note that the deep LSTM network achieves remarkable (5.6%) performance improvement in comparison with the hierarchical RNN network (Du, Wang, and Wang 2015).

It is observed that the weights in the diagonal positions marked by the red ellipse have high values, which means the co-occurrence regularization helps learn the human parts automatically. In contrast to the part based subnet fusion model (Du, Wang, and Wang 2015), the learned co-occurrences of joints by our model do not limit the connections to be in the same part, as there are many large weights outside the diagonal regions, e.g., in the regions marked by white circles, making the network more powerful for action recognition.

Considering that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) can learn feature representations and model long-term temporal dependencies automatically, we propose an endto-end fully connected deep LSTM network for skeleton based action recognition. Inspired by the observation that the co-occurrences of the joints intrinsically characterize human actions, we take the skeleton as the input at each time slot and introduce a novel regularization scheme to learn the co-occurrence features of skeleton joints. To train the deep LSTM network effectively, we propose a new dropout algorithm which simultaneously operates on the gates, cells, and output responses of the LSTM neurons. Experimental results on three human action recognition datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.",
