      "text" : "It has become popular to use over-fitted mixture models in which number of cluster K is chosen as a conservative upper bound on the number of components under the expectation that only relatively few of the components K′ will be occupied by data points in the samples X . This kind of over-fitted mixture models has been successfully due to the ease in computation.\nPreviously Rousseau & Mengersen (2011) proved that quite generally, the posterior behaviour of overfitted mixtures depends on the chosen prior on the weights, and on the number of free parameters in the emission distributions (here D, i.e. the dimension of data). Specifically, they have proved that (a) If α=min(αk, k ≤ K)>D/2 and if the number of components is larger than it should be, asymptotically two or more components in an overfitted mixture model will tend to merge with non-negligible weights. (b) In contrast, if α=max(αk, k 6 K) < D/2, the extra components are emptied at a rate of N−1/2. Hence, if none of the components are small, it implies that K is probably not larger than K0. In the intermediate case, if min(αk, k ≤ K) ≤ D/2 ≤ max(αk, k 6 K), then the situation varies depending on the αk’s and on the difference between K and K0. In particular, in the case where all αk’s are equal to D/2, then although the author does not prove definite result, they conjecture that the posterior distribution does not have a stable limit."

      "text" : "Inspired by Rasmussen (1999) and further discussed by Görür & Edward Rasmussen (2010), they introduced a hyperprior on symmetric Dirichlet distribution prior. We here put a vague prior of Gamma shape on the concentration parameter α and use the standard α setting where αk = α = α+/K for k = 1, . . . ,K.\nα|a, b ∼ Gamma(a, b) =⇒ p(α|a, b) ∝ αa−1e−bα. To get the conditioned posterior distributions on α we need to derive the conditioned posterior distributions on all the other parameters,. But for a graphical model, this conditional distribution is a function only of the nodes in the Markov blanket. In our case, the Bayesian finite Gaussian mixture model, a Directed acyclic graphical (DAG) model, the Markov blanket includes the parents, the children, and the co-parents, as shown in Figure 1. From this graphical representation, we can find the Markov blanket for each parameter in the model, and then figure out their conditional posterior distribution to be derived:\np(α|π, a, b) ∝ p(α|a, b)p(π|α)\n∝ αa−1e−bα Γ(Kα)∏K k=1 Γ(α) K∏ k=1 πα−1k\n= αa−1e−bα(π1 . . . πK) α−1 Γ(Kα)\n[Γ(α)]K .\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n08 17\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n8 A\nug 2\n01 7\nThe following two theorems give the proof that the conditional posterior distribution of α is logconcave.\nTheorem 2.1. Define G(x) = Γ(Kx)\n[Γ(x)]K .\nFor x > 0 and an arbitrary positive integer K, the function G is strictly log-concave.\nProof. From Abramowitz et al. (1966) we get Γ(Kx) = (2π) 1 2 (1−K)KKx− 1 2 ∏K−1 i=0 Γ(x+ i K ). Then\nlogG(x) = 1 2 (1−K) log(2π) + (Kx− 1 2 ) logK + K−1∑ i=0 log Γ(x+ i K )−K log Γ(x)\nand\n[logG(x)]′ = K logK + K−1∑ i=0 Ψ(x+ i K )−KΨ(x),\nwhere Ψ(x) is the Digamma function, and\nΨ′(x) = ∞∑ h=0\n1\n(x+ h)2 . (1)\nThus\n[logG(x)]′′ = [ K−1∑ i=0 Ψ′(x+ i K ) ] −KΨ′(x) < 0, (x > 0).\nThe last inequality comes from (1) and concludes the theorem.\nThis theorem is a general case of Theorem 1 in Merkle (1997).\nTheorem 2.2. In p(α|π, a, b), when a ≥ 1, p(α|π, a, b) is log-concave\nProof. It is easy to verify that αa−1e−bα(π1 . . . πK)α−1 is log-concave when a ≥ 1. In view of that the product of two log-concave functions is log-concave and Theorem 2, it follows that Γ(Kα)\n[Γ(α)]K is log-concave.\nThis concludes the proof.\nFrom the two theorems above, we can find the conditional posterior for α depends only on the weight of each cluster. The distribution p(α|π, a, b) is log-concave, so we may efficiently generate independent samples from this distribution using Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) technique (Gilks & Wild, 1992).\nAlthough the proposed hyperprior on Dirichlet distribution prior for mixture model is generic, we focus on its application in Gaussian mixture models for concreteness. We develop a collapsed Gibbs sampling algorithm based on Neal (2000) for posterior computation.\nLet X be the observations, assumed to follow a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions. We use a conjugate Normal-Inverse-Wishart (NIW) prior p(µ,Σ|β) for the mean vector µ and covariance matrix Σ in each multivariate Gaussian component, where β consists of all the hyperparameters in NIW. A key quantity in a collapsed Gibbs sampler is the probability of each customer i sitting with table k: p(zi = k|z−i,X , α,β), where z−i are the seating assignments of all the other customers and α is the concentration parameter in Dirichlet distribution. This probability is calculated as follows:\np(zi = k|z−i,X , α,β) ∝ p(zi = k|z−i, α, β)p(X|zi = k, z−i, α,β) = p(zi = k|z−i, α)p(xi|X−i, zi = k, z−i,β)p(X−i| zi = k, z−i,β) ∝ p(zi = k|z−i, α)p(xi|X−i, zi = k, z−i,β) ∝ p(zi = k|z−i, α)p(xi|Xk,−i,β),\nwhere Xk,−i are the observations in table k excluding the ith observation. Algorithm 1 gives the pseudo code of the collapsed Gibbs sampler to implement hyperprior for Dirichlet distribution prior in Gaussian mixture models. Note that ARS may require even 10-20 times the computational effort per iteration over sampling once from a gamma density and there is the issue of mixing being worse if we donâĂŹt marginalize out the π in updating α. So this might have a very large impact on effective sample size (ESS) of the Markov chain. Hence, marginalizing out π and using an approximation to the conditional distribution (perhaps with correction through an accept/reject step via usual Metropolis-Hastings or even just using importance weighting without the accept/reject) or even just a Metropolis-Hastings normal random walk for log(α) may be much more efficient than ARS in practice. We here only introduce the updating by ARS.\ninput : Choose an initial z, α and β;\nfor T iterations do for i← 1 to N do\nRemove xi’s statistics from component zi ; for k ← 1 to K do\nCalculate p(zi = k|z−i, α) ; Calculate p(xi|Xk,−i,β); Calculate p(zi = k|z−i,X , α,β) ∝ p(zi = k|z−i, α)p(xi|Xk,−i,β);\nend Sample knew from p(zi|z−i,X , α,β) after normalizing; Add xi’s statistics to the component zi = knew ;\nend ?

Figure 2 shows the result on Sim 1 with different set of K. Figure 3 shows the posterior density of α in each set of K. We can find that the larger K −K0, the smaller the poserior mean of α. This is what we expect, as the larger overfitting, the smaller α will shrink the weight vector in the edge of a probability simplex."

      "text" : "We have proposed a new hyperprior on symmetric Dirichlet distribution in finite Bayesian mixture model. This hyperprior can learn the concentration parameter in Dirichlet prior due to over-fitting of the mixture model. The larger the overfitting (i.e. K −K0 is larger, more overfitting), the smaller the concentration parameter.\nAlthough Rousseau & Mengersen (2011) proved that α=max(αk, k 6 K) < D/2, the extra components are emptied at a rate of N−1/2, it is still risky to use such small α in practice, for example, how much do we over-fit (i.e. how large the K − K0). If K − K0 is small, we will get very poor mixing from MCMC. Some efforts has been done further by van Havre et al. (2015). But simple hyperprior on Dirichlet distribution will somewhat release the burden."
