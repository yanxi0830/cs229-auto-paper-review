      "text" : "Our study is broadly motivated by questions in high-dimensional learning. As is well known, learning in high dimensions is feasible only if the data distribution satisfies suitable prior assumptions. One such assumption is that the data distribution lies on, or is close to, a low-dimensional set embedded in a high dimensional space, for instance a low dimensional manifold. This latter assumption has proved to be useful in practice, as well as amenable to theoretical analysis, and it has led to a significant amount of recent work. Starting from [29, 40, 7], this set of ideas, broadly referred to as manifold learning, has been applied to a variety of problems from supervised [42] and semi-supervised learning [8], to clustering [45] and dimensionality reduction [7], to name a few.\nInterestingly, the problem of learning the manifold itself has received less attention: given samples from a d-manifoldM embedded in some ambient space X , the problem is to learn a set that approximates M in a suitable sense. This problem has been considered in computational geometry, but in a setting in which typically the manifold is a hyper-surface in a low-dimensional space (e.g. R3), and the data are typically not sampled probabilistically, see for instance [32, 30]. The problem of learning a manifold is also related to that of estimating the support of a distribution, (see [17, 18] for recent surveys.) In this context, some of the distances considered to measure approximation quality are the Hausforff distance, and the so-called excess mass distance.\nThe reconstruction framework that we consider is related to the work of [1, 38], as well as to the framework proposed in [37], in which a manifold is approximated by a set, with performance measured by an expected distance to this set. This setting is similar to the problem of dictionary learning (see for instance [36], and extensive references therein), in which a dictionary is found by minimizing a similar reconstruction error, perhaps with additional constraints on an associated encoding of the data. Crucially, while the dictionary is learned on the empirical data, the quantity of interest is the expected reconstruction error, which is the focus of this work.\nWe analyze this problem by focusing on two important, and widely-used algorithms, namely kmeans and k-flats. The k-means algorithm can be seen to define a piecewise constant approximation of M. Indeed, it induces a Voronoi decomposition on M, in which each Voronoi region is effectively approximated by a fixed mean. Given this, a natural extension is to consider higher order approximations, such as those induced by discrete collections of k d-dimensional affine spaces (k-flats), with possibly better\nar X\niv :1\n20 9.\n11 21\nv4 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n1 9\nFe b\n20 13\nresulting performance. Since M is a d-manifold, the k-flats approximation naturally resembles the way in which a manifold is locally approximated by its tangent bundle.\nOur analysis extends previous results for k-means to the case in which the data-generating distribution is supported on a manifold, and provides analogous results for k-flats. We note that the k-means algorithm has been widely studied, and thus much of our analysis in this case involves the combination of known facts to obtain novel results. The analysis of k-flats, however, requires developing substantially new mathematical tools.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we describe the formal setting and the algorithms that we study. We begin our analysis by discussing the reconstruction properties of k-means in section 3. In section 4, we present and discuss our main results, whose proofs are postponed to the appendices."

      "text" : "Let X by a Hilbert space with inner product 〈·, ·〉, endowed with a Borel probability measure ρ supported over a compact, smooth d-manifold M. We assume the data to be given by a training set, in the form of samples Xn = (x1, . . . , xn) drawn identically and independently with respect to ρ. Our goal is to learn a set Sn that approximates well the manifold. The approximation (learning error) is measured by the expected reconstruction error\nEρ(Sn) := ∫ M dρ(x) d2 X (x, Sn), (1)\nwhere the distance to a set S ⊆ X is d2 X (x, S) = infx′∈S d 2 X (x, x′), with dX (x, x ′) = ‖x− x′‖. This is the same reconstruction measure that has been the recent focus of [37, 5, 38]. It is easy to see that any set such that S ⊃M will have zero risk, withM being the “smallest” such set (with respect to set containment.) In other words, the above error measure does not introduce an explicit penalty on the “size” of Sn: enlarging any given Sn can never increase the learning error. With this observation in mind, we study specific learning algorithms that, given the data, produce a set belonging to some restricted hypothesis space H (e.g. sets of size k for k-means), which effectively introduces a constraint on the size of the sets. Finally, note that the risk of Equation 1 is non-negative and, if the hypothesis space is sufficiently rich, the risk of an unsupervised algorithm may converge to zero under suitable conditions."

      "text" : "In this work, we focus on two specific algorithms, namely k-means [34, 33] and k-flats [12]. Although typically discussed in the Euclidean space case, their definition can be easily extended to a Hilbert space setting. The study of manifolds embedded in a Hilbert space is of special interest when considering non-linear (kernel) versions of the algorithms [20]. More generally, this setting can be seen as a limit case when dealing with high dimensional data. Naturally, the more classical setting of an absolutely continuous distribution over d-dimensional Euclidean space is simply a particular case, in which X = Rd, and M is a domain with positive Lebesgue measure. K-Means. Let H = Sk be the class of sets of size k in X . Given a training set Xn and a choice of k, k-means is defined by the minimization over S ∈ Sk of the empirical reconstruction error\nEn(S) := 1\nn n∑ i=1 d2 X (xi, S). (2)\nwhere, for any fixed set S, En(S) is an unbiased empirical estimate of Eρ(S), so that k-means can be seen to be performing a kind of empirical risk minimization [13, 9, 37, 10, 37].\nA minimizer of Equation 2 on Sk is a discrete set of k means Sn,k = {m1, . . . ,mk}, which induces a Dirichlet-Voronoi tiling of X : a collection of k regions, each closest to a common mean [4] (in our notation, the subscript n denotes the dependence of Sn,k on the sample, while k refers to its size.) By virtue of Sn,k being a minimizing set, each mean must occupy the center of mass of the samples in its Voronoi region.\nThese two facts imply that it is possible to compute a local minimum of the empirical risk by using a greedy coordinate-descent relaxation, namely Lloyd’s algorithm [33]. Furthermore, given a finite sample Xn, the number of locally-minimizing sets Sn,k is also finite since (by the center-of-mass condition) there cannot be more than the number of possible partitions of Xn into k groups, and therefore the global minimum must be attainable. Even though Lloyd’s algorithm provides no guarantees of closeness to the global minimizer, in practice it is possible to use a randomized approximation algorithm, such as kmeans++ [3], which provides guarantees of approximation to the global minimum in expectation with respect to the randomization. K-Flats. Let H = Fk be the class of collections of k flats (affine spaces) of dimension d. For any value of k, k-flats, analogously to k-means, aims at finding the set Fk ∈ Fk that minimizes the empirical reconstruction (2) over Fk. By an argument similar to the one used for k-means, a global minimizer must be attainable, and a Lloyd-type relaxation converges to a local minimum. Note that, in this case, given a Voronoi partition ofM into regions closest to each d-flat, new optimizing flats for that partition can be computed by a d-truncated PCA solution on the samples falling in each region."

      "text" : "In practice, k-means is often interpreted to be a clustering algorithm, with clusters defined by the Voronoi diagram of the set of means Sn,k. In this interpretation, Equation 2 is simply rewritten by summing over the Voronoi regions, and adding all pairwise distances between samples in the region (the intra-cluster distances.) For instance, this point of view is considered in [14] where k-means is studied from an information theoretic persepective. K-means can also be interpreted to be performing vector quantization, where the goal is to minimize the encoding error associated to a nearest-neighbor quantizer [23]. Interestingly, in the limit of increasing sample size, this problem coincides, in a precise sense [39], with the problem of optimal quantization of probability distributions (see for instance the excellent monograph of [24].)\nWhen the data-generating distribution is supported on a manifold M, k-means can be seen to be approximating points on the manifold by a discrete set of means. Analogously to the Euclidean setting, this induces a Voronoi decomposition of M, in which each Voronoi region is effectively approximated by a fixed mean (in this sense k-means produces a piecewise constant approximation of M.) As in the Euclidean setting, the limit of this problem with increasing sample size is precisely the problem of optimal quantization of distributions on manifolds, which is the subject of significant recent work in the field of optimal quantization [26, 27].\nIn this paper, we take the above view of k-means as defining a (piecewise constant) approximation of the manifold M supporting the data distribution. In particular, we are interested in the behavior of the expected reconstruction error Eρ(Sn,k), for varying k and n. This perspective has an interesting relation with dictionary learning, in which one is interested in finding a dictionary, and an associated representation, that allows to approximately reconstruct a finite set of data-points/signals. In this interpretation, the set of means can be seen as a dictionary of size k that produces a maximally sparse representation (the k-means encoding), see for example [36] and references therein. Crucially, while the dictionary is learned on the available empirical data, the quantity of interest is the expected reconstruction error, and the question of characterizing the performance with respect to this latter quantity naturally arises.\nSince k-means produces a piecewise constant approximation of the data, a natural idea is to consider higher orders of approximation, such as approximation by discrete collections of k d-dimensional affine spaces (k-flats), with possibly better performance. Since M is a d-manifold, the approximation induced by k-flats may more naturally resemble the way in which a manifold is locally approximated by its tangent bundle. We provide in Sec. 4.2 a partial answer to this question."

      "heading" : "3 Reconstruction Properties of k-Means",
      "text" : "Since we are interested in the behavior of the expected reconstruction (1) of k-means and k-flats for varying k and n, before analyzing this behavior, we consider what is currently known about this problem,\nbased on previous work. While k-flats is a relatively new algorithm whose behavior is not yet well understood, several properties of k-means are currently known.\nRecall that k-means find an discrete set Sn,k of size k that best approximates the samples in the sense of (2). Clearly, as k increases, the empirical reconstruction error En(Sn,k) cannot increase, and typically decreases. However, we are ultimately interested in the expected reconstruction error, and therefore would like to understand the behavior of Eρ(Sn,k) with varying k, n.\nIn the context of optimal quantization, the behavior of the expected reconstruction error Eρ has been considered for an approximating set Sk obtained by minimizing the expected reconstruction error itself over the hypothesis space H = Sk. The set Sk can thus be interpreted as the output of a population, or infinite sample version of k-means. In this case, it is possible to show that Eρ(Sk) is a non increasing function of k and, in fact, to derive explicit rates. For example in the case X = Rd, and under fairly general technical assumptions, it is possible to show that Eρ(Sk) = Θ(k−2/d), where the constants depend on ρ and d [24].\nIn machine learning, the properties of k-means have been studied, for fixed k, by considering the excess reconstruction error Eρ(Sn,k)− Eρ(Sk). In particular, this quantity has been studied for X = Rd, and shown to be, with high probability, of order √ kd/n, up-to logarithmic factors [37]. The case where X is a Hilbert space has been considered in [37, 10], where an upper-bound of order k/ √ n is proven to hold with high probability. The more general setting where X is a metric space has been studied in [9]. When analyzing the behavior of Eρ(Sn,k), and in the particular case that X = Rd, the above results can be combined to obtain, with high probability, a bound of the form\nEρ(Sn,k) ≤ |Eρ(Sn,k)− En(Sn,k)|+ En(Sn,k)− En(Sk) + |En(Sk)− Eρ(Sk)|+ Eρ(Sk)\n≤ C\n(√ kd\nn + k−2/d\n) (3)\nup to logarithmic factors, where the constant C does not depend on k or n (a complete derivation is given in the Appendix.) The above inequality suggests a somewhat surprising effect: the expected reconstruction properties of k-means may be described by a trade-off between a statistical error (of order√\nkd n ) and a geometric approximation error (of order k −2/d.)\nThe existence of such a tradeoff between the approximation, and the statistical errors may itself not be entirely obvious, see the discussion in [5]. For instance, in the k-means problem, it is intuitive that, as more means are inserted, the expected distance from a random sample to the means should decrease, and one might expect a similar behavior for the expected reconstruction error. This observation naturally begs the question of whether and when this trade-off really exists or if it is simply a result of the looseness in the bounds. In particular, one could ask how tight the bound (3) is.\nWhile the bound on Eρ(Sk) is known to be tight for k sufficiently large [24], the remaining terms (which are dominated by |Eρ(Sn,k)−En(Sn,k)|) are derived by controlling the supremum of an empirical process\nsup S∈Sk\n|En(S)− Eρ(S)| (4)\nand it is unknown whether available bounds for it are tight [37]. Indeed, it is not clear how close the distortion redundancy Eρ(Sn,k)− Eρ(Sk) is to its known lower bound of order d √ k1− 4 d\nn (in expectation) [5]. More importantly, we are not aware of a lower bound for Eρ(Sn,k) itself. Indeed, as pointed out in [5], “The exact dependence of the minimax distortion redundancy on k and d is still a challenging open problem”.\nFinally, we note that, whenever a trade-off can be shown to hold, it may be used to justify a heuristic for choosing k empirically as the value that minimizes the reconstruction error in a hold-out set.\nIn Figure 1 we perform some simple numerical simulations showing that the trade-off indeed occurs in certain regimes. The following example provides a situation where a trade-off can be easily shown to occur.\nExample 1. Consider a setup in which n = 2 samples are drawn from a uniform distribution on the unit d = 100-sphere, though the argument holds for other n much smaller than d. Because d n, with high probability, the samples are nearly orthogonal: < x1, x2 >X' 0, while a third sample x drawn uniformly on S100 will also very likely be nearly orthogonal to both x1, x2 [31]. The k-means solution on this dataset is clearly Sk=1 = {(x1 + x2)/2} (Fig 2(a)). Indeed, since Sk=2 = {x1, x2} (Fig 2(b)), it is Eρ(Sk=1) ' 1.5 < 2 ' Eρ(Sk=2) with very high probability. In this case, it is better to place a single mean closer to the origin (with Eρ({0}) = 1), than to place two means at the sample locations. This example is sufficiently simple that the exact k-means solution is known, but the effect can be observed in more complex settings."

      "text" : "In all the results, the final performance does not depend on the dimensionality of the embedding space (which in fact can be infinite), but only on the intrinsic dimension of the space on which the datagenerating distribution is defined. The key to these results is an approximation construction in which the Voronoi regions on the manifold (points closest to a given mean or flat) are guaranteed to have vanishing diameter in the limit of k going to infinity. Under our construction, a hypersurface is approximated efficiently by tracking the variation of its tangent spaces by using the second fundamental form. Where this form vanishes, the Voronoi regions of an approximation will not be ensured to have vanishing diameter with k going to infinity, unless certain care is taken in the analysis.\nAn important point of interest is that the approximations are controlled by averaged quantities, such as the total root curvature (k-flats for surfaces of codimension one), total curvature (k-flats in arbitrary codimensions), and d/(d+ 2)-norm of the probability density (k-means), which are integrated over the domain where the distribution is defined. Note that these types of quantities have been linked to provably tight approximations in certain cases, such as for convex manifolds [25, 16], in contrast with worst-case methods that place a constraint on a maximum curvature, or minimum injectivity radius (for instance [1, 38].) Intuitively, it is easy to see that a constraint on an average quantity may be arbitrarily less restrictive than one on its maximum. A small difficult region (e.g. of very high curvature) may cause the bounds of the latter to substantially degrade, while the results presented here would not be adversely affected so long as the region is small.\nAdditionally, care has been taken throughout to analyze the behavior of the constants. In particular, there are no constants in the analysis that grow exponentially with the dimension, and in fact, many have polynomial, or slower growth. We believe this to be an important point, since this ensures that the asymptotic bounds do not hide an additional exponential dependence on the dimension."

The error E∗ρ,k = infSk∈Sk Eρ(Sk) is related to the problem of optimal quantization. The classical optimal quantization problem is quite well understood, going back to the fundamental work of [46, 44] on optimal quantization for data transmission, and more recently by the work of [24, 27, 26, 15]. In particular, it is known that, for distributions with finite moment of order 2 +λ, for some λ > 0, it is [24]\nlim k→∞\nE∗ρ,k · k2/d = C {∫ dν(x)pa(x) d/(d+2) }(d+2)/d (16)\nwhere ν is the Lebesgue measure, pa is the density of the absolutely continuous part of the distribution (according to its Lebesgue decomposition), and C is a constant that depends only on the dimension.

In particular, this shows that the constant C only depends on the dimension, and, in our case (r = 2), has only linear growth in d, a fact that will be used in the sequel.\nThe approximation error E∗ρ,k = infSk∈Sk Eρ(Sk) of k-means is related to the problem of optimal quantization on manifolds, for which some results are known [26]. By calling E∗M,p,k the approximation error only among sets of means contained inM, Theorem 5 in Appendix C, implies in this case (letting r = 2) that\nlim k→∞ E∗ρ,k · k2/d = C {∫ M dµ I (x) p(x)d/(d+2) }(d+2)/d (17)\nwhere p is absolutely continuous over M and, by replacing M with a d-dimensional domain in Rd, it is clear that the constant C is the same as above.\nSince restricting the means to be onM cannot decrease the approximation error, it is E∗ρ,k ≤ E∗M,p,k, and therefore the right-hand side of Equation 17 provides an (asymptotic) upper bound to E∗ρ,k · k2/d.\nFor the statistical error we use available bounds.

The statistical error of Equation 14, which uniformly bounds the difference between the empirical, and expected error, has been widely-studied in recent years in the literature [37, 38, 5]. In particular, it has been shown that, for a distribution p over the unit ball in Rd, it is\nsup S∈Sk\n|Eρ(S)− En(S)| ≤ k √\n18π√ n +\n√ 8 ln 1/δ\nn (18)\nwith probability 1 − δ [37]. Clearly, this implies convergence En(S) → Eρ(S) almost surely, as n → ∞; although this latter result was proven earlier in [39], under the less restrictive condition that p have finite second moment. By bringing together the above results, we obtain the bound in Theorem 1 on the performance of kmeans, whose proof is postponed to Appendix A.\nFurther, we can consider the error incurred by the actual optimization algorithm used to compute the k-means solution. Computational error. In practice, the k-means problem is NP-hard [2, 19, 35], with the original Lloyd relaxation algorithm providing no guarantees of closeness to the global minimum of Equation 2. However, practical approximations, such as the k-means++ algorithm [3], exist. When using k-means++, means are inserted one by one at samples selected with probability proportional to their squared distance to the\nset of previously-inserted means. This randomized seeding has been shown by [3] to output a set that is, in expectation, within a 8 (ln k + 2)-factor of the optimal. Once again, by combining these results, we obtain Theorem 2, whose proof is also in Appendix A.\nWe use the results discussed in Section A to obtain the proof of Theorem 1 as follows. Proof. Letting ‖p‖d/(d+2) := {∫ dµI(x)p(x) d/(d+2) }(d+2)/d , then with probability 1− δ, it is\nEρ(Sn,k) ≤ 2n−1/2 ( k √ 18π + √ 8 ln 1/δ ) + Ck−2/d · ‖p‖d/(d+2)\n≤ 2n−1/2k √ 18π · √\n8 ln 1/δ + Ck−2/d · ‖p‖d/(d+2) = 24 √ πkn−1/2 √ ln 1/δ + Ck−2/d · ‖p‖d/(d+2)\n= 2 √ ln 1/δn−1/(d+2)Cd/(d+2) ( 24 √ π )2/(d+2) ·{∫ dµI(x)p(x)d/(d+2)}\n(19)\nwhere the parameter\nkn = n d 2(d+2) · ( C\n24 √ π\n)d/(d+2) · {∫ dµI(x)p(x) d/(d+2) } (20)\nhas been chosen to balance the summands in the third line of Equation 19.\nThe proof of Theorem 2 follows a similar argument.\nProof. In the case of Theorem 2, the additional multiplicative term Ak = 8(ln k + 2) corresponding to the computational error incurred by the k-means++ algorithm does not affect the choice of parameter kn since both summands in the third line of Equation 19 are multiplied by Ak in this case. Therefore, we may simply use the same choice of kn as in Equation 20 in this case to obtain\nEZ Eρ(Sn,k) ≤ 2n−1/2 ( k √ 18π + √ 8 ln 1/δ ) + Ck−2/d · ‖p‖d/(d+2) · 8(ln k + 2)\n≤ 16 √ ln 1/δn−1/(d+2)Cd/(d+2) ( 24 √ π )2/(d+2) ·{∫ dµI(x)p(x)d/(d+2)}\n· [ 2 + d\nd+ 2\n( 1\n2 lnn+ ln\nC\n12 √ π\n+ ln ‖p‖d/(d+2) )] (21)\nwith probability 1 − δ, where the expectation is with respect to the random choice Z in the algorithm. From this the bound of Theorem 2 follows."

      "text" : "Here we state a series of lemma that we prove in the next section. For the k-flats problem, we begin by introducing a uniform bound on the difference between empirical (Equation 2) and expected risk (Equation 1.)\nLemma 1.

We distinguish between the codimension one hypersurface case, and the more general case of a smooth manifold M embedded in a Hilbert space. We begin with an approximation error bound for hypersurfaces in Euclidean space.\nLemma 2. Assume given M smooth with metric of class C3 in Rd+1.

The constant C grows as C ∼ (d/(2πe)) 2 with d→∞.\nWe combine these two results into Theorems 3 and 4, whose derivation is in Appendix B.\nC.1 Proofs\nWe begin proving the bound on the statistical error given in Lemma 1.\nProof. We begin by finding uniform upper bounds on the difference between Equations 1 and 2 for the class Fk of sets of k d-dimensional affine spaces. To do this, we will first bound the Rademacher complexity Rn(Fk, p) of the class Fk.\nLet Φ and Ψ be Gaussian processes indexed by Fk, and defined by\nΦX′ = n∑ i=1 γi k min j=1 d2 X (xi, π ′ jxi)\nΨX′ = n∑ i=1 γi k∑ j=1 d2 X (xi, π ′ jxi)\n(22)\nX ′ ∈ Fk, X ′ is the union of k d-subspaces: X ′ = ∪kj=1Fj , where each π′j is an orthogonal projection onto Fj , and γi are independent Gaussian sequences of zero mean and unit variance.\nNoticing that d2 X (x, πx) = ‖x‖2 − ‖πx‖2 = ‖x‖2 − 〈xxt, π〉 F for any orthogonal projection π (see for instance [11], Sec. 2.1), where 〈·, ·〉\nF is the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product, we may verify that:\nEγ (ΦX′ − ΦX′′)2 = n∑ i=1 [ k min j=1 ‖xi‖2 − 〈 xix t i, π ′ j 〉 F − ( k min j=1 ‖xi‖2 − 〈 xix t i, π ′′ j 〉 F )]2 ≤\nn∑ i=1 k max j=1 (〈 xix t i, π ′ j 〉 F − 〈 xix t i, π ′′ j 〉 F )2 ≤\nn∑ i=1 k∑ j=1 (〈 xix t i, π ′ j 〉 F − 〈 xix t i, π ′′ j 〉 F )2 = Eγ (ΨX′ −ΨX′′)2\n(23)\nSince it is,\nEγ sup X′∈Fk n∑ i=1 γi k∑ j=1 〈 xix t i, π ′ j 〉 F = Eγ sup X′∈Fk k∑ j=1 〈 n∑ i=1 γixix t i, π ′ j 〉 F\n≤ kEγ sup π 〈 n∑ i=1 γixix t i, π 〉 F\n≤ k sup π ‖π‖ F Eγ ‖ n∑ i=1 γixix t i‖F ≤ k √ dn\n(24)\nwe may bound the Gaussian complexity Γn(Fk, p) as follows:\nΓn(Fk, p) = 2\nn Eγ sup\nX′∈Fk n∑ i=1 γi k min j=1 d2 X (xi, π ′ jxi)\n≤ 2 n Eγ sup\nX′∈Fk n∑ i=1 γi k∑ j=1 〈 xix t i, π ′ j 〉 F ≤ 2k\n√ d\nn\n(25)\nwhere the first inequality follows from Equation 23 and Slepian’s Lemma [41], and the second from Equation 24.\nTherefore the Rademacher complexity is bounded by\nRn(Fk, p) ≤ √ π/2Γn(Fk, p) ≤ k\n√ 2πd\nn (26)\nFinally, by Theorem 8 of [6], it is:\nsup X′∈Fk\n|Eρ(X ′)− En(X ′)| ≤ Rn(Fk, p) + √ ln 1/δ\n2n ≤ k\n√ 2πd\nn +\n√ ln 1/δ\n2n (27)\nas desired.\nC.2 Approximation Error\nIn order to prove approximation bounds for the k-flats problem, we will begin by first considering the simpler setting of a smooth d-manifold in Rd+1 space (codimension 1), and later we will extend the analysis to the general case.\nApproximation Error: Codimension One\nAssume that it is X = Rd+1 with the natural metric, and M is a compact, smooth d-manifold with metric of class C2. Since M is of codimension one, the second fundamental form at each point is a map from the tangent space to the reals. Assume given α > 0 and λ > 0. At every point x ∈ M, define the metric Qx := |IIx|+ α′(x)Ix, where\na) I and II are, respectively, the first and second fundamental forms on M [22].\nb) |II| is the convexified second fundamental form, whose eigenvalues are those of II but in absolute value. If the second fundamental form II is written in coordinates (with respect to an orthonormal basis of the tangent space) as SΛST , with S orthonormal, and Λ diagonal, then |II| is S|Λ|ST in coordinates. Because |II| is continuous and positive semi-definite, it has an associated measure µ|II| (with respect to the volume measure µI.)\nc) α′(x) > 0 is chosen such that dµ Qx /dµI = dµ|II|/dµI + α. Note that such α ′(x) > 0 always exists since:\n· α′(x) = 0 implies dµ Qx /dµI = dµ|II|/dµI, and · dµ Qx /dµI can be made arbitrarily large by increasing α ′(x).\nand therefore there is some intermediate value of α′(x) > 0 that satisfies the constraint.\nIn particular, from condition c), it is clear that Q is everywhere positive definite. Let µI and µQ be the measures over M, associated with I and Q. Since, by its definition, µII is absolutely continuous with respect to I, then so must Q be. Therefore, we may define\nω Q := dµ Q /dµI\nto be the density of µ Q with respect to µI. Consider the discrete set Pk ⊂M of size k that minimizes the quantity\nfQ,p(Pk) = ∫ M dµ Q (x) [ p(x) ω Q (x) ] min p∈Pk d4 Q (x, p) (28)\namong all sets of k points on M. fQ,p(Pk) is the (fourth-order) quantization error over M, with metric Q, and with respect to a weight function p/ω\nQ . Note that, in the definition of fQ,p(Pk), it is crucial that\nthe measure (µ Q ), and distance (d Q ) match, in the sense that d Q is the geodesic distance with respect to the metric Q, whose associated measure is µ\nQ .\nThe following theorem, adapted from [26], characterizes the relation between k and the quantization error fQ,p(Pk) on a Riemannian manifold.\nTheorem 5. [[26]] Given a smooth compact Riemannian d-manifold M with metric Q of class C1, and a continuous function w :M→ R+, then\nmin P∈Pk ∫ M dµ Q (x)w(x) min p∈P dr Q (x, p) ∼ C {∫ M dµ Q (x)w(x)d/(d+r) }(d+r)/d · k−r/d (29)\nas k →∞, where the constant C depends only on d. Furthermore, for each connected M, there is a number ξ > 1 such that each set Pk that minimizes\nEquation 29 is a ( k−1/d/ξ ) -packing and ( ξk−1/d ) -cover of M, with respect to d\nQ . This last result, which shows that a minimizing set Pk of size k must be a ( ξk−1/d ) -cover, clearly\nimplies, by the definition of Voronoi diagram and the triangle inequality, the following key corollary.\nCorollary 1. Given M, there is ξ > 1 such that each set Pk that minimizes Equation 29 has Voronoi regions of diameter no larger than 2ξk−1/d, as measured by the distance d\nQ .\nLet each Pk ⊂M be a minimizer of Equation 28 of size k, then, for each k, define Fk to be the union of (d-dimensional affine) tangent spaces to M at each q ∈ Pk, that is, Fk := ∪q∈PkTqM. We may now use the definition of Pk to bound the approximation error Eρ(Fk) on this set.\nWe begin by establishing some results that link distance to tangent spaces on manifolds to the geodesic distance d\nQ associated with Q. The following lemma appears (in a slightly different form) as Lemma 4.1\nin [16], and is borrowed from [26, 25].\nLemma 4. [[26, 25], [16]] Given M as above, and λ > 0 then, for every p ∈ M there is an open neighborhood Vλ(p) 3 p in M such that, for all x, y ∈ Vλ(p), it is\nd2 X (x, TyM) ≤ (1 + λ)d4|II|(x, y) (30)\nwhere dX (x, TyM) is the distance from x to the tangent plane TyM at y, and d|II| is the geodesic distance associated with the convexified second fundamental form.\nFrom the definition of Q, it is clear that, because Q strictly dominates |II| then, for points x, y satisfying the conditions of Equation 30, it must be dX (x, TyM) ≤ (1 + λ)d|II|(x, y) ≤ (1 + λ)dQ(x, y).\nGiven our choice of λ > 0, Lemma 4 implies that there is a collection of k neighborhoods, centered around the points p ∈ Pk, such that Equation 30 holds inside each. However, these neighborhoods may\nbe too small for our purposes. In order to apply Lemma 4 to our problem, we will need to prove a stronger condition. We begin by considering the Dirichlet-Voronoi regions DM,Q(p;Pk) of points p ∈ Pk, with respect to the distance d\nQ . That is,\nDM,Q(p;Pk) = {x ∈M : dQ(x, p) ≤ dQ(x, q),∀q ∈ Pk}\nwhere, as before, Pk is a set of size k minimizing Equation 28.\nLemma 5. For each λ > 0, there is k′ such that, for all k ≥ k′, and all q ∈ Pk, Equation 30 holds for all x, y ∈ DM,Q(q;Pk).\nRemark Note that, if it were P ′k ⊂ Pk with k > k′ (if each Pk+1 were constructed by adding one point to Pk), then Lemma 5 would follow automatically from Lemma 4 and Corollary 1. Since, in general, this not the case, the following proof is needed.\nProof. It suffices to show that every Voronoi region DM,Q(q;Pk), for sufficiently large k, is contained in a neighborhood Vλ(vq) of the type described in Lemma 4, for some vq ∈M.\nClearly, by Lemma 4, the set C = {Vλ(x) : x ∈ M} is an open cover of M. Since M is compact, C admits a finite subcover C ′. By the Lebesgue number lemma, there is δ > 0 such that every set inM of diameter less than δ is contained in some open set of C ′.\nNow let k′ = d(δ/2ξ)−de. By Corollary 1, every Voronoi region DM,Q(q;Pk), with q ∈ Pk, k ≥ k′, has diameter less than δ, and is therefore contained in some set of C ′. Since Equation 30 holds inside every set of C ′ then, in particular, it holds inside DM,Q(q;Pk).\nWe now have all the tools needed to prove:\nLemma 2 If Fk is the class of sets of k d-dimensional affine spaces, and E∗ρ,k is the minimizer of Equation 1 over Fk, then there is a constant C that depends on d only, such that\nlim k→∞\nE∗ρ,k · k4/d ≤ C · (κM) 4/d\nwhere κM := µ|II|(M) is the total root curvature of M. The constant C grows as C ∼ (d/(2πe)) 2\nwith d→∞.\nProof. Pick α > 0 and λ > 0. Given Pk minimizing Equation 28, if Fk is the union of tangent spaces at each p ∈ Pk, by Lemmas 4 and 5, it is\nEρ(Fk) = ∫ M dµ I (x)p(x) min p∈Pk d2 X (x, TpM)\n≤ (1 + λ) ∫ M dµI(x)p(x) min p∈Pk d4 Q (x, p)\n= (1 + λ) ∫ M dµ Q (x) p(x) ωQ(x) min p∈Pk d4 Q (x, p)\nThm. 5, r=4\n≤ (1 + λ)C {∫ M dµ Q (x) [ p(x) ωQ(x) ]d/(d+4)}(d+4)/d · k−4/d\n(31)\nwhere the last line follows from the fact that Pk has been chosen to minimize Equation 28, and where, in order to apply Theorem 5, we use the fact that p is absolutely continuous in M.\nBy the definition of ωQ, it follows that{∫ M dµ Q (x) [ p(x) ωQ(x) ]d/(d+4)}(d+4)/d = {∫ M dµ I (x)ωQ(x) 4/(d+4)p(x)d/(d+4) }(d+4)/d\n≤ {∫ M dµ I (x)ω Q (x) }4/d (32)\nwhere the last line follows from Hölder’s inequality (‖fg‖1 ≤ ‖f‖p‖g‖q with p = (d + 4)/d > 1, and q = (d+ 4)/4.)\nFinally, by the definition of Q and α′, it is∫ M dµ I (x)ω Q (x) ≤ ∫ M dµ I (x)α+ ∫ M dµ|II|(x) = αVM + κM (33)\nwhere VM is the total volume of M, and κM := µ|II|(M) is the total root curvature of M. Therefore\nEρ(Fk) ≤ (1 + λ)C {αVM + κM} 4/d · k−4/d (34)\nSince α > 0 and λ > 0 are arbitrary, Lemma 2 follows. Finally, we discuss an important technicality in the proof that we hadn’t mentioned before in the interest of clarity of exposition. Because we are taking absolutely values in its definition, Q is not necessarily of class C1, even if II is. Therefore, we may not apply Theorem 5 directly. We may, however, use Weierstrass’ approximation theorem (see for example [21] p. 133), to obtain a smooth -approximation to Q, which can be enforced to be positive definite by relating the choice of to that of α, and with → 0 as α → 0. Since the -approximation Q only affects the final performance (Equation 34) by at most a constant times , then the fact that α is arbitrarily small (and thus so is ) implies the lemma.\nApproximation Error: General Case\nAssume given a d-manifoldM with metric in C3 embedded in a separable Hilbert space X . Consider the definition in Section 4 of the second fundamental form II and its operator norm |II|.\nWe begin extending the results of Lemma 4 to the general case, where the manifold is embedded in a possibly infinite-dimensional ambient space. In this case, the orthogonal complement (TxM)⊥ to the tangent space at x ∈ M may be infinite-dimensional (although, by the separability of X , it has a countable basis.)\nFor each x ∈ M, consider the largest x-centered ball Bx(ε) for which there is a smooth one-to-one Monge patch mx : Bx(εx) ⊂ TxM→M. Since M is smooth, and II bounded, by the inverse function theorem it holds εx > 0. Because II ∈ C1, we can always choose εx to be continuous in M, and thus by the compactness ofM there is a minimum 0 < ε such that 0 < ε ≤ εx with x ∈M. Let Nx(δ) denote the geodesic neighborhood around x ∈M of radius δ. We begin by proving the following technical Lemma.\nLemma 6. For every q ∈ M, there is δq such that, for all x, y ∈ Nq(δq), it is x ∈ my(By(ε)) (x is in the Monge patch of y.)\nProof. The Monge function my : By( )→M is such that r ∈ By( ) implies my(r)− (y + r) ∈ (TyM)⊥ (with the appropriate identification of vectors in X and in (TyM)⊥), and therefore for all r ∈ By( ) it holds\ndI(y,my(r)) ≥ ‖my(r)− y‖X = ‖my(r)− (y + r) + (y + r)− y‖X = ‖my(r)− (y + r)‖X + ‖r‖X ≥ ‖r‖X\nTherefore Ny(ε) ⊂ my(By(ε)). For each q ∈M, the geodesic ballNq(ε/2) is such that, by the triangle inequality, for all x, y ∈ Nq(ε/2) it is dI(x, y) ≤ ε. Therefore x ∈ Ny(ε) ⊂ my(By(ε)).\nLemma 7. For all λ > 0 and q ∈M, there is a neighborhood V 3 q such that, for all x, y ∈ V it is\nd2X (x, TyM) ≤ (1 + λ)d4I (x, y)|IIx|2 (35)\nProof. Let V be a geodesic neighborhood of radius smaller than ε, so that Lemma 6 holds. Define the extension II∗x(r) = II ∗ x(r t + r⊥) := IIx(r t) of the second fundamental form to X , where rt ∈ TxM and r⊥ ∈ (TxM)⊥ is the unique decomposition of r ∈ X into tangent and orthogonal components.\nBy Lemma 6, given x, y ∈ V , x is in the (one-to-one) Monge patch my of y. Let x′ ∈ TyM be the unique point such that my(x\n′) = x, and let r := (x′ − y)/‖x′ − y‖X . Since the domain of my is convex, the curve γy,r : [0, ‖x′ − y‖X ]→M given by\nγy,r(t) = y + tr +my(tr) = y + tr + 1\n2 t2IIy(r) + o(t 2)\nis well-defined, where the last equality follows from the smoothness of II. Clearly, γy,r(‖x′ − y‖X ) = x. For 0 ≤ t ≤ ‖x′ − y‖X the length of γy,r([0, t]) is\nL(γy,r([0, t])) = ∫ t 0 dτ‖ ˙γy,r(τ)‖X = ∫ t 0 dτ (‖r‖X +O(t)) = t · (1 + o(1)) (36)\n(where o(1) → 0 as t → 0.) This establishes the closeness of distances in TyM to geodesic distance on M. In particular, for any α > 0, y ∈ M, there is a sufficiently small geodesic neighborhood N 3 y such that, for x ∈ N , it holds\n‖x′ − y‖X ≤ ‖x− y‖X ≤ dI(x, y) ≤ (1 + λ)‖x′ − y‖X\nBy the smoothness of II, for y ∈M and x ∈ Ny(δy), with 0 < δy < ε, it is\nd2X (x, TyM) = d2X (γy,r(‖x′ − y‖X ), TyM) = ‖ 1\n2 IIy(r)‖x′ − y‖2X + o(‖x′ − y‖2X )‖2\n= ‖1 2 II∗y(x− y) + o(δ2y)‖2\nand therefore for any α > 0, there is a sufficiently small 0 < δy,α < ε such that, given any x ∈ Ny(δy,α), it is\nd2X (x, TyM) ≤ (1 + α)‖ 1 2 II∗y(x− y)‖2 (37)\nBy the smoothness of II, and the same argument as in Lemma 6, there is a continuous choice of 0 < δy,α, and therefore a minimum value 0 < δα ≤ δy,α, for y ∈M.\nSimilarly, by the smoothness of II∗, for any α > 0 and y ∈ M, there is a sufficiently small βy,α > 0 such that, for all x ∈ Ny(βy,α), it holds\n‖1 2 II∗y(y − x)‖2 ≤ (1 + α)‖ 1 2 II∗x(y − x)‖2 (38)\nBy the argument of Lemma 6, there is a continuous choice of 0 < βy,α, and therefore a minimum value 0 < βα ≤ βy,α, for y ∈M.\nFinally, let α = λ/4, and restrict 0 < λ < 1 (larger λ are simply less restrictive.) For each q ∈ M, let V = Nq(min{δα, βα}/2) 3 q be a sufficiently small geodesic neighborhood such that, for all x, y ∈ V , Eqs. 37 and 38 hold.\nSince α = λ/4 < 1/4, it is clearly (1 + α)2 ≤ (1 + λ), and therefore\nd2X (x, TyM) ≤ (1 + α)‖ 1 2 II∗y(y − x)‖2 ≤ (1 + α)2‖ 1 2 II∗x(y − x)‖2\n≤ (1 + λ)1 4 ‖y − x‖4|IIx|2 ≤ (1 + λ) 1 4 d4I (x, y)|IIx|2\n(39)\nwhere the second-to-last inequality follows from the definition of |II|.\nNote that the same argument as that of Lemma 5 can be used here, with the goal of making sure that, for sufficiently large k, every Voronoi region of each p ∈ Pk in the approximation satisfies Equation 35. We may now finish the proof by using a similar argument to that of the codimension-one case.\nLet λ > 0. Consider a discrete set Pk ⊂M of size k that minimizes\ng(Pk) = ∫ M dµI(x) 1 4 p(x)|IIx|2 min p∈Pk d4 I (x, p) (40)\nNote once again that the distance and measure in Equation 40 match and therefore, since p(x)|IIx|2/4 is continuous, we can apply Theorem 5 (with r = 4) in this case.\nLet Fk := ∪q∈PkTqM. By Lemma 7 and Lemma 5, adapted to this case, there is k′ such that for all k ≥ k′ it is\nEρ(Fk) = ∫ M dµ I (x) 1 4 p(x) min p∈Pk d2 X (x, TpM)\n≤ (1 + λ) ∫ M dµI(x) 1 4 p(x)|IIx|2 min p∈Pk d4 I (x, p)\nThm. 5,r=4\n≤ (1 + λ)C {∫ M dµ I (x) [ 1 4 p(x)|IIx|2 ]d/(d+4)}(d+4)/d · k−4/d\n(41)\nwhere the last line follows from the fact that Pk has been chosen to minimize Equation 40. Finally, by Hölder’s inequality, it is{∫\nM dµ I (x)\n[ 1\n4 p(x)|IIx|2 ]d/(d+4)}(d+4)/d ≤ {∫ M dµ I (x)p(x) }{∫ M dµ I (x) ( 1 4 |IIx‖2 )d/4}4/d = ‖1\n4 |II|2‖d/4\nand thus Eρ(Fk) ≤ (1 + λ)C · (κM/k)4/d\nwhere the total curvature κM := ∫ M dµ I (x) 1 4 |IIx|d/2 is the geometric invariant of the manifold (aside from the dimension) that controls the constant in the bound. Since α > 0 and λ > 0 are arbitrary, Lemma 3 follows.\nProofs of Theorems 3 and 4\nWe use the results discussed in Section A to obtain the proof of Theorem 3 as follows. The proof of Theorem 4 follows from the derivation in Section A, as well as the argument below, with κ1\nM substituted\nby κM , and is omitted in the interest of brevity.\nProof. By Lemmas 1 and 2, with probability 1− δ, it is\nEρ(Fn,k) ≤ 2n−1/2 ( k √ 2πd+ √ 1\n2 ln 1/δ\n) + C(κ1\nM /k)4/d\n≤ 2n−1/2k √ 2πd · √ 1\n2 ln 1/δ + C(κ1 M /k)4/d\n= 2 (8πd) 2/(d+4) Cd/(d+4) · n−2/(d+4) · √ 1\n2 ln 1/δ ·\n( κ1 M\n)4/(d+4) (42)\nwhere the last line follows from choosing k to balance the two summands of the second line, as:\nkn = n d 2(d+4) · ( C\n2 √ 2πd\n)d/(d+4) · ( κ1 M )4/(d+4)"

While the results for k-means are novel, some of the technical tools are well-established in the literature. In the case of k-flats, both the results and the mathematical tools are new.",
