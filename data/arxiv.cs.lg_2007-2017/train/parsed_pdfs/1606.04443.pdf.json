      "text" : "In this paper, we propose a general framework for classification of sparse and irregularly-sampled time series. An irregularly-sampled time series is a sequence of samples with irregular intervals between their observation times. These intervals can be large when the time series are also sparsely sampled. Such time series data are studied in various areas including climate science [22], ecology [4], biology [18], medicine [15] and astronomy [21]. Classification in this setting is challenging both because the data cases are not naturally defined in a fixed-dimensional feature space due to irregular sampling and variable numbers of samples, and because there can be substantial uncertainty about the underlying temporal processes due to the sparsity of observations.\nRecently, Li and Marlin [13] introduced the mixture of expected Gaussian kernels (MEG) framework, an uncertainty-aware kernel for classifying sparse and irregularly sampled time series. Classification with MEG kernels is shown to outperform models that ignore uncertainty due to sparse and irregular sampling. On the other hand, various deep learning models including convolutional neural networks [12] have been successfully applied to fields such as computer vision and natural language processing, and have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on various tasks. Some of these models have desirable properties for time series classification, but cannot be directly applied to sparse and irregularly sampled time series.\nInspired by the MEG kernel, we propose an uncertainty-aware classification framework that enables learning black-box classification models from sparse and irregularly sampled time series data. This framework is based on the use of a computational layer that we refer to as the Gaussian process (GP) adapter. The GP adapter uses Gaussian process regression to transform the irregular time series data into a uniform representation, allowing sparse and irregularly sampled data to be fed into any black-box classifier learnable using gradient descent while preserving uncertainty. However, the\n29th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2016), Barcelona, Spain.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n04 44\n3v 2\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n2 8\nO ct\nO(n3) time and O(n2) space of exact GP regression makes the GP adapter prohibitively expensive when scaling up to large time series.\nTo address this problem, we show how to speed up the key computation of sampling from a GP posterior based on combining the structured kernel interpolation (SKI) framework that was recently proposed by Wilson and Nickisch [25] with Lanczos methods for approximating matrix functions [3]. Using the proposed sampling algorithm, the GP adapter can run in linear time and space in terms of the length of the time series, and O(m logm) time when m inducing points are used. We also show that GP adapter can be trained end-to-end together with the parameters of the chosen classifier by backpropagation through the iterative Lanczos method. We present results using logistic regression, fully-connected feedforward networks, convolutional neural networks and the MEG kernel. We show that end-to-end discriminative training of the GP adapter outperforms a variety of baselines in terms of classification performance, including models based only on GP mean interpolation, or with GP regression trained separately using marginal likelihood."

      "text" : "Our focus in this paper is on time series classification in the presence of sparse and irregular sampling. In this problem, the data D contain N independent tuples consisting of a time series Si and a label yi. Thus, D = {(S1, y1), . . . , (SN , yN )}. Each time series Si is represented as a list of time points ti = [ti1, . . . , ti|Si|] >, and a list of corresponding values vi = [vi1, . . . , vi|Si|] >. We assume that each time series is observed over a common time interval [0, T ]. However, different time series are not necessarily observed at the same time points (i.e. ti 6= tj in general). This implies that the number of observations in different time series is not necessary the same (i.e. |Si| 6= |Sj | in general). Furthermore, the time intervals between observation within a single time series are not assumed to be uniform.\nLearning in this setting is challenging because the data cases are not naturally defined in a fixeddimensional feature space due to the irregular sampling. This means that commonly used classifiers that take fixed-length feature vectors as input are not applicable. In addition, there can be substantial uncertainty about the underlying temporal processes due to the sparsity of observations.\nTo address these challenges, we build on ideas from the MEG kernel [13] by using GP regression [17] to provide an uncertainty-aware representation of sparse and irregularly sampled time series. We fix a set of reference time points x = [x1, . . . , xd]> and represent a time series S = (t,v) in terms of its posterior marginal distribution at these time points. We use GP regression with a zero-mean GP prior and a covariance function k(·, ·) parameterized by kernel hyperparameters η. Let σ2 be the independent noise variance of the GP regression model. The GP parameters are θ = (η, σ2).\nUnder this model, the marginal posterior GP at x is Gaussian distributed with the mean and covariance given by\nµ = Kx,t(Kt,t + σ 2I)−1v, (1)\nΣ = Kx,x −Kx,t(Kt,t + σ2I)−1Kt,x (2)\nwhere Kx,t denotes the covariance matrix with [Kx,t]ij = k(xi, tj). We note that it takesO(n3+nd) time to exactly compute the posterior mean µ, and O(n3 + n2d+ nd2) time to exactly compute the full posterior covariance matrix Σ, where n = |t| and d = |x|."

      "text" : "In Section 2 we described how we can represent a time series through the marginal posterior it induces under a Gaussian process regression model at any set of reference time points x. By fixing a common\nset of reference time points x for all time series in a data set, every time series can be transformed into a common representation in the form of a multivariate Gaussian N (z|µ,Σ;θ) with z being the random vector distributed according to the posterior GP marginalized over the time points x.1 Here we assume that the GP parameters θ are shared across the entire data set.\nIf the z values were observed, we could simply apply a black-box classifier. A classifier can be generally defined by a mapping function f(z;w) parameterized by w, associated with a loss function `(f(z;w), y) where y is a label value from the output space Y . However, in our case z is a Gaussian random variable, which means `(f(z;w), y) is now itself a random variable given a label y. Therefore, we use the expectation Ez∼N (µ,Σ;θ) [ `(f(z;w), y) ] as the overall loss between the label y and a time series S given its Gaussian representation N (µ,Σ;θ). The learning problem becomes minimizing the expected loss over the entire data set:\nw∗,θ∗ = argmin w,θ N∑ i=1 Ezi∼N (µi,Σi;θ) [ `(f(zi;w), yi) ] . (3)\nOnce we have the optimal parameters w∗ and θ∗, we can make predictions on unseen data. In general, given an unseen time series S and its Gaussian representation N (µ,Σ;θ∗), we can predict its label using (4), although in many cases this can be simplified into a function of f(z;w∗) with the expectation taken on or inside of f(z;w∗).\ny∗ = argmin y∈Y\nEz∼N (µ,Σ;θ∗) [ `(f(z;w∗), y) ] (4)\nWe name the above approach the Uncertainty-Aware Classification (UAC) framework. Importantly, this framework propagates the uncertainty in the GP posterior induced by each time series all the way through to the loss function. Besides, we call the transformation S 7→ (µ,Σ) the Gaussian process adapter, since it provides a uniform representation to connect the raw irregularly sampled time series data to a black-box classifier.\nVariations of the UAC framework can be derived by taking the expectation at various position of f(z;w) where z ∼ N (µ,Σ;θ). Taking the expectation at an earlier stage simplifies the computation, but the uncertainty information will be integrated out earlier as well.2 In the extreme case, if the expectation is computed immediately followed by the GP adapter transformation, it is equivalent to using a plug-in estimate µ for z in the loss function, `(f(Ez∼N (µ,Σ;θ)[z];w), y) = `(f(µ;w), y). We refer to this as the IMPutation (IMP) framework. The IMP framework discards the uncertainty information completely, which further simplifies the computation. This simplified variation may be useful when the time series are more densely sampled, where the uncertainty is less of a concern.\nIn practice, we can train the model using the UAC objective (3) and predict instead by IMP. In that case, the predictions would be deterministic and can be computed efficiently without drawing samples from the posterior GP as described later in Section 4."

In this paper, we use stochastic gradient descent to scalably optimize (3) by updating the model using a single time series at a time, although it can be easily modified for batch or mini-batch updates. From now on, we will focus on the optimization problem minw,θ Ez∼N (µ,Σ;θ) [ `(f(z;w), y) ] where µ,Σ are the output of the GP adapter given a time series S = (t,v) and its label y. For many classifiers, the expected loss Ez∼N (µ,Σ;θ) [ `(f(z;w), y) ] cannot be analytically computed. In such cases, we use the Monte Carlo average to approximate the expected loss:\nEz∼N (µ,Σ;θ) [ `(f(z;w), y) ] ≈ 1 S S∑ s=1 `(f(zs;w), y), where zs ∼ N (µ,Σ;θ).

Besides, they are also functions of S = (t,v) as shown in (1) and (2).\n2 For example, the loss of the expected output of the classifier `(Ez∼N (µ,Σ;θ)[f(z;w)], y).\nTo achieve this, we reparameterize the Gaussian random variable using the identity z = µ + Rξ where ξ ∼ N (0, I) and R satisfies Σ = RR> [11]. The gradients under this reparameterization are given below, both of which can be approximated using Monte Carlo sampling as in (5).

One common choice of R is the Cholesky factor, a lower triangular matrix, which can be computed using Cholesky decomposition in O(d3) for a d× d covariance matrix Σ [7]. We instead use the symmetric matrix square root R = Σ1/2. We will show that this particular choice of R leads to an efficient and scalable approximation algorithm in Section 4.2."

      "text" : "The main idea of the structured kernel interpolation (SKI) framework recently proposed by Wilson and Nickisch [25] is to approximate a stationary kernel matrix Ka,b by the approximate kernel K̃a,b defined below where u = [u1, . . . , um]> is a collection of evenly-spaced inducing points.\nKa,b ≈ K̃a,b = WaKu,uW>b . (8)\nLetting p = |a| and q = |b|, Wa ∈ Rp×m is a sparse interpolation matrix where each row contains only a small number of non-zero entries. We use local cubic convolution interpolation (cubic interpolation for short) [10] as suggested in Wilson and Nickisch [25]. Each row of the interpolation matrices Wa,Wb has at most four non-zero entries. Wilson and Nickisch [25] showed that when the kernel is locally smooth (under the resolution of u), cubic interpolation results in accurate approximation. This can be justified as follows: with cubic interpolation, the SKI kernel is essentially the two-dimensional cubic interpolation of Ka,b using the exact regularly spaced samples stored in Ku,u, which corresponds to classical bicubic convolution. In fact, we can show that K̃a,b asymptotically converges to Ka,b as m increases by following the derivation in Keys [10].\nPlugging the SKI kernel into (1), the posterior GP mean evaluated at x can be approximated by\nµ = Kx,t ( Kt,t + σ 2I )−1 v ≈WxKu,uW>t ( WtK −1 u,uW > t + σ 2I )−1 v. (9)\nThe inducing points u are chosen to be evenly-spaced because Ku,u forms a symmetric Toeplitz matrix under a stationary covariance function. A symmetric Toeplitz matrix can be embedded into a circulant matrix to perform matrix vector multiplication using fast Fourier transforms [7].\nFurther, one can use the conjugate gradient method to solve for (WtK−1u,uW > t +σ 2I)−1v which only involves computing the matrix-vector product (WtK−1u,uW > t + σ\n2I)v. In practice, the conjugate gradient method converges within only a few iterations. Therefore, approximating the posterior mean µ using SKI takes onlyO(n+d+m logm) time to compute. In addition, since a symmetric Toeplitz matrix Ku,u can be uniquely characterized by its first column, and Wt can be stored as a sparse matrix, approximating µ requires only O(n+ d+m) space.\nAlgorithm 1: Lanczos method for approximating Σ1/2ξ Input: covariance matrix Σ, dimension of the Krylov subspace k, random vector ξ β1 = 0 and d0 = 0 d1 = ξ/‖ξ‖ for j = 1 to k do\nd = Σdj − βjdj−1 αj = d > j d d = d− αjdj βj+1 = ‖d‖ dj+1 = d/βj+1\nD = [d1, . . . ,dk] H = tridiagonal(β,α,β) return ‖ξ‖DH1/2e1 // e1 = [1, 0, . . . , 0]>\nH = tridiagonal(β,α,β) =  α1 β2 β2 α2 β3 β3 α3 . . .\n. . . . . . βk βk αk\n"

      "text" : "With the SKI techniques, although we can efficiently approximate the posterior mean µ, computing Σ\n1/2ξ is still challenging. If computed exactly, it takes O(n3 + n2d+ nd2) time to compute Σ and O(d3) time to take the square root. To overcome the bottleneck, we apply the SKI kernel to the Lanczos method, one of the Krylov subspace approximation methods, to speed up the computation of Σ1/2ξ as shown in Algorithm 1. The advantage of the Lanczos method is that neither Σ nor Σ1/2 needs to be computed explicitly. Like the conjugate gradient method, another example of the Krylov subspace method, it only requires the computation of matrix-vector products with Σ as the matrix.\nThe idea of the Lanczos method is to approximate Σ1/2ξ in the Krylov subspace Kk(Σ, ξ) = span{ξ,Σξ, . . . ,Σk−1ξ}. The iteration in Algorithm 1, usually referred to the Lanczos process, essentially performs the Gram-Schmidt process to transform the basis {ξ,Σξ, . . . ,Σk−1ξ} into an orthonormal basis {d1, . . . ,dk} for the subspace Kk(Σ, ξ).\nThe optimal approximation of Σ1/2ξ in the Krylov subspace Kk(Σ, ξ) that minimizes the `2-norm of the error is the orthogonal projection of Σ1/2ξ onto Kk(Σ, ξ) as y∗ = DD>Σ\n1/2ξ. Since we choose d1 = ξ/‖ξ‖, the optimal projection can be written as y∗ = ‖ξ‖DD>Σ\n1/2De1 where e1 = [1, 0, . . . , 0] > is the first column of the identify matrix.\nOne can show that the tridiagonal matrix H defined in Algorithm 1 satisfies D>ΣD = H [20]. Also, we have D>Σ1/2D ≈ (D>ΣD)1/2 since the eigenvalues of H approximate the extremal eigenvalues of Σ [19]. Therefore we have y∗ = ‖ξ‖DD>Σ1/2De1 ≈ ‖ξ‖DH1/2e1. The error bound of the Lanczos method is analyzed in Ilić et al. [9]. Alternatively one can show that the Lanczos approximation converges superlinearly [16]. In practice, for a d× d covariance matrix Σ, the approximation is sufficient for our sampling purpose with k d. As H is now a k× k matrix, we can use any standard method to compute its square root in O(k3) time [2], which is considered O(1) when k is chosen to be a small constant. Now the computation of the Lanczos method for approximating Σ1/2ξ is dominated by the matrix-vector product Σd during the Lanczos process.\nHere we apply the SKI kernel trick again to efficiently approximate Σd by\nΣd ≈WxKu,uW>x d−WxKu,uW>t ( WtKu,uW > t + σ 2I )−1 WtKu,uW > x d. (10)\nSimilar to the posterior mean, Σd can be approximated inO(n+d+m logm) time and linear space. Therefore, for k = O(1) basis vectors, the entire Algorithm 1 takes O(n+ d+m logm) time and O(n+ d+m) space, which is also the complexity to draw a sample from the posterior GP. To reduce the variance when estimating the expected loss (5), we can draw multiple samples from the posterior GP: {Σ1/2ξs}s=1,...,S where ξs ∼ N (0, I). Since all of the samples are associated with the same covariance matrix Σ, we can use the block Lanczos process [8], an extension to the single-vector Lanczos method presented in Algorithm 1, to simultaneously approximate Σ1/2Ξ for all S random\nvectors Ξ = [ξ1, . . . , ξS ]. Similarly, during the block Lanczos process, we use the block conjugate gradient method [6, 5] to simultaneously solve the linear equation (WtKu,uW>t + σ\n2I)−1α for multiple α."

(11)\nIf we follow this criterion, training the UAC framework becomes a two-stage procedure: first we learn GP parameters by maximizing the marginal likelihood. We then compute µ and Σ given each time series S and the learned GP parameters θ∗. Both µ and Σ are then fixed and used to train the classifier using (6).\nIn this section, we describe how to instead train the GP parameters discriminatively end-to-end using backpropagation. As mentioned in Section 3, we train the UAC framework by jointly optimizing the GP parameters θ and the parameters of the classifier w according to (6) and (7).\nThe most challenging part in (7) is to compute ∂z = ∂µ + ∂(Σ1/2ξ).3 For ∂µ, we can derive the gradient of the approximating posterior mean (9) as given in Appendix A. Note that the gradient ∂µ can be approximated efficiently by repeatedly applying fast Fourier transforms and the conjugate gradient method in the same time and space complexity as computing (9).\nOn the other hand, ∂(Σ1/2ξ) can be approximated by backpropagating through the Lanczos method described in Algorithm 1. To carry out backpropagation, all operations in the Lanczos method must be differentiable. For the approximation of Σd during the Lanczos process, we can similarly compute the gradient of (10) efficiently using the SKI techniques as in computing ∂µ (see Appendix A).\nThe gradient ∂H1/2 for the last step of Algorithm 1 can be derived as follows. From H = H1/2H1/2, we have ∂H = (∂H1/2)H1/2 + H1/2(∂H1/2). This is known as the Sylvester equation, which has the form of AX + XB = C where A,B,C are matrices and X is the unknown matrix to solve for. We can compute the gradient ∂H1/2 by solving the Sylvester equation using the Bartels-Stewart algorithm [1] in O(k3) time for a k × k matrix H, which is considered O(1) for a small constant k. Overall, training the GP adapter using stochastic optimization with the aforementioned approach takes O(n+ d+m logm) time and O(n+ d+m) space for m inducing points, n observations in the time series, and d features generated by the GP adapter."

However, by exploiting the spectral property of Gaussian kernels, the expected random feature of the MEG kernel is shown to be analytically computable by√ 2/m exp(−w>i Σwi/2) cos(w>i µ+ bi).

      "text" : "The key to scalable learning with the GP adapter relies on both fast and accurate approximation for drawing samples from the posterior GP. To assess the approximation quality, we first generate a synthetic sparse and irregularly-sampled time series S by sampling from a zero-mean Gaussian process at random time points. We use the squared exponential kernel k(ti, tj) = a exp(−b(ti− tj)2) with randomly chosen hyperparameters. We then infer µ and Σ at some reference x given S. Let z̃ denote our approximation of z = µ+ Σ1/2ξ. In this experiment, we set the output size z to be |S|, that is, d = n. We evaluate the approximation quality by assessing the error ‖z̃− z‖ computed with a fixed random vector ξ.\nThe leftmost plot in Figure 1 shows the approximation error under different numbers of inducing points m with k = 10 Lanczos iterations. The middle plot compares the approximation error as the number of Lanczos iterations k varies, with m = 256 inducing points. These two plots show that the approximation error drops as more inducing points and Lanczos iterations are used. In both plots, the three lines correspond to different sizes for z: 1000 (bottom line), 2000 (middle line), 3000 (top line). The separation between the curves is due to the fact that the errors are compared under the same number of inducing points. Longer time series leads to lower resolution of the inducing points and hence the higher approximation error.\nNote that the approximation error comes from both the cubic interpolation and the Lanczos method. Therefore, to achieve a certain normalized approximation error across different data sizes, we should simultaneously use more inducing points and Lanczos iterations as the data grows. In practice, we find that k ≥ 3 is sufficient for estimating the expected loss for classification. The rightmost plot in Figure 1 compares the time to draw a sample using exact computation versus the approximation method described in Section 4 (exact and Lanczos in the figure). We also compare the time to compute the gradient with respect to the GP parameters by both the exact method and the proposed approximation (exact BP and Lanczos BP in the figure) because this is the actual computation carried out during training. In this part of the experiment, we use k = 10 and m = 256. The plot shows that Lanczos approximation with the SKI kernel yields speed-ups of between 1 and 3 orders of magnitude. Interestingly, for the exact approach, the time for computing the gradient roughly doubles the time of drawing samples. (Note that time is plotted in log scale.) This is because computing gradients requires both forward and backward propagation, whereas drawing samples corresponds to only the forward pass. Both the forward and backward passes take roughly the same computation in the exact case. However, the gap is relatively larger for the approximation approach due to the recursive relationship of the variables in the Lanczos process. In particular, dj is defined recursively in terms of all of d1, . . . ,dj−1, which makes the backpropagation computation more complicated than the forward pass."

If spline interpolation is used to construct the SKI kernel K̃a,b, the interpolation matrix Wa depends not only on a and u but also on the kernel Ku,u, which depends on the GP parameters θ. As a result, the gradient ∂Wa/∂θ needs to be computed and thus introduces a huge overhead in backpropagation. On the other hand, the interpolation matrix based on the cubic convolution interpolation depends only on a and u, which are fixed once the data are given. Therefore, with cubic convolution interpolation, both Wa and Wb are constant matrices throughout the entire training process."
