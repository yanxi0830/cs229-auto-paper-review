      "text" : "Learning a distribution from data is a fundamental problem in statistics and computer science, and has numerous applications in machine learning and signal processing. The problem can be stated as:\nGiven an iid sample generated from an unknown probability distribution g, find a distribution ĝ that is close to g in total variation distance.1\nThis strong notion of learning is not possible in general using a finite number of samples. However, if we assume that the target distribution belongs to or can be approximated by a family of distributions, then there is hope to acquire algorithms with finite-sample guarantees. In this paper, we study the important class of mixture models in this framework.\n1. Total variation distance is a prominent distance measure between distributions. For a discussion on this and other choices see (Devroye and Lugosi, 2001, Chapter 5).\nNotice that we consider PAC learning of distributions (a.k.a. density estimation), which is different from parameter estimation. In the parameter estimation problem, it is assumed that the target distribution belongs to some parametric class, and the goal is to learn/identify the parameters (see, e.g., Dasgupta (1999); Belkin and Sinha (2010); Moitra and Valiant (2010)).\nAs an example of our setting, assume that the target distribution is a Gaussian mixture with k components in Rd. Then, how many examples do we need to find a distribution that is ǫ-close to the target? This sample complexity question, as well as the corresponding computational complexity question, has received a lot of attention recently (see, e.g. Feldman et al. (2006); Chan et al. (2014); Suresh et al. (2014); Diakonikolas et al. (2016, 2017); Acharya et al. (2017)).\nIn this paper, we consider a scenario in which we are given a method for learning a class of distributions (e.g., Gaussians). Then, we ask whether we can use it, as a black box, to come up with an algorithm for learning a mixture of such distributions (e.g., mixture of Gaussians). We will show that the answer to this question is affirmative.\nWe propose a generic method for learning mixture models. Roughly speaking, we show that by going from learning a single distribution from a class to learning a mixture of k distributions from the same class, the sample complexity is multiplied by a factor of at most (k log2 k)/ǫ2. This result is general, and yet it is surprisingly tight in many important cases.\nAs a demonstration, we show that our method provides a better sample complexity for learning mixtures of Gaussians than the state of the art. In particular, for learning mixtures of k Gaussians in Rd, our method requires Õ(d2k/ǫ4) samples, improving by a factor of k2 over the Õ(d2k3/ǫ4) bound of Diakonikolas et al. (2017). Furthermore, for the special case of axis-aligned Gaussian, we provide an upper bound of Õ(dk/ǫ4), which is the first optimal bound with respect to k and d, and improves upon the Õ(dk9/ǫ4) bound of Suresh et al. (2014), which is only shown for the subclass of spherical Gaussians.\nOne merit of our approach is that it can be applied in the agnostic (a.k.a. robust) setting, where the target distribution does not necessarily belong to the mixture model of choice. Interestingly, to guarantee such a result, we do not need to assume that the black box works in the agnostic setting. For example, a learning method that works for the Gaussians in the realizable setting can be lifted to a method for learning Gaussian mixtures in the agnostic setting.\nThe main drawback of our approach is its computational complexity: if m is the sample complexity, then our running time is O(mkm), i.e. exponential in the parameters. However, it is applicable in situations where computational power is extensive but training data is scarce. Moreover, recently there have been some work suggesting there is not much hope for efficient learning of, for example, mixtures of Gaussians, using statistical query algorithms (see Diakonikolas et al. (2017))."

      "text" : "PAC learning of distributions was introduced by Kearns et al. (1994), we refer the reader to Diakonikolas (2016) for a recent survey. A closely related line of research in statistics (in which more emphasis is on sample complexity) is density estimation, for which the book by Devroye and Lugosi (2001) is an excellent resource.\nOne approach to density estimation of GMMs is by studying the VC-dimension of their epigraphs and applying results such as Theorem 18 to obtain bounds on sample complexity (These VC-dimensions have mainly been studied for the purpose of proving generalization bounds for neural networks with sigmoid activation functions). In particular, the VCdimension bound of (Anthony and Bartlett, 1999, Theorem 8.14) – which is based on the work of Karpinski and Macintyre (1997) – implies a sample complexity upper bound of O((k4d2 + k3d3)/ε2) for PAC learning mixtures of axis-aligned Gaussians, and an upper bound of O(k4d4/ε2) for PAC learning mixtures of general Gaussians (both results hold in the more general agnostic setting).\nA sample complexity upper bound of O(d2k3 log2 k/ε4) for learning mixtures of Gaussians in the realizable setting was proved in (Diakonikolas et al., 2017, Theorem A.1). Our algorithm is motivated by theirs, but we have introduced several new ideas in the algorithm and in the analysis, which has resulted in improving the sample complexity bound by a factor of k2 and an algorithm that works in the more general agnostic setting.\nFor mixtures of spherical Gaussians, a polynomial time algorithm for the realizable setting with sample complexity O(dk9 log2(d)/ε4) was proposed in (Suresh et al., 2014, Theorem 11). We improve their sample complexity by a factor of Õ(k8), and moreover our algorithm works in the agnostic setting, too. In the special case of d = 1, a polynomial time algorithm with the optimal sample complexity of Õ(k/ε2) was proved in Chan et al. (2014).\nAn important question, which we do not address in this paper, is finding polynomial time algorithms for learning distributions. See Diakonikolas et al. (2017) for the state-of-the-art results on computational complexity of learning mixtures of Gaussians. Another important setting is computational complexity in the agnostic learning, see, e.g., Diakonikolas et al. (2016) for some positive results.\nA related line of research is parameter estimation for mixtures of Gaussians, see, e.g., Dasgupta (1999); Belkin and Sinha (2010); Moitra and Valiant (2010)), who gave polynomial time algorithms for this problem assuming certain separability assumptions. Recall that parameter estimation is a more difficult problem and it can be proved that any algorithm for parame-\nter estimation requires some separability assumptions for the target Gaussians, whereas for density estimation no such assumptions are needed.\nWe finally remark that characterizing the sample complexity of learning a class of distributions in general is an open problem, even for the realizable (i.e., non-agnostic) case (see (Diakonikolas, 2016, Open Problem 15.1))."

Does this mean that we can PAC-learn Fk? And if so, what is the sample complexity of this task? Our main theorem gives an affirmative answer to the first question, and provides a bound for sample complexity of learning Fk.\nTheorem 5 Assume that F can be learned in the realizable setting with sample complexity mF (ǫ, δ) = λ(F , δ)/ǫ\nα for some α ≥ 1 and some function λ(F , δ) = Ω(ln(1/δ)). Then the class Fk can be learned in the agnostic setting with\nm3Fk(ǫ, δ) = O\n( λ(F , δ/3k)k log k\nǫα+2\n) = O ( k log k ·mF (ε, δ/3k)\nǫ2\n)\nsamples.\nSome remarks:\n1. Note that learning in agnostic setting is harder than learning in the realizable setting. Thus our algorithm requires a weak learner for class F , and provides a strong learner for class Fk.\n2. Our mixture learning algorithm has the property that, if the F-learner is proper, then the Fk-learner is proper as well.\n3. The computational complexity of the resulting algorithm is exponential in the number of required samples.\n4. The condition λ(F , δ) = Ω(ln(1/δ)) is a technical condition that holds for all interesting classes F .\n5. One may wonder about tightness of this theorem. In Section 4.1 we will see that if F\nis the class of spherical Gaussians, we have m O(1)\nFk (ǫ, δ) = Ω(kmF (ε, δ/k)), therefore\nthe factor of k is necessary in general. However, it is not clear whether the additional factor of log k/ε2 in the theorem is tight.\nIn the rest of this section we prove Theorem 5. Let g be the distribution to be learned, and let\ng∗ = argmin f∈Fk ‖g − f‖1 and ρ = ‖g ∗ − g‖1 = OPT (F k, g) .\nIn the following we will assume ρ ≤ 2/3, since if ρ > 2/3, then any arbitrary distribution f would be a (0, 3)-approximation for g. Since g∗ ∈ Fk, we can write\ng∗ = ∑\nwiGi\nwith (w1, . . . , wk) ∈ ∆k and each Gi ∈ F . Since the total variation distance between g and g∗ is ρ/2, there exists a coupling (X,X∗) such that X has law g, X∗ has law g∗, and Pr[X = X∗] ≥ 1− ρ/2 (see, e.g., (Levin et al., 2009, Proposition 4.7)). Thus, we can write\ng = (1− ρ/2)g∗ + (ρ/2)N = ∑\n(1− ρ/2)wiGi + (ρ/2)N ,\nwhere N is some unknown, unstructured distribution (i.e., the noise). We will view g as a mixture of k + 1 distributions G1, G2, . . . , Gk, N .\nFor proving Theorem 5 we will use the following theorem on learning finite classes of distributions, which immediately follows from (Devroye and Lugosi, 2001, Theorem 6.3) and a standard Chernoff bound.\nTheorem 6 Suppose we are given M candidate distributions f1, . . . , fM and we have access to iid samples from an unknown distribution g. Then there exists an algorithm that given the fi’s and ε > 0, takes log(3M\n2/δ)/2ε2 samples from g, and with probability ≥ 1 − δ/3 outputs an index j ∈ [M ] such that\n‖fj − g‖1 ≤ 3 min i∈[M ] ‖fi − g‖1 + 4ε .\nWe now describe an algorithm that with probability ≥ 1− δ outputs a distribution with ℓ1 distance 13ε+3ρ to g (the error parameter is 13ε instead of ε just for convenience of the proof; it is clear that this does not change the order of magnitude of sample complexity). The algorithm, whose pseudocode is shown in Figure 1, has two main steps. In the first step we generate a set of candidate distributions, such that at least one of them is (3ε+ ρ)-close to g in ℓ1 distance. These candidates are of the form ∑ ŵiĜi, where the Ĝi’s are extracted from samples and are estimates for the real components Gi, and the ŵi’s come from a fixed discretization of ∆k, and are estimates for the real mixing weights wi. In the second step we use Theorem 6 to obtain a distribution that is (13ε+ 3ρ)-close to g.\nWe start with describing the first step. We take\ns = max\n{ 3kλ(F , δ/3k)\nεα , 24k ln(δ/3k) ε\n} ≥ max { 2kλ(F , δ/3k)\n(1− ρ/2)εα , 16k ln(δ/3k) ε(1 − ρ/2)\n} (1)\niid samples from g. Let S denote the set of generated points. Note that λ(F , δ) = Ω(ln(1/δ)) implies\ns = O(kλ(F , δ/3k) × ǫ−α).\nLet Ŵ be an ε/k-cover for ∆k in ℓ∞ distance of cardinality (k/ε+1) k. That is, for any x ∈ ∆k there exists w ∈ Ŵ such that ‖w−x‖∞ ≤ ε/k. This can be obtained from a grid in [0, 1]k of length ε/k, which is an ε/k-cover for [0, 1]k , and projecting each of its points onto ∆k.\nBy an assignment we mean a function A : S → [k + 1]. The role of an assignment is to “guess” each sample point is coming from which component, by mapping them to the correct index, and mapping the sample points coming from N to the (dummy) index\nk+1. For each pair (A, (ŵ1, . . . , ŵk)), where A is an assignment and (ŵ1, . . . , ŵk) ∈ Ŵ , we generate a candidate distribution as follows: let A−1(i) ⊆ S be those sample points that are assigned to component i. For each i ∈ [k], we provide the set A−1(i) of samples to our F-learner, and the learner provides us with a distribution Ĝi. We add the distribution∑\ni∈[k] ŵiĜi to the set of candidate distributions.\nLemma 7 With probability ≥ 1−2δ/3, at least one of the generated candidate distributions is (3ε+ ρ)-close to g.\nBefore proving the lemma, we show that it implies our main result, Theorem 5. By the lemma, we obtain a set of candidates such that at least one of them is (3ε + ρ)-close to g. This step takes s = O(kλ(F , δ/3k) × ǫ−α) many samples. Then, we apply Theorem 6 to output one of those candidates that is (13ε+3ρ)-close to g, therefore using log(3M2/δ)/2ε2 additional samples. Note that the number of generated candidate distributions is M = (k + 1)s × (1 + k/ε)k. Hence, in the second step of our algorithm, we take\nlog(3M2/δ)/2ε2 = O( λ(F , δ/3k)k log k\nǫα+2 ) = O(\nmF (ε, δ/3k)k log k\nǫ2 )\nadditional samples, completing the proof.\nWe now prove Lemma 7. We will use the following concentration inequality, which holds for any binomial random variable X (see (Mitzenmacher and Upfal, 2005, Theorem 4.5(2))):\nPr{X < EX/2} ≤ exp(−EX/8) . (2)\nSay a component i is negligible if\nwi ≤ 8 ln(δ/3k)\ns(1− ρ/2)\nLet L ⊆ [k] denote the set of negligible components. Let i be a non-negligible component. Note that, the number of points coming from component i is binomial with parameters (1− ρ/2)s and wi and thus has mean (1− ρ/2)swi, so (2) implies that, with probability at least 1−δ/3k, S contains at least (1−ρ/2)wis/2 points from i. Since we have k components in total, the union bound implies that, with probability at least 1 − δ/3, uniformly for all i /∈ L, S contains at least (1− ρ/2)wis/2 points from component i.\nNow consider the pair (A, (ŵ1, . . . , ŵk)) such that A assigns samples to their correct indices, and assigns the noise samples to k + 1, and has the property that |ŵi − wi| ≤ ε/k for all i ∈ [k]. We claim that the resulting candidate distribution is (3ε + ρ)-close to g.\nLet Ĝ1, . . . , Ĝk be the distributions provided by the learner. For each i ∈ [k] define\nεi :=\n( 2λ(F , δ/3k)\n(1− ρ/2)wis\n)1/α\nFor any i /∈ [L], since there exists at least (1 − ρ/2)wis/2 samples for component i, and since\n(1− ρ/2)wis/2 = λ(F , δ/3k)ε −α i = mF (εi, δ/3k) ,\nwe are guaranteed that ‖Ĝi−Gi‖1 ≤ εi with probability 1−δ/3k. Therefore, ‖Ĝi−Gi‖1 ≤ εi holds uniformly over all i /∈ L, with probability ≥ 1 − δ/3. Note that since α ≥ 1, the function w 1−1/α i is concave in wi, so by Jensen’s inequality we have\n∑ w\n1−1/α i ≤ k\n( ( ∑ wi/k) 1−1/α ) = k1/α ,\nhence ∑\ni/∈L\nwiεi =\n( 2λ(F , δ/3k)\n(1− ρ/2)s\n)1/α ∑\ni/∈L\nw 1−1/α i ≤\n( 2kλ(F , δ/3k)\n(1− ρ/2)s\n)1/α\nProving the lemma is now a matter of careful applications of the triangle inequality:\n‖ ∑\ni\nŵiĜi − g‖1 = ‖ ∑\ni\nŵiĜi − ∑\ni\n(1− ρ/2)wiGi − (ρ/2)N‖1\n≤ ‖ ∑\ni\n(ŵiĜi − wiGi)‖1 + ρ/2‖ ∑\ni∈[k]\nwiGi +N‖1\n≤ ‖ ∑ wi(Ĝi −Gi)‖1 + ‖ ∑\ni\n(ŵi − wi)Ĝi‖1 + ρ/2(1 + 1)\n≤ ‖ ∑\ni∈L\nwi(Ĝi −Gi)‖1 + ‖ ∑\ni/∈L\nwi(Ĝi −Gi)‖1 + ∑\ni\n|ŵi − wi|‖Ĝi‖1 + ρ\n≤ 2 ∑\ni∈L\nwi + ∑\ni/∈L\nwiεi + ∑\ni\nε/k × 1 + ρ\n≤ 2k × 8 ln(δ/3k)\ns(1− ρ/2) +\n( 2kλ(F , δ/3k)\n(1− ρ/2)s\n)1/α + ε+ ρ\n≤ ε+ ε+ ε+ ρ ,\nwhere for the last inequality we used the definition of s in (1).

In particular, in the realizable setting p ∈ F , we have\n‖p − LF (S)‖TV ≤ α\n√ v + log 1δ\nm\nProof Let q∗ = argminq∈F ‖p−q‖TV , so ‖q ∗−p‖A ≤ ‖q ∗−p‖TV = OPT (F , p). By Lemma 15,\nwith probability ≥ 1−δ we have ‖p− p̂S‖A ≤ α √ (v + log 1δ )/m for some universal constant α. Also, since LF (S) is the empirical minimizer of the A-distance, we have ‖LF (S)−p̂S‖A ≤ ‖q∗ − p̂S‖A. The proof follows from multiple applications of the triangle inequality:\n‖p− LF (S)‖TV ≤ ‖L F (S)− q∗‖TV + ‖q ∗ − p‖TV\n= ‖LF (S)− q∗‖A +OPT (F , p) ≤ ‖LF (S)− p̂S‖A + ‖p̂S − q ∗‖A +OPT (F , p) ≤ ‖q∗ − p̂S‖A + (‖p̂S − p‖A + ‖p − q ∗‖A) +OPT (F , p) ≤ (‖q∗ − p‖A + ‖p− p̂S‖A) + ‖p− p̂S‖A + 2OPT (F , p) ≤ ‖q∗ − p‖TV + 2‖p − p̂S‖A + 2OPT (F , p)\n≤ 2α\n√ v + log 1δ\nm + 3OPT (F , p) .\nTheorem 18 provides a tool for proving upper bounds on the sample complexity of distribution learning. To prove Theorems 11 and 8, it remains to show upper bounds on the VC dimensions of the class of epigraphs of (axis-aligned) Gaussian pdfs.\nThe following result is well known in statistical learning theory, see, e.g., (Devroye and Lugosi, 2001, Lemma 4.2).\nTheorem 19 (Dudley) Let F be an n-dimensional vector space of real-valued functions. Then V C(EPI(F)) ≤ n.\nNow let h be an indicator function for an arbitrary element in EPI(f1 − f2), where f1, f2 are pdfs of (axis-aligned) Gaussians. Then h is a {0, 1}-valued function and we have:\nh(x) = 1{N (µ1,Σ1) > N (µ2,Σ2)}\n= 1{α1 exp( −1\n2 (x− µ1)\nTΣ−11 (x− µ1)) > α2 exp( −1\n2 (x− µ2)\nTΣ−12 (x− µ2))}\n= 1{(x− µ1) TΣ−11 (x− µ1)− (x− µ2) TΣ−12 (x− µ2)− log α2 α1 > 0} .\nThe inner expression is a quadratic form, and the linear dimension of all quadratic functions is O(d2). Furthermore, for axis-aligned Gaussians, Σ1 and Σ2 are diagonal, and therefore, the inner function lies in an O(d)-dimensional space of functions spanned by {1, x1, . . . , xd, x 2 1, . . . , x 2 d}. Hence, by Dudley’s theorem, we have the required upper bound (d or d2) on the VC-dimension of the classes of epigraphs. Finally, Theorems 11 and 8 follow from applying Theorem 18 to the class of (axis-aligned) Gaussian distributions."

We will show that the answer to this question is affirmative. We propose a generic method for learning mixture models.

As a demonstration, we show that our method provides a better sample complexity for learning mixtures of Gaussians than the state of the art. In particular, for learning mixtures of k Gaussians in Rd, our method requires Õ(d2k/ǫ4) samples, improving by a factor of k2 over the Õ(d2k3/ǫ4) bound of Diakonikolas et al. (2017).

One merit of our approach is that it can be applied in the agnostic (a.k.a. robust) setting, where the target distribution does not necessarily belong to the mixture model of choice. Interestingly, to guarantee such a result, we do not need to assume that the black box works in the agnostic setting. For example, a learning method that works for the Gaussians in the realizable setting can be lifted to a method for learning Gaussian mixtures in the agnostic setting. The main drawback of our approach is its computational complexity: if m is the sample complexity, then our running time is O(mkm), i.e. exponential in the parameters. However, it is applicable in situations where computational power is extensive but training data is scarce. Moreover, recently there have been some work suggesting there is not much hope for efficient learning of, for example, mixtures of Gaussians, using statistical query algorithms (see Diakonikolas et al.

We improve their sample complexity by a factor of Õ(k8), and moreover our algorithm works in the agnostic setting, too. In the special case of d = 1, a polynomial time algorithm with the optimal sample complexity of Õ(k/ε2) was proved in Chan et al. (2014). An important question, which we do not address in this paper, is finding polynomial time algorithms for learning distributions. See Diakonikolas et al. (2017) for the state-of-the-art results on computational complexity of learning mixtures of Gaussians. Another important setting is computational complexity in the agnostic learning, see, e.g., Diakonikolas et al. (2016) for some positive results. A related line of research is parameter estimation for mixtures of Gaussians, see, e.g., Dasgupta (1999); Belkin and Sinha (2010); Moitra and Valiant (2010)), who gave polynomial time algorithms for this problem assuming certain separability assumptions.",

Let F be an arbitrary class of probability distributions, and let F denote the class of k-mixtures of elements of F . Assuming the existence of a method for learning F with sample complexity mF (ǫ) in the realizable setting, we provide a method for learningF with sample complexity O(k log k ·mF(ε)/ǫ2) in the agnostic setting. Our mixture learning algorithm has the property that, if the F -learner is proper, then the F-learner is proper as well. We provide two applications of our main result. First, we show that the class of mixtures of k axis-aligned Gaussians in R is PAC-learnable in the agnostic setting with sample complexity Õ(kd/ǫ), which is tight in k and d. Second, we show that the class of mixtures of k Gaussians in R is PAC-learnable in the agnostic setting with sample complexity Õ(kd/ǫ), which improves the previous known bounds of Õ(kd/ǫ) and Õ(kd/ǫ) in its dependence on k and d.",
