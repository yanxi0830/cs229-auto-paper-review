      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has been an active research field for over a decade [4]. The fundamental philosophy of MTL is to simultaneously train several related tasks with shared information, so that the hope is to improve the generalization performance of each task by the assistance of other tasks. More formally, in a typical MTL setting with T tasks, we want to choose T functions f = (f1, · · · , fT ) from a Hypothesis Space (HS) F = {x 7→ [f1(x), · · · , fT (x)]′}, where x is an instance of some input set X , such that the performance of each task is optimized based on a problem-specific criterion. Here [f1(x), · · · , fT (x)]′ denotes the transposition of row vector [f1(x), · · · , fT (x)]. MTL has been successfully applied in feature selection [2, 8, 10], regression [19, 16], metric learning [28][23], and kernel-based MTL [7, 3, 24, 1] among other applications.\nDespite the abundance of MTL applications, relevant generalization bounds have only been developed for special cases. A theoretically well-studied MTL framework is regularized linear MTL model, whose generalization bound is studied in [21, 13, 22]. In this framework, each function ft is featured as a linear function with weight wt ∈ H, such that ∀x ∈ X ⊆ H, ft(x) = 〈wt,x〉, where H is a real Hilbert space equipped with inner product 〈·, ·〉. Different regularizers can be employed to the weightsw = (w1, · · · ,wT ) ∈ H× . . .×H ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nT times\nto fulfill different requirements of the problem at hand. Formally, given { xit, y i t } ∈ X × Y, i =\n1, · · · , nt, t = 1, · · · , T , where X and Y are the input and output space for each task, the framework can be written as\nmin w\nR(w) + λ ∑\ni,t\nL(ft(x i t), y i t) (1)\nwhere R(·) and L(·, ·) are the regularizer and loss function respectively. Many MTL models fall into this framework. For example, [5] looks for group sparsity of w, [29] discovers group structure of multiple tasks, and [8, 10] select features in a MTL context.\nIn the previous framework, tasks are implicitly related by regularizers on w. On the other hand, another angle of considering information sharing amongst tasks is by pre-processing the data from all tasks by a common processor, and subsequently, a linear model is learned based on the processed data. One scenario of this learning framework is subspace learning, where data of each task are projected to a common subspace by an operator A, and then the wt’s are learned in that subspace. Such an approach is followed in [2, 14]. Another particularly straightforward and useful adaptation of this framework is kernel-based MTL. In this situation, the role of the operatorA is assumed by the non-linear feature mapping φ associated with the kernel function in use. In this case, all data are pre-processed by a common kernel function, which is pre-selected or learned during the training phase, while the wt’s are then learned in the corresponding Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). One example of this technique is given in [26].\nOne previous work which discussed the generalization bound of this method in a classification context is [20]. Given a set A of bounded self-adjoint linear operators on X and T linear functions with weights wt’s, the HS is given as F = {x 7→ [〈w1, Ax〉, · · · , 〈wT , Ax〉]′ : ‖wt‖2 ≤ R,A ∈ A}. Clearly, in this HS, data are pre-processed by the operator A to a common space, as a strategy of information sharing amongst tasks. By either cleverly choosing A beforehand or by learning A ∈ A, it is expected that a tighter generalization bound can be attained compared to learning each task independently. It is straightforward to see that pre-selecting A beforehand is a special case of learning A ∈ A, i.e., pre-selecting A is equivalent to A = {A}.\nHowever, the limitations of F are two-fold. First, in F , all wt’s are equally constrained in a ball, whose radius R is determined prior to training. However, in practice, the HS that lets each task have its own radius for the corresponding norm-ball constraint may be more appropriate and may lead to a better generalization bound and performance.\nThe second limitation is that it cannot handle the models which learn a common kernel function for all tasks, e.g., the Multi-Task Multiple Kernel Learning (MT-MKL) models. One way to incorporate such kernel learning models into F is to let A be the feature mapping φ : X 7→ Hφ, where Hφ is the output space of the feature mapping φ and φ corresponds to the common kernel function k. In other words, this setting defines F = {x 7→ [〈w1, φ(x)〉, · · · , 〈wT , φ(x)〉]′ : ‖wt‖2 ≤ R, φ ∈ Ω(φ)}, where Ω(φ) is the set of feature mappings that φ is learned from. Obviously, the HS that is considered in [20] does not cover this scenario, since it only allows the operator A to be linear operator, which is not the case when A = φ. Yet another limitation reveals itself, when one considers the equivalent HS: F = {x 7→ [〈w1,x〉, · · · , 〈wT ,x〉]′ : ‖wt‖2 ≤ R,x ∈ Hφ, φ ∈ Ω(φ)}, where, as mentioned above, Hφ is the output space of the feature mapping φ. Obviously, the HS in [20] fails to cover this HS, due to the lack of the constraint φ ∈ Ω(φ), which indicates that the feature mapping φ (hence, its corresponding kernel function) is learned during the training phase instead of of being selected beforehand.\nTherefore, in this paper, we generalize F , particularly for kernel-based classification problems, by considering the common operator φ (which is associated with a kernel function) for all tasks and by imposing norm-ball constraints on the wt’s with different radii that are learned during the training process, instead of being chosen prior to training. Specifically, we consider the HS\nFs , {x 7→ [〈w1, φ(x)〉, · · · , 〈wT , φ(x)〉]′ : ‖wt‖2 ≤ λ2tR,λ ∈ Ωs(λ)} (2) and\nFs,r , {x 7→ [〈w1, φ(x)〉, · · · , 〈wT , φ(x)〉]′ : ‖wt‖2 ≤ λ2tR,λ ∈ Ωs(λ), φ ∈ Ωr(φ)} (3)\nwhere Ωs(λ) , {λ 0, ‖λ‖s ≤ 1, s ≥ 1}, and Ωr(φ) = {φ : φ = ( √ θ1φ1, · · · , √ θMφM ), θ 0, ‖θ‖r ≤ 1, r ≥ 1}, φm ∈ Hm, φ ∈ H1 × · · · × HM . The objective of our paper is to derive and analyze the generalization bounds of these two HS. Specifically, the first HS, Fs, has fixed feature mapping φ, which is pre-selected, and the second HS, Fs,r, learns the feature mapping via a Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) approach. We refer readers to [18] and a survey paper [9] for details on MKL.\nObviously, by letting all λt’s equal 1, Fs degrades to the equal-radius HS, which is a special case of Fs when s → +∞, as we will show in the sequel. By considering the generalization bound of Fs based on the Empirical Rademacher Complexity (ERC) [21], we first demonstrate that the ERC is monotonically increasing with s, which implies that the tightest bound is achieved, when s = 1. We then provide an upper bound for the ERC of Fs, which also monotonically increases with respect to s. In the optimal case (s = 1),\nwe achieve a generalization bound of order O( √ log T T\n), which decreases relatively fast with increasing T . On the other hand, when s → +∞, the bound does not decrease with increasing T , thus, it is less preferred.\nWe then derive the generalization bound for the HS Fs,r, which still features a bound of order O( √ log T T\n) when s = 1, as in the single-kernel setting. Additionally, if M kernel functions are involved, the bound is of order O( √ logM), which has been proved to be the best bound that can be obtained in single-task multi-kernel classification [6]. Therefore, the optimal order of the bound is also preserved in the MT-MKL case. Note that the proofs of all theoretical results are in the Appendix.\nAfter investigating the generalization bounds, we experimentally show that our bound on the ERC matches the real ERC very well. Moreover, we propose a MTL model based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs) as an example of a classification framework that uses Fs as its HS. It is further extended to an MT-MKL setting, whose HS becomes Fs,r. Experimental results on multi-task classification problems show the effect of s on the generalization ability of our model. In most situations, the optimal results are indeed achieved, when s = 1, which matches our technical analysis. For some other results that are not optimal as expected, when s = 1, we provide a justification."

By using the same proving strategy, it is easy to show that (7) is valid for all HSs that are considered in this paper. Therefore, we will not explicitly state a specialization of it for each additional HS encountered in the sequel. In the next, we first define the following duality mapping for all a ∈ R:\n(·)∗ : a 7→ a∗ , {\na a−1 , ∀a 6= 1 +∞, a = 1 (9)\nthen we give the following results which show that R̂(Fs) is monotonically increasing with respect to s.\nLemma 2.

Obviously, it is the special case of Fs with all λt’s be set to 1. We have the following result:\nTheorem 2. R̂(F̃) = R̂(F+∞).\nThe above results imply that the tightest generalization bound is obtained when s = 1, while, on the other hand, the bound of F+∞ that sets equal radii for all wt’s is the least preferred. It is clear that, to derive a generalization bound for Fs, we need to compute, or, at least find an upper bound for R̂(Fs). The following theorem addresses this requisite.\nTheorem 3. Let Fs be as defined in Equation (6), and let ρ , 2 lnT . Assume that ∀x ∈ X , k(x,x) = 〈φ(x), φ(x)〉 ≤ 1.

We in this subsection discuss four closely related papers, and emphasize the difference between this paper and these works.\nFirst, we consider [1] and [24]. Both of these two papers consider Group-Lasso type regularizer to achieve different level of sparsity. Specifically, [1] utilized the regularizer\n(\nn∑\nj=1\n(\nnj∑\nk=1\n‖wjk‖)s) 2 s , s ≥ 2 (20)\nwhere l1 norm regularization is applied to the weights of each of the n groups (i.e.the inner summation), and the group-wise regularization is achieved via ls norm regularizer. It is hoped that by utilizing this regularizer, one can achieve inner-group sparsity and group-wise non-sparsity. This regularizer can be applied to MT-MKL, by letting wjk to be w m t , which yields the regularizer\n(\nT∑\nt=1\n(\nM∑\nm=1\n‖wmt ‖)s) 2 s , s ≥ 2 (21)\nThis is similar to the one that appeared in FGLs,r . However, the major difference between our regularizer and (21) is that, in FGLs,r , instead of applying an l1 norm to the inner summation, we used ∑M m=1 ‖wmt ‖2 θm\n, where θm has a feasible region that is parametrized by r. Therefore, our regularizer encompasses MT-MKL with common kernel function, which is learned during training, while (21) does not.\nIn [24], the authors considered\nM∑\nm=1\n( T∑\nt=1\n‖wmt ‖q) p q , 0 ≤ p ≤ 1, q ≥ 1 (22)\nBy applying the lp (pseudo-)norm, the authors intended to achieve sparsity over the outer summation, while variable sparsity is obtained for the inner summation, due to the lq norm. The major difference between (22) and FGLs,r are twofold. First, the order of the double summation is different, i.e., in (22), the wmt ’s that belong to the same RKHS is considered as a group, while FGLs,r treats each task as a group. Second, similar to the reason that is discussed above, (22) does not encompasses the MT-MKL with common kernel function, which is learned during the training phase.\nIn the following, we discuss the difference between our work and the two theoretical works, [22] and [13], which derived generalization bound of the HSs that are similar to ours. In [22], the authors consider the regularizer\n‖w‖M , inf{ ∑\nM∈M ‖vM‖ : vM ∈ H,\n∑\nM∈M MvM = w} (23)\nwhere M is an almost countable set of symmetric bounded linear operators on H. This general form covers several regularizers, such as Lasso, Group-Lasso, weighted Group-Lasso, etc. A key observation is that, in order for a specific regularizer to be covered by this general expression, the regularizer needs to be either summation of several norms, or the infimum of such a summation over a feasible region. For our regularizer ( ∑T\nt=1 ‖wt‖s) 2 s , obviously, it is not summation of norms (note the power outside the summation). Also, it is not immediately clear, if it can be represented by an infimum, which we just mentioned. Therefore, it appears that there is no succinct way to represent our regularizer as a special case of (23) and the same seems to be the case for our MT-MKL regularizer.\nAlso, for our HSs, it is clear how the generalization bounds relate to the number of tasks T and number of kernels M , in Fs and Fs,r, and under which circumstances the logarithmic bound can be achieved. This observation may be hard to obtain from the bound that is derived in (23), even though one may view our regularizers as special cases of (23).\nIn [13], the authors derived generalization bound for regularization-based MTL models, with regularizer ‖W ‖r,p , ‖(‖w1‖r, · · · , ‖wn‖r)‖p. However, their work assumes W ∈ Rm×n, while we assume our wt’s be vectors of a potentially infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. Also, such group norm does not generalize our MT-MKL regularizer, therefore their bound cannot be applied to our HS, even if their results were to be extended to infinite-dimensional vector spaces."

For each of the D samples of σt, we can calculate the corresponding ut. Then, we solve the maximization problem by using CVX [11, 12]. Finally, we calculate the average of the D values to approximate the ERC. For the experiment related to Fs,r, we only considered the case, when s ≥ 2. Under these circumstances, the maximization problem in (13) is concave and can be easily solved, unlike the case, when s ∈ [1, 2).\nWe used the Letter data set 1 for this set of experiments. It is a collection of handwritten words compiled by Rob Kassel of the MIT Spoken Language Systems Group. The associated MTL problem involves 8 tasks, each of which is a binary classification problem for handwritten letters. The 8 tasks are: ‘C’ vs. ‘E’, ‘G’ vs. ‘Y’, ‘M’ vs. ‘N’, ‘A’ vs. ‘G’, ‘I’ vs. ‘J’, ‘A’ vs. ‘O’, ‘F’ vs. ‘T’ and ‘H’ vs. ‘N’. Each letter is represented by a 8× 16 pixel image, which forms a 128-dimensional feature vector. We chose 100 samples for each letter, and set D = 104. To calculate the kernel matrix, we used a Gaussian kernel with spread parameter 27 for Fs, and 9 different Gaussian kernels with spreads {2−7, 2−5, 2−3, 2−1, 20, 21, 23, 25, 27} for Fs,r. Finally, R was set to 1.\nThe experimental results are shown in Figure 1. In both sub-figures, it is obvious that both our bound and the real ERC are monotonically increasing. For Fs, it can be seen that the bound is tight everywhere.\n1Available at: http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~taskar/ocr/\nFor Fs,r, even though the difference between our bound and the Monte Carlo estimated ERC becomes larger when s grows, the bound is still tight for small s. This experiment shows a good match between the real ERC and our bound, which verifies our theoretical analysis in Section 2 and Section 3."

For training data {xit, yit} ∈ X ×{−1, 1}, i = 1, · · · , Nt, t = 1, · · · , T and fixed feature mapping φ : X 7→ H, our model is given as follows:\nmin w,ξ,b (\nT∑\nt=1\n( ‖wt‖2\n2 )\ns 2 ) 2 s + C\nT,Nt∑\nt,i=1\nξit\ns.t.yit( 〈 wt, φ(x i t) 〉 + bt) ≥ 1− ξit , ξit ≥ 0, ∀i, t\n(24)\nObviously, Fs is the HS of (24).

Group coordinate descent can be utilized to solve (28), with λ as a group and α as another group.\nThe model can be extended so that it can accommodate MKL as follows:\nmin wt,ξt,bt,θ (\nT∑\nt=1\n(\nM∑\nm=1\n‖wmt ‖2 2θm ) s 2 ) 2 s + C\nT,Nt∑\nt,i=1\nξit\ns.t.yit( 〈 wt, φ(x i t) 〉 + bt) ≥ 1− ξit, ξit ≥ 0, ∀i, t\nθ 0, ‖θ‖r ≤ 1\n(29)\nwhere φ = (φ1, · · · , φM ).

      "text" : "We performed our experiments on two well-known and frequently-used multi-task data sets, namely Letter and Landmine, and two handwritten digit data sets, namely MNIST and USPS. The Letter data set was described in the previous sub-section. Due to the large size of the original Letter data set, we randomly sampled 200 points for each letter to construct a training set. One exception is the letter j, as it contains only 189 samples in total. The Landmine data set2 consists of 29 binary classification tasks. Each datum is a 9-dimensional feature vector extracted from radar images that capture a single region of landmine fields. Tasks 1 − 15 correspond to regions that are relatively highly foliated, while the other 14 tasks correspond to regions that are bare earth or desert. The tasks entail different amounts of data, varying from 30 to 96 samples. The goal is to detect landmines in specific regions.\n2Available at: http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/LandmineData.zip\nRegarding the MNIST 3 and USPS 4 data sets, each of the two are grayscale images containing handwritten digits from 0 to 9 with 784 and 256 features respectively. As was the case with the Letter data set, due to the large size of the original data set, we randomly sampled 100 data from each digit population to form a training set consisting of 1000 samples in total. To simulate the MTL scenario, we split the data into 45 binary classification tasks by applying a one-versus-one strategy. The classification accuracy was then calculated as the average of classification accuracies over all tasks.\nFor all our experiments, the training set size was set to 10% of the available data. We did not choose large training sets, since, as we can see from the generalization bound in (11), (14) and (15), when N is large, the effect of s becomes minor. For MT-MKL, we chose the 9 Gaussian kernels that were introduced in Section 5.1, as well as a linear and a 2nd-order polynomial kernel. For the single kernel case, we selected the optimal kernel from these 11 kernel function candidates via cross-validation. SVM’s regularization parameter C was selected from the set {1/81, 1/27, 1/9, 1/3, 1, 3, 9, 27, 81}. In the MT-MKL case, the norm parameter r for θ was set to 1 to induce sparsity on θ. We varied s from 1 to 100, and reported the best average classification accuracy over 20 runs. For s > 100, the results are almost always the same as that when s = 100, therefore we did not report these results. In fact, as show below, the model performance deteriorates quickly when s > 2, and changes very few when s > 10. The experimental results are given in Figure 2.\nIt can be seen that, the classification accuracy is roughly monotonically decreasing with respect to s, and the performance deteriorates significantly when s > 2. In many situations, the best performance is achieved, when s = 1. This result supports our theoretical analysis that the lowest generalization bound is obtained when s = 1. On the other hand, in some situations, such as the cases which consider the USPS data set in a single kernel setting, and the Letter data set in multiple kernel setting, the optimum model is not obtained when s = 1. This seems contradictory to our previously stated claims. However, this phenomenon can be explained similarly to the discussion in Section 5.1 of [15], which we summarize here: Obviously, for different s, the optimal solution (ft’s) may be different. To get the optimal solution, we need to tune the “size” of the HS, such that the optimum ft’s are contained in the HS. This implies that the size of the HS, which is parametrized by R, could be different for different s, instead of being fixed as discussed in previous sections. It is possible that the HS size (thus R) is very small, when s 6= 1. In this scenario, the lowest bound could be obtained when s 6= 1. For a more detailed discussion, we refer the reader to Section 5.1 in [15]. Finally, it is interesting to see how the performance deteriorates when s becomes large. The reason for the bad performance is as follows. Observe that the regularizer is the l s\n2 norm of the T SVM regularizers. Consider\n3Available at: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ 4Available at: http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~roweis/data.html\nthe extreme case, when s → ∞, the l s 2 norm becomes the l∞ norm, which is maxt{ ‖wt‖ 2 2 }. In this scenario, the regularizer of the model is only the one which has the smallest margin, while the regularizers of other tasks are ignored. Therefore, it is not a surprise that the performance of the other tasks is bad, which leads to low average classification accuracy. For large s value, even though it is not infinity, the bad result can be similarly analyzed."

      "text" : "In this paper, we proposed a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) Hypothesis Space (HS) Fs involving T discriminative functions parametrized by weights wt. The weights are controlled by norm-ball constraints, whose radii are variable and estimated during the training phase. It extends an HS F̃ that has been previously investigated in the literature, where the radii are pre-determined. It is shown that the latter space is a special case of Fs, when s → +∞. We derived and analyzed the generalization bound of Fs and have shown that the bound is monotonically increasing with respect to s. Also, in the optimal case (s = 1), a bound of order O( √ log T T\n) is achieved. We further extended the HS to Fs,r, which is suitable for Multi-Task Multiple Kernel Learning (MT-MKL). Similar results were obtained, including a bound that is monotonically increasing with s and an optimal bound of order O( √ logMT T\n), when s = 1. The experimental results shown that our Empirical Rademacher Complexity (ERC) bound is tight and matches the real ERC very well. We then demonstrated the relation between our HS and the Group-Lasso type regularizer, and a Support Vector Machine (SVM)-based model was proposed with HS Fs, that was further extended to handle MT-MKL by using the HS Fs,r. The experimental results on multi-task classification data sets showed that the classification accuracy is monotonically decreasing with respect to s, and the optimal results for most experiments are indeed achieved, when s = 1, as indicated by our analysis. The presence of results that, contrary to our analysis, are optimal, when s 6= 1, can be justified similarly to Section 5.1 in [15]."

It extends similar hypothesis spaces that have previously considered in the literature. Assuming this space, an improved Empirical Rademacher Complexity-based generalization bound is derived. The analysis is itself extended to an MKL setting. The connection between the proposed hypothesis space and a Group-Lasso type regularizer is discussed. Finally, experimental results, with some SVM-based Multi-Task Learning problems, underline the quality of the derived bounds and validate the paper’s analysis.",
