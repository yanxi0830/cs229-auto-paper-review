      "text" : "Compressive or compressed sensing is the problem of reconstructing an unknown vector x∗ ∈ Rn after observing m < n linear measurements of its entries, possibly with added noise:\ny = Ax∗ + η,\nwhere A ∈ Rm×n is called the measurement matrix and η ∈ Rm is noise. Even without noise, this is an underdetermined system of linear equations, so recovery is impossible unless we make an assumption on the structure of the unknown vector x∗. We need to assume that the unknown vector is “natural,” or “simple,” in some applicationdependent way.\nThe most common structural assumption is that the vector x∗ is k-sparse in some known basis (or approximately k-sparse). Finding the sparsest solution to an underdetermined system of linear equations is NP-hard, but still convex optimization can provably recover the true sparse vector x∗ if the matrix A satisfies conditions such as the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) or the related Restricted Eigenvalue Condition (REC) [35, 7, 14, 6]. The problem is also called high-dimensional sparse linear regression and there is vast literature on establishing conditions for different recovery algorithms, different assumptions on the design of A and generalizations of RIP and REC for other structures, see e.g. [6, 33, 1, 30, 3].\nThis significant interest is justified since a large number of applications can be expressed as recovering an unknown vector from noisy linear measurements. For example, many tomography problems can be expressed in this framework: x∗ is the unknown true tomographic image and the linear measurements are obtained by x-ray or other physical sensing system that produces sums or more general linear projections of the unknown pixels. Compressed sensing has been studied extensively for medical applications including computed tomography (CT) [8], rapid MRI [31] and neuronal spike train recovery [21]. Another impressive application is the “single pixel camera” [15], where digital micro-mirrors provide linear combinations to a single pixel sensor that then uses compressed sensing reconstruction algorithms to reconstruct an image. These results have been extended by combining sparsity with additional structural assumptions [4, 22], and by generalizations such as translating sparse vectors into low-rank matrices [33, 3, 17].

Other works perform “dictionary learning,” seeking overcomplete bases where the data is more sparse (see [9] and references therein).\nIn this paper instead of relying on sparsity, we use structure from a generative model. Recently, several neural network based generative models such as variational auto-encoders (VAEs) [26] and generative adversarial networks (GANs) [19] have found success at modeling data distributions. In these models, the generative part learns a mapping from a low dimensional representation space z ∈ Rk to the high dimensional sample space G(z) ∈ Rn. While training, this mapping is encouraged to produce vectors that resemble the vectors in the training dataset. We can therefore use any pre-trained generator to approximately capture the notion of an vector being “natural” in our domain: the generator defines a probability distribution over vectors in sample space and tries to assign higher probability to more likely vectors, for the dataset it has been trained on. We expect that vectors “natural” to our domain will be close to some point in the support of this distribution, i.e., in the range of G.\nOur Contributions: We present an algorithm that uses generative models for compressed sensing. Our algorithm simply uses gradient descent to optimize the representation z ∈ Rk such that the corresponding image G(z) has small measurement error ‖AG(z)− y‖22. While this is a nonconvex objective to optimize, we empirically find that gradient descent works well, and the results can significantly outperform Lasso with relatively few measurements.\nWe obtain theoretical results showing that, as long as gradient descent finds a good approximate solution to our objective, our output G(z) will be almost as close to the true x∗ as the closest possible point in the range of G.\nThe proof is based on a generalization of the Restricted Eigenvalue Condition (REC) that we call the Set-Restricted Eigenvalue Condition (S-REC). Our main theorem is that if a measurement matrix satisfies the S-REC for the range of a given generator G, then the measurement error minimization optimum is close to the true x∗. Furthermore, we show that random Gaussian measurement matrices satisfy the S-REC condition with high probability for large classes of generators. Specifically, for d-layer neural networks such as VAEs and GANs, we show that O(kd log n) Gaussian measurements suffice to guarantee good reconstruction with high probability. One result, for ReLU-based networks, is the following:\nTheorem 1.1. Let G : Rk → Rn be a generative model from a d-layer neural network using ReLU activations. Let A ∈ Rm×n be a random Gaussian matrix for m = O(kd log n), scaled so Ai,j ∼ N(0, 1/m). For any x∗ ∈ Rn and any observation y = Ax∗ + η, let ẑ minimize ‖y − AG(z)‖2 to within additive of the optimum. Then with 1− e−Ω(m) probability,\n‖G(ẑ)− x∗‖2 ≤ 6 min z∗∈Rk ‖G(z∗)− x∗‖2 + 3‖η‖2 + 2 .\nLet us examine the terms in our error bound in more detail. The first two are the minimum possible error of any vector in the range of the generator and the norm of the noise; these are necessary for such a technique, and have direct analogs in standard compressed sensing guarantees. The third term comes from gradient descent not necessarily converging to the global optimum; empirically, does seem to converge to zero, and one can check post-observation that this is small by computing the upper bound ‖y −AG(ẑ)‖2.\nWhile the above is restricted to ReLU-based neural networks, we also show similar results for arbitrary L-Lipschitz generative models, for m ≈ O(k logL). Typical neural networks have poly(n)-bounded weights in each layer, so L ≤ nO(d), giving for all activation functions the same O(kd log n) sample complexity as for ReLU networks.\nTheorem 1.2. Let G : Rk → Rn be an L-Lipschitz function. Let A ∈ Rm×n be a random Gaussian matrix for m = O(k log Lrδ ), scaled so Ai,j ∼ N(0, 1/m). For any x\n∗ ∈ Rn and any observation y = Ax∗ + η, let ẑ minimize ‖y −AG(z)‖2 to within additive of the optimum over vectors with ‖ẑ‖2 ≤ r. Then with 1− e−Ω(m) probability,\n‖G(ẑ)− x∗‖2 ≤ 6 min z∗∈Rk ‖z∗‖2≤r ‖G(z∗)− x∗‖2 + 3‖η‖2 + 2 + 2δ.\nThe downside is two minor technical conditions: we only optimize over representations z with ‖z‖ bounded by r, and our error gains an additive δ term. Since the dependence on these parameters is log(rL/δ), and L is something like nO(d), we may set r = nO(d) and δ = 1/nO(d) while only losing constant factors, making these conditions\nvery mild. In fact, generative models normally have the coordinates of z be independent uniform or Gaussian, so ‖z‖ ≈ √ k nd, and a constant signal-to-noise ratio would have ‖η‖2 ≈ ‖x∗‖ ≈ √ n 1/nd.\nWe remark that, while these theorems are stated in terms of Gaussian matrices, the proofs only involve the distributional Johnson-Lindenstrauss property of such matrices. Hence the same results hold for matrices with subgaussian entries or fast-JL matrices [2]."

We observe the measurements y = Ax∗ + η. Given y and A, our task is to find a reconstruction x̂ close to x∗.\nA generative model is given by a deterministic functionG : Rk → Rn, and a distribution PZ over z ∈ Rk. To generate a sample from the generator, we can draw z ∼ PZ and the sample then is G(z). Typically, we have k n, i.e. the generative model maps from a low dimensional representation space to a high dimensional sample space.\nOur approach is to find a vector in representation space such that the corresponding vector in the sample space matches the observed measurements. We thus define the objective to be\nloss(z) = ‖AG(z)− y‖2 (1)\nBy using any optimization procedure, we can minimize loss(z) with respect to z. In particular, if the generative model G is differentiable, we can evaluate the gradients of the loss with respect to z using backpropagation and use standard gradient based optimizers.

      "text" : "Several recent lines of work explore generative models for reconstruction. The first line of work attempts to project an image on to the representation space of the generator. These works assume full knowledge of the image, and are special cases of the linear measurements framework where the measurement matrix A is identity. Excellent reconstruction results with SGD in the representation space to find an image in the generator range have been reported by [28] with stochastic clipping and [11] with logistic measurement loss. A different approach is introduced in [16] and [12]. In their method, a recognition network that maps from the sample space vector x to the representation space vector z is learned jointly with the generator in an adversarial setting.\nA second line of work explores reconstruction with structured partial observations. The inpainting problem consists of predicting the values of missing pixels given a part of the image. This is a special case of linear measurements where each measurement corresponds to an observed pixel. The use of Generative models for this task has been studied in [38], where the objective is taken to be a combination of L1 error in measurements and a perceptual loss term given by the discriminator. Super-resolution is a related task that attempts to increase the resolution of an image. We can view this problem as observing local spatial averages of the unknown higher resolution image and hence cast this as another special case of linear measurements. For prior work on super-resolution see e.g. [37, 13, 23] and references therein.\nWe also take note of the related work of [18] that connects model-based compressed sensing with the invertibility of Convolutional Neural Networks.\nA related result appears in [5], which studies the measurement complexity of an RIP condition for smooth manifolds. This is analogous to our S-REC for the range of G, but the range of G is neither smooth (because of ReLUs) nor a manifold (because of self-intersection). Their recovery result was extended in [20] to unions of two manifolds."

      "heading" : "4 Theoretical Results",
      "text" : "We begin with a brief review of the Restricted Eigenvalue Condition (REC) in standard compressed sensing. The REC is a sufficient condition on A for robust recovery to be possible. The REC essentially requires that all “approximately sparse” vectors are far from the nullspace of the matrix A. More specifically, A satisfies REC for a constant γ > 0 if for all approximately sparse vectors x, ‖Ax‖ ≥ γ‖x‖. (2) It can be shown that this condition is sufficient for recovery of sparse vectors using Lasso. If one examines the structure of Lasso recovery proofs, a key property that is used is that the difference of any two sparse vectors is also approximately sparse (for sparsity up to 2k). This is a coincidence that is particular to sparsity. By contrast, the difference of two vectors “natural” to our domain may not itself be natural. The condition we need is that the difference of any two natural vectors is far from the nullspace of A.\nWe propose a generalized version of the REC for a set S ⊆ Rn of vectors, the Set-Restricted Eigenvalue Condition (S-REC):\nDefinition 1. Let S ⊆ Rn. For some parameters γ > 0, δ ≥ 0, a matrix A ∈ Rm×n is said to satisfy the S-REC(S, γ, δ) if ∀ x1, x2 ∈ S,\n‖A(x1 − x2)‖ ≥ γ‖x1 − x2‖ − δ.\nThere are two main differences between the S-REC and the standard REC in compressed sensing. First, the condition applies to differences of vectors in an arbitrary set S of “natural” vectors, rather than just the set of approximately k-sparse vectors in some basis. This will let us apply the definition to S being the range of a generative model.\nSecond, we allow an additive slack term δ. This is necessary for us to achieve the S-REC when S is the output of general Lipschitz functions. Without it, the S-REC depends on the behavior of S at arbitrarily small scales. Since there are arbitrarily many such local regions, one cannot guarantee the existence of an A that works for all these local regions. Fortunately, as we shall see, poor behavior at a small scale δ will only increase our error by O(δ).\nThe S-REC definition requires that for any two vectors in S, if they are significantly different (so the right hand side is large), then the corresponding measurements should also be significantly different (left hand side). Hence we can hope to approximate the unknown vector from the measurements, if the measurement matrix satisfies the S-REC.\nBut how can we find such a matrix? To answer this, we present two lemmas showing that random Gaussian matrices of relatively few measurements m satisfy the S-REC for the outputs of large and practically useful classes of generative models G : Rk → Rn.\nIn the first lemma, we assume that the generative model G(·) is L-Lipschitz, i.e., ∀ z1, z2 ∈ Rk, we have\n‖G(z1)−G(z2)‖ ≤ L‖z1 − z2‖.\nNote that state of the art neural network architectures with linear layers, (transposed) convolutions, max-pooling, residual connections, and all popular non-linearities satisfy this assumption. In Lemma 8.5 in the Appendix we give a simple bound on L in terms of parameters of the network; for typical networks this is nO(d). We also require the input z to the generator to have bounded norm. Since generative models such as VAEs and GANs typically assume their input z is drawn with independent uniform or Gaussian inputs, this only prunes an exponentially unlikely fraction of the possible outputs.\nLemma 4.1. Let G : Rk → Rn be L-Lipschitz. Let\nBk(r) = {z | z ∈ Rk, ‖z‖ ≤ r}\nbe an L2-norm ball in Rk. For α < 1, if\nm = Ω\n( k\nα2 log\nLr\nδ\n) ,\nthen a random matrixA ∈ Rm×n with IID entries such thatAij ∼ N ( 0, 1m ) satisfies the S-REC(G(Bk(r)), 1−α, δ) with 1− e−Ω(α2m) probability.\nAll proofs, including this one, are deferred to Appendix A.\nNote that even though we proved the lemma for an L2 ball, the same technique works for any compact set.\nFor our second lemma, we assume that the generative model is a neural network with such that each layer is a composition of a linear transformation followed by a pointwise non-linearity. Many common generative models have such architectures. We also assume that all non-linearities are piecewise linear with at most two pieces. The popular ReLU or LeakyReLU non-linearities satisfy this assumption. We do not make any other assumption, and in particular, the magnitude of the weights in the network do not affect our guarantee.\nLemma 4.2. Let G : Rk → Rn be a d-layer neural network, where each layer is a linear transformation followed by a pointwise non-linearity. Suppose there are at most c nodes per layer, and the non-linearities are piecewise linear with at most two pieces, and let\nm = Ω\n( 1\nα2 kd log c ) for some α < 1. Then a random matrixA ∈ Rm×n with IID entriesAij ∼ N (0, 1m ) satisfies the S-REC(G(R\nk), 1− α, 0) with 1− e−Ω(α2m) probability.\nTo show Theorems 1.1 and 1.2, we just need to show that the S-REC implies good recovery. In order to make our error guarantee relative to `2 error in the image space Rn, rather than in the measurement space Rm, we also need that A preserves norms with high probability [10]. Fortunately, Gaussian matrices (or other distributional JL matrices) satisfy this property.\nLemma 4.3. Let A ∈ Rm×n by drawn from a distribution that (1) satisfies the S-REC(S, γ, δ) with probability 1−p and (2) has for every fixed x ∈ Rn, ‖Ax‖ ≤ 2‖x‖ with probability 1− p.\nFor any x∗ ∈ Rn and noise η, let y = Ax∗ + η. Let x̂ approximately minimize ‖y −Ax‖ over x ∈ S, i.e.,\n‖y −Ax̂‖ ≤ min x∈S ‖y −Ax‖+ .\nThen,\n‖x̂− x∗‖ ≤ ( 4\nγ + 1 ) min x∈S ‖x∗ − x‖+ 1 γ (2‖η‖+ + δ)\nwith probability 1− 2p.\nCombining Lemma 4.1, Lemma 4.2, and Lemma 4.3 gives Theorems 1.1 and 1.2. In our setting, S is the range of the generator, and x̂ in the theorem above is the reconstruction G(ẑ) returned by our algorithm."

This provides some evidence that our approach can work with many types of models and datasets.\nIn our experiments, we found that it was helpful to add a regularization term L(z) to the objective to encourage the optimization to explore more in the regions that are preferred by the respective generative models (see comparison to unregularized versions in Fig. 1).

These models can represent data distributions more concisely than standard sparsity models, while their differentiability allows for fast signal reconstruction. This will allow compressed sensing applications to make significantly fewer measurements.\nOur theorems and experiments both suggest that, after relatively few measurements, the signal reconstruction gets close to the optimal within the range of the generator. To reach the full potential of this technique, one should use larger generative models as the number of measurements increase. Whether this can be expressed more concisely than by training multiple independent generative models of different sizes is an open question.\nGenerative models are an active area of research with ongoing rapid improvements. Because our framework applies to general generative models, this improvement will immediately yield better reconstructions with fewer measurements. We also believe that one could also use the performance of generative models for our task as one benchmark for the quality of different models."

Let G : Rk → Rn be an L-Lipschitz function. Let Bk(r) be the L2-ball in Rk with radius r, S = G(Bk(r)), and M be a δ/L-net on Bk(r) such that |M | ≤ k log ( 4Lr\nδ\n) . Let A be a Rm×n random matrix with IID\nGaussian entries with zero mean and variance 1/m. If\nm = Ω ( k log Lr\nδ\n) ,\nthen for any x ∈ S, if x′ = arg minx̂∈G(M) ‖x− x̂‖, we have ‖A(x− x′)‖ = O(δ) with probability 1− e−Ω(m).\nNote that for any given point x′ in S, if we try to find its nearest neighbor of that point in an δ-net on S, then the difference between the two is at most the δ. In words, this lemma says that even if we consider measurements made on these points, i.e. a linear projection using a random matrix A, then as long as there are enough measurements, the difference between measurements is of the same order δ. If the point x′ was in the net, then this can be easily achieved by Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma. But to argue that this is true for all x′ in S, which can be an uncountably large set, we construct a chain of nets on S. We now present the formal proof.\nProof. Observe that ‖Ax‖2\n‖x‖2 is subgamma ( 1√ m , 1 m ) . Thus, for any f > 0,\n≥ 2 + 4 m log 2 f ≥ max\n(√ 2\nm log\n2 f , 2 m log 2 f ) is sufficient to ensure that\nP (‖Ax‖ ≥ (1 + )‖x‖) ≤ f.\nNow, let M = M0 ⊆ M1 ⊆ M2, · · · ⊆ Ml be a chain of epsilon nets of Bk(r) such that Mi is a δi/L-net and δi = δ0/2 i, with δ0 = δ. We know that there exist nets such that\nlog |Mi| ≤ k log ( 4Lr\nδi\n) ≤ ik + k log ( 4Lr\nδ0\n) .\nLet Ni = G(Mi). Then due to Lipschitzness of G, Ni’s form a chain of epsilon nets such that Ni is a δi-net of S = G(Bk(r)), with |Ni| = |Mi|.\nFor i ∈ {0, 1, 2 · · · , l − 1}, let Ti = {xi+1 − xi | xi+1 ∈ Ni+1, xi ∈ Ni}.\nThus,\n|Ti| ≤ |Ni+1||Ni|. =⇒ log |Ti| ≤ log |Ni+1|+ | log |Ni|,\n≤ (2i+ 1)k + 2k log ( 4Lr\nδ0\n) ,\n≤ 3ik + 2k log ( 4Lr\nδ0\n) .\nNow assume m = 3k log ( 4Lr\nδ0\n) ,\nlog(fi) = −(m+ 4ik), and\ni = 2 + 4\nm log\n2 fi ,\n= 2 + 4\nm log 2 + 4 +\n16ik\nm ,\n= O(1) + 16ik\nm .\nBy choice of fi and i, we have ∀i ∈ [l − 1],∀t ∈ Ti,\nP (‖At‖ > (1 + i)‖t‖) ≤ fi.\nThus by union bound, we have\nP (‖At‖ ≤ (1 + i)‖t‖,∀i,∀t ∈ Ti) ≥ 1− l−1∑ i=0 |Ti|fi.\nNow,\nlog(|Ti|fi) = log(|Ti|) + log(fi), ≤ −k log ( 4Lr\nδ0\n) − ik,\n= −m/3− ik.\n=⇒ l−1∑ i=0 |Ti|fi ≤ e−m/3 l−1∑ i=0 e−ik,\n≤ e−m/3 ( 1\n1− e−1\n) ,\n≤ 2e−m/3.\nObserve that for any x ∈ S, we can write\nx = x0 + (x1 − x0) + (x2 − x1) . . . (xl − xl−1) + xf .\nx− x0 = l−1∑ i=0 (xi+1 − xi) + xf .\nwhere xi ∈ Ni and xf = x− xl.\nSince each xi+1 − xi ∈ Ti, with probability at least 1− 2e−m/3, we have l−1∑ i=0 ‖A(xi+1 − xi)‖ = l−1∑ i=0 (1 + i)‖(xi+1 − xi)‖,\n≤ l−1∑ i=0 (1 + i)δi,\n= δ0 l−1∑ i=0 1 2i ( O(1) + 16ik m ) ,\n= O(δ0) + δ0 16k\nm l−1∑ i=0 ( i 2i ) ,\n= O(δ0).\nNow, ‖xf‖ = ‖x − xl‖ ≤ dl = δ0 2l , and ‖xi+1 − xi‖ ≤ δi due to properties of epsilon-nets. We know that ‖A‖ ≤ 2 + √ n/m with probability at least 1 − 2e−m/2 (Corollary 5.35 [36]). By setting l = log(n), we get that,\n‖A‖‖xf‖ ≤ ( 2 + √ n\nm ) δ0 2l = O(δ0) with probability ≥ 1− 2e−m/2.\nCombining these two results, and noting that it is possible to choose x′ = x0, we get that with probability 1− e−Ω(m),\n‖A(x− x′)‖ = ‖A(x− x0)‖,\n≤ l−1∑ i=0 ‖A(xi+1 − xi)‖+ ‖Axf‖, = O(δ0) + ‖A‖‖xf‖, = O(δ).\nLemma. Let G : Rk → Rn be L-Lipschitz. Let\nBk(r) = {z | z ∈ Rk, ‖z‖ ≤ r}\nbe an L2-norm ball in Rk.

We construct a δ\nL -net, N , on Bk(r). There exists a net such that\nlog |N | ≤ k log ( 4Lr\nδ\n) .\nSince N is a δ\nL -cover of Bk(r), due to the L-Lipschitz property of G(·), we get that G(N) is a δ-cover of G(Bk(r)).\nLet T denote the pairwise differences between the elements in G(N), i.e.,\nT = {G(z1)−G(z2) | z1, z2 ∈ N}.\nThen,\n|T | ≤ |N |2, =⇒ log |T | ≤ 2 log |N |,\n≤ 2k log ( 4Lr\nδ\n) .\nFor any z, z′ ∈ Bk, ∃ z1, z2 ∈ N , such thatG(z1), G(z2) are δ-close toG(z) andG(z′) respectively. Thus, by triangle inequality,\n‖G(z)−G(z′)‖ ≤ ‖G(z)−G(z1)‖+ ‖G(z1)−G(z2)‖+ ‖G(z2)−G(z′)‖,\n≤ ‖G(z1)−G(z2)‖+ 2δ.\nAgain by triangle inequality,\n‖AG(z1)−AG(z2)‖ ≤ ‖AG(z1)−AG(z)‖+ ‖AG(z)−AG(z′)‖+ ‖AG(z′)−AG(z2)‖.\nNow, by Lemma 8.2, with probability 1− e−Ω(m), ‖AG(z1)− AG(z)‖ = O(δ), and ‖AG(z′)− AG(z2)‖ = O(δ). Thus,\n‖AG(z1)−AG(z2)‖ ≤ ‖AG(z)−AG(z′)‖+O(δ).\nBy the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma, for a fixed x ∈ Rn, P [ ‖Ax‖2 < (1− α)‖x‖2 ] < exp(−α2m). Therefore, we can union bound over all vectors in T to get\nP(‖Ax‖2 ≥ (1− α)‖x‖2, ∀x ∈ T ) ≥ 1− e−Ω(α 2m).\nSince α < 1, and z1, z2 ∈ N , G(z1)−G(z2) ∈ T , we have\n(1− α)‖G(z1)−G(z2)‖ ≤ √\n1− α‖G(z1)−G(z2)‖, ≤ ‖AG(z1)−AG(z2)‖.\nCombining the three results above we get that with probability 1− e−Ω(α2m),\n(1− α)‖G(z)−G(z′)‖ ≤ (1− α)‖G(z1)−G(z2)‖+O(δ), ≤ ‖AG(z1)−AG(z2)‖+O(δ), ≤ ‖AG(z)−AG(z′)‖+O(δ).\nThus, A satisfies S-REC(S, 1− α, δ) with probability 1− e−Ω(α2m)."

      "text" : "Lemma 8.3. Consider c different k − 1 dimensional hyperplanes in Rk. Consider the k-dimensional faces (hereafter called k-faces) generated by the hyperplanes, i.e. the elements in the partition of Rk such that relative to each hyperplane, all points inside a partition are on the same side. Then, the number of k-faces is O(ck).\nProof. Proof is by induction, and follows [32].\nLet f(c, k) denote the number of k−faces generated in Rk by c different (k − 1)-dimensional hyperplanes. As a base case, let k = 1. Then (k − 1)-dimensional hyperplanes are just points on a line. c points partition R into c+ 1 pieces. This gives f(c, 1) = O(c).\nNow, assuming that f(c, k − 1) = O(ck−1) is true, we need to show f(c, k) = O(ck). Assume we have (c − 1) different hyperplanes H = {h1, h2, . . . , hc−1} ⊂ Rk, and a new hyperplane hc is added. hc intersects H at (c − 1) different (k − 2)-faces given by F = {fj | fj = hj ∩ hc, 1 ≤ j ≤ (c − 1)}. The (k − 2)-faces in F partition hc into f(c− 1, k − 1) different (k − 1)-faces. Additionally, each (k − 1)-face in hc divides an existing k-face into two. Hence the number of new k-faces introduced by the addition of hc is f(c− 1, k − 1). This gives the recursion\nf(c, k) = f(c− 1, k) + f(c− 1, k − 1), = f(c− 1, k) +O(ck−1), = O(ck).\nLemma. Let G : Rk → Rn be a d-layer neural network, where each layer is a linear transformation followed by a pointwise non-linearity. Suppose there are at most c nodes per layer, and the non-linearities are piecewise linear with at most two pieces, and let\nm = Ω\n( 1\nα2 kd log c ) for some α < 1. Then a random matrixA ∈ Rm×n with IID entriesAij ∼ N (0, 1m ) satisfies the S-REC(G(R\nk), 1− α, 0) with 1− e−Ω(α2m) probability.\nProof. Consider the first layer of G. Each node in this layer can be represented as a hyperplane in Rk, where the points on the hyperplane are those where the input to the node switches from one linear piece to the other. Since there are at most c nodes in this layer, by Lemma 8.3, the input space is partitioned by at most c different hyperplanes, into O(ck) k-faces. Applying this over the d layers of G, we get that the input space Rk is partitioned into at most ckd sets.\nRecall that the non-linearities are piecewise linear, and the partition boundaries were made precisely at those points where the non-linearities change from one piece to another. This means that within each set of the input partition, the output is a linear function of the inputs. Thus G(Rk) is a union of ckd different k-faces in Rn.\nWe now use an oblivious subspace embedding to bound the number of measurements required to embed the range of G(·). For a single k-face S ⊆ Rn, a random matrix A ∈ Rm×n with IID entries such that Aij ∼ N ( 0, 1m ) satisfies S-REC(S, 1− α, 0) with probability 1− e−Ω(α2m) if m = Ω(k/α2).\nSince the range ofG(·) is a union of ckd different k-faces, we can union bound over all of them, such thatA satisfies the S-REC(G(Rk), 1−α, 0) with probability 1−ckde−Ω(α2m). Thus, we get thatA satisfies the S-REC(G(Rk), 1−α, 0) with probability 1− e−Ω(α2m) if\nm = Ω\n( kd log c\nα2\n) ."

For almost all results in this literature, the structure is represented by sparsity in a well-chosen basis. We show how to achieve guarantees similar to standard compressed sensing but without employing sparsity at all. Instead, we suppose that vectors lie near the range of a generative model G : R → R. Our main theorem is that, if G is L-Lipschitz, then roughly O(k logL) random Gaussian measurements suffice for an `2/`2 recovery guarantee. We demonstrate our results using generative models from published variational autoencoder and generative adversarial networks. Our method can use 5-10x fewer measurements than Lasso for the same accuracy.",
