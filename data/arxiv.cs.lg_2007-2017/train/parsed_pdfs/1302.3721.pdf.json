This bandit problem assumes stationary distributions for the rewards. It is often unrealistic to model the real world as a stationary distribution and algorithms such AdaptEvE have been proposed to solve bandit problems in this environment. In this paper we concern ourselves with a Switching Multi-Armed Bandit Problem.\nWe first review Thompson Sampling, before describing the non-stationary environment we are concerned with. We then propose a method to solve this problem and review the techniques we employ. We then test our algorithms on a variety of environments.\nar X\niv :1\n30 2.\n37 21\nv1 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n1 5"

      "text" : "Thompson Sampling is effectively a probability matching algorithm. The desired strategy is to pull an arm with the probability that the arm is the best arm. This probability can be written as\nP (ai = a ∗) = ∫ θ I(ai = a ∗|θ)P (θ|D)dθ, (1)\nwhere θ is a model of our arms, a∗ is the optimal arm, ai is the i th arm and D is the history of past rewards. I(x) is the indicator function, which is 1 when x is true, and 0 otherwise. The strategy can thus be reduced to sampling from the model distribution P (θ|D) and then picking the arm that is maximal given this model.\nThis paper considers multi-armed bandits with Bernoulli arms. Each arm, j, delivers a reward of 1 with probability θj and 0 otherwise. In the stationary case the parameter is θ = (θ1, . . . , θk) where k is the number of arms. The arms are assumed independent and so P (θ|D) is a product of terms P (θj |Dj), where Dj are past rewards for are j. Further, since the arms are Bernoulli, for which the Beta distribution is a conjugate prior, we can write P (θ) as a product of Beta distributions;\nP (θ|D) = k∏ j=1 P (θj |αj , βj , Dj) (2)\nwhere αj = #{reward = 1}+ α0 and βj = #{reward = 0}+ β0. We can sample from P (θ|D) by sampling from all P (θj |αj , βj , Dj) and choosing the arm, j, with largest θj ."

This model switches at a constant rate, when a change point happens all arms change their expected rewards. The second model will be referred to as Per-Arm Switching. In this model change points occur independently for each arm, such that when the expected reward switches for one arm, it is uncorrelated to when all other arms switch.\nExamples of this form of changing environment might include stock market data where stock prices can change their statistical nature very quickly subject to external events. Switching behaviour has been studied in Financial Markets [Preis et al., 2011], and multi-armed bandits have been applied to this field before [Sorensen, 2007]."

In a switching system the arm which is considered optimal changes. In this case a different form of regret is often used. Garivier and Moulines [2008] use the following definition of regret.\nR(T ) =< T∑ t=0 (µ∗t − µit) >, (4)\nwhere µ∗t is the highest expected payoff of an arm at time t and where < . > denotes expectation over possible sequences of {µit}.

If we did we could just do the same Bayesian update as with the standard Bernoulli case to arrive at the distribution of our model. Since we do not know the runlength rt we can introduce it as a latent variable and marginalise it out.

They show exact inference on the runlength can be achieved by a simple message passing algorithm. Letting xt be the reward at time t so that Dt = xt ∪Dt−1. The inference procedure can be easily derived as follows.\nP (rt|xt−1, Dt−2) = P (rt, xt−1, Dt−2)\nP (xt−1, Dt−2) (7)\nThe numerator can then be expressed as\nP (rt, xt−1, Dt−2) = ∑ rt−1 P (rt, rt−1, xt−1, Dt−2) (8)\n= ∑ rt−1 P (rt, xt−1|rt−1, Dt−2)P (rt−1, Dt−2) (9) = ∑ rt−1 switching rate︷ ︸︸ ︷ P (rt|rt−1) reward likelihood︷ ︸︸ ︷ P (xt−1|rt−1, Dt−2)P (rt−1, Dt−2). (10)\nThe derivation just applies the rules of probability up to and including equation 9. One assumption is made in equation 10, that the runlength is only dependent on the previous time steps runlength. This forms a simple message passing algorithm because rt can only take values depending on rt−1. In fact rt = rt−1 + 1 when switching does not occur and rt = 0 when it does. P (rt|rt−1) is defined by a hazard function h(t). For simplicity in our case this is a constant switching rate γ.\nUnfortunately the exact inference has space and time requirements that grow linearly in time. The space requirements are linear because at each time step the support set of the posterior runlength distribution increases by one, which means we have to store information for an extra value of the runlength at every step. The update is also linear in time, as the message passing algorithm requires an update to each runlength in the support. Adams and MacKay suggest a simple thresholding technique to eliminate runlengths with small probability mass associated with them. As we can only know in expectation how much memory this algorithm will require, an alternative with hard guarantees on memory requirements is desirable. Fearnhead and Liu suggest a much more sophisticated particle filter resampling step to maintain a finite sample of the runlength distribution, which has the benefit that we can be certain on the upper limit of space the algorithm requires, this approach is the one taken in this paper."

We wish to reduce a discrete probability distribution with a support of N discrete points down to a stochastic distribution of M discrete points, where the set of M points is a subset of the original N . The original N points each have probability mass pi associated with them, and the procedure finds a reweighting of these probabilities, qi such that N −M of the probabilities are 0. The idea is that we wish there to be no bias in the sampling procedure, which means that the expected value of qi should be the original probability mass pi. The algorithm is optimal in the sense that the expected squared difference between the original probabilities pi and the new weights qi are minimised.\nThis can be done by the following procedure;\n1. Find κ such that M = ∑N i=1 min(1, pi/κ)\n2. Sample u from uniform distribution, U(0, κ)\n3. Iterate through all pi\n(a) If pi > κ Then qi = pi\n(b) Otherwise\ni. u = u− pi ii.

Only one runlength distribution needs to be inferred for Global Switching, which does not depend on the number of arms the bandit has. The Per-Arm model can store the runlengths for each arm independent, and the space requirements grow linearly with respect to the number of arms. Other models with more complicated dependencies between arms can quickly become intractable."

      "text" : "In global switching there is a single change point process across all of the arms since when one arm switches distribution so do all other arms. This means that the data from every arm pull contributes to the posterior of the single runlength distribution. Effectively to sample from the posterior of the full bandit model, we first need to sample from the runlength distribution, this gives us an estimate of the runlength, which tells us how much data from the past our arms can use. Once the global runlength is sampled, we then proceed by sampling individually from the posterior distributions of the arms, given only the data since the last changepoint (determined by the runlength). The arm with the corresponding maximum sample is then pulled. We only need to store the posterior probabilities of the given runlengths and the hyperparameters for the arm posteriors associated with those runlengths. We will call the runlength distribution the Change Point model, and the set of hyperparameters associated with each runlength for a given action the Arm model. The Change Point model is an approximation of the runlength distribution storing a probability for at most N runlengths. Let wti be the probability of having a runlength of i at time t. In this paper the arm rewards are assumed to come from a Bernoulli distribution so the hyperparameters stored are the 2 parameters for the Beta distribution. Let αti,j and β t i,j be the hyperparameters for a runlength of i at time t for arm j. At any point in time t there is a set of runlengths Rt ⊂ N, |Rt| ≤ N , where for every r ∈ Rt there exists quantities wtr, α t r,j and β t r,j . When |Rt| = N then a resampling step is performed in order to reduce the number of runlengths stored. For ease of notation let {w}t be the set of runlength probabilities at time t and let {α}tj and {β}tj be the sets of hyperparameters for arm j at time t. Similarly let {α}t and {β}t be the set of all hyperparameters at time t. The algorithm is presented in pseudocode in figure 1.\nWe will refer to this algorithm as Global Change-Point Thompson Sampling (Global-CTS)."

Wilson et al. method can learn a hazard function that is piecewise constant via a hierarchical generative model. Turner et al. can learn any parametric hazard rate via gradient descent, but from initial investigations appeared to not perform particularly well if the hazard rate is adapted at every time step. For the purposes of this paper, a constant switching rate was assumed which was learned using the approach of Wilson et al. For the simplest case where we consider a single constant switch rate, Wilson et al. model whether a change point occurred as a Bernoulli variable. The hyperparameters of this switching rate are those of a Beta distribution and can be thought of as the number of times the system has switched, at and the number of times it not switched bt. We now compute the joint distribution P (rt, at|xt−1, Dt−2) as oppose to the original distribution P (rt|xt−1, Dt−2). The message passing proceeds in a very similar fashion as before, except now the number of particles also grows quadratically rather than linearly.

With Per-Arms there are many possibilities, there could be a single switching rate for each of the independent arms, or each arm could have a separate switching rate. In this paper we assume each arm has a separate switching rate and call this algorithm Non-Parametric Per-Arm Change-Point Thompson Sampling (NP PA-CTS)."

      "text" : "The algorithms presented so far attempt to track changes in all arms, irrespective of whether they are pulled. The distribution of θi for an arm not pulled will slowly become flatter and thus have higher variance. One of the stated assumptions of Adapt-EvE, was that it was only important to track whether the perceived best arm has changed distribution. We can modify the algorithms to better replicate this assumption. The model for the Per-Arm Switching is adapted most simply. Since both the Change Point models and the Arm models are independent for each arm, we can track the change of the best arm by only updating the Change Point and Arm models for the arm that was pulled. For the Global Switching model the change is not so clear since all arms share a Change Point model. In this paper we updated the shared Change Point model and only updated the Arm model for the arm pulled. The question then arises what should the hyperparameters for the unpulled arms be that are associated with the new runlength of zero. The approach taken here was to set them to the hyperparameters associated with a random other runlength in the distribution. We can apply the sample method from Wilson to infer the switching rate for\nthese architectures as well.

In the case of the PA-CTS and NP PA-CTS there are 2 plots for each algorithm, corresponding to the runlength distribution for each arm. The pay off of the 2 arms has been superimposed over the top of the plots so that it can be seen how the runlength distribution matches up with the changes in the environment From the heatmap figures we can see the change point prediction works when applied to a bandit problem. As expected the change point distribution looks to be more accurate for the Global-CTS and NP Global-CTS algorithms which use the Global Switching model, this is because each data point can contribute to the posterior runlength distribution. The PA-CTS also performs reasonably well even though the amount of data that has influence on each posterior is reduced.

The challenge is a good general test for the algorithms presented in this paper as to perform well it was required for the bandit algorithms to be able to work in non-stationary environments.

Given context of a user the goal is to select an article to present to the user as to maximise the expected rate at which users click on the article to read more (click-through). The articles also change during the dataset, and so bandit algorithms designed specifically for this environment also need the ability to modify the number of arms they can select from. For the purposes of our experiments we do not concern ourselves with the contextual case, nor do we try to incorporate new articles as they arrive. Instead we ignore the context, and we only pick from a set number of articles. This reduces the problem to a conventional multi-armed bandit problem. To maximise the amount of data used, for each run we randomly selected the set of articles (in our case 5 articles) from a list of 100 permutations of possible articles which overlapped in time the most. The click-through rates were estimated from the data by taking the mean of an articles click-through rate every 1000 time ticks. The simulation then proceeded as described by Li et al.

It was imagined that the agent could make fictitious trades, and could either decide to buy a long call option (if they believe the rate will increase) and a short call option (if they believe the rate will go down). To turn this into a Bernoulli bandit problem, we ignore the scale of the change and provide a reward of 1 if the bandit predicted correctly the rate going up/down and 0 otherwise. When the rate remains the same, the agent receives a reward of 0 irrespective of their decision. For the purpose of the experiment we imagine the option length is 100 time ticks, so that the agent has to decide if the exchange rate will increase or decrease in 100 time ticks. Although this bandit scenario is not true to life, we believe that the underlying data should exhibit\nsome of the characteristics of a switching system for which the algorithms were designed [Preis et al., 2011]. We can not estimate a “true” average payoff at each timestep, and so can not measure the regret of these algorithms, instead we report the error. The results are shown in table 6."

      "text" : "This paper has explored several algorithms using Thompson Sampling in conjunction with Change Point detection. We have shown that they perform well in the environments for which they are designed. Bandit scenarios based on real-world data such as the Yahoo! dataset and the Foreign Exchange also demonstrate their performance. They are shown not to perform as well as appropriately tuned competing algorithms in the PASCAL challenge. However our results suggest that a strategy that just tracks changes in the perceived best arm (Global-CTS2,PA-CTS2), similar to Adapt-EvE, works well. Since the model is extremely modular it is hoped that further assumptions can be incorporated into the model to improve performance. It is also worth noting that non-Bernoulli payoffs can just as easily be used, e.g. Normal distributed payoffs. A Bayesian approach also avoids difficulties that arise with handling false alarms in change point detection schemes. The algorithms have been derived from simple models and so are theoretically motivated, however steps still need to be taken to provide any theoretic justification for their performance."

This bandit problem assumes stationary distributions for the rewards. It is often unrealistic to model the real world as a stationary distribution. In this paper we derive and evaluate algorithms using Thompson Sampling for a Switching Multi-Armed Bandit Problem. We propose a Thompson Sampling strategy equipped with a Bayesian change point mechanism to tackle this problem. We develop algorithms for a variety of cases with constant switching rate: when switching occurs all arms change (Global Switching), switching occurs independently for each arm (Per-Arm Switching), when the switching rate is known and when it must be inferred from data. This leads to a family of algorithms we collectively term Change-Point Thompson Sampling (CTS). We show empirical results of the algorithm in 4 artificial environments, and 2 derived from real world data; news click-through[Yahoo!, 2011] and foreign exchange data[Dukascopy, 2012], comparing them to some other bandit algorithms. In real world data CTS is the most effective.",
