      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Online learning in stochastic environments is a sequential decision problem where in each time step a learner chooses an action from a given finite set, observes some random feedback and receives a random payoff. Several feedback models have been considered in the literature: The simplest is the full information case where the learner observes the payoff of all possible actions at the end of every round. A popular setup is the case of bandit feedback, where the learner only observes its own payoff and receives no information about the payoff of other actions [1]. Recently, several papers considered a more refined setup, called graph-structured feedback, that interpolates between the full-information and the bandit case: here the feedback structure is described by a (directed) graph, and choosing an action reveals the payoff of all actions that are connected to the selected one, including the chosen action itself. This problem, motivated for example by social networks, has been studied extensively in both the adversarial [2, 3, 4, 5] and the stochastic cases [6, 7]. However, most algorithms presented heavily depend on the self-observability assumption (that is, that the payoff of the selected action can be observed). Removing this self-loop assumption leads to the so-called partial monitoring case [5]. In the absolutely general partial monitoring setup the learner receives some general feedback that depends on its choice (and the environment), with some arbitrary (but known) dependence [8, 9]. While the partial monitoring setup covers all other problems, its analysis has concentrated on the finite case where both the set of actions and the set of feedback signals are finite [8, 9], which is in contrast to the standard full information and bandit settings where the feedback is typically assumed to be real-valued. The only exception to this case is the work of [5], which considers graph-structured feedback without the self-loop assumption.\nIn this paper we consider a generalization of the graph-structured feedback model that can also be viewed as a general partial monitoring model with real-valued feedback. We assume that selecting an action i the learner can observe a random variable Xij for each action j whose mean is the same as the payoff of j, but its variance σ2ij depends on the pair (i, j). For simplicity, throughout the paper\nwe assume that all the payoffs and the Xij are Gaussian. While in the graph-structured feedback case one either has observation on an action or not, but the observation always gives the same amount of information, our model is more refined: Depending on the value of σij , the information can be of different quality. For example, if σ2ij = ∞, trying action i gives no information about action j. In general, for any σ2ij < ∞, the value of the information depends on the time horizon T of the problem: when σ2ij is large relative to 1/ √ T (and the payoff differences of the actions) essentially no information is received, while a small variance results in useful observations.\nAfter defining the problem formally in Section 2, we provide non-asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds in Section 3, which depend on the distribution of the observations through their mean payoffs and variances. To our knowledge, these are the first such bounds presented for any stochastic partial monitoring problem beyond the full-information setting: previous work either presented asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds (e.g., [10, 7]), or finite-time minimax bounds (e.g., [9, 3, 5]). Our bounds can recover all previous bounds up to some universal constant factors not depending on the problem. In Section 4, we present two algorithms with finite-time performance guarantees for the case of graph-structured feedback without the self-observability assumption. While due to their complicated forms it is hard to compare our finite-time upper and lower bounds, we show that our first algorithm achieves the asymptotic problem-dependent lower bound up to problem-independent multiplicative factors. Regarding the minimax regret, the hardness (Θ̃(T 1/2) or Θ̃(T 2/3) regret) of partial monitoring problems is characterized by their global/local observability property [9] or, in case of the graph-structured feedback model, by their strong/weak observability property [5]. In the same section we present another algorithm that achieves the minimax regret (up to logarithmic factors) under both strong and weak observability, and achieves an O(log3/2 T ) problem-dependent regret. Earlier results for the stochastic graph-structured feedback problems [6, 7] provided only asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds and performance bounds that did not match the asymptotic lower bounds or the minimax rate up to constant factors. Finally, we draw conclusions and consider some interesting future directions in Section 5. Due to space constraints, all proofs are deferred to the appendix."

      "heading" : "2 Problem Formulation",
      "text" : "Formally, we consider an online learning problem with Gaussian payoffs and side observations: Suppose a learner has to choose from K actions in every round. When choosing an action, the learner receives a random payoff and also some side observations corresponding to other actions. More precisely, each action i ∈ [K] = {1, . . . ,K} is associated with some parameter θi, and the payoff Yt,i to action i in round t is normally distributed random variable with mean θi and variance σ2ii, while the learner observes a K-dimensional Gaussian random vector Xt,i whose jth coordinate is a normal random variable with mean θj and variance σ2ij (we assume σij ≥ 0) and the coordinates of Xt,i are independent of each other. We assume the following: (i) the random variables (Xt, Yt)t are independent for all t; (ii) the parameter vector θ is unknown to the learner but it knows the variance matrix Σ = (σ2ij)i,j∈[K] in advance; (iii) θ ∈ [0, D]K for some D > 0 ; (iv) mini∈[K] σij ≤ σ < ∞ for all j ∈ [K], that is, the expected payoff of each action can be observed.\nThe goal of the learner is to maximize its payoff or, in other words, minimize the expected regret\nRT = T max i∈[K]\nθi − T∑\nt=1\nE [Yt,it ]\nwhere it is the action selected by the learner in round t.\nNote that the problem encompasses several common feedback models considered in online learning (modulo the Gaussian assumption), and makes it possible to examine more delicate observation structures:\nFull information: σij = σj < ∞ for all i, j ∈ [K]. Bandit: σii < ∞ and σij = ∞ for all i 6= j ∈ [K]. Partial monitoring with feedback graphs [5]: Each action i ∈ [K] is associated with an observa-\ntion set Si ⊂ [K] such that σij = σj if j ∈ Si and σij = ∞ otherwise.\nWe will call the uniform variance version of these problems when all the finite σij are equal to some σ ≥ 0. Some interesting features of the problem can be seen when considering the generalized full information case , when all entries of Σ are finite. In this case, the greedy algorithm, which estimates the payoff of each action by the average of the corresponding observed samples and selects the one with the highest average, achieves at most a constant regret for any time horizon T .1 On the other hand, the constant can be quite large: in particular, when the variance of some observations are large relative to the gaps dj = maxi θi − θj , the situation is rather similar to a partial monitoring setup for a smaller, finite time horizon. In this paper we are going to analyze this problem and present algorithms and lower bounds that are able to “interpolate” between these cases and capture the characteristics of the different regimes."

      "heading" : "3 Lower Bounds",
      "text" : "The aim of this section is to derive generic, problem-dependent lower bounds to the regret, which are also able to provide minimax lower bounds. The hardness in deriving such bounds is that for any fixed θ and Σ, the dumb algorithm that always selects i1(θ) achieves zero regret (the regret of this algorithm is linear for any θ′ with i1(θ) 6= i1(θ′)), so in general it is not possible to give a lower bound for a single instance. When deriving asymptotic lower bounds, this is circumvented by only considering consistent algorithms whose regret is sub-polynomial for any problem [10]. However, this asymptotic notion of consistency is not applicable to finite-horizon problems. Therefore, following [11], for any problem we create a family of related problems (by perturbing the mean payoffs) such that if the regret of an algorithm is “too small” in one of the problems than it will be “large” in another one.\nAs a warm-up, and to show the reader what form of a lower bound can be expected, first we present an asymptotic lower bound for the uniform-variance version of the problem of partial monitoring with feedback graphs. The result presented below is an easy consequence of [10], hence its proof is omitted. An algorithm is said to be consistent if supθ∈ΘRT (θ) = o(T\nγ) for every γ > 0. Now assume for simplicity that there is a unique optimal action in environment θ, that is, θi1(θ) > θi for all i 6= i1 and let\nCθ =   c ∈ [0,∞) K : ∑\ni:j∈Si ci ≥\n2σ2\nd2j (θ) ∀j 6= i1(θ) ,\n∑\ni:i1(θ)∈Si ci ≥\n2σ2\nd2i2(θ)(θ)\n   .\nThen, for any consistent algorithm and for any θ with θi1(θ) > θi2(θ),\nlim inf T→∞\nRT (θ)\nlogT ≥ inf c∈Cθ 〈c, d(θ)〉 . (1)\nNote that the right hand side of (1) is 0 for any generalized full information problem (recall that the expected regret is bounded by a constant for such problems), but it is a finite positive number\n1To see this, notice that the error of identifying the optimal action decays exponentially with the number of rounds.\nfor other problems. Similar bounds have been provided in [6, 7] for graph-structured feedback with self-observability (under non-Gaussian assumptions on the payoffs). In the following we derive finite time lower bounds that are also able to replicate this result."

Clearly, f(θ, q, θ′) is a lower bound on RT (θ′) for any algorithm for which the distribution of N(T ) is q.

If B is picked as the minimax value of the problem given the observation structure Σ, the theorem states that for any minimax optimal algorithm the expected regret for a certain θ is lower bounded by b(θ,B)."

      "text" : "Now we introduce a relaxed but more interpretable version of the finite-time lower bound of Theorem 1, which can be shown to match the asymptotic lower bound (1). The idea of deriving the lower bound is the following: instead of ensuring that the algorithm performs well in the most adversarial environment θ′, we consider a set of “bad” environments and make sure that the algorithm performs well on them, where each “bad” environment θ′ is the most adversarial one by only perturbing one coordinate θi of θ.\nHowever, in order to get meaningful finite-time lower bounds, we need to perturb θ more carefully than in the case of asymptotic lower bounds. The reason for this is that for any sub-optimal action i, if θi is very close to θi1(θ), then E [Ni(T ); θ] is not necessarily small for a good algorithm for θ. If it is small, one can increase θi to obtain an environment θ′ where i is the best action and the algorithm performs bad; otherwise, when E [Ni(T ); θ] is large, we need to decrease θi to make the algorithm perform badly in θ′. Moreover, when perturbing θi to be better than θi1(θ), we cannot make θ ′ i−θi1(θ) arbitrarily small as in asymptotic lower-bound arguments, because when θ′i − θi1(θ) is small, large E [ Ni1(θ); θ\n′] and not necessarily large E [Ni(T ); θ′] may lead to low finite-time regret in θ′. In the following we make this argument precise to obtain an interpretable lower bound."

      "text" : "We considered a novel partial-monitoring setup with Gaussian side observations, which generalizes the recently introduced setting of graph-structured feedback, allowing finer quantification of the observed information from one action to another. We provided non-asymptotic problem-dependent\nlower bounds that imply existing asymptotic problem-dependent and non-asymptotic minimax lower bounds (up to some constant factors) beyond the full information case. We also provided an algorithm that achieves the asymptotic problem-dependent lower bound (up to some universal constants) and another algorithm that achieves the minimax bounds under both weak and strong observability.\nHowever, we think this is just the beginning. For example, we currently have no algorithm that achieves both the problem dependent and the minimax lower bounds at the same time. Also, our upper bounds only correspond to the graph-structured feedback case. It is of great interest to go beyond the weak/strong observability in characterizing the harness of the problem, and provide algorithms that can adapt to any correspondence between the mean payoffs an the variances (the hardness is that one needs to identify suboptimal actions with good information/cost trade-off)."

Let q, q′ ∈ ∆|C N T | denote\nthe joint distribution over the number of plays for each action under environment θ and θ′ ∈ Θ, respectively, that is, q(a) = Pr (N(T ) = a; θ) and q′(a) = Pr (N(T ) = a; θ′) for each a ∈ CNT . For any a ∈ CNT , applying a standard change of measure equality (see, e.g., [13, Lemma 15]), we obtain\nq′(a) = Pr (N(T ) = a; θ′) = E [I {N(T ) = a} exp(−LT ); θ] = E [I {N(T ) = a}E [exp(−LT )|N(T ) = a; θ] ; θ] ≥ E [I {N(T ) = a} exp (E [−LT |N(T ) = a; θ]) ; θ] = Pr (N(T ) = a; θ) exp (E [−LT |N(T ) = a; θ]) = q(a) exp (E [−LT |N(T ) = a; θ]) .\nThus E [LT |N(T ) = a; θ] ≥ log q(a)q′(a) and so ∑ i∈[K] E [Ni(T ); θ] Ii(θ, θ ′) = E [LT ; θ]\n= ∑\na∈CNT\nPr (N(T ) = a; θ)E [LT |N(T ) = a; θ] ≥ ∑\na∈CNT\nq(a) log q(a)\nq′(a) ,\nwhere E [Ni(T ); θ] = ∑\na∈CNT q(a)ai. Therefore, according to the definition of f(θ, q, θ ′), we\nhave f(θ, q, θ′) ≤ ∑a∈CNT q ′(a) 〈a, d(θ′)〉 = RT (θ′) for any θ′ ∈ Θ. Then supθ′∈Θ f(θ, q, θ′) ≤\nsupθ′∈Θ RT (θ ′) ≤ B must hold. Since E [N(T ); θ] = ∑a∈CNT q(a)a we have g(θ,E [N(T ); θ]) ≤ supθ′∈Θ f(θ, q, θ ′) ≤ B. Thus E [N(T ); θ] ∈ Cθ,B and so RT (θ) ≥ b(θ,B), which concludes the proof of Theorem 1.\nA.2 Proof of Corollary 3\nWe start the proof with two technical lemmas on the Lambert W function.\nLemma 12. Let a, b > 0 with ab < 1 and f(x) = 1x2 log ((x+ a)b) for x > 0. Then f(x) ≤ f(x∗) for all x > 0 where\nx∗ =\n√ e\nb e W\n(\n− ab 2 √ e\n)\n− a .\nLemma 13. Let a, b > 0 and f(x) = 1x2 log ((x − a)b) for x > a. Then f(x) ≤ f(x∗) for all x > a where\nx∗ =\n√ e\nb e W\n(\nab 2 √ e\n)\n+ a .\nProof of Lemma 13.\nf ′(x) = x−3\nx− a (x− 2(x− a) log ((x− a)b)) .\nLet g(y) = y + a− 2y log by defined on y > 0. g′(y) = −2 log yb− 1\nSo g(y) is increasing when 0 < y < 1 b √ e and decreasing when y > 1 b √ e .\nSince limy→0 g(y) = a > 0 and limy→+∞ g(y) = −∞ we know that there exists a unique y∗ > 0 such that g(y∗) = 0, g(y) > 0 for 0 < y < y∗ and g(y) < 0 for y > y∗. It can be verified that y∗ = x∗ − a = √ e b e W ( ab 2 √ e )\nsatisfies g(y∗) = 0. Therefore f ′(x) > 0 when a < x < x∗ and f ′(x) < 0 when x > x∗. Since f(x) is continuous when x > a we have proved that f(x) ≤ f(x∗) for all x > a.\nProof of Corollary 3. To prove the corollary, it suffices to show b′(θ,B) ≤ b(θ,B). Define C′θ,B = { c ∈ CRT : ∑K j=1\ncj σ2ji\n≥ mi(θ,B) , ∀i ∈ [K] }\n. We will prove Cθ,B ⊂ C′θ,B by showing that if c ∈ CRT satisfies g(θ, c) ≤ B then c ∈ C′θ,B .\nFor c ∈ CRT , if g(θ, c) ≤ B, then there exists q ∈ ∆|C N T | such that supθ′∈Θ f(θ, q, θ ′) ≤ B and∑\na∈CNT q(a)a = c. We will next derive K constraints on c to show that c ∈ C′θ,B by picking\ndifferent θ′s. Before proceeding with the proof, we introduce the following technical lemma:\nLemma 14. For any A ⊂ CNT and q, q′ ∈ ∆|C N T |, if q(A) ≥ 1/2 then ∑\na∈CNT\nq(a) log q(a) q′(a) ≥ 1 2 log 1 4q′(A) ,\nwhere q′(A) = ∑\na∈A q ′(a).\nProof. Let Ac = CNT −A. By the log-sum inequality we have ∑\na∈CNT\nq(a) log q(a) q′(a) ≥ KL(q(A), q′(A)) , (3)\nwhere for x, y ∈ [0, 1], KL(x, y) = x log(x/y) + (1 − x) log((1 − x)/(1 − y)) denotes the binary KL-divergence. Now for such x, y, since x log x + (1 − x) log(1 − x) is minimized for x = 1/2, we have\nKL(x, y) ≥ log 1 2 + x log 1 y + (1− x) log( 1 1− y ) ≥ log 1 2 + 1 2 log 1 y = 1 2 log 1 4y .\nCombining with (3) proves the lemma.\nNow we continue the proof of Corollary 3. First consider i 6= i1(θ). If ∑\na:ai≤T/2 q(a) ≥ 1/2, construct θ(i,+) by replacing θi with θi + ǫi,+. Then f(θ, q, θ(i,+)) ≤ B holds, so there exists q′ ∈ ∆|CNT | such that ∑a∈CNT q ′(a) 〈 a, d(θ(i,+)) 〉 ≤ B and ∑ a∈CNT q(a) log q(a)q′(a) ≤ ∑ j∈[K] cjIj(θ, θ (i,+)). Applying Lemma 14 with A = {a : ai ≤ T/2} gives ∑\nj∈[K] cjIj(θ, θ\n(i,+)) ≥ 1 2 log 1 4q′(A) ,\nwhere\nq′(A) = ∑\na∈CNT\nI\n \n ∑\nj 6=i aj ≥ T/2\n   q ′(a) ≤ 2 T ∑\na∈CNT\nq′(a) ∑\nj 6=i aj\n= 2 T (ǫi,+ − di(θ)) ∑\na∈CNT\nq′(a) ∑\nj 6=i aj(ǫi,+ − di(θ))\n≤ 2 T (ǫi,+ − di(θ))\n∑\na∈CNT\nq′(a) 〈 a, d(θ(i,+)) 〉\n≤ 2B T (ǫi,+ − di(θ)) .\nSince Ij(θ, θ(i,+)) = ǫ2i,+/2σ 2 ji, we get\n∑\nj∈[K]\ncj σ2ji ≥ 1 ǫ2i,+ log T (ǫi,+ − di(θ)) 8B . (4)\nIf ∑\na:ai≤T/2 q(a) < 1/2 and di(θ) ≥ 4B/T , then\nf(θ, q, θ) = ∑\na∈CNT\nq(a) 〈a, d(θ)〉 ≥ ∑\na∈CNT\nq(a)aidi(θ)\n≥ di(θ) ∑\na∈CNT\nI {ai ≥ T/2} q(a)ai\n≥ 4B T T 2\n∑\na∈CNT\nI {ai ≥ T/2} q(a) > B ,\nwhich contradicts the fact that supθ′∈Θ f(θ, q, θ ′) ≤ B.

Then there exists q′ ∈ ∆|CNT | such that ∑a∈CNT q ′(a) 〈 a, d(θ(i,−)) 〉 ≤ B and ∑a∈CNT q(a) log q(a) q′(a) ≤∑\nj∈[K] cjIj(θ, θ (i,−)). Applying Lemma 14 with A = {a : ai ≥ T/2} and\nq′(A) = ∑\na∈CNT\nI {ai ≥ T/2} q′(a) ≤ 2 T (ǫi,− − di2(θ)(θ)) ∑\na∈CNT\nq′(a)ai(ǫi,− − di2(θ)(θ)) ≤ 2B\nT (ǫi,− − di2(θ)(θ))\ngives\n∑\nj∈[K]\ncj σ2ji ≥ 1 ǫ2i,−\nlog T (ǫi,− − di2(θ)(θ))\n8B .

If ∑\na:ai≥T/2 q(a) < 1/2 and di2(θ)(θ) < 4B/T , construct θ (i,+) by replacing θi with\nθi + ǫi,+. Then there exists q′ ∈ ∆|C N T | such that ∑\na∈CNT q′(a)\n〈 a, d(θ(i,+)) 〉 ≤ B and\n∑ a∈CNT q(a) log q(a) q′(a) ≤ ∑ j∈[K] cjIj(θ, θ\n(i,+)).

(7)\nCombining (4) (5) (6) (7) gives c ∈ C′θ,B, which concludes the proof.\nA.3 Proof of Corollary 4\nProof of Corollary 4. Define ǫ = 8eBT . First consider the case that Σ is strongly observable. If the maximum independence number κ(Σ) ≥ 2, there exists an independent set Aκ ⊂ [K] such that |Aκ| = κ(Σ). We construct θ as follows: Let θi1 = D/2 for some i1 ∈ Aκ and θi = D/2− ǫ for i ∈ Aκ \\ {i1}. For the remaining i /∈ Aκ, let θi = 0. Note that each i in Aκ must be self observable since otherwise it is a weakly observable action. Also in Aκ i can be observed only by itself according to the definition of independent sets.\nThen we will lower bound b′(θ,B). According to our choice of ǫ, we have\n8 √ eB\nT e W\n(\nǫT 16 √ eB\n)\n+ ǫ = 2ǫ .\nTherefore, for i = i1 we have ǫi,− = 2ǫ and ǫi,+ = 2ǫ for i ∈ Aκ \\ {i1}. Thus for any i ∈ Aκ,\nmi(θ,B) = 1\n4ǫ2 log\nT ǫ 8B = 1 4ǫ2 .\nRecall that we defined C′θ,B = { c ∈ CRT : ∑ j:i∈Sj cj ≥ σ2mi(θ,B) , ∀i ∈ [K] } and b′(θ,B) = infc∈C′θ,B 〈c, d(θ)〉. For any c ∈ C′θ,B , let a = ∑\ni/∈Aκ ci. Then we have for any i ∈ Aκ,∑ j:i∈Sj cj ≤ a+ ci and thus ci ≥ σ2mi(θ,B)−a = σ2\n4ǫ2 −a. Since di(θ) = ǫ for all i ∈ Aκ \\{i1} and di(θ) = D/2 for all i /∈ Aκ, we get\n〈c, d(θ)〉 = ∑\ni∈Aκ\\{i1} ciǫ +\naD\n2 ≥ (κ(Σ)− 1)\n( σ2\n4ǫ2 − a\n) ǫ+ aD\n2\n≥ κ(Σ) 2\n( σ2\n4ǫ2 − a\n) ǫ + aD\n2 =\nκ(Σ)σ2\n8ǫ + D − κ(Σ)ǫ 2 a\n≥ κ(Σ)σ 2\n8ǫ (8)\nif κ(Σ)ǫ < D. Applying our particular choice of ǫ and B, we get the conclusion that for T ≥ 64e2α2σ2κ(Σ)3\nD2 , b ′(θ,B) ≥ σ\n√ κ(Σ)T\n64eα .\nIf κ(Σ) = 1, since we exclude the full information case, there always exists a pair of actions i1 and i2 such that i2 /∈ Si1 (here i1 6= i2 is not necessary). We construct θ by setting θi1 = D/2 and θi = D/2 − ǫ for all i 6= i1. Then mi(θ,B) = 14ǫ2 holds for all i ∈ [K]. For any c ∈ C′θ,B , let a =\n∑ i6=i1 ci, then ∑ j:i2∈Sj cj ≤ a. Hence a ≥ σ2mi2(θ,B) = σ2 4ǫ2 and\n〈c, d(θ)〉 = aǫ ≥ σ 2\n4ǫ >\nκ(Σ)σ2\n8ǫ . (9)\nCombining (8) and (9) gives the first part of Corollary 4.\nNow we turn to the case that Σ is weakly observable. The idea of constructing the worst θ comes from the proof of Theorem 7 in [5] which based on the following graph-theoretic lemma:\nLemma 15 (Restated from Lemma 8 in [5]). Let G = (V,E) be a directed graph with K vertices and let W ⊂ V be a subset of vertices with domination number ρ. Then there exists an independent set U ⊂ W with the property that |U | ≥ ρ50 logK and any vertex of G dominates at most logK vertices of U .\nLet W(Σ) ⊂ [K] be the set of all weakly observable actions. By Lemma 15 we know that there exists an independent set Aρ ⊂ W(Σ) such that |Aρ| ≥ ρ(Σ)50 logK and for any i ∈ [K], |Si ∩ U | ≤ logK .\nIf ρ(Σ) ≥ 100 logK such that |Aρ| ≥ 2, we can construct θ as follows: Let θi1 = D/2 for some i1 ∈ Aρ and θi = D/2− ǫ for i ∈ Aρ \\{i1}. For the remaining i /∈ Aρ, let θi = 0. Note that actions in Aρ cannot be observed by any action inside Aρ. For any c ∈ C′θ,B , let a = ∑ i/∈Aρ ci. Since for\nany i, |Si ∩ U | ≤ logK , we have ∑ i∈Aρ ∑ j:i∈Sj cj ≤ a logK and\na logK ≥ |Aρ| min i∈Aρ\n∑\nj:i∈Sj cj ≥ |Aρ| min i∈Aρ σ2mi(θ,B) ≥\nρ(Σ)σ2\n200 logKǫ2 .\nTherefore,\n〈c, d(θ)〉 ≥ aD 2 ≥ ρ(Σ)σ 2D 200ǫ2 log2 K =\n(ρ(Σ)D)1/3(σT )2/3 log−2/3 K\n12800e2α2 . (10)\nIf ρ(Σ) < 100 logK , then we pick a weakly observable action as i2. There must be another action i1 such that i2 /∈ Si1 due to the definition of weakly observable actions. Then we set θ as θi1 = D/2, θi2 = D/2 − ǫ and θi = 0 for the remaining actions. So for any c ∈ C′θ,B , let a = ∑ i6=i1,i2 ci ≥ σ2mi2(θ,B). Then\n〈c, d(θ)〉 ≥ aD 2 ≥ σ 2mi2(θ,B)D 2 = Dσ2 8ǫ2 = D1/3(σT )2/3 512e2α2 · log 4/3 K ρ(Σ)2/3\n≥ (ρ(Σ)D) 1/3(σT )2/3 log−2/3 K\n51200e2α2 . (11)\nIn the last step we used the fact that K ≥ 3 for any weakly observable Σ. Combining (10) and (11) gives the second part of Corollary 4."

According to the algorithm we have ne(t) = ∑t−1\ns=K+1 I {W cs } for t > K , we then proceed by the following proposition: Proposition 17. For K < t1 < t2, if ∑t2−1\ns=t1 I {W cs , Ys} ≥ K , then mini∈[K] ni(t2) ≥\nmini∈[K] ni(t1) + 1.\nProof of Proposition 17. If for such t1 and t2, mini∈[K] ni(t2) = mini∈[K] ni(t1), then there must exist j such that nj(t1) = nj(t2) and nj(s) = mini∈[K] ni(s) for all t1 ≤ s ≤ t2. Since∑t2−1\ns=t1 I {W cs , Ys} ≥ K , there exist K instants t1 ≤ s1 < s2 < ... < sK ≤ t2 − 1 such that{\nW csk , Ysk }\nhappens for 1 ≤ k ≤ K . According to the algorithm, for each sk, there exists j′ 6= j such that j′ ∈ Sisk and nj′(sk) = nj(sk) = mini∈[K] ni(sk). Note that each action appears at most once as such j′ for 1 ≤ k ≤ K since nj′(sk + 1) = nj′ (sk) + 1, but there are only K − 1 actions other than j, which means such j cannot exist. Hence mini∈[K] ni(t2) ≥ mini∈[K] ni(t1) + 1 is proved.\nNow we define\nt′ = max {K + 1 ≤ t ≤ T : W ct , Yt} . If such t′ does not exist, then (18) must hold.

To bound ∑T\nt=K+1 E [I {Ut,W ct , Y ct , V ct }], we first introduce two lemmas from [14] (Lemma 2.1 and 2.2):\nLemma 18. Let {Zt}t∈N+ be a sequence of independent random variables from N (0, σ2). Define Ft the σ-algebra generated by {Zs}s≤t and the filtration F = (Ft)t∈N+ . Consider r, n0 ∈ N+ and T ≥ n0. Define Yt = ∑t−1 s=n0\nBsZs where Bt ∈ {0, 1} is an Ft−1-measurable random variable. Further define n(t) =\n∑t−1 s=n0\nBs and φ an F -stopping time which satisfies either n(φ) ≥ r or φ = T + 1.\nThen we have\nPr (|Yφ| > n(φ)ǫ, φ ≤ T ) ≤ 2 exp ( − rǫ 2\n2σ2\n) .\nLemma 19. Define Ft the σ-algebra generated by {Xi,s}s∈[t],i∈[K]. Let Λ ⊂ [1, T ] ∩ N be a set of (random) time instants. Assume there exists a sequence of (random) sets {Λs}0≤s≤T such that (i) Λ ⊂ ∪0≤s≤TΛs, (ii) for all 0 ≤ s ≤ T , |Λs| ≤ 1, (iii) for all 0 ≤ s ≤ T , if t ∈ Λs then ni(t) ≥ β(s)/K , and (iv) the event {t ∈ Λs} is Ft measurable. Then for any ǫ > 0 and i ∈ [K]:\nE\n[ T∑\nt=1\nI { t ∈ Λ, |θ̂i,t − θi| > ǫ }] ≤ T∑\ns=0\n2 exp ( −β(s)ǫ 2\n2Kσ2\n) .\nProof of Lemma 19. We adapt the proof of Lemma 2.2 from [14]. For 0 ≤ s ≤ T , define φs = t if Λs = {t} or φs = T + 1 if Λs = ∅. Then\nE\n[ T∑\nt=1\nI { t ∈ Λ, |θ̂i,t − θi| > ǫ }] ≤ E [ T∑\ns=0\nI { φs ≤ T, |θ̂i,φs − θi| > ǫ\n}]\n=\nT∑\ns=0\nPr ( φs ≤ T, |θ̂i,φs − θi| > ǫ ) . (20)\nSince φs can be viewed as an F -stopping time and satisfies either ni(φs) ≥ ⌈β(s)/K⌉ or φs = T + 1, if ⌈β(s)/K⌉ ≥ 1 then applying Lemma 18 gives\nPr ( φs ≤ T, |θ̂i,φs − θi| > ǫ ) ≤ 2 exp ( −⌈β(s)/K⌉ǫ 2\n2σ2\n) ≤ 2 exp ( −β(s)ǫ 2\n2Kσ2\n) .\nIf ⌈β(s)/K⌉ = 0 then Pr ( φs ≤ T, |θ̂i,φs − θi| > ǫ ) < 2 = 2 exp ( −β(s)ǫ 2\n2Kσ2\n) still holds. Now\nproceeding from (20) we can get the result of Lemma 19.\nNow we define Λ = {t : K + 1 ≤ t ≤ T, Ut,W ct , Y ct }, and Λs = {t : K + 1 ≤ t ≤ T, Ut,W c t , ne(t) = s,mini∈[K] ni(t) ≥ β(s)/K}. It can be verified that Λs satisfies the conditions in Lemma 19: (i) If t ∈ Λ then there must be some 0 ≤ s ≤ T such that ne(t) = s and thus t ∈ Λs. (ii) If t ∈ Λs then for t′ > t, ne(t′) ≥ ne(t+1) = ne(t)+1 = s+1, so t′ /∈ Λs. Condition (iii) and (iv) are also satisfied from the definition of Λs.\nThen T∑\nt=K+1\nE [I {Ut,W ct , Y ct , V ct }] = T∑\nt=K+1\nE [I {t ∈ Λ, V ct }]\n≤ K∑\ni=1\nT∑\nt=K+1\nE [ I { t ∈ Λ, |θ̂i,t − θi| > ǫ }] ≤ 2K T∑\ns=0\nexp ( −β(s)ǫ 2\n2Kσ2\n) . (21)\nFinally we will upper bound ∑n\nt=K+1 dit(θ)I {Ut,W ct , Y ct , Vt}.\nRecall that in the algorithm, if W ct and Y c t happens, some it satisfying Ni(t) < ci(θ̂t)4α log t is played. Such it must exist because otherwise Ni(t) 4α log t ≥ ci(θ̂t)4α log t holds for any i ∈ [K] and\nthus Wt = { N(t) 4α log t ∈ C(θ̂t) } happens, which causes contradiction.\nDefine\nΘ(θ, ǫ) = {λ ∈ Θ : ∀i ∈ [K] , |λi − θi| ≤ ǫ} , and\nci(θ, ǫ) = sup λ∈Θ(θ,ǫ) ci(λ) .\nLet Ti be the maximum t ≤ T such that it = i and I {Ut,W ct , Y ct , Vt} = 1. Then\nNi(Ti) =\nTi−1∑\ns=1\nI {is = i} ≤ ci(θ̂Ti)4α logTi ≤ ci(θ, ǫ)4α logT .\nThus T∑\nt=K+1\nI {it = i, Ut,W ct , Y ct , Vt} ≤ ci(θ, ǫ)4α logT + 1 .\nSo we have T∑\nt=K+1\ndit(θ)I {Ut,W ct , Y ct , Vt} ≤ 4α logT ∑\ni∈[K] ci(θ, ǫ)di(θ) +\n∑\ni∈[K] di(θ) , (22)\nand T∑\nt=K+1\nI {Ut,W ct , Y ct , Vt} ≤ 4α logT ∑\ni∈[K] ci(θ, ǫ) +K . (23)\nNow plugging (23) (21) into (19) and plugging (13) (16) (19) (21) (22) into (12) we get\nRT (θ) ≤ ( 2K + 2 + 4K\nα− 2\n) dmax(θ) + 4Kdmax(θ) T∑\ns=0\nexp ( −β(s)ǫ 2\n2Kσ2\n)\n+ 2dmax(θ)β\n 4α logT ∑\ni∈[K] ci(θ, ǫ) +K\n + 4α logT ∑\ni∈[K] ci(θ, ǫ)di(θ) ."

For every r > 0, define the events\nUr = { ∀i ∈ [K] , |θ̂i,r − θi| ≤ gi,r(δ) } .\nThen, by Hoeffding’s inequality and union bound, we have\nPr(∀r ≥ 2, Ur) ≥ 1− δ .\nNext we will upper bound the regret based on the fact that Ur holds for all r ≥ 2. Define rT = max{r : tt < T, |Ar| ≥ 2}, the event\nVr = { AWr 6= ∅, min\ni∈AWr ni(r) < min{min i∈ASr ni(r), γ(r)}\n}\nand its complement V cr . Then consider the regret:\nRT (θ) ≤ rT∑\nr=1\nI {Vr} 〈ir, d(θ)〉 + rT∑\nr=1\nI {V cr } 〈ir, d(θ)〉\n≤ rT∑\nr=1\nI {Vr} ‖ir‖1 D + rT∑\nr=1\nI {V cr } ‖ir‖1 maxi∈Ar di(θ) . (24)\nWe upper bound the two terms in (24) separately. Before proceeding, we introduce the following proposition which lower bounds ni(r) for i ∈ AWr . Proposition 20. For any i, r such that i ∈ AWr ,\nni(r) ≥ αr−1 2\nr−1∑\ns=1\nI {Vs} ‖is‖1 − (βr − 1)K , (25)\nwhere βr = ∣∣∣ ⋃ 1≤s≤r A W s ∣∣∣.\nProof of Proposition 20. The proof is done by induction. Let Wr denote the event that for any 1 ≤ s ≤ r and any i ∈ AWs , (25) holds. W1 holds because AW1 = ∅. Now we assume Wr holds and consider Wr+1.\nIf AWr+1 = ∅, then Wr+1 holds. If AWr+1 6= ∅, for i ∈ AWr+1, consider ni(r + 1) in different cases: If i ∈ AWr , then ni(r) ≥ αr−12 ∑r−1\ns=1 I {Vs} ‖is‖1 − (βr − 1)K . Recall that αr = min1≤s≤r,AWs 6=∅ m([K] , A W s ). So we have\nni(r + 1) ≥ ni(r) + I {Vr} ‖cr‖0 αr ≥ αr 2\nr∑\ns=1\nI {Vs} ‖is‖1 − (βr+1 − 1)K ,\nwhere we use the fact that αr is non-increasing, βr is non-decreasing as well as\n‖ir‖1 = ‖⌈cr · ‖cr‖0⌉‖1 ≤ ‖cr‖0 + ‖cr‖0 · ‖cr‖1 = 2 ‖cr‖0 . (26)\nIf i /∈ AWr , then i ∈ ASs for all 1 ≤ s ≤ r and thus βr+1 ≥ βr + 1. Let r′ = max{s ≤ r : Vs}. If such r′ does not exist, then\nni(r + 1) ≥ 0 ≥ αr 2\nr∑\ns=1\nI {Vs} ‖is‖1 − (βr+1 − 1)K .\nIf such r′ exists\nni(r + 1) ≥ ni(r′) > min j∈AW\nr′ nj(r\n′) ≥ αr′−1 2\nr′−1∑\ns=1\nI {Vs} ‖is‖1 − (βr′ − 1)K\n≥ αr 2\nr∑\ns=1\nI {Vs} ‖is‖1 − αr 2 ‖ir′‖1 − (βr′ − 1)K ≥ αr 2\nr∑\ns=1\nI {Vs} ‖is‖1 − βr′K\n≥ αr 2\nr∑\ns=1\nI {Vs} ‖is‖1 − (βr+1 − 1)K ,\nwhere the facts αr ≤ 1, ‖ir′‖1 ≤ 2K and βr′ ≤ βr+1 − 1 are used. Now we have proved that Wr+1 holds based on the assumption of Wr, hence Wr holds for any r, which gives the result of Proposition 20.\nBased on Proposition 20, ∑r\ns=1 I {Vs} ‖is‖1 can be upper bounded by the following fact:\nProposition 21. For any r ≥ 1, ∑rs=1 I {Vs} ‖is‖1 ≤ 2γ(r)+2Kβr αr .\nProof of Proposition 21. Let r′ = max{s ≤ r : Vs}. Then\nγ(r′) > min i∈AW\nr′ ni(r\n′) ≥ αr′−1 2\nr′−1∑\ns=1\nI {Vs} ‖is‖1 − (βr′ − 1)K .\nHence r∑\ns=1\nI {Vs} ‖is‖1 ≤ r′−1∑\ns=1\nI {Vs} ‖is‖1 + ‖ir′‖1 ≤ 2γ(r′) + 2K(βr′ − 1)\nαr′ + 2K\n≤ 2γ(r ′) + 2Kβr′\nαr′ .\nSince αr is non-increasing, βr is non-decreasing and γ(r)/αr = α −1/3 r (σtr/D)\n2/3 is nondecreasing, we have ∑r s=1 I {Vs} ‖is‖1 ≤ 2γ(r)+2Kβr αr .\nNow we are ready to upper bound the first term in (24): rT∑\nr=1\nI {Vr} ‖ir‖1 D ≤ 2γ(rT ) + 2KβrT αrT D = 2α−1/3rT D 1/3(σT )2/3 + 2KD βrT αrT . (27)\nNext consider the second term in (24): ∑rT\nr=1 I {V cr } ‖ir‖1 maxi∈Ar di(θ). Given Ur holds for all r we know that i1(θ) is never eliminated. Then for any i ∈ Ar , we have |θ̂i,r − θi| ≤ gi,r(δ) and θ̂i,r + gi,r(δ) ≥ θ̂i1(θ) − gi1(θ),r(δ). Therefore,\ndi(θ) ≤ min { D, 2gi,r(δ) + 2gi1(θ),r(δ) } ≤ min { D, 4σ √ 6 log 2KT\nδ ( min i∈Ar ni(r) )−1/2} .\nSo rT∑\nr=1\nI {V cr } ‖ir‖1 maxi∈Ar di(θ) ≤ rT∑\nr=1\nI {V cr } ‖ir‖1 min { D,C(min\ni∈Ar ni(r))\n−1/2 }\n, (28)\nwhere C = 4σ √ 6 log 2KTδ .\nThe next step is to lower bound mini∈Ar ni(r) when V c r happens. Define ηmin = minA∈[K],|A|≥2 m(A,A S). For i ∈ ASr ,\nni(r) ≥ r−1∑\ns=1\nI {V cs } ‖cs‖0 m(As, ASs ) ≥ ηmin 2\nr−1∑\ns=1\nI {V cs } ‖is‖1 . (29)\nFor i ∈ AWr , since V cr happens and AWr 6= ∅, we have\nni(r) ≥ min{min i∈ASr ni(r), γ(r)} ≥ min { ηmin 2 r−1∑\ns=1\nI {V cs } ‖is‖1 , γ(r) } .\nBy Proposition 21,\nηmin 2\nr−1∑\ns=1\nI {V cs } ‖is‖1 ≥ 1\n2K\n( tr − r∑\ns=1\nI {Vs} ‖is‖1\n) ≥ 1\n2K\n( tr −\n2γ(r) + 2Kβr αr\n)\n= 1\n2K\n( tr − 2α−1/3r ( σtr D )2/3 − 2Kβr/αr )\n≥ 1 2K tr − ( σtr D )2/3 −K2 ,\nwhere we used αr, ηmin ≥ 1/K and βr ≤ K .\nFor tr ≥ 125σ 2 D2 K 3 + 10K3, we have 45 tr ≥ 4K ( σtr D )2/3 and 15 tr ≥ 2K3, so\nηmin 2\nr−1∑\ns=1\nI {V cs } ‖is‖1 ≥ 1\n2K tr − ( σtr D )2/3 −K2\n≥ 2 ( σtr D )2/3 +K2 − ( σtr D )2/3 −K2\n= ( σtr D )2/3 ≥ ( σαrtr D )2/3 = γ(r) .\nSo we have proved that for any r ≤ rT such that tr ≥ T0 = 125σ 2 D2 K 3 + 10K3 and V cr happens, mini∈Ar ni(r) ≥ γ(r) ≥ (σαrT tr/D)2/3. Therefore, following (28) gives rT∑\nr=1\nI {V cr } ‖ir‖1 maxi∈Ar di(θ)\n≤ rT∑\nr=1\nI {V cr } ‖ir‖1 min { D,C(min\ni∈Ar ni(r))\n−1/2 }\n≤ ∑\nr≥1:tr<T0 ‖ir‖1 D +\n∑\nr≤rT :tr≥T0 ‖ir‖1 C\n(σαrT D )−1/3 t−1/3r\n≤ (T0 + 2K)D + C (σαrT\nD\n)−1/3 ∑\nr≤rT :tr≥T0 (tr+1 − tr)(tr+1 − 2K)−1/3\n≤ (T0 + 2K)D + C (σαrT\nD\n)−1/3 ∫ trT +1\nT0\n(x− 2K)−1/3dx\n≤ (T0 + 2K)D + C (σαrT\nD )−1/3 ∫ trT T0−2K x−1/3dx\n≤ (T0 + 2K)D + 3 2 C (σαrT D )−1/3 T 2/3\n= 125σ2K3\nD + (10K3 + 2K)D + α−1/3rT D\n1/3(σT )2/3 · 6 √ 6 log 2KT\nδ . (30)\nNow plugging (27) and (30) into (24) gives\nRT (θ) ≤ α−1/3rT D1/3(σT )2/3 · 7 √ 6 log 2KT\nδ +\n125σ2K3\nD + 13K3D .\nIf Σ is strongly observable, then AWr is always empty and V c r always happens. According to (24) (28) and (29) we have\nRT (θ) ≤ rT∑\nr=1\n‖ir‖1 maxi∈Ar di(θ)\n≤ rT∑\nr=1\n(tr+1 − tr)min { D,C (ηmin 2 )−1/2 t−1/2r }\n≤ 2KD+ C (ηmin\n2 )−1/2 ∫ trT 0 x−1/2dx\n≤ 2KD+ 8σ √ T\nηmin · 12 log 2KT δ .\nTo finish the proof, it suffices to show that 1αrT ≤ ρ(Σ) and 1ηmin ≤ κ(Σ)50 logK , which is based on the following fact:\nProposition 22. For any A,A′ ⊂ [K] Let ρLP(A,A′) denote the minimum fractional cover number from A to A′, that is\nρLP(A,A ′) = min\nb∈[0,∞)A\n∑ i∈A bi\ns.t. ∑\ni:j∈Si bi ≥ 1 ∀j ∈ A′ .\nThen m(A,A′) = 1ρLP(A,A′) .\nProof of Proposition 22. Recall that\nm(A,A′) = max c∈∆A min i∈A′\n∑\nj:i∈Sj cj\n= max c∈∆A,a\na s.t. ∑\ni:j∈Si ci ≥ a ∀j ∈ A′ .\nLet b = c/a, then\nm(A,A′) = max b∈[0,∞)A,a\na s.t. ∑\ni:j∈Si bi ≥ 1 ∀j ∈ A′ and\n∑ i∈A bi = 1 a\n= max b∈[0,∞)A 1∑ i∈A bi\ns.t. ∑\ni:j∈Si bi ≥ 1 ∀j ∈ A′\n= 1\nρLP(A,A′) .\nTo lower bound αrT , let ρ(A,A ′) be the integer version of ρLP(A,A′) by restricting b ∈ NA. Then we have ρ(Σ) = ρ([K] ,W(Σ)) and\nαrT ≥ m([K] ,W(Σ)) = 1 ρLP([K] ,W(Σ)) ≥ 1 ρ(Σ) ,\nwhere we used the fact that AWr ⊂ W(Σ) for any r ≤ rT . To lower bound ηmin, we use\nηmin = min A∈[K],|A|≥2 m(A,AS) = min A∈[K],|A|≥2 m(A,A) = 1\nmaxA∈[K],|A|≥2 ρLP(A,A)\n(AS = A for strongly observable Σ), thus\nmax A∈[K],|A|≥2 ρ(A,A) ≥ 1 ηmin .\nFor any A ∈ [K] , |A| ≥ 2, let ΣA be the subgraph of Σ on A. We apply Lemma 15 on ΣA with the subset W = A. Then the lemma states that A contains an independent set U of size at least ρ(A,A) 50 log |A| . Since an independent set of ΣA is also an independent set of Σ, for each subset A there exists an independent set of Σ with size at least ρ(A,A)50 log |A| . So the independence number\nκ(Σ) ≥ max A∈[K],|A|≥2\nρ(A,A) 50 log |A| ≥ 1 50 logK max A∈[K],|A|≥2 ρ(A,A) ≥ 1 ηmin50 logK ,\nwhich indicates 1ηmin ≤ κ(Σ)50 logK .\nC.2 Proof of Theorem 9\nProof of Theorem 9. Similarly to the proof of Theorem 9, we define high probability events\nUr = { ∀i ∈ [K] , |θ̂i,r − θi| ≤ gi,r(δ) } .\nand upper bound the regret based on the fact that for all r ≥ 2, Ur holds. The rest of the proof will be based on upper bounding the number of round before all sub-optimal actions are eliminated.\nDefine rT = max{r : tt < T, |Ar| ≥ 2}, event\nVr = { AWr 6= ∅, min\ni∈AWr ni(r) < min{min i∈ASr ni(r), γ(r)}\n}\nand V cr be its complement.\nFor any r ≤ rT and any i ∈ Ar, i 6= i1(θ), we have 2gi,r(δ) + 2gi1(θ),r(δ) ≥ di(θ) ≥ dmin(θ), where dmin(θ) denotes di2(θ)(θ). From gi,r(δ) = σ √ 2 log(8K2r3/δ) ni(r) we get\ndmin(θ) ≤ 2σ √ 2 log(8K2r3/δ) ( 1√ ni(r) + 1√ ni1(θ)(r) ) ≤ Cr ( min i∈Ar ni(r) )−1/2 ,\nwhere Cr = 4σ √ 6 log 2Krδ , and thus\nmin i∈Ar\nni(r) ≤ C2r\nd2min(θ) . (31)\nThen consider the regret:\nRT (θ) ≤ rT∑\nr=1\nI {Vr} 〈ir, d(θ)〉+ rT∑\nr=1\nI {V cr } 〈ir, d(θ)〉\n≤ rV∑\nr=1\nI {Vr} ‖ir‖1 dmax(θ) + rW∑\nr=1\nI {V cr } ‖ir‖1 maxi∈Ar di(θ) . (32)\nwhere rV = max{r ≤ rT : Vr} and rW = max{r ≤ rT : V cr }. Since mini∈AWrV ni(rV ) < mini∈ASrV ni(rV ) we have\nmin i∈ArV ni(rV ) = min i∈AWrV\nni(rV ) ≥ 1\n2ρ(Σ)\nrV −1∑\ns=1\nI {Vs} ‖is‖1 −K2\nby applying Proposition 20. Then we can upper bound the first term in (32) by rV∑\nr=1\nI {Vr} ‖ir‖1 ≤ 2ρ(Σ)C2rV d2min(θ) + 2ρ(Σ)K2 + 2K . (33)\nRegarding the second term in (32), recall that for any r ≤ rT such that tr ≥ T0 = 125σ 2 D2 K 3+10K3 and V cr happens, mini∈Ar ni(r) ≥ γ(r) ≥ (σαrT tr/D)2/3 ≥ ( σtr ρ(Σ)D )2/3 . Using the fact that maxi∈Ar di(θ) ≤ min { dmax(θ), Cr (mini∈Ar ni(r)) −1/2 } gives\nrW∑\nr=1\nI {V cr } ‖ir‖1 maxi∈Ar di(θ)\n≤ rW∑\nr=1\nI {V cr } ‖ir‖1 min { dmax(θ), Cr(min\ni∈Ar ni(r))\n−1/2 }\n≤ ∑\nr≥1:tr<T0 ‖ir‖1 dmax(θ) +\n∑\nr≤rW :tr≥T0 ‖ir‖1 CrW\n( σ\nρ(Σ)D\n)−1/3 t−1/3r\n≤ (T0 + 2K)dmax(θ) + CrW ( σ\nρ(Σ)D\n)−1/3 ∑\nr≤rW :tr≥T0 (tr+1 − tr)(tr+1 − 2K)−1/3\n≤ (T0 + 2K)dmax(θ) + CrW ( σ\nρ(Σ)D\n)−1/3 ∫ trW +1\nT0\n(x− 2K)−1/3dx\n≤ (T0 + 2K)dmax(θ) + CrW ( σ\nρ(Σ)D )−1/3 ∫ trW T0−2K x−1/3dx\n≤ (T0 + 2K)dmax(θ) + 3\n2 CrW\n( σ\nρ(Σ)D\n)−1/3 t2/3rW . (34)\nNow we upper bound trW . If trW ≥ T0 then C2rW\nd2min(θ) ≥ mini∈ArW ni(rW ) ≥ ( σtrW ρ(Σ)D )2/3 . Hence\nt2/3rW ≤ ( σ\nρ(Σ)D )−2/3 C2rW d2min(θ) + T 2/3 0 . (35)\nCombining (32) (33) (34) and (35) with CrW ≤ CrT gives\nRT (θ) ≤ 1603ρ(Σ)Dσ2\nd2min(θ)\n( log\n2KrT δ\n)3/2 + 14K3D + 125σ2K3\nD\n+ 15 ( ρ(Σ)Dσ2\n)1/3 ( 125σ2\nD2 + 10\n) K2 ( log\n2KrT δ\n)1/2 . (36)\nApplying rT ≤ T gives the result of Theorem 9. Note that using rT ≤ T here is only for simplicity, actually rT can be upper bounded by some constant by more careful analysis. This is because, according to Proposition 21, ∑rT s=1 I {Vs} ‖is‖1 =\nO ( t 2/3 rT ) , and trW = O ( (log trT ) 3/2 ) , we have\ntrT ≤ trW + rT∑\ns=1\nI {Vs} ‖is‖1 = O ( t2/3rT ) +O ( (log trT ) 3/2 ) ,\nwhich mean trT must be upper bounded by some constant independent with T ."

The setup allows a more refined information transfer from one action to another than previous partial monitoring setups, including the recently introduced graph-structured feedback case. For the first time in the literature, we provide non-asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds on the regret of any algorithm, which recover existing asymptotic problem-dependent lower bounds and finitetime minimax lower bounds available in the literature. We also provide algorithms that achieve the problem-dependent lower bound (up to some universal constant factor) or the minimax lower bounds (up to logarithmic factors).",
