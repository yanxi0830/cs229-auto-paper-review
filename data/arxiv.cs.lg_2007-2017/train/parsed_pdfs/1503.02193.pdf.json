One of the main open questions left in this framework concerns closing the above gap.\nIn this work, we provide a complete answer to the question above via two main results. We show, via a tighter analysis, that the semi-definite programming based algorithm of (Christiano, 2014a) in fact achieves a regret of O( √\nnLT ). Second, we show a matching computational lower bound. Namely, we show that a polynomial time algorithm for online local learning with lower regret would imply a polynomial time algorithm for the planted clique problem which is widely believed to be hard. We prove a similar hardness result under a related conjecture concerning planted dense subgraphs that we put forth. Unlike planted clique, the planted dense subgraph problem does not have any known quasi-polynomial time algorithms.\nComputational lower bounds for online learning are relatively rare, and we hope that the ideas developed in this work will lead to lower bounds for other online learning scenarios as well."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Online learning is a classic area of machine learning starting from the seminal work of (Littlestone and Warmuth, 1994), (DeSantis et al., 1988) and (Vavock, 1990). In this framework, also known as “prediction from expert advice”, the learning algorithm has to predict label information about an item or a set of items at each stage. It then earns a real valued payoff which is a function of the predicted labels. The aim is to achieve a total payoff in T rounds comparable to the best expert, i.e., the best fixed labeling of the items. The difference from the best possible payoff is known as the regret of the algorithm.\nThe weighted majority algorithm (Littlestone and Warmuth, 1994) achieves the optimal regret of O( √ T logN) for the above mentioned problem (T is the number of rounds, N is the total number of experts) but is computationally efficient only when the number of experts is small. In many scenarios, one is competing with a set of exponentially many experts. Hence, there has been a significant effort in designing polynomial time algorithms with optimal regret bounds for various such problems such as collaborative filtering, online gambling, and online max cut ((Kalai and Vempala, 2005), (Hazan et al., 2012), (Kakade et al., 2009), (Hazan, 2009))\n∗Princeton University, Computer Science Department.

Partially supported by NSF grants CCF-0832797, CCF-1117309, CCF-1302518, DMS-1317308, Sanjeev Arora’s Simons Investigator Award, and a Simons Collaboration Grant.\nA common aspect of many online learning scenarios mentioned above, is that at each time step, the learner is asked to predict local information about items. For instance, in the online max cut problem, the learner has to predict whether any two nodes are on the same side of the cut or on opposite sides. Recently, (Christiano, 2014a) proposed an elegant unifying framework called online local learning to capture such problems.\nIn this framework, one is given a set of n items, numbered 1 to n. In each round t ∈ [T ], the learner gets a pair of items (it, jt) as input and has to reply with a pair of labels (ait , bjt), where the possible labels are in [L]. Then, an adversary picks a payoff function Pt : [L]2 → [−1, 1]. The goal is to compete with the best fixed labeling. More precisely, if we denote\nOPT = maxl∈[L]n T ∑\nt=1\nPt (l(it), l(jt))\nand the algorithm achieves expected payoff OPT − r, the algorithm has regret r, where the expectation is over the algorithm’s randomness.\nThe main result of (Christiano, 2014a) is that the well known “Follow-the-regularized-leader” algorithm with an appropriate regularizer achieves regret O( √ nL3T ) for the online local learning problem. This, in particular, leads to optimal regret bounds1 for the online max cut problem. Notice that as mentioned before, one can get the optimal regret of O( √ n logL T ) via an inefficient algorithm which runs the weighted majority algorithm over the space of all possible labelings. One of the main questions left open in this framework was to close the gap between the regret that can be achieved by an efficient algorithm and the information theoretically optimal regret. We close this gap by proving the following results (formal statements appear later). On the lower bound side, we prove:\nTheorem 1 (Informal). For every ǫ > 0, if there exists an algorithm for online local learning achieving regret O( √ nL1−β(ǫ)T ), and running in time polynomial in n, L, T , then in polynomial time, one can distinguish an instance of a random graph G(n, 1/2) from an instance of G(n, 1/2) with a randomly planted clique of size n1/2−ǫ. Here, β(ǫ) is a function such that limǫ→0 β(ǫ) = 0.\nWe also prove a similar lower bound under a more robust conjecture concerning planting dense subgraphs which we introduce, which has no known quasipolynomial time algorithms, unlike planted clique. We show:\nTheorem 2 (Informal). For every ǫ, ǫ′ > 0, if there exists an algorithm for online local learning achieving regret O( √ nL1−β(ǫ,ǫ′)T ), and running in time polynomial in n, L, T , then in polynomial time, one can distinguish between an instance of G(n, p) and an instance of G(n, p) with a randomly planted instance of G(k, q). Here, k, q depend on ǫ, ǫ′, and β(ǫ, ǫ′) is a function such that limǫ,ǫ′→0 β(ǫ, ǫ′) = 0.\nWe match the above lower bounds with the following theorem:\nTheorem 3 (Informal). For the online local learning problem, follow the regularized leader with an appropriate regularizer achieves regret O( √ nLT ).\nJointly these results are meaningful for multiple reasons. First and foremost, online local learning is the most natural generalization of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) to the online setting. The semidefinite relaxation upon which Theorem 3 is based is the same one considered in (Raghavendra, 2008), who proves that under the Unique Games Conjecture, it actually achieves the best approximation factor among all polynomial-time algorithms. Our result can be viewed as an extension of (Raghavendra, 2008): for the online version of CSPs, follow-the-regularized leader on the same semidefinite relaxation along with a log determinantal regularizer is the “optimal” algorithm, under widely believed conjectures. Furthermore, while our hardness reduction is specific to the setting of online local learning, given the paucity of lower bounds in the setting of online learning, our result is a significant contribution and we hope it will find applications in other settings as well. Finally, a labeling of the items with k labels can be also viewed as a k-partitioning of the items. So, all the above results can be viewed through the lens of online settings for k-partitioning.\n1Up to constant factors"

      "text" : "We obtain the above mentioned upper bound on the regret by showing that “Follow-the-regularized-leader” using the same regularizer as (Christiano, 2014a) achieves the regret bound we are claiming, but with a completely different analysis. There, the idea is to express the entropy of a multivariate Gaussian in terms of the log-determinant of its covariance matrix, and that two multivariate Gaussian distributions that differ by a small amount in their covariance matrices cannot be too far in total variation distance as well. The main reason for this approach in (Christiano, 2014a) is that the Hessian of the log-determinantal regularizer is not diagonal, so it’s difficult to argue about its inverse. We use the special structure of the regularizer to get explicit expressions for the inverse, which allows us then to use more standard tools from convex geometry for analyzing “Follow-the-regularized-leader”. To do this we use some matrix calculus identities, which we think might be useful in other machine learning applications, where one needs to perform regularized optimization over polytopes of pseudo-moments.\nOur lower bounds are based on two conjectures about detecting planted dense structures inside random graphs. The first one is planted clique, which states that detecting planted cliques of sufficiently small size in an Erdös-Rényi graph cannot be done in polynomial time. We introduce a more robust version of this conjecture, planted dense subgraph, which concerns detecting planted dense Erdös-Rényi graphs inside sparser ones. While our reductions are similar in both cases, the state of the art algorithms for this detection problem are much worse. This is an indicator that this problem is likely harder and gives even stronger evidence for the hardness of achieving low regret. The proof idea is to use the online learner as an estimator of the size of the largest clique or dense subgraph in a graph, and the regret as the rate of error in this estimator. We show that if the rate is low enough, then one can distinguish between the planted and non-planted case. See next section for further details."

      "text" : "In the planted clique problem, one is given a graph sampled from one of two possible random ensembles: an ErdösRényi random graph G(n, 1/2), or an Erdös-Rényi random graph G(n, 1/2) along with a clique of size k placed between k randomly chosen vertices in the graph. (The usual notation for this random ensemble is G(n, 1/2, k).) The task is to distinguish whether one is presented with a graph from the G(n, 1/2) ensemble or the G(n, 1/2, k) ensemble.\nPrevious sequences of work (Feldman et al., 2013), (Meka et al., 2015), show that wide classes of natural polynomial time algorithms cannot efficiently distinguish between these two cases when the size of the planted clique is n 1 2−ǫ, and it is conjectured that in fact there is no polynomial time algorithm for this task. More precisely, the conjecture is the following:\nConjecture 1. Suppose that an algorithm A receives as input a graph G, which is either sampled from the ensemble G(n, 1/2) or G(n, 1/2, n\n1 2−ǫ), ǫ = Ω(1).

In the planted case, we plant a denser graph inside a sparser one. Formally, let G(n, p, k, q) be a random graph ensemble generated in the following manner. First, one picks a random subset S of k vertices. Then, for all pairs of vertices inside S, one connects them with an edge independently with probability q. For all other pairs of vertices, we connect them independently with probability p.\n2The constant is arbitrary. One could make the conjecture for any constant bounded away from 1 2\nThe sizes and densities of the planted and ambient graph in which we will be interested are p = n−α, k = n 1 2−ǫ ′\n, q = k−α−ǫ, for α ≤ 12 . The main reason this scenario is interesting is that unlike planted clique, we do not know of quasi-polynomial time algorithms for it.\nTo be formal, we conjecture the following:\nConjecture 2. Suppose that an algorithm A receives as input a graph G, which is either sampled from the ensemble G(n, p) or G(n, p, k, q), where k = n 1 2−ǫ ′\nfor ǫ′ = Ω(1) and k = nΩ(1); p = n−α for α = Ω(1), α ≤ 12 ; q = k−α−ǫ for ǫ = Ω(1); and p = o(q). Then, no A which runs in polynomial time can decide with probability 45 which ensemble the input was sampled from.\nThere are few ways to justify this conjecture. First, the current best known algorithm for this distinguishing problem from (Bhaskara et al., 2010) runs in time nk Θ(ǫ) . This bound gives a running time of 2n Θ(ǫ)\nsince k is polynomial in n, which is significantly worse than quasi-polynomial. Second, it’s possible to show (Bhaskara et al., 2010) that spectral methods do not work in this regime. It’s also easy to check that simple algorithms like outputting the vertices with highest degree do not work either – since the variance of the degree in the sparser ambient graph dominates the degrees in the denser planted graph. Finally, similar conjectures to this have already been proposed in various contexts in theoretical computer science. ((Arora et al., 2010), (Applebaum et al., 2010))\nThe fact that state of the art algorithms have a much worse running time for this problem in comparison to planted clique is our motivation for putting forth this conjecture. Namely, our reduction of planted clique/planted dense subgraph to online local learning will produce an online learning instance in which the number of items n′, the number of rounds T and the label set size L are all polynomial in the size of the input graph. Furthermore, the time to produce the inputs for the learning algorithm will be polynomial as well. Therefore, if N = max(T, L, n′), and we have an algorithm of running time f(N) for online local learning, we get an algorithm for planted clique/planted dense subgraph of running time max (f (poly (n)) , poly (n)).\nThis means for instance, if our algorithm for online local learning has running time f(N) = No(logN), our reduction would give an algorithm for planted clique with running time no(logn). A similar statement holds in the planted dense subgraph case. If our algorithm for online local learning has running time even f(N) = 2N o(1)\n, the reduction would give an algorithm better than the state of the art for planted dense subgraph."

In the planted case, there will be a fixed labeling which achieves a large payoff bp, and in the random case, we’ll show that any algorithm (efficient or not) can achieve at most some small payoff br. The reduction will ensure that if we can get a sufficiently low regret r in polynomial time, we will get a payoff of at least bp− r in the planted case, such that bp− r ≫ br, with probability 45 . Then to distinguish between planted and random, we simply declare planted if the payoff is large enough, and random otherwise.\nFor both reductions, we will show a “robust” version of the bound first, e.g. for planted clique, we will show a lower bound of O( √ nL1−β(ǫ)T ) if planted clique is hard when the size of the planted portion is n1/2−ǫ, for some function β(ǫ). Then we will take the limit ǫ → 0. The details of the reduction follow."

If regret √ nLβT for β = ( 1− ω ( 1\nlogn\n))(\n1 1 2 + ǫ\n)\n− 1 is achievable in time\npolynomial in n, L, T , then one can distinguish between G(n, 1/2) and G ( n, 1/2, n1/2−ǫ ) with probability 45 3 in polynomial time.\n3Again, the choice of 4 5 is arbitary\nProof. We produce an instance for the online local learning problem, given an instance of the planted clique problem with size of the planted clique k in the following way.\nWe randomly partition the input graph into n′ = n/l clusters, each containing l vertices, where l = 10nk . We associate each vertex with a unique label in {1, .., l}. We then use this as an instance for the online learning problem as follows. We run the online learning game for T = ( n′\n2\n)\nsteps. In each step t, we query a pair of clusters (Cit , Cjt). Each pair is queried once, and the ordering is arbitrary. The algorithm responds with some labeling for the clusters (lit , ljt), and the payoff is 1 if the vertex for lit in Cit has an edge to the vertex for ljt in Cjt . Otherwise, the payoff is 0.\nThe distinguisher for the planted clique problem runs the online learning algorithm on the instance specified above R = n 4\nk3.7 number of times. This is to ensure that with constant probability, the average payoff of the algorithm over the\nruns is close to the expected payoff. If the average payoff from the R runs is at least (1+ 1100 ) 1 2\n(\nk/10 2\n)\n, the distinguisher replies with planted. Otherwise, it replies with random.\nLet’s assume the original graph was sampled from G(n, 1/2). Then, we claim that any algorithm (regardless if\nefficient or not) will get an average payoff of at most T2 + 5 √ T 2 with probability at least 4 5 .\nThe above probability is with respect to the randomness in generating the graph from G(n, 1/2), the partitioning of the vertices, and any randomness in the algorithm. Let the pair of clusters queried at time step t be (Cit , Cjt). Let’s denote the random variable for the payoff in round t on the r-th repetition of the online learning problem as Prit,jt . Let Ga,b be a random 0-1 indicator variable for whether there is an edge between vertices a, b.\nIf Pit,jt = ∑R r=1 Prit,jt , then the total payoff of the algorithm is P = ∑T t=1 Pit,jt . We claim that the variables Pit,jt are mutually independent. Indeed, this follows because the variables Ga,b, for any vertices a ∈ Cit , b ∈ Cjt are independent of the data shown to the online learner in the first t− 1 rounds and the algorithm’s randomness.\nBut, by linearity of expectation, E [ 1 RPit,jt ] = 12 , and 1 RPit,jt always is between 0 and 1. So, by Hoeffding’s\ninequality,\nPr\n[\n1\nR\nT ∑\nt=1\nPit,jt ≥ T\n2 + 5\n√ T\n2\n]\n≤ e−50\nIn particular, with probability at least 45 , any algorithm gets average payoff of 1 2\n(\nk/10 2\n)\n+ o(k2). Let’s proceed to the planted case. First, we claim that with probability at least 78 , there is a fixed labeling with payoff\nat least ( 2k/25 2 ) . Let Ii be an indicator random variable for the event that no vertex from the planted clique belongs to cluster i. The partitioning is done independently of the graph, so Pr[Ii = 1] = (\n1− 10 k\n)k\n≤ e− 10k k = e−10. Hence, if I is a random variable for the total number of clusters which contain no vertices from the planted clique, we know that E[I] = n′ ∑\ni=1\nE[Ii] ≤ k\n10 e−10. By Markov’s inequality, Pr\n[\nI ≥ k 50\n]\n≤ E[I] k 50 ≤ 5e−10 ≤ 1 8 .\nSo, with probability at least 78 , the number of clusters with at least one vertex from the planted clique is at least k 10 − k50 = 2k25 . In this case, the labeling where we label each of the clusters with a vertex from the planted clique has a payoff of at least (\n2k/25 2\n) . In the online learning instance we constructed, the number of vertices is n′, the\nnumber of rounds is T , and the label size is l. Let’s assume that we can achieve regret of √ n′lβT . According to the definition of regret, whenever the graph was a planted instance, and the partitioning resulted in a fixed labeling with payoff at least (\n2k/25 2\n)\n, the expected payoff of the algorithm (with respect to the randomness of the algorithm) is at\nleast\n(\n2k/25\n2\n) − √ n′lβT . We claim that the average payoff over the R runs of the online learning algorithm will be\nclose to this.\nIf we denote by Pr = T ∑\nt=1 Prit,jt the payoff of the algorithm in the r-th repetition, then we have that E[Pr] ≥ (\n2k/25 2\n) − √ n′lβT and all the variables Pr are mutually independent and between 0 and n2. So, by Hoeffding’s\nbound, Pr\n[\n1\nR\nR ∑\nr=1\nPr ≤ E[Pr]− t ] ≤ e− 2R 2t2 Rn4 . Setting t = k1.9, lets us conclude that with probability 1 − o(1),\n1 R ∑R r=1Pr ≥ ( 2k/25 2 )\n− √ n′lβT − o(k2). Putting everything together, in the planted case, the average payoff is at\nleast ( 2k/25 2 ) − √ n′lβT − o(k2) with probability 45 .\nRecall that we also proved that in a random instance, we get a payoff at most 1\n2\n(\nk/10\n2\n)\n+o(k2) with probability at\nleast 45 . We claim that\n(\n2k/25\n2\n) ≥ ( 1 + 1\n100\n)\n1\n2\n(\nk/10\n2\n)\n. Indeed, ( 2k/25 2 ) = 2k/25(2k/25−1)2 ≥ (1 − 1100 ) (2k/25)2 2 ,\nfor large enough k, and\n(\n1− 1 100\n)\n(2k/25)2\n2 ≥\n(\n1 + 1\n100\n)\n1\n2\n(k/10)2\n2 ≥\n(\n1 + 1\n100\n)\n1\n2\n(\nk/10\n2\n)\nHence, if √ n′lβT = o(k2), the distinguisher constructed outputs the correct answer with probability 45 . We will\nshow exactly that. First we claim that\nlβ = o (n\nl\n)\n(1)\nSince l = 10nk = 10n 1 2+ǫ, after rearranging terms, 1 is equivalent to n(β+1)( 1 2+ǫ) = o(n). Notice that nω( 1 log n ) = ω(1), so for the above it is sufficient that (β + 1) ( 1\n2 + ǫ\n) = 1 − ω ( 1\nlogn\n)\n. But since\nβ =\n( 1− ω ( 1\nlogn\n))(\n1 1 2 + ǫ\n)\n− 1 the above is clearly satisfied. Hence,\n√ n′lβT =\n√\nn l lβ (n l 2 ) = o\n( √\nlβ (n\nl\n)3 )\n= o\n(\n(n\nl\n)2 )\n= o(k2)\nwhich finishes the proof.\nThis quite easily will give the result that assuming Conjecture 1, achieving regret √ nL1−δT , for any δ = Ω(1) is\nhard. More precisely: Corollary 1. Let ǫ = Ω(1). If we can achieve regret √ nL1−ǫT in time polynomial in n, L, T , we can distinguishing between G(n, 1/2) and G(n, 1/2, n1/2− ǫ 6 ) with probability 45 in polynomial time. In particular, if Conjecture 1 is\ntrue, no polynomial time algorithm can achieve regret √ nL1−δT , for any δ = Ω(1).\nThe proof of this Corollary is straightforward and relegated to Appendix A. We note that a stronger form of Conjecture 1 is consistent with our current knowledge of planted clique. In particular, we can strengthten the claim to allow any k = o( √ n), or alternatively k = n\n1 2−ǫ, for any ǫ = ω( 1logn ). In this case, Corollary 1 will imply that\nachieving regret √ n o(L)T is impossible in polynomial time."

      "text" : "We’ll prove the following lemma first:\nLemma 1. If R(M) = log det(I + LM), then:\n(∇2R(M))−1((i,a),(j,b)),((i′,a′),(j′,b′)) =\n1\nL2 (δ ((i′, a′), (j, b)) + L ·M ((i′, a′), (j, b))) (δ ((i, a), (j′, b′)) + L ·M ((i, a), (j′, b′)))\nProof. Let’s proceed stepwise. First, let’s calculate the gradient. For this, the following theorem from matrix calculus is very useful (where adj stands for the adjugate):\nTheorem. Jacobi’s Formula (Magnus and Neudecker, 1995):\n∂ det(B)\n∂Bi,j = adj(B)⊺i,j = adj(B)j,i = det(B)B −1 j,i\nWith this in mind, the gradient is a simple matter of applying the chain rule. To keep the notation clean, let w = (i, a), x = (j, b), and calculate the gradient of R(M) with respect to Mw,x. We get:\n∂R(M) ∂Mw,x = 1 det(I + L ·M) ∂ det(I + L ·M) ∂Mw,x = (I + L ·M)−1x,w ∂(I + L ·M)w,x ∂Mw,x\n= L(I + L ·M)−1x,w\nAgain, to keep the notation lighter, let y = (i′, a′), z = (j′, b′). We will use a little bit of matrix calculus to show:\nLemma 2. ∂(I+L·M)−1x,w\n∂My,z = −L(I + L ·M)−1x,y(I + L ·M)−1z,w\nProof. Let’s denote by ∂X∂t the matrix with entries ∂Xi,j ∂t . Then, we claim the following is true:\n∂(XY )\n∂t =\n∂X\n∂t Y + X\n∂Y\n∂t . This is not hard to check: it’s just due to the fact that in the matrix product XY, the entry\n(XY )i,j is a sum of terms which multiplications of two entries in X and Y. An application of the chain rule gives the above quite easily.\nThen, we use the following trick: BB−1 = I , so by the above observation, ∂B∂t B −1 + B ∂B\n−1\n∂t = 0. Hence, ∂B−1\n∂t = −B−1 ∂B∂t B−1. Let’s apply this observation to B = (I + L ·M) and t = My,z\n∂(I + L ·M)−1x,w ∂My,z = −((I + L ·M)−1 ∂(I + L ·M) ∂My,z (I + L ·M)−1)x,w (2)\n= − ∑\np,q\n(I + L ·M)−1x,p ∂(I + L ·M)p,q\n∂My,z (I + L ·M)−1q,w (3)\nNow, the term ∂(I+L·M)p,q∂My,z is non-zero only if p = y, q = z, in which case it is equal to L. Hence, we get:\n(3) = −L(I + L ·M)−1x,y(I + L ·M)−1z,w as needed.\nWith this in mind, the Hessian is obvious:\n∂2R(M) ∂Mw,x∂My,z = ∂ ∂My,z L(I + L ·M)−1x,w = −L2(I + L ·M)−1x,y(I + L ·M)−1z,w\nLet’s call the Hessian matrix H(w,x),(y,z). We claim that the inverse H̃ has the following explicit form:\nH̃(w,x),(y,z) = − 1\nL2 (I + L ·M)x,y(I + L ·M)w,z\nTo show this, it’s just a matter of verifying that (HH̃)(w,x),(y,z) = δ((w, x), (y, z)). But this is easy enough:\n(HH̃)(w,x),(y,z) = ∑\np,q\nH(w,x),(p,q)H̃(p,q),(y,z)\n= ∑\np,q\n(−L2(I + L ·M)−1x,p(I + L ·M)−1w,q)(−1/L2(I + L ·M)q,y(I + L ·M)p,z)\n= ∑\np\n(I + L ·M)−1x,p(I + L ·M)p,z ∑\nq\n(I + L ·M)−1w,q(I + L ·M)q,y\n= δ(x, z)δ(w, y) = δ((w, x), (y, z))\nThis finishes the proof of Lemma 1."

      "text" : "In this paper, we studied the optimal regret achievable in polynomial time for online local learning. We showed that follow the regularized leader with a log-determinantal regularizer achieves regret √ nLT , and we proved a matching lower bound based both on planted clique and planted dense subgraph. An interesting open problem is to investigate whether the regret bound can be improved when allowing subexponential time algorithms, since both planted clique and planted dense subgraph admit sub-exponential time algorithms. A natural approach is to maintain higher order pseudo-moments, following similar approaches when using the Lasserre/Sum of Squares hierarchies. The key difficulty is the right choice of the regularizer. The log determinant regularizer is one particular approximation of the entropy of a distribution over the set of all possible labelings, matching the pseudo-moments that we maintain during the algorithm – it roughly corresponds to the entropy of a Gaussian with matching second moments. (Wainwright and Jordan, 2006) Even if we one has access to higher order moments, it is not clear if there is a better candidate than the log determinant.\nAnother open problem is basing the hardness of achieving regret √ nLT on more standard, worst case assumptions (e.g. NP-hardness, UGC-hardness). Indeed, it isn’t obvious that randomness is required for proving hardness, but it does seem to help. This mirrors the current state of affairs in improper learning, where the only known hardness results are either based on cryptographic assumptions or very recently, refuting random DNF formulas (Daniely et al., 2014)."

If we can achieve regret √ nL1−ǫT in time polynomial in n, L, T , we can distinguishing between G(n, 1/2) and G(n, 1/2, n1/2− ǫ 6 ) with probability 45 in polynomial time. In particular, if Conjecture 1 is\ntrue, no polynomial time algorithm can achieve regret √ nL1−δT , for any δ = Ω(1).\nProof. For ease of notation, let’s call ǫ̃ := ǫ6 . Since ǫ̃ = ω( 1 logn ), directly applying Theorem 1, to distinguish between G(n, 1/2) and G(n, 1/2, n1/2−ǫ̃), it’s sufficient to achieve regret √ nLβT , for β = (1− ǫ̃) 2\n1 + 2ǫ̃ −1. Since\n2 1+2ǫ̃ = 2− 4ǫ̃1+2ǫ̃ ,\n(1− ǫ̃) 2 1 + 2ǫ̃ = (1− ǫ̃) ( 2− 4ǫ̃ 1 + 2ǫ̃ ) = 2− ( 2 + 4 1 + 2ǫ̃ ) ǫ̃+ 2ǫ̃2 1 + 2ǫ̃ ≥ 2− 6ǫ̃ = 2− ǫ\nHence, if we can achieve regret √ nL1−ǫT , we can distinguish between G(n, 1/2) and G(n, 1/2, n 1 2− ǫ 6 ), as we needed.\nTheorem 2. Let ǫ, α, k satisfy the conditions of Conjecture 2. If regret √ nLβT for\nβ = 2\n1 2 −\n( 1 2 − ǫ′ )\n(α+ ǫ)− ω (\n1 logn\n)\n1 2 + ǫ\n′ − 1\nis achievable in polynomial time, then one can distinguish between G(n, ps) andG(n, ps, k, pd), where ps = n−α, k = n 1 2−ǫ ′\n, pd = k −α−ǫ with probability 45 in polynomial time.\nProof. We proceed in the same way as in the proof of Theorem 1. Namely, we will produce an instance for the online learning algorithm by partitioning our graph randomly into n′ = nl clusters, each of size n l , where l = 10 n k . As before, we will query all T pairs of clusters, and the payoff will be 1 if there is an edge between the labels supplied by the learner, and 0 otherwise. Finally, we run the distinguisher R = n 4\nk3.7p2 d\ntimes, and we output planted if the average\npayoff from the R runs is at least 12 ( 2k/25 2 ) · pd, and otherwise random. As before, we claim that in the case when the graph is G(n, ps), with probability at least 45 , any algorithm will\nachieve average payoff at most T · ps + 10 √ T · ps = ( k/10\n2\n) · ps + 10 √ ( k/10\n2\n)\n· ps.\nWe use the same notation as before: the pair of clusters queried at time step t is (Cit , Cjt), the random variable for the payoff in round t on the r-th repetition of the online learning problem is Prit,jt , and Ga,b is a random 0-1 indicator variable for whether there is an edge between vertices a, b.\nFor the same reasons as before, the variables Pit,jt = ∑R r=1 Prit,jt are mutually independent. Furthermore,\nE [ 1 RPii,jt ] = ps, and 1RPit,jt always is between 0 and 1. So, by Chernoff, Pr [ T ∑\nt=1\nPt ≥ T · ps ( 1 + 10√ Tps )\n]\n≤\ne−100/3, i.e. Pr\n[\nT ∑\nt=1\nPt ≥ T · ps + 10 √ Tps]\n]\n≤ e−100/3. In particular, with probability at least 45 , any algorithm\ngets payoff at most T · ps + 10 √ T · ps.\nIn the planted case, completely the same as in Theorem 1, with probability 1 − 5e−10 ≥ 1415 , there will be at least 2k 25 clusters which contain a vertex from the planted graph.\nConditioned on the above event happening, we claim that any labeling that chooses the vertex from the planted\ngraph in the clusters that contain one achieves a payoff of at least ( 2k/25 2 ) ·pd−10 √ ( 2k/25 2 )\n· pd with probability at least 15 16 . To show this, first notice that conditioned on belonging to two different clusters, the probability of an edge existing between two vertices in the planted graph is a Bernoulli 0−1 variable, which is 1 with probability pd. This is true since\nthe partitioning is done independently from the graph. But then, the payoff is at least ( 2k/25 2 ) · pd − 10 √ ( 2k/25 2 )\n· pd with probability at least 1− e−100/3 ≥ 78 by Chernoff.\nHence, in the planted case, again, with probability at least 78 , there is a fixed labeling with payoff at least ( 2k/25 2 ) · pd − 10 √ ( 2k/25 2 ) · pd. If the regret is √ n′lβT , and such a labeling exists, using a Hoeffding bound as before, with\nprobability at least 1 − o(1) the average payoff will be at least ( 2k/25 2 ) · pd − 10 √ ( 2k/25 2 )\n· pd − o(k2pd). But since ps = o(pd) and k2pd = ω(1), if the regret is √ n′lβT , such that √ n′lβT = o(k2 · pd), the distinguisher constructed outputs the correct answer with probability at least 45 . Since nl = Θ(k), it’s sufficient to show:\n√ n′lβT = o(( n\nl )2k−α−ǫ) ⇔\nl(β+1)/2 = o(n 1 2−( 1 2−ǫ ′)(α′+ǫ)) (4)\nPlugging in l = 10nk = 10n 1 2+ǫ ′ , 4 is equivalent n( β+1 2 )( 1 2+ǫ ′) = o(n 1 2−( 1 2−ǫ ′)(α′+ǫ)) As before, for this it’s sufficient that,\n(\nβ + 1\n2\n)(\n1 2 + ǫ′\n)\n=\n(\n1 2 − ( 1 2 − ǫ′ ) (α+ ǫ) ) − ω ( 1 logn )\nIt’s easy to check for our choice of β that this is satisfied, which finishes the proof.\nCorollary 2. Let ǫ′, α, ǫ = Ω(1) and α ≥ ǫ. If we can achieve regret √ nL1−ǫ′−α−ǫT in polynomial time, we can distinguish between G(n, ps) and G(n, ps, k, pd) in polynomial time with probability 45 , where ps = n −α8 , k = n 1 2 − ǫ′ 4 , pd = k −α 8 − ǫ\n8 . In particular, if Conjecture 2 is true, no polynomial time algorithm can achieve regret√ nL1−δT , for any δ = Ω(1).\nProof. For notational ease, let α̃ = α8 , ǫ̃ = ǫ 8 , ǫ̃ ′ = ǫ ′\n4 . First, notice that ps = o(pd). Indeed, since ps = n−α̃ and pd = k−α̃−ǫ̃,\nps = o(pd) ⇔ n−α̃ = o(n−( 1 2−ǫ̃′)(α̃+ǫ̃))\nHowever, since α ≥ ǫ,\nα̃ ≥ 1 2 (α̃+ ǫ̃) = ( 1 2 − ǫ̃′)(α̃ + ǫ̃) + ǫ̃′(α̃+ ǫ̃)\nSince ǫ̃′, α̃, ǫ̃ = Ω(1), clearly this implies n−α̃ = o(n−( 1 2−ǫ̃′)(α̃+ǫ̃)) Since clearly ǫ̃, ǫ̃′, α̃ = ω( 1logn ), directly applying Theorem 2, to distinguish betweenG(n, ps) andG(n, ps, k, pd),\nwhere k = n 1 2−ǫ̃′ , ps = n −α̃ and pd = k−α̃−ǫ̃, achieving regret √ nLβT is sufficient, for\nβ = 2 1 2 − 2(12 + ǫ̃′)(α̃+ ǫ̃)\n1 2 + ǫ̃\n′ − 1 = 1− 4( 1 2 + ǫ̃ ′)(α̃ + ǫ̃) 1 2 + ǫ̃ ′ − 1\n= 1− 2ǫ̃ ′ + 4(12 + ǫ̃ ′)(α̃ + ǫ̃) 1 2 + ǫ̃ ′ ≥ 1− 4ǫ̃′ − 8(1 2 + ǫ̃′)(α̃+ ǫ̃) ≥ 1− 4ǫ̃′ − 8α̃− 8ǫ̃\nwhere the next to last inequality holds since ǫ̃′ ≥ 0 and the last since ǫ̃′ ≤ 12 . So, if we can achieve regret\n√ nL1−4ǫ̃′−8α̃−8ǫ̃T = √ nL1−ǫ′−α−ǫ\nwe can distinguish between G(n, ps) and G(n, ps, k, pd), as we needed."

In this framework, the algorithm is shown a pair of items at each step, chosen from a set of n items. The learner then predicts a label for each item, from a label set of size L and receives a real valued payoff. This is a natural framework which captures many interesting scenarios such as online gambling and online max cut. (Christiano, 2014a) designed an efficient online learning algorithm for this problem achieving a regret of O( √ nLT ), where T is the number of rounds. Information theoretically, one can achieve a regret of O( √ n logLT ). One of the main open questions left in this framework concerns closing the above gap. In this work, we provide a complete answer to the question above via two main results. We show, via a tighter analysis, that the semi-definite programming based algorithm of (Christiano, 2014a) in fact achieves a regret of O( √ nLT ). Second, we show a matching computational lower bound. Namely, we show that a polynomial time algorithm for online local learning with lower regret would imply a polynomial time algorithm for the planted clique problem which is widely believed to be hard. We prove a similar hardness result under a related conjecture concerning planted dense subgraphs that we put forth. Unlike planted clique, the planted dense subgraph problem does not have any known quasi-polynomial time algorithms. Computational lower bounds for online learning are relatively rare, and we hope that the ideas developed in this work will lead to lower bounds for other online learning scenarios as well.",
