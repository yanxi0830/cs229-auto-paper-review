      "text" : "Bayesian optimization (BO) [1] provides a powerful framework for automating design problems, and finds applications in robotics, environmental monitoring, and automated machine learning, just to name a few. One seeks to find the maximum of an unknown reward function that is expensive to evaluate, based on a sequence of suitably-chosen points and noisy observations. Numerous BO algorithms have been presented previously; see Section 1.1 for an overview.\nLevel-set estimation (LSE) [2] is closely related to BO, with the added twist that instead of seeking a maximizer, one seeks to classify the domain into points that lie above or below a certain threshold. This is of considerable interest in applications such as environmental monitoring and sensor networks, allowing one to find all “sufficiently good” points rather than the best point alone.\nWhile BO and LSE are closely related, they are typically studied in isolation. In this paper, we provide a unified treatment of the two via a new algorithm, Truncated Variance Reduction (TRUVAR), which enjoys theoretical guarantees, good computational complexity, and the versatility to handle important settings such as pointwise costs, non-constant noise, and multi-task scenarios. The main result of this paper applies to the former two settings, and even the fixed-noise and unit-cost case, we refine existing bounds via a significantly improved dependence on the noise level."

      "text" : "Three popular myopic techniques for Bayesian optimization are expected improvement (EI), probability of improvement (PI), and Gaussian process upper confidence bound (GP-UCB) [1, 3], each of which chooses the point maximizing an acquisition function depending directly on the current posterior mean and variance. In [4], the GP-UCB-PE algorithm was presented for BO, choosing the highest-variance point within a set of potential maximizers that is updated based on confidence bounds. Another relevant BO algorithm is BaMSOO [5], which also keeps track of potential maximizers, but instead chooses points based on a global optimization technique called simultaneous\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n07 37\n9v 1\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n2 4\nO ct\nonline optimization (SOO). An algorithm for level-set estimation with GPs is given in [2], which keeps track of a set of unclassified points. These algorithms are computationally efficient and have various theoretical guarantees, but it is unclear how best to incorporate aspects such as pointwise costs and heteroscedastic noise [6]. The same is true for the Straddle heuristic for LSE [7].\nEntropy search (ES) [8] and its predictive version [9] choose points to reduce the uncertainty of the location of the maximum, doing so via a one-step lookahead of the posterior rather than only the current posterior. While this is more computationally expensive, it also permits versatility with respect to costs [6], heteroscedastic noise [10], and multi-task scenarios [6]. A recent approach called minimum regret search (MRS) [11] also performs a look-ahead, but instead chooses points to minimize the regret. To our knowledge, no theoretical guarantees have been provided for these.\nThe multi-armed bandit (MAB) [12] literature has developed alongside the BO literature, with the two often bearing similar concepts. The MAB literature is far too extensive to cover here, but we briefly mention some variants relevant to this paper. Extensive attention has been paid to the bestarm identification problem [13], and cost constraints have been incorporated in a variety of forms [14]. Moreover, the concept of “zooming in” to the optimal point has been explored [15]. In general, the assumptions and analysis techniques in the MAB and BO literature are quite different."

      "text" : "We present a unified analysis of Bayesian optimization and level-set estimation via a new algorithm Truncated Variance Reduction (TRUVAR). The algorithm works by keeping track of a set of potential maximizers (BO) or unclassified points (LSE), selecting points that shrink the uncertainty within that set up to a truncation threshold, and updating the set using confidence bounds. Similarly to ES and MRS, the algorithm performs a one-step lookahead that is highly beneficial in terms of versatility. However, unlike these previous works, our lookahead avoids the computationally expensive task of averaging over the posterior distribution and the observations.\nAlso in contrast with ES and MRS, we provide theoretical bounds for TRUVAR characterizing the cost required to achieve a certain accuracy in finding a near-optimal point (BO) or in classifying each point in the domain (LSE). By applying this to the standard BO setting, we not only recover existing results [2, 4], but we also strengthen them via a significantly improved dependence on the noise level, with better asymptotics in the small noise limit. Moreover, we provide a novel result for a setting in which the algorithm can choose the noise level, each coming with an associated cost.\nFinally, we compare our algorithm to previous works on several synthetic and real-world data sets, observing it to perform favorably in a variety of settings."

      "text" : "Setup: We seek to sequentially optimize an unknown reward function f(x) over a finite domain D.1 At time t, we query a single point xt ∈ D and observe a noisy sample yt = f(xt) + zt, where zt ∼ N(0, σ2(xt)) for some known noise function σ2(·) : D → R+. Thus, in general, some points may be noisier than others, in which case we have heteroscedastic noise [10]. We associate with each point a cost according to some known cost function c : D → R+. If both σ2(·) and c(·) are set to be constant, then we recover the standard homoscedastic and unit-cost setting.\nWe model f(x) as a Gaussian process (GP) [16] having mean zero and kernel function k(x, x′), normalized so that k(x, x) = 1 for all x ∈ D. The posterior distribution of f given the points and observations up to time t is again a GP, with the posterior mean and variance given by [10]\nµt(x) = kt(x) T ( Kt + Σt )−1 yt (1)\nσt(x) 2 = k(x, x)− kt(x)T ( Kt + Σt )−1 kt(x), (2)\nwhere kt(x) = [ k(xi, x) ]t i=1 , Kt = [ k(xt, xt′) ] t,t′\n, and Σt = diag(σ2(x1), . . . , σ2(xt)). We also let σ2t−1|x(x) denote the posterior variance of x upon observing x along with x1, · · · , xt−1.\n1Extensions to continuous domains are discussed in the supplementary material.\nWe consider both Bayesian optimization, which consists of finding a point whose function value is as high as possible, and level-set estimation, which consists of classifying the domain according into points that lie above or below a given threshold h. The precise performance criteria for these settings are given in Definition 3.1 below. Essentially, after spending a certain cost we report a point (BO) or a classification (LSE), but there is no preference on the values of f(xt) for the points xt chosen before coming to such a decision (in contrast with other notions such as cumulative regret).\nTRUVAR algorithm: Our algorithm is described in Algorithm 1, making use of the updates described in Algorithm 2. The algorithm keeps track of a sequence of unclassified points Mt, representing potential maximizers for BO or points close to h for LSE. This set is updated based on the confidence bounds depending on constants β(i). The algorithm proceeds in epochs, where in the i-th epoch it seeks to bring the confidence β1/2(i) σt(x) of points within Mt below a target value η(i). It does this by greedily minimizing the sum of truncated variances∑ x∈Mt−1 max{β(i)σ 2 t−1|x(x), η(i)} arising from choosing the point x, along with a normalization and division by c(x) to favor low-cost points. The truncation by η(i) in this decision rule means that once the confidence of a point is below the current target value, there is no preference in making it any lower (until the target is decreased). Once the confidence of every point in Mt is less than a factor 1 + δ above the target value, the target confidence is reduced according to a multiplication by r ∈ (0, 1). An illustration of the process is given in Figure 1, with details in the caption. For level-set estimation, we also keep track of the sets Ht and Lt, containing points believed to have function values above and below h, respectively. The constraint x ∈ Mt−1 in (5)–(7) ensures that {Mt} is non-increasing with respect to inclusion, and Ht and Lt are non-decreasing.\nAlgorithm 1 Truncated Variance Reduction (TRUVAR)\nInput: Domain D, GP prior (µ0, σ0, k), confidence bound parameters δ > 0, r ∈ (0, 1), {β(i)}i≥1, η(1) > 0, and for LSE, level-set threshold h\n1: Initialize the epoch number i = 1 and potential maximizers M(0) = D. 2: for t = 1, 2, . . . do 3: Choose\nxt = arg max x∈D\n∑ x∈Mt−1 max{β(i)σ 2 t−1(x), η 2 (i)} − ∑ x∈Mt−1 max{β(i)σ 2 t−1|x(x), η 2 (i)}\nc(x) . (3)\n4: Observe the noisy function sample yt, and update according to Algorithm 2 to obtain Mt, µt, σt, lt and ut, as well as Ht and Lt in the case of LSE 5: while maxx∈Mt β 1/2 (i) σt(x) ≤ (1 + δ)η(i) do 6: Increment i, set η(i) = r × η(i−1).\nThe choices of β(i), δ, and r are discussed in Section 4. As with previous works, the kernel is assumed known in our theoretical results, whereas in practice it is typically learned from training data [3]. Characterizing the effect of model mismatch or online hyperparameter updates is beyond the scope of this paper, but is an interesting direction for future work.\nAlgorithm 2 Parameter Updates for TRUVAR\nInput: Selected points and observations {xt′}tt′=1; {yt′}tt′=1, previous sets Mt−1, Ht−1, Lt−1, parameter β1/2(i) , and for LSE, level-set threshold h.\n1: Update µt and σt according to (1)–(2), and form the upper and lower confidence bounds\nut(x) = µt(x) + β 1/2 (i) σt(x), `t(x) = µt(x)− β 1/2 (i) σt(x).

That is, we define this term differently in the two scenarios, but then we provide theorems that simultaneously apply to both. All proofs are given in the supplementary material.\nDefinition 3.1. After time step t of TRUVAR, we use the following terminology:\n• For BO, the set Mt is -accurate if it contains all true maxima x∗ ∈ arg maxx f(x), and all of its points satisfy f(x∗)− f(x) ≤ . • For LSE, the triplet (Mt, Ht, Lt) is -accurate if all points in Ht satisfy f(x) > h, all points in Lt satisfy f(x) < h, and all points in Mt satisfy |f(x)− h| ≤ 2 .\nIn both cases, the cumulative cost after time t is defined as Ct = ∑t t′=1 c(xt′).\nWe use 2 in the LSE setting instead of since this creates a region of size where the function value lies, which is consistent with the BO setting. Our performance criterion for level-set estimation is slightly different from that of [2], but the two are closely related."

      "text" : "Preliminary definitions: Suppose that the {β(i)} are chosen to ensure valid confidence bounds, i.e., lt(x) ≤ f(x) ≤ ut(x) with high probability; see Theorem 3.1 and its proof below for such choices. In this case, we have after the i-th epoch that all points are either already discarded (BO) or classified (LSE), or are known up to the confidence level (1 + δ)η(i). For the points with such confidence, we have ut(x)− lt(x) ≤ 2(1 + δ)η(i), and hence\nut(x) ≤ lt(x) + 2(1 + δ)η(i) ≤ f(x) + 2(1 + δ)η(i), (8)\nand similarly lt(x) ≥ f(x)− 2(1 + δ)η(i). This means that all points other than those within a gap of width 4(1 + δ)η(i) must have been discarded or classified:\nMt ⊆ { x : f(x) ≥ f(x∗)− 4(1 + δ)η(i) } =: M (i) (BO) (9)\nMt ⊆ { x : |f(x)− h| ≤ 2(1 + δ)η(i) } =: M (i) (LSE) (10)\nSince no points are discarded or classified initially, we define M (0) = D.\nFor a collection of points S = (x′1, . . . , x ′ |S|), possibly containing duplicates, we write the total cost as c(S) = ∑|S| i=1 c(x ′ i). Moreover, we denote the posterior variance upon observing the points up to time t− 1 and the additional points in S by σt−1|S(x). Therefore, c(x) = c({x}) and σt−1|x(x) = σt−1|{x}(x). The minimum cost (respectively, maximum cost) is denoted by cmin = minx∈D c(x) (respectively, cmax = maxx∈D c(x)).\nFinally, we introduce the quantity\nC∗(ξ,M) = min S\n{ c(S) : max\nx∈M σ0|S(x) ≤ ξ\n} , (11)\nrepresenting the minimum cost to achieve a posterior standard deviation of at most ξ within M .\nMain result: In all of our results, we make the following assumption. Assumption 3.1. The kernel k(x, x′) is such that the variance reduction function\nψt,x(S) = σ 2 t (x)− σ2t|S(x) (12)\nis submodular [17] for any time t, and any selected points (x1, . . . , xt) and query point x.\nThis assumption has been used in several previous works based on Gaussian processes, and sufficient conditions for its validity can be found in [18, Sec. 8]. We now state the following general guarantee. Theorem 3.1. Fix > 0 and δ ∈ (0, 1), and suppose there exist values {C(i)} and {β(i)} such that\nC(i) ≥ C∗ ( η(i)\nβ 1/2 (i)\n,M (i−1)\n) log |M (i−1)|β(i)\nδ 2 η2(i)\n+ cmax, (13)\nand\nβ(i) ≥ 2 log |D| (∑ i′≤i C(i′) )2 π2\n6δc2min . (14)\nThen if TRUVAR is run with these choices of β(i) until the cumulative cost reaches C = ∑\ni : 4(1+δ)η(i−1)>\nC(i), (15)\nthen with probability at least 1− δ, we have -accuracy.\nWhile this theorem is somewhat abstract, it captures the fact that the algorithm improves when points having a lower cost and/or lower noise are available, since both of these lead to a smaller value of C∗(ξ,M); the former by directly incurring a smaller cost, and the latter by shrinking the variance more rapidly. Below, we apply this result to some important cases."

In the supplementary material, we provide a theorem with a condition for -accuracy of the form T ≥ Ω∗ ( C1γT βT 2 + 1 )\nwith C1 = 1log(1+σ−2) , thus matching [2, 4] up to logarithmic factors. In the following, we present a refined version that has a significantly better dependence on the noise level, thus exemplifying that a more careful analysis of (13) can provide improvements over the standard bounding techniques.\nCorollary 3.1. Fix > 0 and δ ∈ (0, 1), define βT = 2 log |D|T 2π2 6δ , and set η(1) = 1 and r = 1 2 .

This condition is of the form T ≥ Ω ∗(σ2γT βT 2 + C1γT βT σ2 + 1 ) .\nThe choices η(1) = 1 and r = 12 are made for mathematical convenience, and a similar result follows for any other choices η(1) > 0 and r ∈ (0, 1), possibly with different constant factors.\nAs σ2 →∞ (i.e., high noise), both of the above-mentioned bounds have noise dependence O∗(σ2), since log(1 + α−1) = O(α−1) as α → ∞. On the other hand, as σ2 → 0 (i.e., low noise), C1 is logarithmic, and Corollary 3.1 is significantly better provided that σ. Choosing the noise and cost: Here we consider the setting that there is a domain of points D0 that the reward function depends on, and alongside each point we can choose a noise variance σ2(k) (k = 1, . . . ,K). Hence,D = D0×{1, · · · ,K}. Lower noise variances incur a higher cost according to a cost function c(k).\nCorollary 3.2. For each k = 1, · · · ,K, let T ∗(k) denote the smallest value of T such that (17) holds with σ2(k) in place of σ2, and with βT = 2 log\n|D|T 2c2maxπ2 6δc2min\n. Then, under the preceding setting, there exist choices of β(i) (not depending on T ) such that we have -accuracy with probability at least 1−δ once the cumulative cost reaches mink c(k)T ∗(k).\nThis result roughly states that we obtain a bound as good as that obtained by sticking to any fixed choice of noise level. In other words, every choice of noise (and corresponding cost) corresponds to a different version of a BO or LSE algorithm (e.g., [2, 4]), and our algorithm has a similar performance guarantee to the best among all of those. This is potentially useful in avoiding the need for running an algorithm once per noise level and then choosing the best-performing one. Moreover, we found numerically that beyond matching the best fixed noise strategy, we can strictly improve over it by mixing the noise levels; see Section 4."

      "heading" : "4 Experimental Results",
      "text" : "We evaluate our algorithm in both the level-set estimation and Bayesian optimization settings.\nParameter choices: As with previous GP-based algorithms that use confidence bounds, our theoretical choice of β(i) in TRUVAR is typically overly conservative. Therefore, instead of using (14) directly, we use a more aggressive variant with similar dependence on the domain size and time: β(i) = a log(|D|t2(i)), where t(i) is the time at which the epoch starts, and a is a constant. Instead of the choice a = 2 dictated by (14), we set a = 0.5 for BO to avoid over-exploration. We found exploration to be slightly more beneficial for LSE, and hence set a = 1 for this setting. We found TRUVAR to be quite robust with respect to the choices of the remaining parameters, and simply set η(1) = 1, r = 0.1, and δ = 0 in all experiments; while our theory assumes δ > 0, in practice there is negligible difference between choosing zero and a small positive value.\nLevel-set estimation: For the LSE experiments, we use a common classification rule in all algorithms, classifying the points according to the posterior mean as Ĥt = {x : µt(x) ≥ h} and L̂t = {x : µt(x) < h}. The classification accuracy is measured by the F1-score (i.e., the harmonic mean of precision and recall) with respect to the true super- and sub-level sets.\nWe compare TRUVAR against the GP-based LSE algorithm [2], which we name via the authors’ surnames as GCHK, as well as the state-of-the-art straddle (STR) heuristic [7] and the maximum variance rule (VAR) [2]. Descriptions can be found in the supplementary material. GCHK includes an exploration constant βt, and we follow the recommendation in [2] of setting β 1/2 t = 3.\nLake data (unit cost): We begin with a data set from the domain of environmental monitoring of inland waters, consisting of 2024 in situ measurements of chlorophyll concentration within a vertical transect plane, collected by an autonomous surface vessel in Lake Zürich [19]. As in [2], our goal is to detect regions of high concentration. We evaluate each algorithm on a 50 × 50 grid of points, with the corresponding values coming from the GP posterior that was derived using the original data (see Figure 2d). We use the Matérn-5/2 ARD kernel, setting its hyperparameters by maximizing the likelihood on the second (smaller) available dataset. The level-set threshold h is set to 1.5.\nIn Figure 2a, we show the performance of the algorithms averaged over 100 different runs; here the randomness is only with respect to the starting point, as we are in the noiseless setting. We observe that in this unit-cost case, TRUVAR performs similarly to GCHK and STR. All three methods outperform VAR, which is good for global exploration but less suited to level-set estimation.\nLake data (varying cost): Next, we modify the above setting by introducing pointwise costs that are a function of the previous sampled point x′, namely, cx′(x) = 0.25|x1 − x′1| + 4(|x2| + 1), where x1 is the vessel position and x2 is the depth. Although we did not permit such a dependence on x′ in our original setup, the algorithm itself remains unchanged. Our choice of cost penalizes the distance traveled |x1 − x′1|, as well as the depth of the measurement |x2|. Since incorporating costs into existing algorithms is non-trivial, we only compare against the original version of GCHK that ignores costs.\nIn Figure 2b, we see that TruVaR significantly outperforms GCHK, achieving a higher F1 score for a significantly smaller cost. The intuition behind this can be seen in Figures 2e and 2f, where we show the points sampled by TruVaR and GCHK in one experiment run, connecting all pairs of consecutive points. GCHK is designed to pick few points, but since it ignores costs, the distance traveled is large. In contrast, by incorporating costs, TRUVAR tends to travel small distances, often even staying in the same x1 location to take measurements at multiple depths x2.\nSynthetic data with multiple noise levels: In this experiment, we demonstrate Corollary 3.2 by considering the setting in which the algorithm can choose the sampling noise variance and incur the associated cost. We use a synthetic function sampled from a GP on a 50× 50 grid with an isotropic squared exponential kernel having length scale l = 0.1 and unit variance, and set h = 2.25. We use three different noise levels, σ2 ∈ {10−6, 10−3, 0.05}, with corresponding costs {15, 10, 2}. We run GCHK separately for each of the three noise levels, while running TRUVAR as normal and allowing it to mix between the noise levels. The resulting F1-scores are shown in Figure 2c. The best-performing version of GCHK changes throughout the time horizon, while TRUVAR is consistently better than all three. A discussion on how TRUVAR mixes between the noise levels can be found in the supplementary material.\nBayesian optimization. We now provide the results of two experiments for the BO setting.\nSynthetic data: We first conduct a similar experiment as that in [8, 11], generating 200 different test functions defined on [0, 1]2. To generate a single test function, 200 points are chosen uniformly at random from [0, 1]2, their function values are generated from a GP using an isotropic squared exponential kernel with length scale l = 0.1 and unit variance, and the resulting posterior mean forms the function on the whole domain [0, 1]2. We subsequently assume that samples of this function are corrupted by Gaussian noise with σ2 = 10−6. The extension of TRUVAR to continuous domains is straightforward, and is explained in the supplementary material. For all algorithms considered, we evaluate the performance according to the regret of a single reported point, namely, the one having the highest posterior mean.\nWe compare the performance of TRUVAR against expected improvement (EI), GP-upper confidence bound (GP-UCB), entropy search (ES) and minimum regret search (MRS), whose acquisition functions are outlined in the supplementary material. We use publicly available code for ES and MRS [20]. The exploration parameter βt in GP-UCB is set according to the recommendation in [3] of dividing the theoretical value by five, and the parameters for ES and MRS are set according to the recommendations given in [11, Section 5.1].\nFigure 3a plots the median of the regret, and Figure 3b plots the mean after removing outliers (i.e., the best and worst 5% of the runs). In the earlier rounds, ES and MRS provide the best performance, while TRUVAR improves slowly due to exploration. However, the regret of TRUVAR subsequently drops rapidly, giving the best performance in the later rounds after “zooming in” towards the maximum. GP-UCB generally performs well with the aggressive choice of βt, despite previous works’ experiments revealing it to perform poorly with the theoretical value.\nHyperparameter tuning data: In this experiment, we use the SVM on grid dataset, previously used in [21]. A 25× 14× 4 grid of hyperparameter configurations resulting in 1400 data points was preevaluated, forming the search space. The goal is to find a configuration with small validation error. We use a Matérn-5/2 ARD kernel, and re-learn its hyperparameters by maximizing the likelihood after sampling every 3 points. Since the hyperparameters are not fixed in advance, we replace Mt−1 by D in (5) to avoid incorrectly ruling points out early on, allowing some removed points to be added again in later steps. Once the estimated hyperparameters stop to vary significantly, the size of the set of potential maximizers decreases almost monotonically. Since we consider the noiseless setting here, we measure performance using the simple regret, i.e., the best point found so far.\nWe again average over 100 random starting points, and plot the resulting validation error in Figure 3c. Even in this noiseless and unit-cost setting that EI and GP-UCB are suited to, we find that TRUVAR performs slightly better, giving a better validation error with smaller error bars."

Moreover, compared to other BO algorithms that perform a lookahead (e.g., ES and MRS), TRUVAR avoids the computationally expensive task of averaging over the posterior and/or measurements, and comes with rigorous theoretical guarantees.\nAcknowledgment: This work was supported in part by the European Commission under Grant ERC Future Proof, SNF Sinergia project CRSII2-147633, SNF 200021-146750, and EPFL Fellows Horizon2020 grant 665667."

For level-set estimation, we have the following:\n• The GCHK algorithm [2] evaluates, at each iteration, the point that is not yet classified with the largest ambiguity: xt = arg maxx∈Mt−1 min{ut(x) − h, h − `t(x)}, where ut and `t are defined as in (4) with a parameter βt replacing β(i). Here, similarly to our algorithm, Mt−1 is the set of points that have not yet been classified as having a value above or below the threshold h.\n• The straddle (STR) heuristic [7] chooses xt = arg maxx∈D 1.96σt−1(x)− |µt−1(x)− h|, favoring high-uncertainty points that are expected to have function values closer to h.\n• The maximum variance rule (VAR) [2] simply chooses xt = arg maxx∈D σt−1(x).\nFor Bayesian optimization, we have the following:\n• The expected improvement (EI) algorithm [1] chooses xt = arg maxx∈D Et[(f(x) − ξt)1{f(x) > ξt}], where Et[·] denotes averaging with respect to the posterior distribution at time t, and ξt is the best observed value so far. Since the posterior is Gaussian, the expectation can easily be expressed in closed form.\n• The Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (GP-UCB) algorithm [3] chooses the points with the highest upper confidence bounds, xt = arg maxx∈D µt−1(x) +βtσt−1(x), where βt is a parameter controlling the level of exploration performed.\n• The Entropy Search (ES) algorithm can be interpreted as approximating the rule xt = arg minx∈D h(fx∗|t,x), where h(f) = ∫ D f(x) log 1f(x)dx denotes the differential entropy,\nand fx∗|t,x denotes the density function of the optimal action x∗ given the observations up to time t along with the additional observation x. Intuitively, this rule seeks to minimize the uncertainty of x∗. Since its exact evaluation is intractable, it is approximated using Monte Carlo techniques to average with respect to the posterior distribution and the measurements.\n• The Minimum Regret Search (MRS) algorithm [11] also resembles ES, but works with the expected regret instead of the differential entropy. Once again, Monte Carlo techniques are used to average with respect to the posterior distribution and the measurements.\nEfficiently computing the acquisition function: To compute the value of the acquisition function (3) for different x ∈ D, we need to compute σ2t−1|x(Mt−1) ∈ R\n|Mt−1|, i.e., the posterior variance of points in Mt−1 upon observing x along with x1, · · · , xt−1. Instead of computing it directly, it is more efficient to recursively compute σ2t−1|x(Mt−1) = σ 2 t−1(Mt−1)−∆t−1|x(Mt−1). The difference term, ∆t−1|x(Mt−1), can be computed as [8]:\n∆t−1|x(Mt−1) = diag ( Covt−1(Mt−1, x)(σ2 + σ2t−1(x)) −1Covt−1(Mt−1, x)T ) , (18)\nwhere\nσ2t−1(x) = k(x, x)− kt−1(x)T ( Kt−1 + Σt−1 )−1 kt−1(x) (19)\nCovt−1(Mt−1, x) = k(Mt−1, x)− kt−1(Mt−1)T ( Kt−1 + Σt−1 )−1 kt−1(x), (20)\nand where k(Mt−1, x) = [ k(x, x) ] x∈|Mt−1| ∈ R\n|Mt−1|, and kt−1(Mt−1) =[ k(x, x) ] x∈|Mt−1|,x∈{1,...,t−1} ∈ R |Mt−1|×(t−1). When the Cholesky decomposition of\nKt−1 + Σt−1 is known, ( Kt−1 + Σt−1 )−1 kt−1(x) can be computed in time O(t2).\nDetails on LSE experiment with multiple noise levels: Figure 4a plots the randomly-generated function that was used in this experiment. Figure 4b plots the average cost spent by TRUVAR on each noise level by the end of the experiment, again averaged over 100 trials. We see that the cost is roughly equally distributed across the three levels. To be more specific, we observed that TRUVAR initially chooses high noise levels in order to cheaply explore, and throughout the course of the experiments, it gradually switches to lower noise levels in order to accurately determine the function values around the maximum. This is consistent with the behavior of the three version of GCHK, with σ2 = 0.05 performing well in the early stages, but σ2 = 10−6 being preferable in the later stages.\nExtension of TRUVAR for synthetic BO experiment We used the extension of TRUVAR to continuous domains outlined in Appendix A, approximating the integrals over Mt by summations that are restricted to points on a uniformly-spaced 50 × 50 grid covering [0, 1]2. We optimized our acquisition function using DIRECT [23]."

      "heading" : "C Proof of General Result (Theorem 3.1)",
      "text" : "We begin with the following lemma from [3].\nLemma C.1. [3] For each t, define βt = 2 log |D|t 2π2\n6δ . With probability at least 1− δ, we have for all x and t that |f(x)− µt(x)| ≤ β1/2t σt(x).\nWe conclude that in order for µt(·) ± β1/2(i) σt(·) to provide valid confidence bounds, it suffices to ensure that β(i) ≥ βt for all t in epoch i. From (14), we see that this is true provided that the time taken to reach the end of the i-th epoch is at most 1cmin ∑ i′≤i C(i′). Since cmin is the minimum pointwise cost, this holds provided that the cost incurred in epoch i is at most C(i). The bulk of the proof is devoted to showing that this is the case.\nWe connect TRUVAR with the following budgeted submodular covering problem:2\nminimizeS c(S) subject to gt(S) = gt,max, (21)\nwhere\ngt(S) = ∑\nx∈Mt−1\nmax { σ2t−1(x), η2(i)\nβ(i)\n} − ∑ x∈Mt−1 max { σ2t−1|S(x), η2(i) β(i) } , (22)\nand where gt,max is the highest possible value of gt(S) over arbitrarily large S, i.e., it is the value obtained once all of the summands in the second summation in (22) have saturated to η2(i) β(i) :\ngt,max = ∑\nx∈Mt−1\n( max { σ2t−1(x), η2(i)\nβ(i)\n} − η2(i)\nβ(i)\n) (23)\n= ∑\nx∈Mt−1\nmax { 0, σ2t−1(x)− η2(i)\nβ(i)\n} . (24)\nWe thus refer to gt,max as the excess variance; see Figure 5 for an illustration. Note that each time instant t corresponds to a different function gt(S), and we are considering sets S of an arbitrary size even though our algorithm only chooses one point at each time instant.\n2Recall that S may contain duplicates, and these are counted multiple times accordingly in the definitions of both c(S) and gt(S). All of our equations can be cast in terms of standard sets (without duplicates) by expanding D to D × {1, · · · , N} for any integer N that is larger than the maximum number of points that are chosen throughout the course of the algorithm.\nBy our assumption on the submodularity of the variance reduction function, and the fact that taking the minimum with a constant3 preserves submodularity [17], gt(S) is also submodular. It is also easily seen to be monotonically increasing, and normalized in the sense that gt(∅) = 0. Our selection rule (3) at time t can now be interpreted as the first step in a greedy algorithm for solving the budgeted submodular optimization problem (21); specifically, the greedy rule optimizes the objective value per unit cost. To obtain performance guarantees, we use Lemma 2 of [24] specialized to |S| = 1, which reads as follows in our own notation:\ngt({xt}) ≥ c(xt)\nc(S∗t ) gt,max, (25)\nwhere S∗t is an optimal solution to (21), and hence gt(S ∗) = gt,max. Here xt is the point chosen greedily by our algorithm.\nWe now consider the behavior of the excess variance gt,max in a single epoch, i.e., the duration of a single value of i in the algorithm. We claim that for t and t+ 1 in the same epoch, we have\ngt+1,max ≤ gt,max − gt({xt}). (26) To see this, we note from (22)–(23) that this would hold with equality if we were to have Mt = Mt−1, since by definition we have σ2t (x) = σ 2 t−1|{xt}(x). We therefore obtain (26) by recalling that Mt is decreasing in t with respect to inclusion, and noting from (24) that any given gt,max can only decrease when Mt−1 is smaller.\nCombining (25)–(26) gives\ngt+1,max ≤ (\n1− c(xt) c(S∗t )\n) gt,max. (27)\nWe also note that c(S∗t+1) ≤ c(S∗t ), which follows since σ2t (·) is decreasing in t and Mt is shrinking in t, and therefore at time t + 1 a smaller cost is required to ensure that all terms in the second summation of (22) have saturated to η2(i) β(i)\n. Hence, and applying (27) recursively, we obtain for t and t+ ` in the same epoch that\ngt+`,max gt,max\n≤ t+∏̀\nt′=t+1\n( 1− c(xt ′)\nc(S∗t )\n) (28)\n≤ exp ( − ∑t+` t′=t+1 c(xt′)\nc(S∗t )\n) , (29)\nwhere we have applied the inequality 1 − α ≤ e−α. Moreover, the total cost incurred by choosing these points is precisely ∑t+` t′=t+1 c(xt). Thus, letting t(i) be the first time index in the i-th epoch, we find that in order to remove all but a proportion γ of the initial excess variance gt(i),max, it suffices that the cost incurred is at least\nc(S∗t(i)) log 1\nγ . (30)\n3The minimum becomes a maximum after negation.\nNext, we observe that since the posterior variance is upper bounded by one due to the assumption k(x, x) = 1, the initial excess variance gt(i),max is upper bounded by gt(i),max ≤ |Mt(i)−1|, the size of the set of potential maximizers at the start of the epoch. It follows that if we set\nγ = δ 2 η2(i)\nβ(i)|Mt(i)−1| , (31)\nthen removing all but a proportion γ of gt(i),max also implies removing all but δ 2 η2(i) β(i)\nof it. In other words, if at time t we have incurred a cost in epoch i satisfying (30) with γ as in (31), then we must have gt,max ≤ δ 2 η2(i) β(i) .\nRemoving all of the excess variance would imply η(i)-confidence at all points in Mt. In the worst case, the remaining excess variance δ 2 η2(i) β(i) is concentrated entirely on a single point, in which case\nits confidence is upper bounded by √ 1 + δ 2 η(i), which is further upper bounded by (1 + δ)η(i) due to the identity √\n1 + α2 ≤ 1 + α. Combining these observations, we conclude that in the i-th epoch, upon incurring a cost of at least\nc(S∗t(i)) log |Mt(i)−1|β(i)\nδ 2 η2(i)\n, (32)\nwe are guaranteed to have (1 + δ)η(i)-confidence for all points in Mt. Having such confidence is precisely the condition used in the algorithm to move onto the next epoch, and we conclude that the epoch must end by (or sooner than) the time that (32) holds.\nIn accordance with the discussion following Lemma C.1, we need to show that when the highprobability event in that lemma holds true, (32) is upper bounded by the right-hand side of (13) for all epochs. We do this via an induction argument on the epoch number:\n• As a base case, recalling that M0 = M(0) = D, we find that (32) and (13) coincide, with the addition of cmax arising since once (32) is exceeded, it may be exceeded by any amount up to cmax.\n• Fix an epoch number i > 1, and suppose that for all i′ < i, the cost incurred in epoch i′ was at most C∗ ( η(i′) β 1/2\n(i′)\n,M (i′−1) ) log |M(i′−1)|β(i′)\nδ 2 η2 (i′)\n+ cmax. By the choice of β(i′) in (14), we find that under the event in Lemma C.1, the confidence bounds µt ± √ β(i′)σt must have been valid for all t in the epochs i′ < i, and hence M (i−1) ⊆Mt(i)−1 (cf., (9)–(10)). From this, we claim that an analogous argument to the base case implies that (32) is upper bounded by the right-hand side of (13), as required. The only additional argument compared to the base case is noting that c(S∗t(i)) defines the minimum cost to uniformly shrink the posterior standard deviation within Mt(i)−1 down to η2(i) β(i) after already having chosen x1, . . . , xt(i)−1,\nwhereas C∗ ( η(i) β 1/2\n(i)\n,M (i−1) ) is defined analogously for the set M (i−1) with no previously-chosen\npoints. The latter clearly upper bounds the former.\nFinally, we check the conditions for -accuracy in Definition 3.1. In the case of BO, summing (13) over all of the epochs such that 4(1 + δ)η(i−1) > yields (15); recall from (9) that after any epoch i such that 4(1 + δ)η(i) ≤ , all points are at most -suboptimal. We also note that all true maxima must remain in Mt, due to the fact that we showed β(i) yields valid confidence bounds with high probability, and we only ever discard points that are deemed suboptimal according to those bounds. For LSE, a similar conclusion follows from (10) by summing over all epochs such that"

This condition is of the form T ≥ Ω ∗(C1γT βT 2 + 1 ) .\nWe bound the cardinality of S in (33) by considering a procedure that greedily picks arg maxx∈M σt(x). We claim that after selecting k points according to this procedure to construct a set Sk, we have\nmax x σ20|Sk(x) ≤ C1 γk k , (38)\nwhere C1 = 1log(1+σ−2) .

Letting T = T denote the total time horizon, and using (36), we find that β(i) in (35) can be upper bounded by 2 log |D|T 2π2 6δ , which is precisely βT . By similarly using the monotonicity of γt, we obtain\nT ∗ ( η(i)\nβ 1/2 (i)\n,M (i−1)\n) ≤ C1γTβT\nη2(i) + 1, (43)\nwhere the addition of one is to account for possible rounding up to the nearest integer.\nUsing (43), we find that in order for (34) to hold it suffices that T(i) ≥ ( C1γTβT η2(i) + 1 ) log |M (i−1)|β(i)\nδ 2 η2(i)\n+ 1. (44)\nSince we are only considering values of i such that 4(1 + δ)η(i−1) > , and since M (i−1) ⊆ D, we can upper bound the logarithm by log 16(1+δ)\n2|D|β(i) δ 2 2\n> 1, and hence in order for (44) to hold it suffices that T(i) ≥ ( C1γTβT η2(i) + 2 ) log 16(1 + δ)2|D|βT δ 2 2 . (45)\nWe also note that since η(i) = η(1)ri−1, the condition 4(1 + δ)η(i−1) > is equivalent to\n4(1 + δ)η(1)r i−2 > (46)\n⇐⇒ ri−2 > 4(1 + δ)η(1)\n(47)\n⇐⇒ i < 2 + log1/r 4(1 + δ)η(1)\n(48)\n⇐⇒ i ≤ ⌈ log1/r 4(1 + δ)η(1) ⌉ + 1 (49)\n⇐⇒ i ≤ ⌈ log1/r 4(1 + δ)η(1)\nr\n⌉ , (50)\nwhere in the last line we used log1/r 1 r = 1.

Our starting point to improve the noise dependence is to note that the following holds under the more restrictive\ncondition σ2t ≤ σ2:\nσ2t = σ 2σ\n2 t\nσ2 (56) ≤ 2σ2 log (\n1 + σ2t σ2\n) , (57)\nwhere we have used the fact that α ≤ 2 log(1 + α) for α ∈ [0, 1].

Since (1 + δ)η(i) is the confidence level obtained after epoch i, and since β 1/2 (i) σt is the confidence level after time t, we find that in order to ensure σ2t ≤ σ2 it suffices that (1+δ)2η2(i) β(i) ≤ σ2.
