      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "The focus of this paper is a class of high-dimensional matrix decomposition problems of the following variety. Suppose that we observe a matrix Y ∈ Rd1×d2 that is (approximately) equal to the sum of two unknown matrices: how to recover good estimates of the pair? Of course, this problem is ill-posed in general, so that it is necessary to impose some kind of low-dimensional structure on the matrix components, one example being rank constraints. The framework of this paper supposes that one matrix component (denoted Θ⋆) is low-rank, either exactly or in an approximate sense, and allows for general forms of low-dimensional structure for the second component Γ⋆. Two particular cases of structure for Γ⋆ that have been considered in past work are elementwise sparsity [9, 8, 7] and column-wise sparsity [18, 29].\nProblems of matrix decomposition are motivated by a variety of applications. Many classical methods for dimensionality reduction, among them factor analysis and principal\ncomponents analysis (PCA), are based on estimating a low-rank matrix from data. Different forms of robust PCA can be formulated in terms of matrix decomposition using the matrix Γ⋆ to model the gross errors [9, 7, 29]. Similarly, certain problems of robust covariance estimation can be described using matrix decompositions with a column/row-sparse structure, as we describe in this paper. The problem of low rank plus sparse matrix decomposition also arises in Gaussian covariance selection with hidden variables [8], in which case the inverse covariance of the observed vector can be decomposed as the sum of a sparse matrix with a low rank matrix. Matrix decompositions also arise in multi-task regression [32, 21, 27], which involve solving a collection of regression problems, referred to as tasks, over a common set of features. For some features, one expects their weighting to be preserved across features, which can be modeled by a low-rank constraint, whereas other features are expected to vary across tasks, which can be modeled by a sparse component [5, 2]. See Section 2.1 for further discussion of these motivating applications.\nIn this paper, we study a noisy linear observation that can be used to describe a number of applications in a unified way. Let X be a linear operator that maps matrices in Rd1×d2 to matrices in Rn1×n2 . In the simplest of cases, this observation operator is simply the identity mapping, so that we necessarily have n1 = d1 and n2 = d2. However, as we discuss in the sequel, it is useful for certain applications, such as multi-task regression, to consider more general linear operators of this form. Hence, we study the problem matrix decomposition for the general linear observation model\nY = X(Θ⋆ + Γ⋆) +W, (1)\nwhere Θ⋆ and Γ⋆ are unknown d1 × d2 matrices, and W ∈ Rn1×n2 is some type of observation noise; it is potentially dense, and can either be deterministic or stochastic. The matrix Θ⋆ is assumed to be either exactly low-rank, or well-approximated by a low-rank matrix, whereas the matrix Γ⋆ is assumed to have a complementary type of low-dimensional structure, such as sparsity. As we discuss in Section 2.1, a variety of interesting statistical models can be formulated as instances of the observation model (1). Such models include versions of factor analysis involving non-identity noise matrices, robust forms of covariance estimation, and multi-task regression with some features shared across tasks, and a sparse subset differing across tasks. Given this observation model, our goal is to recover accurate estimates of the decomposition (Θ⋆,Γ⋆) based on the noisy observations Y . In this paper, we analyze simple estimators based on convex relaxations involving the nuclear norm, and a second general norm R.\nMost past work on the model (1) has focused on the noiseless setting (W = 0), and for the identity observation operator (so that X(Θ⋆ + Γ⋆) = Θ⋆ + Γ⋆). Chandrasekaran et al. [9] studied the case when Γ⋆ is assumed to sparse, with a relatively small number s ≪ d1d2 of non-zero entries. In the noiseless setting, they gave sufficient conditions for exact recovery for an adversarial sparsity model, meaning the non-zero positions of Γ⋆ can be arbitrary. Subsequent work by Candes et al. [7] analyzed the same model but under an assumption of random sparsity, meaning that the non-zero positions are chosen uniformly at random. In very recent work, Xu et al. [29] have analyzed a different model, in which the matrix Γ⋆ is assumed to be columnwise sparse, with a relatively small number s ≪ d2 of non-zero columns. Their analysis guaranteed approximate recovery for the low-rank matrix, in particular for the uncorrupted columns. After initial posting of this work, we became aware of recent work by Hsu et al. [14], who derived Frobenius norm error bounds for the case of exact elementwise sparsity. As we discuss in more detail in Section 3.4, in this special case, our bounds are based\non milder conditions, and yield sharper rates for problems where the rank and sparsity scale with the dimension.\nOur main contribution is to provide a general oracle-type result (Theorem 1) on approximate recovery of the unknown decomposition from noisy observations, valid for structural constraints on Γ⋆ imposed via a decomposable regularizer. The class of decomposable regularizers, introduced in past work by Negahban et al. [19], includes the elementwise ℓ1-norm and columnwise (2, 1)-norm as special cases, as well as various other regularizers used in practice. Our main result is stated in Theorem 1: it provides finite-sample guarantees for estimates obtained by solving a class of convex programs formed using a composite regularizer. The resulting Frobenius norm error bounds consist of multiple terms, each of which has a natural interpretation in terms of the estimation and approximation errors associated with the subproblems of recovering Θ⋆ and Γ⋆. We then specialize Theorem 1 to the case of elementwise or columnwise sparsity models for Γ⋆, thereby obtaining recovery guarantees for matrices Θ⋆ that may be either exactly or approximately low-rank, as well as matrices Γ⋆ that may be either exactly or approximately sparse. We provide non-asymptotic error bounds for general noise matrices W both for elementwise and columnwise sparse models (see Corollaries 1 through Corollary 6). To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results that apply to this broad class of models, allowing for noisiness (W 6= 0) that is either stochastic or deterministic, matrix components that are only approximately low-rank and/or sparse, and general forms of the observation operator X.\nIn addition, the error bounds obtained by our analysis are sharp, and cannot be improved in general. More precisely, for the case of stochastic noise matrices and the identity observation operator, we prove that the squared Frobenius errors achieved by our estimators are minimaxoptimal (see Theorem 2). An interesting feature of our analysis is that, in contrast to previous work [9, 29, 7], we do not impose incoherence conditions on the singular vectors of Θ⋆; rather, we control the interaction with a milder condition involving the dual norm of the regularizer. In the special case of elementwise sparsity, this dual norm enforces an upper bound on the “spikiness” of the low-rank component, and has proven useful in the related setting of noisy matrix completion [20]. This constraint is not strong enough to guarantee identifiability of the models (and hence exact recovery in the noiseless setting), but it does provide a bound on the degree of non-identifiability. We show that this same term arises in both the upper and lower bounds on the problem of approximate recovery that is of interest in the noisy setting.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we set up the problem in a precise way, and describe the estimators. Section 3 is devoted to the statement of our main result on achievability, as well as its various corollaries for special cases of the matrix decomposition problem. We also state a matching lower bound on the minimax error for matrix decomposition with stochastic noise. In Section 4, we provide numerical simulations that illustrate the sharpness of our theoretical predictions. Section 5 is devoted to the proofs of our results, with certain more technical aspects of the argument deferred to the appendices, and we conclude with a discussion in Section 6.\nNotation: For the reader’s convenience, we summarize here some of the standard notation used throughout this paper. For any matrix M ∈ Rd1×d2 , we define the Frobenius norm |||M |||F : = √∑d1 j=1 ∑d2 k=1M 2 jk, corresponding to the ordinary Euclidean norm of its entries. We denote its singular values by σ1(M) ≥ σ2(M) ≥ · · · ≥ σd(M) ≥ 0, where d = min{d1, d2}. Its nuclear norm is given by |||M |||N = ∑d j=1 σj(M)."

[25] and references therein), with a norm-based regularizer R : Rd1×d2 → R+ used to constrain the structure of Γ⋆. We provide a general theorem applicable to a class of regularizers R that satisfy a certain decomposability property [19], and then consider in detail a few particular choices of R that have been studied in past work, including the elementwise ℓ1-norm, and the columnwise (2, 1)-norm (see Examples 4 and 5 below)."

      "heading" : "2.1 Some motivating applications",
      "text" : "We begin with some motivating applications for the general linear observation model with noise (1).\nExample 1 (Factor analysis with sparse noise). In a factor analysis model, random vectors Zi ∈ Rd are assumed to be generated in an i.i.d. manner from the model\nZi = LUi + εi, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, (2)\nwhere L ∈ Rd1×r is a loading matrix, and the vectors Ui ∼ N(0, Ir×r) and εi ∼ N(0,Γ⋆) are independent. Given n i.i.d. samples from the model (2), the goal is to estimate the loading matrix L, or the matrix LLT that projects onto column span of L. A simple calculation shows that the covariance matrix of Zi has the form Σ = LL\nT + Γ⋆. Consequently, in the special case when Γ⋆ = σ2Id×d, then the range of L is spanned by the top r eigenvectors of Σ, and so we can recover it via standard principal components analysis.\nIn other applications, we might no longer be guaranteed that Γ⋆ is the identity, in which case the top r eigenvectors of Σ need not be close to column span of L. Nonetheless, when Γ⋆ is a sparse matrix, the problem of estimating LLT can be understood as an instance of our general observation model (1) with d1 = d2 = d, and the identity observation operator X (so that n1 = n2 = d). In particular, if the let the observation matrix Y ∈ Rd×d be the sample covariance matrix 1n ∑n i−1 ZiZ T i , then some algebra shows that Y = Θ\n⋆ + Γ⋆ + W , where Θ⋆ = LLT is of rank r, and the random matrix W is a re-centered form of Wishart noise [1]—in particular, the zero-mean matrix\nW : = 1\nn\nn∑\ni=1\nZiZ T i −\n{ LLT + Γ⋆ } . (3)\nWhen Γ⋆ is assumed to be elementwise sparse (i.e., with relatively few non-zero entries), then this constraint can be enforced via the elementwise ℓ1-norm (see Example 4 to follow). ♣\nExample 2 (Multi-task regression). Suppose that we are given a collection of d2 regression problems in Rd1 , each of the form yj = Xβ ∗ j + wj for j = 1, 2, . . . , d2. Here each β∗j ∈ Rd1 is an unknown regression vector, wj ∈ Rn is observation noise, and X ∈ Rn×d1 is the design matrix. This family of models can be written in a convenient matrix form as Y = XB∗ +W , where Y = [y1 · · · yd2 ] and W = [w1 · · · wd2 ] are both matrices in Rn×d2 and B∗ : = [β∗1 · · · β∗d2 ] ∈ R\nd1×d2 is a matrix of regression vectors. Following standard terminology in multi-task learning, we refer to each column of B∗ as a task, and each row of B∗ as a feature.\nIn many applications, it is natural to assume that the feature weightings—i.e., that is, the vectors β∗j ∈ Rd2—exhibit some degree of shared structure across tasks [2, 32, 21, 27]. This type of shared structured can be modeled by imposing a low-rank structure; for instance, in the extreme case of rank one, it would enforce that each β∗j is a multiple of some common underlying vector. However, many multi-task learning problems exhibit more complicated structure, in which some subset of features are shared across tasks, and some other subset of features vary substantially across tasks [2, 4]. For instance, in the Amazon recommendation system, tasks correspond to different classes of products, such as books, electronics and so on, and features include ratings by users. Some ratings (such as numerical scores) should have a meaning that is preserved across tasks, whereas other features (e.g., the label “boring”) are very meaningful in applications to some categories (e.g., books) but less so in others (e.g., electronics).\nThis kind of structure can be captured by assuming that the unknown regression matrix B∗ has a low-rank plus sparse decomposition—namely, B∗ = Θ⋆+Γ⋆ where Θ⋆ is low-rank and Γ⋆ is sparse, with a relatively small number of non-zero entries, corresponding to feature/task pairs that that differ significantly from the baseline. A variant of this model is based on instead assuming that Γ⋆ is row-sparse, with a small number of non-zero rows. (In Example 5 to follow, we discuss an appropriate regularizer for enforcing such row or column sparsity.) With this model structure, we then define the observation operator X : Rd1×d2 → Rn×d2 via A 7→ XA, so that n1 = n and n2 = d2 in our general notation. In this way, we obtain another instance of the linear observation model (1). ♣\nExample 3 (Robust covariance estimation). For i = 1, 2, . . . , n, let Ui ∈ Rd be samples from a zero-mean distribution with unknown covariance matrix Θ⋆. When the vectors Ui are observed without any form of corruption, then it is straightforward to estimate Θ⋆ by performing PCA on the sample covariance matrix. Imagining that j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , d} indexes different individuals in the population, now suppose that the data associated with some subset S of individuals is arbitrarily corrupted. This adversarial corruption can be modeled by assuming that we observe the vectors Zi = Ui + vi for i = 1, . . . , n, where each vi ∈ Rd is a vector supported on the subset S. Letting Y = 1n ∑n i=1 ZiZ T i be the sample covariance matrix of the corrupted samples, some algebra shows that it can be decomposed as Y = Θ⋆+∆+W , whereW : = 1n ∑n i=1 UiU T i −Θ⋆ is again a type of re-centered Wishart noise, and the remaining term can be written as\n∆ := 1\nn\nn∑\ni=1\nviv T i +\n1\nn\nn∑\ni=1\n( Uiv T i + viU T i ). (4)\nNote that ∆ itself is not a column-sparse or row-sparse matrix; however, since each vector vi ∈ Rd is supported only on some subset S ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , d}, we can write ∆ = Γ⋆ + (Γ⋆)T , where Γ⋆ is a column-sparse matrix with entries only in columns indexed by S. This structure can be enforced by the use of the column-sparse regularizer (12), as described in Example 5 to follow.\n♣"

Our theory also provides choices of these parameters that guarantee good properties of the associated estimator. Although this estimator is reasonable, it turns out that an additional constraint yields an equally simple estimator that has attractive properties, both in theory and in practice.\nIn order to understand the need for an additional constraint, it should be noted that without further constraints, the model (1) is unidentifiable, even in the noiseless setting (W = 0). Indeed, as has been discussed in past work [9, 7, 29], no method can recover the components (Θ⋆,Γ⋆) unless the low-rank component is “incoherent” with the matrix Γ⋆. For instance, supposing for the moment that Γ⋆ is a sparse matrix, consider a rank one matrix with Θ⋆11 6= 0, and zeros in all other positions. In this case, it is clearly impossible to disentangle Θ⋆ from a sparse matrix. Past work on both matrix completion and decomposition [9, 7, 29] has ruled out these types of troublesome cases via conditions on the singular vectors of the low-rank component Θ⋆, and used them to derive sufficient conditions for exact recovery in the noiseless setting (see the discussion following Example 4 for more details).\nIn this paper, we impose a related but milder condition, previously introduced in our past work on matrix completion [20], with the goal of performing approximate recovery. To be clear, this condition does not guarantee identifiability, but rather provides a bound on the radius of non-identifiability. It should be noted that non-identifiability is a feature common to many high-dimensional statistical models.1 Moreover, in the more realistic setting of noisy observations and/or matrices that are not exactly low-rank, such approximate recovery is the best that can be expected. Indeed, one of our main contributions is to establish minimaxoptimality of our rates, meaning that no algorithm can be substantially better over the matrix classes that we consider.\nFor a given regularizer R, we define the quantity κd(R) := supV 6=0 |||V |||F/R(V ), which measures the relation between the regularizer and the Frobenius norm. Moreover, we define the associated dual norm\nR∗(U) := sup R(V )≤1 〈〈V, U〉〉, (5)\nwhere 〈〈V, U〉〉 : = trace(V TU) is the trace inner product on the space Rd1×d2 . Our estimators are based on constraining the interaction between the low-rank component and Γ⋆ via the quantity\nϕR(Θ) := κd(R∗)R∗(Θ). (6)\nMore specifically, we analyze the family of estimators\nmin (Θ,Γ) {1 2 |||Y − X(Θ + Γ)|||2F + λd |||Θ|||N + µdR(Γ) } , (7)\n1For instance, see the paper [23] for discussion of non-identifiability in high-dimensional sparse regression.\nsubject to ϕR(Θ) ≤ α for some fixed parameter α."

      "text" : "Let us consider some examples to provide intuition for specific forms of the estimator (7), and the role of the additional constraint.\nExample 4 (Sparsity and elementwise ℓ1-norm). Suppose that Γ ⋆ is assumed to be sparse, with s ≪ d1d2 non-zero entries. In this case, the sum Θ⋆ + Γ⋆ corresponds to the sum of a low rank matrix with a sparse matrix. Motivating applications include the problem of factor analysis with a non-identity but sparse noise covariance, as discussed in Example 1, as well as certain formulations of robust PCA [7], and model selection in Gauss-Markov random fields with hidden variables [8]. Given the sparsity of Γ⋆, an appropriate choice of regularizer is the elementwise ℓ1-norm\nR(Γ) = ‖Γ‖1 : = d1∑\nj=1\nd2∑\nk=1\n|Γjk|. (8)\nWith this choice, it is straightforward to verify that\nR∗(Z) = ‖Z‖∞ : = max j=1,...,d1 max k=1,...,d2 |Zjk|, (9)\nand moreover, that κd(R∗) = √ d1d2. Consequently, in this specific case, the general convex program (7) takes the form\nmin (Θ,Γ) {1 2 |||Y − X(Θ + Γ)|||2F + λd |||Θ|||N + µd ‖Γ‖1 } such that ‖Θ‖∞ ≤ α√d1 d2 . (10)\nThe constraint involving ‖Θ‖∞ serves to control the “spikiness” of the low rank component, with larger settings of α allowing for more spiky matrices. Indeed, this type of spikiness control has proven useful in analysis of nuclear norm relaxations for noisy matrix completion [20]. To gain intuition for the parameter α, if we consider matrices with |||Θ|||F ≈ 1, as is appropriate to keep a constant signal-to-noise ratio in the noisy model (1), then setting α ≈ 1 allows only for matrices for which |Θjk| ≈ 1/ √ d1d2 in all entries. If we want to permit the maximally spiky matrix with all its mass in a single position, then the parameter α must be of the order√ d1d2. In practice, we are interested in settings of α lying between these two extremes.\n♣\nPast work on ℓ1-forms of matrix decomposition has imposed singular vector incoherence conditions that are related to but different from our spikiness condition. More concretely, if we write the SVD of the low-rank component as Θ⋆ = UDV T where D is diagonal, and U ∈ Rd1×r and V ∈ Rd2×r are matrices of the left and right singular vectors. Singular vector incoherence bounds quantities such as\n‖UUT − r d1 Id1×d1‖∞, ‖V V T − r d2 Id2×d2‖∞, and ‖UV T ‖∞. (11)\nall of which measure the degree of “coherence” between the singular vectors and the canonical basis. A remarkable feature of such conditions is that they have no dependence on the singular values of Θ⋆. This lack of dependence makes sense in the noiseless setting, where exact recovery is the goal. For noisy models, in contrast, one should only be concerned\nwith recovering components with “large” singular values. In this context, our bound on the maximum element ‖Θ⋆‖∞, or equivalently on the quantity ‖UDV T ‖∞, is natural. Note that it imposes no constraint on the matrices UUT or V V T , and moreover it uses the diagonal matrix of singular values as a weight in the ℓ∞ bound. Moreover, we note that there are many matrices for which ‖Θ⋆‖∞ satisfies a reasonable bound, whereas the incoherence measures are poorly behaved (e.g., see Section 3.4.2 in the paper [20] for one example).\nExample 5 (Column-sparsity and block columnwise regularization). Other applications involve models in which Γ⋆ has a relatively small number s ≪ d2 of non-zero columns (or a relatively small number s ≪ d1 of non-zero rows). Such applications include the multi-task regression problem from Example 2, the robust covariance problem from Example 3, as well as a form of robust PCA considered by Xu et al. [29]. In this case, it is natural to constrain Γ via the (2, 1)-norm regularizer\nR(Γ) = ‖Γ‖2,1 : = d2∑\nk=1\n‖Γk‖2, (12)\nwhere Γk is the k th column of Γ (or the (1, 2)-norm regularizer that enforces the analogous constraint on the rows of Γ). For this choice, it can be verified that\nR∗(U) = ‖U‖2,∞ : = max k=1,2,...,d2 ‖Uk‖2, (13)\nwhere Uk denotes the k th column of U , and that κd(R∗) = √ d2. Consequently, in this specific case, the general convex program (7) takes the form\nmin (Θ,Γ) {1 2 |||Y − X(Θ + Γ)|||2F + λd |||Θ|||N + µd ‖Γ‖2,1 } such that ‖Θ‖2,∞ ≤ α√d2 . (14)\nAs before, the constraint ‖Θ‖2,∞ serves to limit the “spikiness” of the low rank component, where in this case, spikiness is measured in a columnwise manner. Again, it is natural to consider matrices such that |||Θ⋆|||F ≈ 1, so that the signal-to-noise ratio in the observation model (1) stays fixed. Thus, if α ≈ 1, then we are restricted to matrices for which ‖Θ⋆k‖2 ≈ 1√ d2 for all columns k = 1, 2, . . . , d2. At the other extreme, in order to permit a maximally “column-spiky” matrix (i.e., with a single non-zero column of ℓ2-norm roughly 1), we need to set α ≈ √ d2. As before, of practical interest are settings of α lying between these two extremes. ♣"

In our setting, the loss is the quadratic function L(Ω) = 12 |||Y − X(Ω)|||2F (where we use Ω = Θ + Γ), so that the first-order Taylor series error at Ω in the direction of the matrix ∆ is given by\nL(Ω +∆)− L(Ω)− L(Ω)T ∆ = 1 2 |||X(∆)|||2F. (19)\nConsequently, strong convexity is equivalent to a lower bound of the form 12‖X(∆)‖22 ≥ γ 2 |||∆|||2F, where γ > 0 is the strong convexity constant.\nRestricted strong convexity is a weaker condition that also involves a norm defined by the regularizers. In our case, for any pair (µd, λd) of positive numbers, we first define the weighted combination of the two regularizers—namely\nQ(Θ,Γ) := |||Θ|||N + µd λd R(Γ). (20)\nFor a given matrix ∆, we can use this weighted combination to define an associated norm\nΦ(∆) := inf Θ+Γ=∆\nQ(Θ,Γ), (21)\ncorresponding to the minimum value of Q(Θ,Γ) over all decompositions of ∆3.\nDefinition 2 (RSC).

In the special case of the identity operator (i.e., X(Θ) = Θ), such strong convexity does hold with γ = 1. More general observation operators require different choices of the parameter γ, and also non-zero choices of the tolerance parameter τn.\nWhile RSC establishes a form of (approximate) identifiability in general, here the error ∆ is a combination of the error in estimating Θ⋆ (∆Θ) and Γ⋆ (∆Γ). Consequently, we will need a further lower bound on |||∆|||F in terms of |||∆Θ|||F and |||∆Γ|||F in the proof of our main results to demonstrate the (approximate) identifiability of our model under the RSC condition 22.\n3Defined this way, Φ(∆) is the infimal-convolution of the two norms ||| · |||N and R, which is a very well studied object in convex analysis (see e.g. [26])"

(23)\nWith this notation, the following result applies to the observation model Y = X(Γ⋆+Θ⋆)+W , where the low-rank matrix satisfies the constraint ϕR(Θ⋆) ≤ α.

(27)\nLet us make a few remarks in order to interpret the meaning of this claim.\nDeterministic guarantee: To be clear, Theorem 1 is a deterministic statement that applies to any optimum of the convex program (7). Moreover, it actually provides a whole family of upper bounds, one for each choice of the rank parameter r and each choice of the subspace pair (M,M⊥). In practice, these choices are optimized so as to obtain the tightest possible upper bound. As for the condition (25), it will be satisfied for a sufficiently large sample size n as long as γ > 0, and the tolerance τn decreases to zero with the sample size. In many cases of interest—including the identity observation operator and multi-task cases—the RSC condition holds with τn = 0, so that condition (25) holds as long as γ > 0.\nInterpretation of different terms: Let us focus first on the term KΘ⋆ , which corresponds to the complexity of estimating the low-rank component. It is further sub-divided into two terms, with the term λ2d r corresponding to the estimation error associated with a rank r ma-\ntrix, whereas the term λd ∑d j=r+1 σj(Θ ⋆) corresponds to the approximation error associated with representing Θ⋆ (which might be full rank) by a matrix of rank r. A similar interpretation applies to the two components associated with Γ⋆, the first of which corresponds to a form of estimation error, whereas the second corresponds to a form of approximation error.\nA family of upper bounds: Since the inequality (27) corresponds to a family of upper bounds indexed by r and the subspaceM, these quantities can be chosen adaptively, depending on the structure of the matrices (Θ⋆,Γ⋆), so as to obtain the tightest possible upper bound. In the simplest case, the RSC conditions hold with tolerance τn = 0, the matrix Θ\n⋆ is exactly low rank (say rank r), and Γ⋆ lies within a R-decomposable subspace M. In this case, the approximation errors vanish, and Theorem 1 guarantees that the squared Frobenius error is at most\ne2(Θ̂; Γ̂) - λ2dr + µ 2 dΨ 2(M;R), (28)\nwhere the - notation indicates that we ignore constant factors."

As previously noted, an important example of a decomposable regularizer is the elementwise ℓ1-norm, which is decomposable with respect to subspaces of the form (16).\nCorollary 1. Consider an observation operator X that satisfies the RSC condition (22) with γ > 0 and τn = 0.

As noted in Example 4, for this norm, we have κd = √ d1d2, so that the choice (29) satisfies the conditions of Theorem 1. The dual norm is given by the elementwise ℓ∞-norm R∗(·) = ‖ · ‖∞. As observed in Section 3.1, the ℓ1-norm is decomposable with respect to subspace pairs of the form (M(S),M⊥(S)), for an arbitrary subset S of matrix indices. Moreover, for any subset S of cardinality s, we have Ψ2(M(S)) = s. It is easy to verify that with this choice, we have\nΠ M⊥\n(Γ⋆) = ∑\n(j,k)/∈S |Γ⋆jk|, from which the claim follows.\nIt is worth noting the inequality (27) corresponds to a family of upper bounds indexed by r and the subset S. For any fixed integer s ∈ {1, 2, . . . , (d1d2)}, it is natural to let S index the largest s values (in absolute value) of Γ⋆. Moreover, the choice of the pair (r, s) can be further adapted to the structure of the matrix. For instance, when Θ⋆ is exactly low rank, and Γ⋆ is exactly sparse, then one natural choice is r = rank(Θ⋆), and s = | supp(Γ⋆)|. With this choice, both the approximation terms vanish, and Corollary 1 guarantees that any solution (Θ̂, Γ̂) of the convex program (10) satisfies\n|||Θ̂−Θ⋆|||2F + |||Γ̂− Γ⋆|||2F . λ2d r + µ2d s. (31)\nFurther specializing to the case of noiseless observations (W = 0), yields a form of approximate recovery—namely\n|||Θ̂−Θ⋆|||2F + |||Γ̂− Γ⋆|||2F . α2 s\nd1d2 . (32)\nThis guarantee is weaker than the exact recovery results obtained in past work on the noiseless observation model with identity operator [9, 7]; however, these papers imposed incoherence requirements on the singular vectors of the low-rank component Θ⋆ that are more restrictive than the conditions of Theorem 1.\nOur elementwise ℓ∞ bound is a weaker condition than incoherence, since it allows for singular vectors to be coherent as long as the associated singular value is not too large. Moreover, the bound (32) is unimprovable up to constant factors, due to the non-identifiability of the observation model (1), as shown by the following example for the identity observation operator X = I.\nExample 6. [Unimprovability for elementwise sparse model] Consider a given sparsity index s ∈ {1, 2, . . . , (d1d2)}, where we may assume without loss of generality that s ≤ d2. We then form the matrix\nΘ⋆ : = α√ d1d2  \n1 0 ... 0\n  [ 1 1 1 . . . 0 . . . 0 ] ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nfT\n, (33)\nwhere the vector f ∈ Rd2 has exactly s ones. Note that ‖Θ⋆‖∞ = α√d1d2 by construction, and moreover Θ⋆ is rank one, and has s non-zero entries. Since up to s entries of the noise matrix Γ⋆ can be chosen arbitrarily, “nature” can always set Γ⋆ = −Θ⋆, meaning that we would observe Y = Θ⋆ +Γ⋆ = 0. Consequently, based on observing only Y , the pair (Θ⋆,Γ⋆) is indistinguishable from the all-zero matrices (0d1×d2 , 0d1×d2). This fact can be used to show that no method can have squared Frobenius error lower than ≈ α2 sd1d2 ; see Section 3.7 for a precise statement. Therefore, the bound (32) cannot be improved unless one is willing to impose further restrictions on the pair (Θ⋆,Γ⋆). We note that the singular vector incoherence conditions, as imposed in past work [9, 7, 14] and used to guarantee exact recovery, would exclude the matrix (33), since its left singular vector is the unit vector e1 ∈ Rd1 . ♣"

With a slightly modified argument, the bound (35) can be sharpened slightly by reducing the logarithmic term to log(d1d2s ). As shown in Theorem 2 to follow in Section 3.7, this sharpened bound is minimax-optimal, meaning that no estimator (regardless of its computational complexity) can achieve much better estimates for the matrix classes and noise model given here.\nIt is also worth observing that both terms in the bound (35) have intuitive interpretations. Considering first the term KΘ⋆ , we note that the numerator term r(d1 + d2) is of the order of the number of free parameters in a rank r matrix of dimensions d1 × d2. The multiplicative factor ν 2\nd1d2 corresponds to the noise variance in the problem. On the other hand, the term KΓ⋆\nmeasures the complexity of estimating s non-zero entries in a d1× d2 matrix. Note that there are (d1d2 s ) possible subsets of size s, and consequently, the numerator includes a term that\nscales as log (d1d2\ns\n) ≈ s log(d1d2). As before, the multiplicative pre-factor ν 2\nd1d2 corresponds to\nthe noise variance. Finally, the second term within KΓ⋆—namely the quantity α 2 s\nd1d2 —arises\nfrom the non-identifiability of the model, and as discussed in Example 6, it cannot be avoided without imposing further restrictions on the pair (Γ⋆,Θ⋆).\nWe now turn to analysis of the sparse factor analysis problem: as previously introduced in Example 1, this involves estimation of a covariance matrix that has a low-rank plus elementwise sparse decomposition. In this case, given n i.i.d. samples from the unknown covariance matrix Σ = Θ⋆ + Γ⋆, the noise matrix W ∈ Rd×d is a recentered Wishart noise (see equation (3)). We can use tail bounds for its entries and its operator norm in order to specify appropriate choices of the regularization parameters λd and µd. We summarize our conclusions in the following corollary:\n4To be clear, we state our results in terms of the noise scaling ν2/(d1d2) since it corresponds to a model with constant signal-to-noise ratio when the Frobenius norms of Θ⋆ and Γ⋆ remain bounded, independently of the dimension. The same results would hold if the noise were not rescaled, modulo the appropriate rescalings of the various terms.\nCorollary 3. Consider the factor analysis model with n ≥ d samples, and regularization parameters\nλd = 16||| √ Σ|||2\n√ d\nn , and µd = 32ρ(Σ)\n√ log d\nn +\n4α\nd , where ρ(Σ) = maxj Σjj. (36)\nThen with probability greater than 1− c2 exp ( − c3 log(d) ) , any optimal solution (Θ̂, Γ̂) satisfies\ne2(Θ̂, Γ̂) ≤ c1 { |||Σ|||2 rd\nn + ρ(Σ)\ns log d\nn\n} + c1 α2s\nd2 .\nWe note that the condition n ≥ d is necessary to obtain consistent estimates in factor analysis models, even in the case with Γ⋆ = Id×d where PCA is possible (e.g., see Johnstone [15]). Again, the terms in the bound have a natural interpretation: since a matrix of rank r in d dimensions has roughly rd degrees of freedom, we expect to see a term of the order rdn .\nSimilarly, since there are log ( d2\ns\n) ≈ s log d subsets of size s in a d×d matrix, we also expect to\nsee a term of the order s log dn . Moreover, although we have stated our choices of regularization parameter in terms of |||Σ|||2 and ρ(Σ), these can be replaced by the analogous versions using the sample covariance matrix Σ̂.

      "text" : "This recent work focuses on the problem of matrix decomposition with the ‖ · ‖1-norm, and provides results both for the noiseless and noisy setting. All of their work focuses on the case of exactly low rank and exactly sparse matrices, and deals only with the identity observation operator; in contrast, Theorem 1 in this paper provides an upper bound for general matrix pairs and observation operators. Most relevant is comparison of our ℓ1-results with exact rank-sparsity constraints to their Theorem 3, which provides various error bounds (in nuclear and Frobenius norm) for such models with additive noise. These bounds are obtained using an estimator similar to our program (10), and in parts of their analysis, they enforce bounds on the ℓ∞-norm of the solution. However, this is not done directly with a constraint on Θ as in our estimator, but rather by penalizing the difference ‖Y − Γ‖∞, or by thresholding the solution.\nApart from these minor differences, there are two major differences between our results, and those of Hsu et al. First of all, their analysis involves three quantities (α, β, γ) that measure singular vector incoherence, and must satisfy a number of inequalities. In contrast, our analysis is based only on a single condition: the “spikiness” condition on the low-rank component Θ⋆. As we have seen, this constraint is weaker than singular vector incoherence, and consequently, unlike the result of Hsu et al., we do not provide exact recovery guarantees for the noiseless setting. However, it is interesting to see (as shown by our analysis) that a very simple spikiness condition suffices for the approximate recovery guarantees that are of interest for noisy observation models. Given these differing assumptions, the underlying proof techniques are quite distinct, with our methods leveraging the notion of restricted strong convexity introduced by Negahban et al. [19].\nThe second (and perhaps most significant) difference is in the sharpness of the results for the noisy setting, and the permissible scalings of the rank-sparsity pair (r, s). As will be clarified in Section 3.7, the rates that we establish for low-rank plus elementwise sparsity\nfor the noisy Gaussian model (Corollary 2) are minimax-optimal up to constant factors. In contrast, the upper bounds in Theorem 3 of Hsu et al. involve the product rs, and hence are sub-optimal as the rank and sparsity scale. These terms appear only additively both our upper and minimax lower bounds, showing that an upper bound involving the product rs is sub-optimal. Moreover, the bounds of Hsu et al. (see Section IV.D) are limited to matrix decompositions for which the rank-sparsity pair (r, s) are bounded as\nrs - d1d1\nlog(d1) log(d2) (37)\nThis bound precludes many scalings that are of interest. For instance, if the sparse component Γ⋆ has a nearly constant fraction of non-zeros (say s ≍ d1d2log(d1) log(d2) for concreteness), then the bound (37) restricts to Θ⋆ to have constant rank. In contrast, our analysis allows for high-dimensional scaling of both the rank r and sparsity s simultaneously; as can be seen by inspection of Corollary 2, our Frobenius norm error goes to zero under the scalings s ≍ d1d2log(d1) log(d2) and r ≍ d2 log(d2) ."

In this section, we provide a detailed analysis of one version of such a procedure in the case of nuclear norm combined with ℓ1-regularization. We prove that in the special case of X = I, this procedure can attain the same form of error bounds, with possibly different constants. However, there is also a cautionary message here: we also give an example to show that the two-step method will not necessarily perform well for general observation operators X.\nIn detail, let us consider the following two-step estimator:\n(a) Estimate the sparse component Γ⋆ by solving\nΓ̂ ∈ argmin Γ∈Rd1×d2 {1 2 |||Y − Γ|||2F + µd ‖Γ‖1 } .

In step (a), we fix the low-rank component, and minimize as a function of the sparse component. In step (b), we fix the sparse component, and then minimize as a function of the low-rank component. The following result that these two steps of co-ordinate descent achieve the same rates (up to constant factors) as solving the full convex program (10):\nProposition 1. Given observations Y from the model Y = Θ⋆ + Γ⋆+W with ‖Θ⋆‖∞ ≤ α√d1d2 , consider the two-step procedure (40) and (41) with regularization parameters (λd, µd) such that\nλd ≥ 4|||W |||op, and µd ≥ 4 ‖W‖∞ + 4 α√ d1d2 . (42)\nThen the error bound (30) from Corollary 1 holds with γ = 1.\nConsequently, in the special case that X = I, then there is no need to solve the convex program (10) to optimality; rather, two steps of co-ordinate descent are sufficient.\nOn the other hand, the simple two-stage method will not work for general observation operators X. As shown in the proof of Proposition 1, the two-step method relies critically on having the quantity ‖X(Θ⋆ + W )‖∞ be upper bounded (up to constant factors) by max{‖Θ⋆‖∞, ‖W‖∞}. By triangle inequality, this condition holds trivially when X = I, but can be violated by other choices of the observation operator, as illustrated by the following example.\nExample 7 (Failure of two-step method). Recall the multi-task observation model first introduced in Example 2. In Corollary 4, we showed that the general estimator (10) will recover good estimates under certain assumptions on the observation matrix. In this example, we provide an instance for which the assumptions of Corollary 4 are satisfied, but on the other hand, the two-step method will not return a good estimate.\nMore specifically, let us consider the observation model Y = X(Θ⋆ + Γ⋆) +W , in which Y ∈ Rd×d, and the observation matrix X ∈ Rd×d takes the form\nX : = Id×d + 1√ d e1~1 T ,\nwhere e1 ∈ Rd is the standard basis vector with a 1 in the first component, and ~1 denotes the vector of all ones. Suppose that the unknown low-rank matrix is given by Θ⋆ = 1d\n~1~1T . Note that this matrix has rank one, and satisfies ‖Θ⋆‖∞ = 1d .\nWe now verify that the conditions of Corollary 4 are satisfied. Letting σmin and σmax denote (respectively) the smallest and largest singular values of X, we have σmin = 1 and σmax ≤ 2. Moreover, letting Xj denote the jth column of X, we have maxj=1,...,d ‖Xj‖2 ≤ 2. Consequently, if we consider rescaled observations with noise variance ν2/d, the conditions of Corollary 4 are all satisfied with constants (independent of dimension), so that the M - estimator (10) will have good performance.\nOn the other hand, letting E denote expectation over any zero-mean noise matrix W , we have\nE [ ‖X(Θ⋆ +W )‖∞ ] (i) ≥ ‖X(Θ⋆ + E[W ])‖∞ = ‖X(Θ⋆)‖∞ (ii) ≥ √ d‖Θ⋆‖∞,\nwhere step (i) exploits Jensen’s inequality, and step (ii) uses the fact that\n‖X(Θ⋆)‖∞ = 1/d+ 1/ √ d = ( 1 + √ d ) ‖Θ⋆‖∞.\nFor any noise matrix W with reasonable tail behavior, the variable ‖X(Θ⋆ + W )‖∞ will concentrate around its expectation, showing that ‖X(Θ⋆ +W )‖∞ will be larger than ‖Θ⋆‖∞ by an order of magnitude (factor of √ d).

As before, if we assume that Θ⋆ has exactly rank r and Γ⋆ has at most s non-zero columns, then both approximation error terms in the bound (44) vanish, and we recover an upper bound of the form |||Θ̂−Θ⋆|||2F + |||Γ̂− Γ⋆|||2F . λ2dr+ µ2ds. If we further specialize to the case of exact observations (W = 0), then Corollary 5 guarantees that\n|||Θ̂−Θ⋆|||2F + |||Γ̂− Γ⋆|||2F . α2 s\nd2 .\nThe following example shows, that given our conditions, even in the noiseless setting, no method can recover the matrices to precision more accurate than α2s/d2.\nExample 8 (Unimprovability for columnwise sparse model). In order to demonstrate that the term α2s/d2 is unavoidable, it suffices to consider a slight modification of Example 6. In particular, let us define the matrix\nΘ⋆ : = α√ d1d2  \n1 1 ... 1\n  [ 1 1 1 . . . 0 . . . 0 ] ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nfT\n, (45)\nwhere again the vector f ∈ Rd2 has s non-zeros. Note that the matrix Θ⋆ is rank one, has s non-zero columns, and moreover ‖Θ⋆‖2,∞ = α√d2 . Consequently, the matrix Θ ⋆ is covered by Corollary 5. Since s columns of the matrix Γ⋆ can be chosen in an arbitrary manner, it is possible that Γ⋆ = −Θ⋆, in which case the observation matrix Y = 0. This fact can be exploited to show that no method can achieve squared Frobenius error much smaller than ≈ α2sd2 ; see Section 3.7 for the precise statement. Finally, we note that it is difficult to compare directly to the results of Xu et al. [29], since their results do not guarantee exact recovery of the pair (Θ⋆,Γ⋆). ♣\nAs with the case of elementwise ℓ1-norm, more concrete results can be obtained when the noise matrix W is stochastic.\nCorollary 6. Suppose Θ⋆ has rank at most r and satisfies ‖Θ⋆‖2,∞ ≤ α√d2 , and Γ ⋆ has at most s non-zero columns. If the noise matrix W has i.i.d. N(0, ν2/(d1d2)) entries, and we solve the convex program (14) with regularization parameters λd =\n8ν√ d1 + 8ν√ d2 and\nµd = 8ν\n√ 1\nd2 + √ log d2 d1d2 + 4α√ d2 ,\nthen with probability greater than 1− exp ( − 2 log(d2) ) , any optimal solution (Θ̂, Γ̂) satisfies\ne2(Θ̂, Γ̂) ≤ c1 ν2 r (d1 + d2)\nd1d2︸ ︷︷ ︸ KΘ⋆\n+ ν2 {\nsd1 d1d2 + s log d2 d1d2\n} + c2 α2s\nd2︸ ︷︷ ︸ KΓ⋆\n. (46)\nRemarks: Note that the setting of λd is the same as in Corollary 2, whereas the parameter µd is chosen based on upper bounding ‖W‖2,∞, corresponding to the dual norm of the columnwise (2, 1)-norm. With a slightly modified argument, the bound (46) can be sharpened slightly by reducing the logarithmic term to log(d2s ). As shown in Theorem 2 to follow in Section 3.7, this sharpened bound is minimax-optimal.\nAs with Corollary 2, both terms in the bound (46) are readily interpreted. The term KΘ⋆ has the same interpretation, as a combination of the number of degrees of freedom in a rank r matrix (that is, of the order r(d1+d2)) scaled by the noise variance ν2\nd1d2 . The second term KΓ⋆\nhas a somewhat more subtle interpretation. The problem of estimating s non-zero columns embedded within a d1 × d2 matrix can be split into two sub-problems: first, the problem of estimating the sd1 non-zero parameters (in Frobenius norm), and second, the problem of column subset selection—i.e., determining the location of the s non-zero parameters. The estimation sub-problem yields the term ν\n2sd1 d1d2 , whereas the column subset selection sub-problem\nincurs a penalty involving log (d2 s ) ≈ s log d2, multiplied by the usual noise variance. The final term α2s/d2 arises from the non-identifiability of the model. As discussed in Example 8, it is unavoidable without further restrictions.\nWe now turn to some consequences for the problem of robust covariance estimation formulated in Example 3. As seen from equation (4), the disturbance matrix in this setting can be written as a sum (Γ⋆)T + Γ⋆, where Γ⋆ is a column-wise sparse matrix. Consequently, we can use a variant of the estimator (14), in which the loss function is given by |||Y − {Θ⋆ + (Γ⋆)T +Γ⋆}|||2F . The following result summarizes the consequences of Theorem 1 in this setting:\nCorollary 7. Consider the problem of robust covariance estimation with n ≥ d samples, based on a matrix Θ⋆ with rank at most r that satisfies ‖Θ⋆‖2,∞ ≤ α√d , and a corrupting matrix Γ⋆ with at most s rows and columns corrupted. If we solve SDP (14) with regularization parameters\nλ2d = 8|||Θ⋆|||2op r\nn , and µ2d = 8|||Θ⋆|||2op\nr n +\n16α2\nd , (47)\nthen with probability greater than 1− c2 exp ( − c3 log(d) ) , any optimal solution (Θ̂, Γ̂) satisfies\ne2(Θ̂, Γ̂) ≤ c1|||Θ⋆|||2op {r2 n + sr n } + c2 α2s d .\nSome comments about this result: with the motivation of being concrete, we have given an explicit choice (47) of the regularization parameters, involving the operator norm |||Θ⋆|||op, but any upper bound would suffice. As with the noise variance in Corollary 6, a typical strategy would choose this pre-factor by cross-validation."

      "text" : "For the case of i.i.d Gaussian noise matrices, Corollaries 2 and 6 provide results of an achievable nature, namely in guaranteeing that our estimators achieve certain Frobenius errors. In this section, we turn to the complementary question: what are the fundamental (algorithmicindependent) limits of accuracy in noisy matrix decomposition? One way in which to address such a question is by analyzing statistical minimax rates.\nMore formally, given some family F of matrices, the associated minimax error is given by\nM(F) := inf (Θ̃,Γ̃) sup (Θ⋆,Γ⋆)\nE [ |||Θ̃−Θ⋆|||2F + |||Γ̃− Γ⋆|||2F ] , (48)\nwhere the infimum ranges over all estimators (Θ̃, Γ̃) that are (measurable) functions of the data Y , and the supremum ranges over all pairs (Θ⋆,Γ⋆) ∈ F . Here the expectation is taken over the Gaussian noise matrix W , under the linear observation model (1).\nGiven a matrix Γ⋆, we define its support set supp(Γ⋆) := {(j, k) | Γ⋆jk 6= 0}, as well as its column support colsupp(Γ⋆) := {k | Γ⋆k 6= 0 } , where Γ⋆k denotes the k\nth column. Using this notation, our interest centers on the following two matrix families:\nFsp(r, s, α) := { (Θ⋆,Γ⋆) | rank(Θ⋆) ≤ r, | supp(Γ⋆)| ≤ s, ‖Θ⋆‖∞ ≤\nα√ d1d2\n} , and (49a)\nFcol(r, s, α) := { (Θ⋆,Γ⋆) | rank(Θ⋆) ≤ r, | colsupp(Γ⋆)| ≤ s, ‖Θ⋆‖2,∞ ≤\nα√ d2\n} . (49b)\nBy construction, Corollaries 2 and 6 apply to the families Fsp and Fcol respectively.\nThe following theorem establishes lower bounds on the minimax risks (in squared Frobenius norm) over these two families for the identity observation operator:\nTheorem 2. Consider the linear observation model (1) with identity observation operator: X(Θ + Γ) = Θ+ Γ. There is a universal constant c0 > 0 such that for all α ≥ 32 √ log(d1d2), we have\nM(Fsp(r, s, α)) ≥ c0ν2 { r (d1 + d2)\nd1d2 +\ns log(d1d2−ss/2 )\nd1d2\n} + c0 α2 s\nd1d2 , (50)\nand\nM(Fcol(r, s, α)) ≥ c0ν2 ( r (d1 + d2)\nd1d2 +\ns\nd2 +\ns log(d2−ss/2 )\nd1d2\n) + c0 α2 s\nd2 . (51)\nNote the agreement with the achievable rates guaranteed in Corollaries 2 and 6 respectively. (As discussed in the remarks following these corollaries, the sharpened forms of the logarithmic factors follow by a more careful analysis.) Theorem 2 shows that in terms of squared Frobenius error, the convex relaxations (10) and (14) are minimax optimal up to constant factors.\nIn addition, it is worth observing that although Theorem 2 is stated in the context of additive Gaussian noise, it also shows that the radius of non-identifiability (involving the parameter α) is a fundamental limit. In particular, by setting the noise variance to zero, we see that under our milder conditions, even in the noiseless setting, no algorithm can estimate to greater accuracy than c0\nα2 s d1d2 , or the analogous quantity for column-sparse matrices."

      "text" : "We have implemented the M -estimators based on the convex programs (10) and (14), in particular by adapting first-order optimization methods due to Nesterov [22]. In this section, we report simulation results that demonstrate the excellent agreement between our theoretical predictions and the behavior in practice. In all cases, we used square matrices (d = d1 = d2), and a stochastic noise matrix W with i.i.d. N(0, ν 2\nd2 ) entries, with ν2 = 1. For any given rank\nr, we generated Θ⋆ by randomly choosing the spaces of left and right singular vectors. We formed random sparse (elementwise or columnwise) matrices by choosing the positions of the non-zeros (entries or columns) uniformly at random.\nRecall the estimator (10) from Example 4. It is based on a combination of the nuclear norm with the elementwise ℓ1-norm, and is motivated problem of recovering a low-rank matrix Θ⋆ corrupted by an arbitrary sparse matrix Γ⋆. In our first set of experiments, we fixed the matrix dimension d = 100, and then studied a range of ranks r for Θ⋆, as well as a range of sparsity indices s for Γ⋆. More specifically, we studied linear scalings of the form r = γd for a constant γ ∈ (0, 1), and s = βd2 for a second constant β ∈ (0, 1).\nNote that under this scaling, Corollary 2 predicts that the squared Frobenius error should be upper bounded as c1γ + c2β log(1/β), for some universal constants c1, c2. Figure 1(a) provides experimental confirmation of the accuracy of these theoretical predictions: varying γ (with β fixed) produces linear growth of the squared error as a function of γ. In Figure 1(b), we study the complementary scaling, with the rank ratio γ fixed and the sparsity ratio β varying in the interval [.01, .1]. Since β log(1/β) ≈ Θ(β) over this interval, we should expect to see roughly linear scaling. Again, the plot shows good agreement with the theoretical predictions.\nNow recall the estimator (14) from Example 5, designed for estimating a low-rank matrix plus a columnwise sparse matrix. We have observed similar linear dependence on the analogs of the parameters γ and β, as predicted by our theory. In the interests of exhibiting a different phenomenon, here we report its performance for matrices of varying dimension, in all cases with Γ⋆ having s = 3r non-zero columns. Figure 2(a) shows plots of squared Frobenius error versus the dimension for two choices of the rank (r = 10 and r = 15), and the matrix dimension varying in the range d ∈ {100 : 25 : 300}. As predicted by our theory, these plots decrease at the rate 1/d. Indeed, this scaling is revealed by replotting the inverse squared error versus d, which produces the roughly linear plots shown in panel (b). Moreover, by comparing the relative slopes of these two curves, we see that the problem with rank r = 15 requires roughly a dimension that is roughly 32 larger than the problem with r = 10 to achieve the same error. Again, this linear scaling in rank is consistent with Corollary 6."

Throughout these proofs, we adopt the convenient shorthand notation ∆̂Γ\nM : = ΠM(∆̂ Γ) and ∆̂Γ M⊥ = ΠM⊥(∆̂ Γ), with similar definitions for Γ⋆M and Γ ⋆ M⊥ .\nWe now turn to a lemma that deals with the behavior of the error matrices (∆̂Θ, ∆̂Γ) when measured together using a weighted sum of the nuclear norm and regularizer R. In order to state the following lemma, let us recall that for any positive (µd, λd), the weighted norm is defined as Q(Θ,Γ) := |||Θ|||N + µdλdR(Γ).\nWith this notation, we have the following:\nLemma 1.

Recall from Example 6 the “bad” matrix (33), which we denote here by B∗. By construction, we have |||B∗|||2F = α 2s d1d2\n. Using this matrix, we construct a very simple packing set with M = 4 matrix pairs (Θ,Γ):\n{ (B∗,−B∗), (−B∗, B∗), ( 1√\n2 B∗,− 1√ 2 B∗), (0, 0)\n} (62)\nEach one of these matrix pairs (Θ,Γ) belongs to the set Fsp(1, s, α), so it can be used to establish a lower bound over this set. (Moreover, it also yields a lower bound over the sets Fsp(r, s, α) for r > 1, since they are supersets.) It can also be verified that for any two distinct pairs of matrices in the set (62), they differ in squared Frobenius norm by at least\nδ2 = 12 |||B∗|||2F = 12 α 2s d1d2 . Let J be a random index uniformly distributed over the four possible models in our packing set (62). By construction, for any matrix pair (Θ,Γ) in the packing set, we have Θ + Γ = 0. Consequently, for any one of these models, the observation matrix Y is simply equal to pure noise W , and hence I(Y ;J) = 0. Putting together the pieces, the Fano bound (61) implies that\nP [ M(Fsp(1, s, α)) ≥ 1\n16\nα2s\nd1d2\n] ≥ 1− I(Y ;J) + log 2\nlog 4 =\n1 2 .\nPacking for estimation error: We now describe the construction of a packing set for lower bounding the estimation error. In this case, our construction is more subtle, based on the the Cartesian product of two components, one for the low rank matrices, and the other for the sparse matrices. For the low rank component, we re-state a slightly modified form (adapted to the setting of non-square matrices) of Lemma 2 from the paper [20]:\nLemma 5. For d1, d2 ≥ 10, a tolerance δ > 0, and for each r = 1, 2, . . . , d, there exists a set of d1 × d2-dimensional matrices {Θ1, . . . ,ΘM} with cardinality M ≥ 14 exp ( rd1 256 + rd2 256 ) such that each matrix has rank r, and moreover\n|||Θℓ|||2F = δ2 for all ℓ = 1, 2, . . . ,M , (63a) |||Θℓ −Θk|||2F ≥ δ2 for all ℓ 6= k, (63b)\n‖Θℓ‖∞ ≤ δ √ 32 log(d1d2)\nd1d2 for all ℓ = 1, 2, . . . ,M . (63c)\nConsequently, as long as δ ≤ 1, we are guaranteed that the matrices Θℓ belong to the set Fsp(r, s, α) for all α ≥ 32 √ log(d1d2).\nAs for the sparse matrices, the following result is a modification, so as to apply to the matrix setting of interest here, of Lemma 5 from the paper [23]:\nLemma 6 (Sparse matrix packing). For any δ > 0, and for each integer s < d1d2, there exists a set of matrices {Γ1, . . . ,ΓN} with cardinality N ≥ exp ( s 2 log d1d2−s s/2 ) such that\n|||Γj − Γk|||2F ≥ δ2, and (64a) |||Γj|||2F ≤ 8 δ2, (64b)\nand such that each Γj has at most s non-zero entries.\nWe now have the necessary ingredients to prove the lower bound (50). By combining Lemmas 5 and 6, we conclude that there exists a set of matrices with cardinality\nM N ≥ 1 4 exp\n{ s\n2 log d1d2 − s s/2 + rd1 256 + rd2 256\n} (65)\nsuch that\n|||(Θℓ,Γk)− (Θℓ′ ,Γk′)|||2F ≥ δ2 for all pairs such that ℓ 6= ℓ′ or k 6= k′, and (66a) |||(Θℓ,Γk)|||2F ≤ 9δ2 for all (ℓ, k). (66b)\nLet Pℓ,k denote the distribution of the observation matrix Y when Θℓ and Γk are the underlying parameters. We apply the Fano construction over the class of MN such distributions, thereby obtaining that in order to show that the minimax error is lower bounded by c0δ 2 (for some universal constant c0 > 0), it suffices to show that\n1\n(MN 2 ) ∑ (ℓ,k)6=(ℓ′,k′) D(Pℓ,k ‖Pℓ′,k′) + log 2\nlog(MN) ≤ 1 2 , (67)\nwhere D(Pℓ,k ‖Pℓ′,k′) denotes the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the distributions Pℓ,k and Pℓ ′,k′.

[24] on minimax rates for kernel classes. In particular, we view column j of a matrix Γ as defining a linear function in dimension Rd1 ; for each j = 1, 2, . . . , d1, this defines a Hilbert space Hj of functions. By known results on metric entropy of Euclidean balls [17], this function class has logarithmic metric entropy, so that part (b) of the above lemma applies, and yields the stated result.\nUsing this lemma and the packing set for the low-rank component and following through the Fano construction yields the claimed lower bound (50) on the minimax error for the class Fcol(r, s, α), which completes the proof of Theorem 2."

      "text" : "In this paper, we analyzed a class of convex relaxations for solving a general class of matrix decomposition problems, in which the goal is recover a pair of matrices, based on observing a noisy contaminated version of their sum. Since the problem is ill-posed in general, it is essential to impose structure, and this paper focuses on the setting in which one matrix is approximately low-rank, and the second has a complementary form of low-dimensional structure enforced by a decomposable regularizer. Particular cases include matrices that are elementwise sparse, or columnwise sparse, and the associated matrix decomposition problems have various applications, including robust PCA, robustness in collaborative filtering, and model selection in Gauss-Markov random fields. We provided a general non-asymptotic bound on the Frobenius error of a convex relaxation based on a regularizing the least-squares loss with a combination of the nuclear norm with a decomposable regularizer. When specialized\nto the case of elementwise and columnwise sparsity, these estimators yield rates that are minimax-optimal up to constant factors.\nVarious extensions of this work are possible. We have not discussed here how our estimator would behave under a partial observation model, in which only a fraction of the entries are observed. This problem is very closely related to matrix completion, a problem for which recent work by Negahban and Wainwright [20] shows that a form of restricted strong convexity holds with high probability. This property could be adapted to the current setting, and would allow for proving Frobenius norm error bounds on the low rank component. Finally, although this paper has focused on the case in which the first matrix component is approximately low rank, much of our theory could be applied to a more general class of matrix decomposition problems, in which the first component is penalized by a decomposable regularizer that is “complementary” to the second matrix component. It remains to explore the properties and applications of these different forms of matrix decomposition."

Their lemma applies to optimization problems of the general form\nmin θ∈Rp\n{ L(θ) + γnr(θ) } ,\nwhere L is a loss function on the parameter space, and r is norm-based regularizer that satisfies a property known as decomposability. The elementwise ℓ1-norm as well as the nuclear norm are both instances of decomposable regularizers. Their lemma requires that the regularization parameter γn be chosen such that γn ≥ 2 r∗ ( ∇L(θ∗) ) , where r∗ is the dual norm, and ∇L(θ∗) is the gradient of the loss evaluated at the true parameter.\nWe now discuss how this lemma can be applied in our special case. Here the relevant parameters are of the form θ = (Θ,Γ), and the loss function is given by\nL(Θ,Γ) = 1 2 |||Y − (Θ + Γ)|||2F.\nThe sample size n = d2, since we make one observation for each entry of the matrix. On the other hand, the regularizer is given by the function\nr(θ) = Q(Θ,Γ) := |||Θ|||N + µd λd R(Γ),\ncoupled with the regularization parameter γn = λd. By assumption, the regularizer R is decomposable, and as shown in the paper [19], the nuclear norm is also decomposable. Since\nQ is simply a sum of these decomposable regularizers over separate matrices, it is also decomposable.\nIt remains to compute the gradient ∇L(Θ⋆,Γ⋆), and evaluate the dual norm.

The observations are noisy realizations of a linear transformation X of the sum of an (approximately) low rank matrix Θ⋆ with a second matrix Γ⋆ endowed with a complementary form of low-dimensional structure; this set-up includes many statistical models of interest, including forms of factor analysis, multi-task regression with shared structure, and robust covariance estimation. We derive a general theorem that gives upper bounds on the Frobenius norm error for an estimate of the pair (Θ⋆,Γ⋆) obtained by solving a convex optimization problem that combines the nuclear norm with a general decomposable regularizer. Our results are based on imposing a “spikiness” condition that is related to but milder than singular vector incoherence. We specialize our general result to two cases that have been studied in past work: low rank plus an entrywise sparse matrix, and low rank plus a columnwise sparse matrix. For both models, our theory yields non-asymptotic Frobenius error bounds for both deterministic and stochastic noise matrices, and applies to matrices Θ⋆ that can be exactly or approximately low rank, and matrices Γ⋆ that can be exactly or approximately sparse. Moreover, for the case of stochastic noise matrices and the identity observation operator, we establish matching lower bounds on the minimax error, showing that our results cannot be improved beyond constant factors. The sharpness of our theoretical predictions is confirmed by numerical simulations.",
