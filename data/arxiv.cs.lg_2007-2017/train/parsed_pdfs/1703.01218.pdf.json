We consider sparse linear influence games — a parametric class of graphical games with linear payoffs, and represented by directed graphs of n nodes (players) and in-degree of at most k. We show that one can efficiently recover the PSNE set of a linear influence game with O ( k2 log n ) samples, under very general observation models. On the other hand, we show that Ω (k log n) samples are necessary for any procedure to recover the PSNE set from observations of joint actions."

      "text" : "Non-cooperative game theory is widely considered as an appropriate mathematical framework for studying strategic behavior in multi-agent scenarios. In Non-cooperative game theory, the core solution concept of Nash equilibrium describes the stable outcome of the overall behavior of self-interested agents — for instance people, companies, governments, groups or autonomous systems — interacting strategically with each other and in distributed settings. Over the past few years, considerable progress has been made in analyzing behavioral data using game-theoretic tools, e.g. computing Nash equilibria [1, 2, 3], most influential agents [4], price of anarchy [5] and related concepts in the context of graphical games. In political science for instance, Irfan and Ortiz [4] identified, from congressional voting records, the most influential senators in the U.S. congress — a small set of senators whose collective behavior forces every other senator to a unique choice of vote. Irfan and Ortiz [4] also observed that the most influential senators were strikingly similar to the gang-of-six senators, formed during the national debt ceiling negotiations of 2011. Further, using graphical games, Honorio and Ortiz [6] showed that Obama’s influence on Republicans increased in the last sessions before candidacy, while McCain’s influence on Republicans decreased. The problems in algorithmic game theory described above, i.e., computing the Nash equilibria, computing the price of anarchy or finding the most influential agents, require a known graphical game which is not available apriori in real-world settings. Therefore, Honorio and Ortiz [6]\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n01 21\n8v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 3\nM ar\n2 01\n7\nproposed learning graphical games from behavioral data, using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and sparsity-promoting methods. On the other hand, Garg and Jaakkola [7] provide a discriminative approach to learn a class of graphical games called potential games. Honorio and Ortiz [6] and Irfan and Ortiz [4] have also demonstrated the usefulness of learning sparse graphical games from behavioral data in real-world settings, through their analysis of the voting records of the U.S. congress as well as the U.S. supreme court. In this paper, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for recovering the PSNE set of a graphical game in polynomial time. We also generalize the observation model from Ghoshal and Honorio [8], to arbitrary distributions that satisfy certain mild conditions. Our polynomial time method for recovering the PSNE set, which was proposed by Honorio and Ortiz [6], is based on using logistic regression for learning the neighborhood of each player in the graphical game, independently. Honorio and Ortiz [6] showed that the method of independent logistic regression is likelihood consistent; i.e., in the infinite sample limit, the likelihood estimate converges to the best achievable likelihood. In this paper we obtain the stronger guarantee of recovering the true PSNE set exactly. Finally, we would like to draw the attention of the reader to the fact that `1-regularized logistic regression has been analyzed by Ravikumar et. al. [9] in the context of learning sparse Ising models. Apart from technical differences and differences in proof techniques, our analysis of `1-penalized logistic regression for learning sparse graphical games differs from Ravikumar et. al. [9] conceptually — in the sense that we are not interested in recovering the edges of the true game graph, but only the PSNE set. Therefore, we are able to avoid some stronger conditions required by Ravikumar et. al. [9], such as mutual incoherence."

      "text" : "A normal-form game G in classical game theory is defined by the triple G = (V,X ,U) of players, actions and payoffs. V is the set of players, and is given by the set V = {1, . . . , n}, if there are n players. X is the set of actions or pure-strategies and is given by the Cartesian product X def= ×i∈V Xi, where Xi is the set of pure-strategies of the i-th player. Finally, U def = {ui}ni=1, is the set of payoffs, where ui : Xi ×j∈V \\i Xj → R specifies the payoff for the i-th player given its action and the joint actions of the all the remaining players. An important solution concept in the theory of non-cooperative games is that of Nash equilibrium. For a non-cooperative game, a joint action x∗ ∈ X is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) if, for each player i, x∗i ∈ argmaxxi∈Xi ui(xi,x ∗ −i), where x ∗ −i = {x∗j |j 6= i}. In other words, x∗ constitutes the mutual best-response for all players and no player has any incentive to unilaterally deviate from their optimal action x∗i given the joint actions of the remaining players x∗−i. The set of all pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) for a game G is defined as follows:\nNE(G) = { x∗ ∣∣(∀i ∈ V ) x∗i ∈ argmax\nxi∈Xi ui(xi,x\n∗ −i)\n} . (1)\nGraphical games, introduced by Kearns et al. [10], are game-theoretic analogues of graphical models. A graphical game G is defined by the directed graph, G = (V,E), of vertices and directed\nedges (arcs), where vertices correspond to players and arcs encode “influence” among players, i.e., the payoff of the i-th player only depends on the actions of its (incoming) neighbors."

      "text" : "Irfan and Ortiz [4] and Honorio and Ortiz [6], introduced a specific form of graphical games, called Linear Influential Games, characterized by binary actions, or pure strategies, and linear payoff functions. We assume, without loss of generality, that the joint action space X = {−1,+1}n. A linear influence game between n players, G(n) = (W,b), is characterized by (i) a matrix of weights W ∈ Rn×n, where the entry wij indicates the amount of influence (signed) that the j-th player has on the i-th player and (ii) a bias vector b ∈ Rn, where bi captures the prior preference of the i-th player for a particular action xi ∈ {−1,+1}. The payoff of the i-th player is a linear function of the actions of the remaining players: ui(xi,x−i) = xi(wT−ix−i − bi), and the PSNE set is defined as follows:\nNE(G(n)) = { x|(∀i) xi(wT−ix−i − bi) ≥ 0 } , (2)\nwhere w−i denotes the i-th row of W without the i-th entry, i.e. w−i = {wij |j 6= i}. Note that we have diag(W) = 0. Thus, for linear influence games, the weight matrix W and the bias vector b, completely specify the game and the PSNE set induced by the game. Finally, let G(n, k) denote a sparse game over n players where the in-degree of any vertex is at most k."

      "heading" : "3. Problem Formulation",
      "text" : "Now we turn our attention to the problem of learning graphical games from observations of joint actions only. Let NE∗ def= NE(G∗(n, k)). We assume that there exists a game G∗(n, k) = (W∗,b∗) from which a “noisy” data set D = {x(l)}ml=1 of m observations is generated, where each observation x(l) is sampled independently and identically from some distribution P. We will use two specific distributions Pg and Pl, which we refer to as the global and local noise model, to provide further intuition behind our results. In the global noise model, we assume that a joint action is observed from the PSNE set with probability qg ∈ (|NE∗|/2n, 1), i.e.\nPg(x) = qg1 [x ∈ NE∗] |NE∗| + (1− qg)1 [x /∈ NE∗] 2n − |NE∗| . (3)\nIn the above distribution, qg can be thought of as the “signal” level in the data set, while 1− qg can be thought of as the “noise” level in the data set. In the local noise model we assume that the joint actions are drawn from the PSNE set with the action of each player corrupted independently by some Bernoulli noise. Then in the local noise model the distribution over joint actions is given as follows:\nPl(x) = 1 |NE∗| ∑\ny∈NE∗ n∏ i=1 q 1[xi=yi] i (1− qi) 1[xi 6=yi], (4)\nwhere qi > 0.5. While these noise models were introduced in [6], we obtain our results with respect to very general observation models, satisfying only some mild conditions. A natural question to ask then is that: “Given only the data set D and no other information, is it possible to recover the game graph?” Honorio and Ortiz [6] showed that it is in general impossible to learn the true game G∗(n, k) from observations of joint actions only because multiple weight matrices\nW and bias vectors b can induce the same PSNE set and therefore have the same likelihood under the global noise model (3) — an issue known as non-identifiablity in the statistics literature. It is also easy to see that the same holds true for the local noise model. It is, however, possible to learn the equivalence class of games that induce the same PSNE set. We define the equivalence of two games G∗(n, k) and Ĝ(n, k) simply as :\nG∗(n, k) ≡ Ĝ(n, k) iff NE(G∗(n, k)) = NE(Ĝ(n, k)).\nTherefore, our goal in this paper is efficient and consistent recovery of the pure-strategy Nash equilibria set (PSNE) from observations of joint actions only; i.e., given a data set D, drawn from some game G∗(n, k) according to the distribution P, we infer a game Ĝ(n, k) from D such that Ĝ(n, k) ≡ G∗(n, k)."

There exists constants p̃min, p̃max and pmax such that the data distribution P satisfies the following:\n0 < p̃min 2n − |NE∗| ≤ P(x) ≤ p̃max 2n − |NE∗| ,∀x ∈ X \\ NE∗,\np̃max 2n − |NE∗| < P(x) ≤ pmax ≤ 1, ∀x ∈ NE∗.\nTo get some intuition for the above assumption, consider the global noise model. In this case we have that p̃min = p̃max = (1 − qg), pmax = qg/|NE∗|, and ∀x ∈ NE∗, P(x) = pmax. For the local noise model, consider, for simplicity, the case when there are only two joint actions in the PSNE set: NE∗ = {x1,x2}, such that x11 = +1, x21 = −1 and x1i = x2i = +1 for all i 6= 1. Then, p̃min = 0.5 × (1 − q2) × . . . × (1 − qn) × (2n − 2), p̃max = 0.5 × (1 − qj)( ∏ i/∈{j,1} qi) × (2n − 2), where qj = min{q2, . . . , qn}, and pmax = 0.5× q2 × . . . qn. Our next assumption concerns with the minimum payoff in the PSNE set.\nAssumption 2. The minimum payoff in the PSNE set, ρmin, is strictly positive, specifically:\nxi(w ∗ −i Tx−i − bi) ≥ ρmin > 5Cmin/Dmax (∀ x ∈ NE∗),\nwhere Cmin > 0 and Dmax are the minimum and maximum eigenvalue of the expected Hessian and scatter matrices respectively.\nNote that as long as the minimum payoff is strictly positive, we can scale the parameters (W∗,b∗) by the constant 5Cmin/Dmax to satisfy the condition: ρmin > 5Cmin/Dmax, without changing the PSNE set. Indeed the assumption that the minimum payoff is strictly positive is is unavoidable for exact recovery of the PSNE set in a noisy setting such as ours, because otherwise this is akin to exactly recovering the parameters v for each player i. For example, if x ∈ NE∗ is such that v∗Tx = 0, then it can be shown that even if ‖v∗ − v̂‖∞ = ε, for any ε arbitrarily close to 0, then v̂Tx < 0 and therefore NE(W∗,b∗) 6= NE(Ŵ, b̂)."

We denote by vi(W,b) = (w−i,−bi) the parameter vector for the i-th player, which characterizes its payoff; by zi(x) = (xix−i, xi) the “feature” vector. In the rest of the paper we use vi and zi instead of vi(W,b) and zi(x) respectively, to simplify notation.

We take a moment to introduce the expressions of the gradient and the Hessian of the loss function (6), which will be useful later. The gradient and Hessian of the loss function for any vector v and the data set D is given as follows:\n∇`(v,D) = 1 m m∑ l=1\n{ −z(l)\n1 + exp(vT z(l))\n} (7)\n∇2`(v,D) = 1 m m∑ l=1 η(vT z(l))z(l)z(l) T , (8)\nwhere η(x) = 1/(ex/2+e−x/2)2.

In subsequent sections we drop the notational dependence of H∗i and zi on i to simplify notation. We show that, under the aforementioned assumptions on the true game G∗(n, k) = (W∗,b∗),\nthe parameters Ŵ and b̂ obtained using (6) induce the same PSNE set as the true game, i.e., NE(W∗,b∗) = NE(Ŵ, b̂)."

To start with, we make the following observation regarding the number of Nash equilibria of the game satisfying Assumption 2. The proof of the following proposition, as well as other missing proofs can be found in Appendix A.\nProposition 1. The number of Nash equilibria of a non-trivial game (|NE∗| ∈ [1, 2n − 1]) satisfying Assumption 2 is at most 2n−1.\nWe will denote the fraction of joint actions that are in the PSNE set by fNE∗ def = |NE∗|/2n−1. By proposition 1, fNE∗ ∈ (0, 1]. Then, our main strategy for obtaining sufficient conditions for exact PSNE recovery guarantees is to first show that under any data distribution P that satisfies Assumption 1, the expected loss is smooth and strongly convex, i.e., the population Hessian matrix is positive definite and the population scatter matrix has eigenvalues bounded by a constant. Then using tools from random matrix theory, we show that the sample Hessian and scatter matrices are “well behaved”, i.e., are positive definite and have bounded eigenvalues\nrespectively, with high probability. Then, we exploit the convexity properties of the logistic loss function to show that the weight vectors learned using penalized logistic regression are “close” to the true weight vectors. By our assumption that the minimum payoff in the PSNE set is strictly greater than zero, we show that the weight vectors inferred from a finite sample of joint actions induce the same PSNE set as the true weight vectors. The following lemma shows that the expected Hessian matrices for each player is positive definite and the maximum eigenvalues of the expected scatter matrices are bounded from above by a constant.\nLemma 1.

Consider the i-th player. Let um def= ∇`(v∗i ,D) and umj denote the j-th index of um. For any subset S ′ ⊂ X such that |S ′| = 2n−1 define the function g(S ′) as follows:\ng(S ′) def= ∑ x∈S′ P(x)f(x)− ∑ x∈S′c P(x)f(x),\nwhere S ′c denotes the complement of the set S ′ and f(x) = 1/1+exp(v∗i T zi(x)). For x ∈ NE∗, f(x) ≤ κ, while for x /∈ NE∗ we have 1/2 ≤ f(x) ≤ 1. Lastly, let Sij = {x ∈ X |xixj = +1} and Si = {x ∈ X |xi = +1}. From (7) we have that, for j 6= n, ∣∣∣E [umj ]∣∣∣ = |g(Sij)|, while for j = n∣∣∣E [umj ]∣∣∣ = |g(Si)|.

First, note that κ ≤ 1/2. Also, as the minimum payoff ρmin increases, κ decays to 0 exponentially. Similarly, if the probability measure on the non-Nash equilibria set is close to uniform, meaning p̃max − p̃min ≈ 0, then the second term in (9) vanishes. Finally, if the fraction of actions that are in the PSNE set (fNE∗) is small, then the third term in (9) is small. Therefore, if the minimum payoff is high, the noise distribution, i.e., the distribution of the non-Nash equilibria joint actions, is close to uniform, and the fraction of joint actions that are in the PSNE set is small, then the expected gradient vanishes. In the following technical lemma we show that the optimal vector v̂ for the logistic regression problem is close to the true vector v∗ in the support set S of v∗. Next, in Lemma 5, we bound the difference between the true vector v∗ and the optimal vector v̂ in the non-support set. The lemmas together show that the optimal vector is close to the true vector.\nLemma 4. If the regularization parameter λ satisfies the following condition:\nλ ≤ 5C 2 min\n16 |S|Dmax − ν −\n√ 2\nm log\n2n\nδ ,\nthen\n‖v∗S − v̂S‖2 ≤ 5Cmin 4 √ |S|Dmax ,\nwith probability at least 1− (δ + |S| exp((−mCmin)/2|S|) + |S| exp(−mp̃min/4|S|)).\nProof. The proof of this lemma follows the general proof structure of Lemma 3 in [9]. First, we reparameterize the `1-regularized loss function\nf(vS) = `(vS) + λ ‖vS‖1\nas the loss function f̃ , which gives the loss at a point that is ∆S distance away from the true parameter v∗S as : f̃(∆S) = `(v ∗ S +∆S)− `(v∗S)+λ(‖v∗S + ∆S‖1−‖v ∗ S‖1), where ∆S = vS−v ∗ S . Also note that the loss function f̃ is shifted such that the loss at the true parameter v∗S is 0, i.e., f̃(0) = 0. Further, note that the function f̃ is convex and is minimized at ∆̂S = v̂S − v∗S , since v̂S minimizes f . Therefore, clearly f̃(∆̂S) ≤ 0. Thus, if we can show that the function f̃ is strictly positive on the surface of a ball of radius b, then the point ∆̂S lies inside the ball i.e., ‖v̂S − v∗S‖2 ≤ b. Using the Taylor’s theorem we expand the first term of f̃ to get the following:\nf̃(∆S) = ∇`(v∗S)T∆S + ∆TS∇2`(v∗S + θ∆S)∆S + λ(‖v∗S + ∆S‖1 − ‖v ∗ S‖1), (11)\nfor some θ ∈ [0, 1]. Next, we lower bound each of the terms in (11). Using the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality, the first term in (11) is bounded as follows:\n∇`(v∗S)T∆S ≥ −‖∇`(v∗S)‖∞ ‖∆S‖1 ≥ −‖∇`(v∗S)‖∞ √ |S| ‖∆S‖2\n≥ −b √ |S| ( ν + √ 2\nm log\n2n\nδ\n) , (12)\nwith probability at least 1 − δ for δ ∈ [0, 1]. It is also easy to upper bound the last term in equation 11, using the reverse triangle inequality as follows:\nλ |‖v∗S + ∆S‖1 − ‖v ∗ S‖1| ≤ λ ‖∆S‖1 .\nWhich then implies the following lower bound:\nλ(‖v∗S + ∆S‖1 − ‖v ∗ S‖1) ≥ −λ ‖∆S‖1 ≥ −λ √ |S| ‖∆S‖2\n= −λ √ |S|b. (13)\nNow we turn our attention to computing a lower bound of the second term of (11), which is a bit more involved.\n∆TS∇2`(v∗S + θ∆S)∆S ≥ min‖∆S‖2=b ∆TS∇2`(v∗S + θ∆S)∆S\n= b2λmin(∇2`(v∗S + θ∆S)).\nNow,\nλmin(∇2`(v∗S + θ∆S)) ≥ min θ∈[0,1] λmin ( ∇2`(v∗S + θ∆S) ) = min θ∈[0,1] λmin ( 1 m m∑ l=1 η((v∗S + θ∆S) T z (l) S )z (l) S (z (l) S ) T )\nAgain, using the Taylor’s theorem to expand the function η we get\nη((v∗S + θ∆S) T z (l) S )\n= η((v∗S) T z (l) S ) + η ′((v∗S + θ̄∆S) T z (l) S )(θ∆S) T z (l) S\n, where θ̄ ∈ [0, θ]. Finally, from Lemma 2 we have, with probability at least 1−|S| exp((−mCmin)/2|S|): λmin ( ∇2`(v∗S + θ∆S) ) ≥ min θ∈[0,1] λmin ( 1 m m∑ l=1 η((v∗S) T z (l) S )z (l) S (z (l) S ) T\n+ 1\nm m∑ l=1 η′((v∗S + θ̄∆S) T z (l) S )((θ∆S) T z (l) S )z (l) S (z (l) S ) T )\n≥ λmin(HmSS)− max θ∈[0,1] |||A(θ)|||2\n≥ Cmin 2 − max θ∈[0,1] |||A(θ)|||2,\nwhere we have defined\nA(θ) def =\n1\nm m∑ l=1 η′((v∗S + θ∆S) T z (l) S )×\n(θ∆S) T z (l) S z (l) S (z (l) S ) T .\nNext, the spectral norm of A(θ) can be bounded as follows:\n|||A(θ)|||2\n≤ max ‖y‖2=1\n{ 1\nm m∑ l=1 ∣∣∣η′((v∗S + θ∆S)T z(l)S )∣∣∣ ∣∣∣((θ∆S)T z(l)S )∣∣∣ × yT (z(l)S (z (l) S ) T )y }\n< max ‖y‖2=1\n1\n(10m) m∑ l=1 ‖(θ∆S)‖1 ∥∥∥z(l)S ∥∥∥∞ yT (z(l)S (z(l)S )T )y\n≤ θ max ‖y‖2=1\n{ 1\n10m m∑ l=1 √ |S| ‖∆S‖2 y T (z (l) S (z (l) S ) T )y\n}\n= θb √ |S| ∣∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣∣ 110m m∑ l=1 z (l) S (z (l) S ) T ∣∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣∣ ∣∣∣∣∣ 2\n≤ (b √ |S|Dmax)\n5 ≤ Cmin 4 ,\nwhere in the second line we used the fact that η′(.) < 1/10 and in the last line we assumed that (b √ |S|Dmax) 5 ≤ Cmin/4 — an assumption that we verify momentarily. Having upper bounded the spectral norm of A(θ), we have\nλmin ( ∇2`(v∗S + θ∆S) ) ≥ Cmin\n4 . (14)\nPlugging back the bounds given by (12), (13) and (14) in (11) and equating to zero we get\n−b √ |S| ( ν + √ 2\nm log\n2n\nδ\n) + b2Cmin\n4 − λ\n√ |S|b = 0\n=⇒ b = 4 √ |S|\nCmin\n( λ+ ν + √ 2\nm log\n2n\nδ\n) .\nFinally, coming back to our prior assumption we have b = 4 √ |S|\nCmin\n( λ+ ν + √ 2\nm log\n2n\nδ\n) ≤ 5Cmin\n4 √ |S|Dmax .\nThe above assumption holds if the regularization parameter λ is bounded as follows:\nλ ≤ 5C 2 min 16 |S|Dmax − √ 2 m log 2n δ − ν.\nLemma 5. If the regularization parameter λ satisfies the following condition: λ ≥ ν + √ 2\nm log\n2n\nδ ,\nthen we have that\n‖v̂ − v∗‖1 ≤ 5Cmin Dmax\nwith probability at least 1− (δ + |S| exp((−mCmin)/2|S|) + |S| exp(−mp̃min/4|S|)).\nNow we are ready to present our main result on recovering the true PSNE set.\nTheorem 1. If for all i, |Si| ≤ k, the minimum payoff ρmin ≥ 5Cmin/Dmax, and the regularization parameter and the number of samples satisfy the following conditions:\nν +\n√ 2\nm log\n6n2\nδ ≤ λ ≤ 2K + ν −\n√ 2\nm log\n6n2\nδ (15)\nm ≥ max\n{ 2\nK2 log\n( 6n2\nδ\n) , 2k\nCmin log\n( 3kn\nδ\n) ,\n4k\np̃min log\n( 3kn\nδ\n)} , (16)\nwhere K def= 5C2min/32kDmax − ν, then with probability at least 1− δ, for δ ∈ (0, 1), we recover the true PSNE set, i.e., NE(Ŵ, b̂) = NE(W∗,b∗).\nProof. From Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and Lemma 5 we have∣∣(v̂i − v∗i )T zi∣∣ ≤ ‖v̂i − v∗i ‖1 ‖zi‖∞ ≤ 5CminDmax . Therefore, we have that\n(v∗i ) T zi − 5Cmin Dmax ≤ v̂Ti zi ≤ (v∗i )T zi + 5Cmin Dmax .\nNow, if ∀ x ∈ NE∗, (v∗i )T zi ≥ 5Cmin/Dmax, then v̂Ti zi ≥ 0. Using an union bound argument over all players i, we can show that the above holds with probability at least\n1− n(δ + k exp((−mCmin)/2k) + k exp((−mp̃min)/4k) (17)\nfor all players. Therefore, we have that NE(Ŵ, b̂) = NE∗ with high probability. Finally, setting δ = δ′/3n, for some δ′ ∈ [0, 1], and ensuring that the last two terms in (17) are at most δ′/3n each, we prove our claim.\nTo better understand the implications of the theorem above, we instantiate it for the global and local noise model.\nRemark 1 (Sample complexity under global noise model). Recall that Dmax ≤ min(k, 2npmax), and for the global noise model given by (3) pmax = qg/|NE∗|. If qg is constant, then Dmax = k. Then K = Ω (1/k2), and the sample complexity of learning sparse linear games grows as O ( k4 log n ) . However, if qg is small enough, i.e., qg = O (|NE∗|/2n), then Dmax is no longer a\nfunction of k and K = Ω (1/k). Hence, the sample complexity scales as O ( k2 log n ) for exact PSNE recovery.\nNext, we consider the implications of Theorem 1 under the local noise model given by (4). we consider the regime where the parameter q scales with the number of players n.\nRemark 2 (Sample complexity under local noise). In the local noise model if the number of Nash-equilibria is constant, then pmax = O (exp(−n)), and once again Dmax becomes independent of k, which results in a sample complexity of O ( k2 log n ) .\nAlso, observe the dependence of the sample complexity on the minimum noise level p̃min. The number of samples required to recover the PSNE set increases as p̃min decreases. From the aforementioned remarks we see that if the noise level is too low, i.e., p̃min → 0, then number of samples needed goes to infinity; This seems counter-intuitive — with reduced noise level, a learning problem should become easier and not harder. To understand this seemingly counterintuitive behavior, first observe that the constant Dmax/Cmin can be thought of as the “condition number” of the loss function given by (6). Then, the sample complexity as given by Theorem 1 can be written as O ( k2D2max C2min log n ) . Hence, we have that as the noise level gets too low, the Hessian of the loss becomes ill-conditioned, since the data set now comprises of many repetitions of the few joint-actions that are in the PSNE set; thereby increasing the dependency (Dmax) between actions of players in the sample data set."

      "text" : "In this section we derive necessary conditions on the number of samples required to learn graphical games. Our approach for doing so is information-theoretic: we treat the inference procedure as a communication channel and then use the Fano’s inequality to lower bound the estimation error. Such techniques have been widely used to obtain necessary conditions for model selection in graphical models, see e.g. [13, 14], sparsity recovery in linear regression [15], and many other problems. Consider an ensemble Gn of n-player games with the in-degree of each player being at most k. Nature picks a true game G∗ ∈ G, and then generates a data set D of m joint actions. A decoder is any function ψ : Xm → Gn that maps a data set D to a game, ψ(D), in Gn. The minimum estimation error over all decoders ψ, for the ensemble Gn, is then given as follows:\nperr def = min\nψ max G∗∈Gn\nPr {NE(ψ(D)) 6= NE(G∗)} , (18)\nwhere the probability is computed over the data distribution. Our objective here is to compute the number of samples below which PSNE recovery fails with probability greater than 1/2.\nTheorem 2. The number of samples required to learn graphical games over n players and indegree of at most k, is Ω (k log n).\nRemark 3. From the above theorem and from Theorem 1 we observe that the method of l1regularized logistic regression for learning graphical games, operates close to the fundamental limit of Ω (k log n).\nResults from simulation experiments for both global and local noise model can be found in Appendix B.\nConcluding Remarks. An interesting direction for future work would be to consider structured actions — for instance permutations, directed spanning trees, directed acyclic graphs among others — thereby extending the formalism of linear influence games to the structured prediction setting. Other ideas that might be worth pursuing are: considering mixed strategies, correlated equilibria and epsilon Nash equilibria, and incorporating latent or unobserved actions and variables in the model."

      "heading" : "Appendix A Detailed Proofs",
      "text" : "Proof of Proposition 1. Let |NE∗| > 2n−1. Then by the pigeon hole principle there are at least two joint actions x and x′ in NE∗ such that x = −x′. Since the payoff is strictly positive, it follows that the bias bi for each player must be 0. If the bias for all players is 0, then for each x ∈ NE∗, −x ∈ NE∗. Therefore, |NE∗| = 2n. Since we have assumed that the game is non-trivial, we get a contradiction.\nProof of Lemma 5. Define ∆ def= v̂ − v∗. Also for any vector y let the notation yS denote the vector y with the entries not in the support, S, set to zero, i.e.[\nyS ] i = { yi if i ∈ S, 0 otherwise.\nSimilarly, let the notation ySc denote the vector y with the entries not in S c set to zero, where Sc is the complement of S. Having introduced our notation and since, S is the support of the true vector v∗, we have by definition that v∗ = v∗\nS . We then have, using the reverse triangle\ninequality,\n‖v̂‖1 = ‖v ∗ + ∆‖1 = ∥∥v∗ S + ∆S + ∆Sc ∥∥ 1\n= ∥∥v∗\nS − (−∆S) ∥∥ 1 + ∥∥∆Sc∥∥1\n≥ ‖v∗‖1 − ∥∥∆S∥∥1 + ∥∥∆Sc∥∥1 . (19)\nAlso, from the optimality of v̂ for the `1-regularized problem we have that\n`(v∗) + λ ‖v∗‖1 ≥ `(v̂) + λ ‖v̂‖1 =⇒ λ(‖v∗‖1 − ‖v̂‖1) ≥ `(v̂)− `(v ∗). (20)\nNext, from convexity of `(.) and using the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality we have that\n`(v̂)− `(v∗) ≥ ∇`(v∗)T (v̂ − v∗) ≥ −‖∇`(v∗)‖∞ ‖∆‖1\n≥ −λ 2 ‖∆‖1 , (21)\nin the last line we used the fact that λ ≥ ‖∇`(v∗)‖∞. Thus, we have from (19), (20) and (21) that\n1 2 ‖∆‖1 ≥ ‖v̂‖1 − ‖v ∗‖1\n=⇒ 1 2 ‖∆‖1 ≥ ∥∥∆Sc∥∥1 − ∥∥∆S∥∥1 =⇒ 1\n2 ∥∥∆Sc∥∥1 + 12 ∥∥∆S∥∥1 ≥ ∥∥∆Sc∥∥1 − ∥∥∆S∥∥1 =⇒ 3\n∥∥∆S∥∥1 ≥ ∥∥∆Sc∥∥1 .

First, we construct a restricted ensemble of games G̃ ⊂ G as follows. Each game G ∈ G̃ contains k, randomly chosen, influential players. The game graph for G is then chosen to be a complete directed bipartite graph from the set of k influential players to the set of n− k non-influential players. The edge weights are all set to −1, the bias for the k influential players is set to +1, while the bias for the remaining n − k players is set to 0. Then it is clear that each game in G̃ induces a distinct size-one PSNE set. Specifically, for a game G ∈ G̃, a joint action x ∈ NE(G) is such that xi = −1 if player i is influential in G, otherwise xi = +1. Also, note that the minimum payoff in the PSNE set of each game in G̃ is strictly positive, and is precisely 1. Finally, we assume that the data set is drawn according to the global noise model (3), with q = 1/n. Now let G ∈ G̃ be a uniformly-distributed random variable corresponding to the game that was picked by nature. From the Fano’s inequality, we have that:\nperr ≥ 1− I(D;G) + log 2\nH(G) , (23)\nwhere I(.) denotes mutual information and H(.) denotes entropy. Since, G is uniformly distributed, we have that H(G) = log ∣∣G̃∣∣ = log (nk) ≥ k(log n − log k). Let PD|G=G1 be the conditional distribution of the data set given a game G1 ∈ G̃. We bound the mutual information I(D;G) by a pairwise KL-based bound from [16] as follows:\nI(D;G) ≤ 1∣∣G̃∣∣ ∑ G1∈G̃ ∑ G2∈G̃ KL ( PD|G=G1 ∥∥PD|G=G2) . (24) Now from the fact that data are sampled i.i.d , we get:\nKL ( PD|G=G1 ∥∥PD|G=G2) = m ∑ x∈X PD|G=G1(x) log\nPD|G=G1 (x) PD|G=G2 (x) = m { q log q(2\nn−1) 1−q + 1−q 2n−1 log 1−q q(2n−1) } = m(2\nnq−1) 2n−1\n( log q − log ( 1−q\n2n−1 )) ≤ m log 2, (25)\nwhere the last line comes from the fact that q = 1/n. Putting together (23), (24) and (25), and setting perr = 1/2, we get\nm ≤ k log n− k log k − 2 log 2 2 log 2 .\nBy observing that learning the ensemble G is at least as hard as learning a subset of the ensemble G̃, we prove our main claim."

      "heading" : "Appendix B Experiments",
      "text" : "In order to verify that our results and assumptions indeed hold in practice, we performed various simulation experiments. We generated random LIGs for n players and exactly k neighbors by first creating a matrix W of all zeros and then setting k off-diagonal entries of each row, chosen uniformly at random, to −1. We set the bias for all players to 0. We found that any odd value of k produces games with strictly positive payoff in the PSNE set. Therefore, for each value of k\nin {1, 3, 5}, and n in {10, 12, 15, 20}, we generated 40 random LIGs. For experiments involving the local noise model, we only used n ∈ {10, 12, 15}. The parameter δ was set to the constant value of 0.01. For the global noise model, the parameters qg was set to 0.01, while for the local noise model we used q1 = . . . = qn = 0.6. The regularization parameter λ was set according to Theorem 1 as some constant multiple of √ (2/m) log(2n/δ). Figure 1 shows the probability of successful recovery of the PSNE, for various combinations of (n, k), where the probability was computed as the fraction of the 40 randomly sampled LIGs for which the learned PSNE set matched the true PSNE set exactly. For each experiment, the number of samples was computed as: b(C)(10c)(k2 log(6n2/δ))c, where c is the control parameter and the constant C is 10000 for k = 1 and 1000 for k = 3 and 5. Thus, from Figure 1 we see that, the sample complexity of O ( k2 log n ) as given by Theorem 1 indeed holds in practice, i.e., there exists constants c and c′ such that if the number of samples is less than ck2 log n, we fail to recover the PSNE set exactly with high probability, while if the number of samples is greater than c′k2 log n then we are able to recover the PSNE set exactly, with high probability. Further, the scaling remains consistent as the number of players n is changed from 10 to 20."

We consider sparse linear influence games — a parametric class of graphical games with linear payoffs, and represented by directed graphs of n nodes (players) and in-degree of at most k. We show that one can efficiently recover the PSNE set of a linear influence game with O ( k2 log n ) samples, under very general observation models. On the other hand, we show that Ω (k log n) samples are necessary for any procedure to recover the PSNE set from observations of joint actions.",
