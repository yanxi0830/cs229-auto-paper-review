INTRODUCTION\nIn many real-world applications, the dimensionality of data are very high. Directly handle the high-dimensional data is computationally expensive. At the same time, the performance could be poor because the number of available data is often limited and the noise in the data would increase dramatically when the dimensionality increases. To solve these problems, dimensionality reduction is one of the most important and effective methods. Among the dimensionality reduction algorithms, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [1] is one of the most widely used algorithms due to its simplicity and effectiveness. The main goal of PCA is to preserve the structure of the original data in the projected low-dimensional space. To this end, given a data set, PCA finds a projection matrix to minimize the reconstruction error of the projected data points under this projection matrix.\nThe traditional PCA has been successfully applied in many problems [2] in the past decades. However, the traditional PCA algorithm has several drawbacks. First, it need perform Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD) on input data matrix or eigendecomposition on the covariance matrix, which is computationally expensive and difficult to be used when the number and the dimensionality of data are both very high. Second, it is sensitive to data outliers, because its objective function is intrinsically based on squared L2-norm and the outliers with large variation values can be exaggerated by the squared L2-norm. Many recent\nFeiping Nie and Heng Huang are with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, USA. Email: feipingnie@gmail.com, heng@uta.edu\nresearch works [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8] have devoted effort to alleviate this problem and improve the robustness to outliers. [3], [6] proposed to find the subspace such that the sum of L1-norm distances of data points to the subspace is minimized. Although the robustness to outliers is improved in these methods, their algorithms are computationally expensive. Moreover, the used L1-norm in objective is not invariant to rotation. Thus, the performance is usually poor when their L1-norm based PCA is combined with K-means clustering [7]. To solve this problem, the R1-PCA was proposed with rotational invariant property and demonstrated good performance [7]. However, the R1-PCA iteratively performs the subspace iteration algorithm [9] in the high dimensional original space, which is computationally expensive. The extension of R1-PCA to tensor version can be found in [10].\nRecently, a PCA method based on L1-norm maximization was proposed in [11], and a similar work can be found in [12]. This method is invariant to rotation and is also robust to outliers. An efficient algorithm was proposed to solve the L1norm maximization problem in [11]. This algorithm only need perform matrix-vector multiplication, and thus can be applied in the case that both the number and the dimensionality of data are very high. Several works on its tensor version and supervised version can be found in [13], [14], [15]. Due to the difficulty of directly solving the L1-norm maximization problem, all these works use a greedy strategy to solve it. Specifically, the projection directions are optimized one by one sequentially. Such a kind of greedy method is easy to get stuck in a local solution.\nMoreover, the L1-norm maximization based PCA method is not theoretically connected to minimization of the reconstruction error, which is the important goal of traditional PCA. In this paper, we propose a novel principal component analysis method based on the L21-norm maximization. The proposed method is robust to data outliers and also invariant to rotation. More importantly, our new method is theoretically connected to the minimization of reconstruction error, and thus is more suitable for principal component analysis than previous method in [11]. To solve the derived L21-norm PCA objective, we propose a new non-greedy and efficient optimization algorithm to optimize all the projection directions simultaneously. Meanwhile, our algorithm will be extended to solve the more general maximization problems. We provide the theoretical analysis to guarantee the convergence of our algorithms. All experimental results on real world data sets show that the proposed method is effective for principal component analysis, and always obtains smaller reconstruction error than the method in [11] under the same reduced dimension.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: We give a brief review of the related work in Section 2. In Section 3, we propose the L21-norm maximization based principal component analysis and solve the derived optimization problem through a new nongreedy and efficient algorithm which can solve the more general L21-norm maximization problem. In Section 4, we extend our\n2 algorithm to solve the general maximization problem which can be used to derive solutions for many other statistical learning models. In Section 5, we present experimental results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Finally, we draw the conclusions in Section 6."

      "text" : "Given data X = [x1, x2, · · · , xn] ∈ ℜd×n, where d and n are the dimensionality and number of data points respectively, without loss of generality, we can assume the data {xi}ni=1 are centralized, i.e.,\n∑n i=1 xi = 0.\nWe denote the projection matrix W = [w1, w2, · · · , wm] ∈ ℜd×m. The traditional PCA method minimizes the reconstruction error under the projected subspace, which is to solve the following optimization problem:\nmin WT W=I\nn ∑\ni=1\n∥ ∥ ∥ xi −WWTxi ∥ ∥ ∥ 2\n2 , (1)\nwhere I is the identity matrix, ‖ · ‖2 is the L2-norm of vector. Equivalently, the traditional PCA method can also be formulated as maximizing the variance of data in the projected subspace, which is to solve the following optimization problem:\nmax WTW=I Tr(WTStW ) = max WT W=I\nn ∑\ni=1\n∥ ∥ ∥ WTxi ∥ ∥ ∥\n2 2 , (2)\nwhere St = XXT is the covariance matrix and Tr(·) is the trace operator of a matrix. The equivalence of Eq. (1) and Eq. (2) is based on the following equation for any matrix W with WTW = I:\nn ∑\ni=1\n∥ ∥ ∥ xi −WWTxi ∥ ∥ ∥ 2\n2 +\nn ∑\ni=1\n∥ ∥ ∥ WTxi ∥ ∥ ∥ 2\n2 =\nn ∑\ni=1\n‖xi‖22 (3)\nBased on Eq. (1), R1-PCA was proposed to solve the following problem [7]:\nmin WT W=I\nn ∑\ni=1\n∥ ∥ ∥ xi −WWTxi ∥ ∥ ∥\n2 . (4)\nR1-PCA minimizes the L2-norm loss instead of the squared L2norm loss in traditional PCA, and thus the robustness to outliers is improved. The other important property of R1-PCA is that it is invariant to rotation, which is also preserved by traditional PCA.\nMotivated by Eq. (2), a recent work named PCA-L1 [11] was proposed to maximize the L1-norm instead of the squared L2norm in traditional PCA by solving the following problem:\nmax WT W=I\nn ∑\ni=1\n∥ ∥ ∥ WTxi ∥ ∥ ∥\n1 , (5)\nwhere ‖·‖1 is the L1-norm of vector. PCA-L1 also has the rotation invariant property. Directly solving this problem is difficult, thus the author used a greedy strategy to solve it. Specifically, the m projection directions {w1, w2, · · · , wm} are optimized one by one. The first projection direction w1 is optimized by solving:\nmax wT\n1 w1=1\nn ∑\ni=1\n|wT1 xi|. (6)\nAfter the (k − 1)-th projection direction wk−1 has been obtained, the data matrix X is transformed to X = X −\nwk−1(wk−1) TX, and then the k-th projection direction wk is optimized by solving:\nmax wT\nk wk=1\nn ∑\ni=1\n|wTk xi|. (7)\nIn this greedy method, the problem (7) is the key function to be solved for each k. The work in [11] proposed an iterative algorithm to solve this problem. In order to guarantee the algorithm converges to a local maximum, the algorithm adds an additional judgement after the convergence to wtk. If there exists i such that (wtk) Txi = 0, then let wtk = (w t k + △w)/‖wtk + △w‖2 and re-run the iterative algorithm, where △w is a small nonzero random vector. However, such operation might make the algorithm interminable. For example, if there is a data point x that exactly locates on the mean of the data set, then x will be zero after centralization. As a result, (wt)Tx is always zero for any wt). Moreover, it is possible that there exists i such that (wtk)\nTxi = 0 at the global maximum. In this case, the algorithm doesn’t have the chance to find the global maximum."

(2), we propose to solve the following problem:\nmax WTW=I\nn ∑\ni=1\n‖WTxi‖2 = max WTW=I ‖XTW‖2,1, (8)\nwhere ‖·‖2,1 is the L21-norm of a matrix defined as ‖M‖2,1 = ∑\ni ( ∑ j m 2 ij)\n1\n2 . Contrast to the name of PCA-L1 in [11] that solves problem (5), we call our PCA method with solving problem (8) as PCA-L21. The PCA-L21 maximizes the L2-norm instead of the squared L2-norm in PCA, and thus the robustness to outliers is also improved. Similarly to R1-PCA and PCA-L1, PCA-L21 is also a rotation invariant method.\nIt is conjectured in [11] that problem (4) and problem (5) are closely related. However, no theoretical analysis was provided in [11] and it seems not the case according to our extensively experimental results. In contrast, we will show from both theoretical and experimental results that the proposed problem (8) is indeed closely related to the problem (4), thus PCA-L21 is more suitable for the principal component analysis than PCA-L1.\nFirst, we have the following lemma: Lemma 1: If a2 + b2 = c2, then |c| ≤ |a|+ |b| ≤ √ 2 |c|. Proof: Starting from the condition, we have\na2 + b2 = c2\n⇒ a2 + b2 + 2 |a| |b| ≥ c2 ⇒ (|a|+ |b|)2 ≥ c2\n⇒ |a|+ |b| ≥ |c| . (9)\nOn the other hand, we have\n(|a| − |b|)2 ≥ 0 ⇒ (|a|+ |b|)2 ≤ 2(a2 + b2) ⇒ (|a|+ |b|)2 ≤ 2c2 ⇒ |a|+ |b| ≤ √ 2 |c| (10)\nCombining Eq. (9) and Eq. (10), we complete the proof.\n3\nAccording to Eq. (3) and Lemma 1, we have the following relationship: n ∑\ni=1\n‖xi‖2 ≤ n ∑\ni=1\n∥ ∥ ∥ xi −WWTxi ∥ ∥ ∥\n2 +\nn ∑\ni=1\n∥ ∥ ∥ WTxi ∥ ∥ ∥\n2 ≤\n√ 2 n ∑\ni=1\n‖xi‖2,\n(11) which can be written in matrix form as\n‖X‖2,1 ≤ ‖XT −XTWWT‖2,1 + ‖WTX‖2,1 ≤ √ 2 ‖X‖2,1 .\n(12) Therefore, the proposed problem (8) is theoretically connected to the problem (4), which indicates that maximizing the L21 norm as in problem (8) also makes sense to minimize the reconstruction error, and thus is suitable for the principal component analysis.\nTo solve the problem (8), we first propose an efficient algorithm to solve the more general L21-norm maximization problem. Utilizing this general algorithm, we can solve the problem (8) directly without using the greedy strategy as in [11]."

Therefore, the computational complexity of the algorithm is linear w.r.t. either data number or data dimension, which indicates the algorithm is applicable in the case that both data number and data dimension are high.

      "text" : "Similar to traditional PCA, the proposed PCA-L21 is also a linear method, and is not suitable to handle data under the non-Gaussian distribution. A popular technique to deal with this problem is to extend the linear method to kernel method. Obviously, the PCA-L21 is invariant to rotation and shift, so this linear method satisfies the conditions of the general kernelization framework in [17]. Thus, the PCA-L21 can be kernelized using this framework. Specifically, the given data are transformed by KPCA [18], and then Algorithm 2 is performed on the transformed data.\nAnother problem of PCA is that it can only handle data points with vector format. For high-order tensor data, we have to vectorize the data to very high-dimensional vectors before applying PCA. This approach destroys the spacial information of tensor data and makes the computational burden very heavy. A popular technique to deal with this problem is to extend the vector based method to tensor based method. As the problem (8) in PCA-L21 only includes linear operator WTxi, it can be easily extended to the tensor method to handle high-order data directly. For simplicity, we only briefly discuss the case of 2D tensor, the higher order tensor cases can be readily extended by replacing the linear operator WTxi with tensor operator [19].\nGiven data X = [X1, X2, · · · , Xn] ∈ ℜr×c×n, where each data Xi ∈ ℜr×c is a 2D matrix, n is the number of data points, we assume that {Xi}ni=1 are centralized, i.e., ∑n i=1 Xi = 0. To handle the tensor case, linear operator WTxi is replaced by UTXiV , where U ∈ ℜr×k1 and V ∈ ℜc×k2 are two projection matrices (k1 < r and k2 < c are the reduced dimensions of two projection subspaces).

We can also observed that in this experimental setting, PCAL1 doesn’t perform as good as PCA, which indicates that PCAL1 is not closely connected to the minimization of reconstruction error, thus is not a good option for principal component analysis in some cases."

Some samples from the Palm data set are shown in Figure 5.\nWe use the following reconstruction error to measure the\nquality of dimensionality reduction methods:\ne(m) = 1\nn\nn ∑\ni=1\n∥ ∥ ∥ xorgi −WW Txorgi ∥ ∥ ∥\n2 , (38)\nwhere n is the number of training data (not including the noise image data from the Palm data set), W ∈ ℜd×m is the learned projection matrix by PCA, R1-PCA, PCA-L1 or PCA-L21, xorgi is the i-th original training data (not including the noise image data from the Palm data set). Under this experimental setting, if a method is robust to the data outliers, its reconstruction error should be smaller than other non-robust methods.\nIn the experiments, the projected dimension m varies from 21 to 69. The results of the reconstruction error by PCA, R1-PCA, PCA-L1 and PCA-L21 are shown in Figure 6.\nWe can see from the figures that, in this experimental setting, R1-PCA, PCA-L1 and the proposed PCA-L21 all outperform PCA in terms of reconstruction error, and our PCA-L21 consistently outperforms R1PCA, PCA-L1 and performs best in this case. The experimental results clearly indicates that the proposed PCA-L21 is more suitable for principal component analysis than the traditional PCA when there are outliers in the data."

      "text" : "A principal component analysis with L21-norm maximization was proposed in this paper. The L21-norm maximization based PCA is theoretically connected to the minimization of the reconstruction error, and thus is more suitable for principal component analysis than the L1-norm maximization based PCA proposed in [11]. To avoid the greedy strategy used in [11] for solving the L1norm maximization problem, we propose an efficient optimization algorithm to solve a more general L21-norm maximization problem, which is non-greedy and is guaranteed to converge to a local solution. Moreover, we extend our algorithm to solve the more general maximization problem which can derive solutions for many related statistical learning models. Experimental results on real world data sets show that the proposed method is effective for principal component analysis, and always obtains smaller reconstruction error than the related methods under the same reduced dimension."

However, due to the high computational complexity of its eigen decomposition solution, it hard to apply PCA to the large-scale data with high dimensionality. Meanwhile, the squared L2-norm based objective makes it sensitive to data outliers. In recent research, the L1-norm maximization based PCA method was proposed for efficient computation and being robust to outliers. However, this work used a greedy strategy to solve the eigen vectors. Moreover, the L1-norm maximization based objective may not be the correct robust PCA formulation, because it loses the theoretical connection to the minimization of data reconstruction error, which is one of the most important intuitions and goals of PCA. In this paper, we propose to maximize the L21-norm based robust PCA objective, which is theoretically connected to the minimization of reconstruction error. More importantly, we propose the efficient non-greedy optimization algorithms to solve our objective and the more general L21-norm maximization problem with theoretically guaranteed convergence. Experimental results on real world data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed method for principal component analysis.",
