      "text" : "Decentralized computation and estimation have many applications in sensor and peer-to-peer networks as well as for extracting knowledge from massive information graphs such as interlinked Web documents and on-line social media. Algorithms running on such networks must often operate under tight constraints: the nodes forming the network cannot rely on a centralized entity for communication and synchronization, without being aware of the global network topology and/or have limited resources (computational power, memory, energy). Gossip algorithms [20, 19, 6], where each node exchanges information with at most one of its neighbors at a time, have emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for distributed computation in such settings. Given a data observation on each node, gossip algorithms can be used to compute averages or sums of functions of the data that are separable across observations (see for example [11, 2, 16, 12, 10] and references therein). Unfortunately, these algorithms cannot be used to efficiently compute quantities that take the form of an average over pairs of observations, also known as U -statistics [13]. Among classical U -statistics used in machine learning and data mining, one can mention, among others: the sample variance, the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of a classifier on distributed data, the Gini mean difference, the Kendall\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n05 46\n4v 1\n[ st\nat .M\ntau rank correlation coefficient, the within-cluster point scatter and several statistical hypothesis test statistics such as Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney [15].\nIn this paper, we propose randomized synchronous and asynchronous gossip algorithms to efficiently compute a U -statistic, in which each node maintains a local estimate of the quantity of interest throughout the execution of the algorithm. Our methods rely on two types of iterative information exchange in the network: propagation of local observations across the network, and averaging of local estimates. We show that the local estimates generated by our approach converge in expectation to the value of the U -statistic at rates of O(1/t) and O(log t/t) for the synchronous and asynchronous versions respectively, where t is the number of iterations. These convergence bounds feature datadependent terms that reflect the hardness of the estimation problem, and network-dependent terms related to the spectral gap of the network graph [4], showing that our algorithms are faster on wellconnected networks. The proofs rely on an original reformulation of the problem using “phantom nodes”, i.e., on additional nodes that account for data propagation in the network. Our results largely improve upon those presented in [18]: in particular, we achieve faster convergence together with lower memory and communication costs. Experiments conducted on AUC and within-cluster point scatter estimation using real data confirm the superiority of our approach.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the problem of interest as well as relevant notation. Section 3 provides a brief review of the related work in gossip algorithms. We then describe our approach along with the convergence analysis in Section 4, both in the synchronous and asynchronous settings. Section 5 presents our numerical results."

Let H : X × X → R be a measurable function, symmetric in its two arguments and with H(X,X) = 0, ∀X ∈ X . We consider the problem of estimating the following quantity, known as a degree two U -statistic [13]:1\nÛn(H) = 1\nn2 n∑ i,j=1 H(Xi, Xj). (1)\nIn this paper, we illustrate the interest of U -statistics on two applications, among many others.

      "text" : "Gossip algorithms have been extensively studied in the context of decentralized averaging in networks, where the goal is to compute the average of n real numbers (X = R):\nX̄n = 1\nn n∑ i=1 Xi = 1 n X>1n. (4)\nOne of the earliest work on this canonical problem is due to [20], but more efficient algorithms have recently been proposed, see for instance [11, 2]. Of particular interest to us is the work of [2], which introduces a randomized gossip algorithm for computing the empirical mean (4) in a context where nodes wake up asynchronously and simply average their local estimate with that of a randomly chosen neighbor. The communication probabilities are given by a stochastic matrix P , where pij is the probability that a node i selects neighbor j at a given iteration. As long as the network graph is connected and non-bipartite, the local estimates converge to (4) at a rate O(e−ct) where the constant c can be tied to the spectral gap of the network graph [4], showing faster convergence for well-connected networks.3 Such algorithms can be extended to compute other functions such as maxima and minima, or sums of the form ∑n i=1 f(Xi) for some function f : X → R (as done for instance in [16]). Some work has also gone into developing faster gossip algorithms for poorly connected networks, assuming that nodes know their (partial) geographic location [7, 14]. For a detailed account of the literature on gossip algorithms, we refer the reader to [19, 6].\nHowever, existing gossip algorithms cannot be used to efficiently compute (1) as it depends on pairs of observations. To the best of our knowledge, this problem has only been investigated in [18]. Their algorithm, coined U2-gossip, achieves O(1/t) convergence rate but has several drawbacks. First, each node must store two auxiliary observations, and two pairs of nodes must exchange an observation at each iteration. For high-dimensional problems (large d), this leads to a significant memory and communication load. Second, the algorithm is not asynchronous as every node must update its estimate at each iteration. Consequently, nodes must have access to a global clock, which is often unrealistic in practice. In the next section, we introduce new synchronous and asynchronous algorithms with faster convergence as well as smaller memory and communication cost per iteration."

      "text" : "In the synchronous setting, we assume that the nodes have access to a global clock so that they can all update their estimate at each time instance. We stress that the nodes need not to be aware of the global network topology as they will only interact with their direct neighbors in the graph.\nLet us denote by Zk(t) the (local) estimate of Ûn(H) by node k at iteration t. In order to propagate data across the network, each node k maintains an auxiliary observation Yk, initialized to Xk. Our algorithm, coined GoSta, goes as follows. At each iteration, each node k updates its local estimate by taking the running average of Zk(t) and H(Xk, Yk). Then, an edge of the network is drawn uniformly at random, and the corresponding pair of nodes average their local estimates and swap their auxiliary observations. The observations are thus each performing a random walk (albeit coupled) on the network graph. The full procedure is described in Algorithm 1.\nIn order to prove the convergence of Algorithm 1, we consider an equivalent reformulation of the problem which allows us to model the data propagation and the averaging steps separately. Specifically, for each k ∈ V , we define a phantom Gk = (Vk, Ek) of the original network G, with Vk = {vki ; 1 ≤ i ≤ n} and Ek = {(vki , vkj ); (i, j) ∈ E}. We then create a new graph G̃ = (Ṽ , Ẽ) where each node k ∈ V is connected to its counterpart vkk ∈ Vk:{\nṼ = V ∪ (∪nk=1Vk) Ẽ = E ∪ (∪nk=1Ek) ∪ {(k, vkk); k ∈ V }\nThe construction of G̃ is illustrated in Figure 1. In this new graph, the nodes V from the original network will hold the estimates Z1(t), . . . , Zn(t) as described above. The role of each Gk is to simulate the data propagation in the original graph G. For i ∈ [n], vki ∈ V k initially holds the value H(Xk, Xi). At each iteration, we draw a random edge (i, j) of G and nodes vki and v k j swap their value for all k ∈ [n]. To update its estimate, each node k will use the current value at vkk .\nWe can now represent the system state at iteration t by a vector S(t) = (S1(t)>,S2(t)>)> ∈ Rn+n2 . The first n coefficients, S1(t), are associated with nodes in V and correspond to the estimate vector Z(t) = [Z1(t), . . . , Zn(t)]>. The last n2 coefficients, S2(t), are associated with nodes in (Vk)1≤k≤n and represent the data propagation in the network. Their initial value is set to S2(0) = (e>1 H, . . . , e > nH) so that for any (k, l) ∈ [n]2, node vkl initially stores the value H(Xk, Xl).\nRemark 1. The “phantom network” G̃ is of size O(n2), but we stress the fact that it is used solely as a tool for the convergence analysis: Algorithm 1 operates on the original graph G.\nThe transition matrix of this system accounts for three events: the averaging step (the action of G on itself), the data propagation (the action of Gk on itself for all k ∈ V ) and the estimate update (the action of Gk on node k for all k ∈ V ). At a given step t > 0, we are interested in characterizing the transition matrix M(t) such that E[S(t + 1)] = M(t)E[S(t)]. For the sake of clarity, we write M(t) as an upper block-triangular (n+ n2)× (n+ n2) matrix:\nM(t) =\n( M1(t) M2(t)\n0 M3(t)\n) , (5)\nwith M1(t) ∈ Rn×n, M2(t) ∈ Rn×n 2 and M3(t) ∈ Rn 2×n2 . The bottom left part is necessarily 0, because G does not influence any Gk. The upper left M1(t) block corresponds to the averaging step; therefore, for any t > 0, we have:\nM1(t) = t− 1 t · 1 |E| ∑ (i,j)∈E ( In − 1 2 (ei − ej)(ei − ej)> ) = t− 1 t W2 (G) ,\nwhere for any α > 1, Wα(G) is defined by:\nWα(G) = 1 |E| ∑\n(i,j)∈E\n( In − 1\nα (ei − ej)(ei − ej)>\n) = In − 2\nα|E| L(G). (6)\nFurthermore, M2(t) and M3(t) are defined as follows:\nM2(t) = 1\nt  e>1 0 · · · 0 0 . . . ... ...\n. . . 0 0 · · · 0 e>n  ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nB\nand M3(t) =  W1 (G) 0 · · · 0 0 . . . ... ... . . . ...\n0 · · · 0 W1 (G)  ︸ ︷︷ ︸\nC\n,\nwhere M2(t) is a block diagonal matrix corresponding to the observations being propagated, and M3(t) represents the estimate update for each node k. Note that M3(t) = W1 (G)⊗ In where ⊗ is the Kronecker product.\nWe can now describe the expected state evolution. At iteration t = 0, one has: E[S(1)] = M(1)E[S(0)] = M(1)S(0) = (\n0 B 0 C\n)( 0\nS2(0)\n) = ( BS2(0) CS2(0) ) . (7)\nUsing recursion, we can write: E[S(t)] = M(t)M(t− 1) . . .M(1)S(0) = ( 1 t ∑t s=1W2 (G) t−s BCs−1S2(0)\nCtS2(0)\n) . (8)\nTherefore, in order to prove the convergence of Algorithm 1, one needs to show that limt→+∞ 1 t ∑t s=1W2 (G) t−s BCs−1S2(0) = Ûn(H)1n. We state this precisely in the next theorem. Theorem 1. Let G be a connected and non-bipartite graph with n nodes, X ∈ Rn×d a design matrix and (Z(t)) the sequence of estimates generated by Algorithm 1. For all k ∈ [n], we have:\nlim t→+∞\nE[Zk(t)] = 1\nn2 ∑ 1≤i,j≤n H(Xi, Xj) = Ûn(H). (9)\nMoreover, for any t > 0,∥∥∥E[Z(t)]− Ûn(H)1n∥∥∥ ≤ 1 ct ∥∥∥h− Ûn(H)1n∥∥∥+ ( 2 ct + e−ct )∥∥H− h1>n ∥∥ ,\nwhere c = c(G) := 1− λ2(2) and λ2(2) is the second largest eigenvalue of W2 (G).\nProof. See supplementary material.\nTheorem 1 shows that the local estimates generated by Algorithm 1 converge to Ûn(H) at a rate O(1/t). Furthermore, the constants reveal the rate dependency on the particular problem instance. Indeed, the two norm terms are data-dependent and quantify the difficulty of the estimation problem itself through a dispersion measure. In contrast, c(G) is a network-dependent term since 1−λ2(2) = βn−1/|E|, where βn−1 is the second smallest eigenvalue of the graph LaplacianL(G) (see Lemma 1 in the supplementary material). The value βn−1 is also known as the spectral gap of G and graphs with a larger spectral gap typically have better connectivity [4]. This will be illustrated in Section 5.\nComparison to U2-gossip. To estimate Ûn(H), U2-gossip [18] does not use averaging. Instead, each node k requires two auxiliary observations Y (1)k and Y (2) k which are both initialized to Xk. At each iteration, each node k updates its local estimate by taking the running average of Zk and H(Y\n(1) k , Y (2) k ). Then, two random edges are selected: the nodes connected by the first (resp. second) edge swap their first (resp. second) auxiliary observations. A precise statement of the algorithm is provided in the supplementary material. U2-gossip has several drawbacks compared to GoSta: it requires initiating communication between two pairs of nodes at each iteration, and the amount of communication and memory required is higher (especially when data is high-dimensional). Furthermore, applying our convergence analysis to U2-gossip, we obtain the following refined rate:4∥∥∥E[Z(t)]− Ûn(H)1n∥∥∥ ≤ √n\nt\n( 2\n1− λ2(1) ∥∥∥h− Ûn(H)1n∥∥∥+ 1 1− λ2(1)2 ∥∥H− h1>n ∥∥) , (10)\nwhere 1 − λ2(1) = 2(1 − λ2(2)) = 2c(G) and λ2(1) is the second largest eigenvalue of W1(G). The advantage of propagating two observations in U2-gossip is seen in the 1/(1 − λ2(1)2) term, however the absence of averaging leads to an overall √ n factor. Intuitively, this is because nodes do not benefit from each other’s estimates. In practice, λ2(2) and λ2(1) are close to 1 for reasonablysized networks (for instance, λ2(2) = 1 − 1/n for the complete graph), so the square term does not provide much gain and the √ n factor dominates in (10). We thus expect U2-gossip to converge slower than GoSta, which is confirmed by the numerical results presented in Section 5."

In this section, we remove the global clock assumption and propose a fully asynchronous algorithm where each node has a local clock, ticking at a rate 1 Poisson process. Yet, local clocks are i.i.d. so one can use an equivalent model with a global clock ticking at a rate n Poisson process and a random edge draw at each iteration, as in synchronous setting (one may refer to [2] for more details on clock modeling). However, at a given iteration, the estimate update step now only involves the selected pair of nodes. Therefore, the nodes need to maintain an estimate of the current iteration number to ensure convergence to an unbiased estimate of Ûn(H). Hence for all k ∈ [n], let pk ∈ [0, 1] denote the probability of node k being picked at any iteration. With our assumption that nodes activate with a uniform distribution over E, pk = 2dk/|E|. Moreover, the number of times a node k has been selected at a given iteration t > 0 follows a binomial distribution with parameters t and pk.

We compare the performance of our algorithms to that of U2-gossip [18] — see supplementary material for additional comparisons to some baseline methods. We perform our simulations on the three types of network described below (corresponding values of 1− λ2(2) are shown in Table 1). • Complete graph: This is the case where all nodes are connected to each other. It is the ideal situation in our framework, since any pair of nodes can communicate directly. For a complete graph G of size n > 0, 1− λ2(2) = 1/n, see [1, Ch.9] or [4, Ch.1] for details. • Two-dimensional grid: Here, nodes are located on a 2D grid, and each node is connected to its four neighbors on the grid. This network offers a regular graph with isotropic communication, but its diameter ( √ n) is quite high, especially in comparison to usual scale-free networks.\n• Watts-Strogatz: This random network generation technique is introduced in [21] and allows us to create networks with various communication properties. It relies on two parameters: the average degree of the network k and a rewiring probability p. In expectation, the higher the rewiring probability, the better the connectivity of the network. Here, we use k = 5 and p = 0.3 to achieve a connectivity compromise between the complete graph and the two-dimensional grid.\n4The proof can be found in the supplementary material.\nAUC measure. We first focus on the AUC measure of a linear classifier θ as defined in (3). We use the SMVguide3 binary classification dataset which contains n = 1260 points in d = 23 dimensions.5 We set θ to the difference between the class means. For each generated network, we perform 50 runs of GoSta-sync (Algorithm 1) and U2-gossip. The top row of Figure 2 shows the evolution over time of the average relative error and the associated standard deviation across nodes for both algorithms on each type of network. On average, GoSta-sync outperforms U2-gossip on every network. The variance of the estimates across nodes is also lower due to the averaging step. Interestingly, the performance gap between the two algorithms is greatly increasing early on, presumably because the exponential term in the convergence bound of GoSta-sync is significant in the first steps.\nWithin-cluster point scatter. We then turn to the within-cluster point scatter defined in (2). We use the Wine Quality dataset which contains n = 1599 points in d = 12 dimensions, with a total ofK = 11 classes.6 We focus on the partition P associated to class centroids and run the aforementioned methods 50 times. The results are shown in the bottom row of Figure 2. As in the case of AUC, GoSta-sync achieves better perfomance on all types of networks, both in terms of average error and variance. In Figure 3a, we show the average time needed to reach a 0.2 relative error on a complete graph ranging from n = 50 to n = 1599. As predicted by our analysis, the performance gap widens in favor of GoSta as the size of the graph increases. Finally, we compare the performance of GoSta-sync and GoSta-async (Algorithm 2) in Figure 3b. Despite the slightly worse theoretical convergence rate for GoSta-async, both algorithms have comparable performance in practice."

Therefore, for any pair of nodes (k, l) ∈ V 2 there exists an integer skl > 0 such that [A(G)skl ]kl > 0 so Wα(G) is irreducible. Also, G is non bipartite so similar reasoning can be used to show that Wα(G) is aperiodic.\nBy the Lattice Theorem (see [3, Th. 4.3, p.75]), for any 1 ≤ k, l ≤ n there exists an integer mkl such that, for any m ≥ mkl:\n[Wα(G) m]kl > 0.\nFinally, we can define m̄ = supk,lmkl and observe that Wα(G) m̄ > 0.\nLemma 3. Let G = (V,E) be a connected and non bipartite graph. Then for any α ≥ 1,\n1 = λ1(α) > λ2(α),\nwhere λ1(α) and λ2(α) are respectively the largest and the second largest eigenvalue of Wα(G).\nProof. Let α ≥ 1. The matrix Wα(G) is bistochastic, so λ1(α) = 1. By Lemma 2, Wα(G) is primitive. Therefore, by the Perron-Frobenius Theorem (see [3, Th. 1.1, p.197]), we can conclude that λ1(α) > λ2(α).\nAlgorithm 3 Gossip algorithm proposed in [2] to compute the standard mean (4) Require: Each node i holds observation Xi\n1: Each node initializes its estimator Zi ← Xi 2: for t = 1, 2, . . . do 3: Draw (i, j) uniformly at random from E 4: Set Zi, Zj ← Zi+Zj2 5: end for"

      "text" : "In this part, we provide a description and analysis of the randomized gossip algorithm proposed in [2] for the standard averaging problem (4). The procedure is shown in Algorithm 3 and goes as follows. For each node k ∈ [n], an estimator Zk(t) is initialized to the observation of the node Zk(0) = Xk. At each iteration t > 0, an edge (i, j) ∈ E is picked uniformly at random over E. Then, the corresponding nodes average their current estimators, while the others remain unchanged:\nZi(t) = Zj(t) = Zi(t− 1) + Zj(t− 1)\n2 . (17)\nThe evolution of estimates can be characterized using transition matrices. If an edge (i, j) ∈ E is picked at iteration t > 0, one can re-formulate (17) as:\nZ(t) = ( In − (ei − ej)(ei − ej)>\n2\n) Z(t− 1),\nwhere Z(t) = (Z1(t), . . . , Zn(t)) ∈ Rn is the (global) vector of mean estimates. The edges being drawn uniformly at random, the expected transition matrix is simply W2(G) with the notation introduced in (6). Then, for all t > 0, the expectation of the global estimate at iteration t is characterized recursively by:\nE[Z(t)] = W2(G)E[Z(t− 1)] = W2(G)tE[Z(0)] = W2(G)tX,\nwhere E stands for the expectation with respect to the edge sampling process.\nWe can now state a convergence result for Algorithm 3, rephrasing slightly the results from [2]. Theorem 3. Let us assume that G is connected and non bipartite. Then, for Z(t) defined in Algorithm 3, we have that for all k ∈ [n]:\nlim t→+∞\nE[Zk(t)] = X̄n,\nMoreover, for any t > 0,\n‖E[Z(t)]− X̄n1n‖ ≤ e−ct‖X− X̄n1n‖.\nwhere c = (1− λ2(2)) > 0, with λ2(2) the second largest eigenvalue of W2(G).\nProof. In order to prove the convergence of the estimates in expectation, one has to prove that W2 (G)X converges to the objective X̄n1n.\nRemark that W2 (G) is bi-stochastic. Let us denote as (λk(2))1≤k≤n and (φk)1≤k≤n respectively the eigenvalues (sorted in decreasing order) and the corresponding eigenvectors of W2 (G). Lemma 3 indicates that 1 = λ1(2) > λ2(2). Therefore, we only need to prove the second assertion since the first one is a direct consequence. Since W2 (G) is symmetric, we can pick eigenvectors that are orthonormal and select φ1 such that:\nφ1 = 1√ n 1n.\nLet us also define D2 = diag(λ1(2), . . . , λn(2)) and P = [φ1, . . . , φn]. Thus, we have:\nW2 (G) = PD2P >.\nLet us split D2 by defining Q2 ∈ Rn×n and R2 ∈ Rn×n such that:{ Q2 = diag(λ1(2), 0, . . . , 0) R2 = diag(0, λ2(2), . . . , λn(2))\nThen, for any t > 0, we can write: E[Z(t)] = W2 (G)tX = PDt2P>X = P ( Qt2 +R t 2 ) P>X = PQt2P >X + PRt2P >X.\nReminding λ1(2) = 1, the first term can be rewritten:\nPQt2P >X = φ1φ > 1 X =\n1\nn\n( 1>nX ) 1n,\nwhich corresponds to the objective X̄n1n. We write |||·||| the operator norm of a matrix. Since R21n = 0, one has for any t > 0,\n‖E[Z(t)]− X̄n1n‖ = ‖W2 (G)tX− X̄n1n‖ = ∥∥∥∥W2 (G)tX− 1n (1>nX)1n ∥∥∥∥ = ∥∥PRt2P>X∥∥ ≤ ∣∣∣∣∣∣PRt2P>∣∣∣∣∣∣ ‖X− X̄n1n‖\n≤ (λ2(2))t‖X− X̄n1n‖, and the result holds since 0 ≤ λ2(2) < 1."

      "text" : "C.1 Proof of Theorem 1 (Synchronous Setting)\nOur main goal is to characterize the behavior of S1(t), as it corresponds to the estimates Z(t). As for the standard gossip averaging, our proof relies on the study of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the transition matrix M(t).\nProof. By definition of M1(t), we have that\nM1(t) = t− 1 t W2 (G) = t− 1 t PD2P >.\nSimilarly, using the fact that C = W1 (G)⊗ In, we have that\nC = PcDcP > c ,\nwhere Pc = P ⊗ In, D = D1⊗ In and D1 = diag(λ1(1), . . . , λn(1)). The expected value of S1(t) can then be rewritten:\nE[S1(t)] = 1\nt t∑ s=1 W2 (G) t−s BCs−1S2(0) = 1 t P\n( t∑\ns=1\nDt−s2 P >BPcD s−1 c ) P>c S2(0). (18)\nOur objective is to extract the value Ûn(H) from the expression (18) by separating λ2(1) and λ1(1) from other eigenvalues. Let Qc = Q1 ⊗ In and Rc = R1 ⊗ In. We can now write E[S1(t)] = L1(t) + L2(t) + L3(t) + L4(t), where: L1(t) = 1 t ∑t s=1 PQ t−s 2 P >BPcQcP > c S2(0), L2(t) = 1 t ∑t s=1 PR t−s 2 P >BPcQcP > c S2(0), L3(t) = 1 t ∑t s=1 PQ t−s 2 P >BPcR s−1 c P > c S2(0),\nL4(t) = 1 t ∑t s=1 PR t−s 2 P >BPcR s−1 c P > c S2(0).\nWe will now show that for any t > 0, L1(t) is actually Ûn(H). We have:\nPQ2P > =\n1 n 1n1 > n .\nSimilarly, we have:\nPcQcP > c = (PQ1P >)⊗ In = 1\nn (1n1\n> n )⊗ In.\nFinally, we can write:\nL1(t) = PQ2P >BPcQcP > c S2(0) =\n1\nn2 1n1\n> nB ( (1n1 > n )⊗ In ) S2(0)\n= 1\nn2 1n1\n> n (1 > n ⊗ In)S2(0) =\n1\nn2 1n1\n> n2S2(0) = Ûn(H)1n.\nLet us now focus on the other terms.

By definition, for any t ≥ s > 0, PRt−s2 P>1n = 0.

Similarly, one has:\n‖L3(t)‖ ≤ 1 t · 1 1− λ2(1) ‖H− 1>nh‖,\nby definition of h and using PRcP>1n2 = 0. The final term can be upper bounded similarly to previous proofs:\n‖L4(t)‖ ≤ 1\nt t∑ s=1 ∥∥PRt−s2 P>BPcRscP>c S2(0)∥∥ ≤ 1 t t∑ s=1 ∥∥∥∥PRt−s2 P>BPcRscP>c (S2(0)− 1n1>nS2(0) )∥∥∥∥\n≤ 1 t\n( t∑\ns=1\n(λ2(2)) t−sλ2(1) s ) ‖H− 1>nh‖.\nLemma 1 indicates that λ2(2) > λ2(1), so\nL4(t) ≤ (λ2(2))t‖H− 1>nh‖. Using Lemma 1 and above inequalities, one can finally write:∥∥∥S1(t)− Ûn(H)1n∥∥∥ ≤ ‖L2(t)‖+ ‖L3(t)‖+ ‖L4(t)‖\n≤ c t ‖h− Ûn(H)1n‖+\n( 2\nct + e−ct\n) ‖H− 1>nh‖,\nwith c = 1− λ2(2).\nC.2 Proof of Theorem 2 (Asynchronous Setting)\nFor t > 0, let us denote as M(t) the expected transition matrix at iteration t. With the notation introduced in the synchronous setting, it yields(\nM1(t) M2(t) 0 C\n) .\nThe propagation step is unaltered w.r.t. the synchronous case, thus the bottom right block is unmodified. On the other hand, both the transmission step and the averaging step differ: only the selected nodes update their estimators from their associated phantom graph. Therefore, we have:\nM2(t) = 1 |E| ∑\n(i,j)∈E\nE  I{ 1∈(i,j) } 1 m1(t)p1 e>1 0 · · · 0 0 . . . ... ...\n. . . 0 0 · · · 0 I{ n∈(i,j) } 1 mn(t)pn e>n\n .\nFor any k ∈ [n] and t > 0, mk(t) is an unbiased estimator of t. Moreover, ∑ (i,j)∈E I{k∈(i,j)} = 2dk. Therefore, we can write:\nM2(t) = 1\nt|E|  2d1 p1 e>1 0 · · · 0 0 . . . ... ...\n. . . 0 0 · · · 0 2dnpn e > n\n = 1t  e>1 0 · · · 0 0 . . . ... ...\n. . . 0 0 · · · 0 e>n  = Bt .

For t > 0, we have:\nM1(t) = W2 (G)− 1\n2t\n( In +D −1(G)A(G) ) = W2 (G)− 1\nt In +\n1 2t D(G)−1L(G).\nSince M1(t)1n = ( 1 − 1t ) 1n, we have |||M1(t)||| ≥ 1 − 1t . Let us denote Sp ( L(G) ) = { β ∈\nR, ∃φ ∈ Rn, L(G)φ = βφ } . Let β ∈ Sp ( L(G) ) and φ ∈ Rn a corresponding eigenvector. One can write:\nM1(t)φ = ( W2 (G)− 1\nt In +\n1 2t D(G)L(G)−1\n) φ = ( 1− β |E| − 1 t ) φ+ β 2t D(G)−1φ\n= (( 1− 1\nt\n) In − β\n|E|\n( In − |E|D(G)−1\n2t\n)) φ.\nThe above matrix is diagonal, therefore we can write:\n‖M1(t)φ‖ ≤ max i\n( 1− 1\nt − β |E|\n( 1− |E|\n2dit\n)) ‖φ‖ = ( 1− 1\nt − β |E|\n( 1− 1\npt\n)) ‖φ‖,\nwhere p = mini 2di|E| is the minimum probability of a node being picked at any iteration. Thus, we can see that if β > 0, ‖M1(t)φ‖ < (1 − 1t )‖φ‖ if t < tc = 1 p . Consequently, if t ≥ tc then |||M1(t)||| = 1 − 1t . Here, tc represents the minimum number of iteration needed for every node to have been picked at least once, in expectation.\nLet (β1, . . . , βn) ∈ R and P = (φ1, . . . , φn) ∈ Rn×n be respectively the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of L(G) (sorted in decreasing order), such that P is the same matrix than the one introduced in Section B. We have:\nM1(t)P = PK(t) = P\n(( 1− 1\nt\n) In − 1\n|E|\n( In −\n|E| 2t P>D(G)−1P\n) DL(G) ) ,\nwhere DL(G) = diag(βn, . . . , β1). Let P1 = ( φ1, 0, . . . , 0 ) . The matrix K(t) can be rewritten as follows:\nK(t) = ( 1− 1\nt\n) In − 1\n|E|\n( In −\n|E| 2t P>D(G)−1P\n) DL(G) = ( 1− 1\nt\n) Q+ 1\nt U +R(t),\nwhere Q, U and R(t) are defined by: Q = diag(1, 0, . . . , 0), U = 12P > 1 D(G)\n−1PDL(G), R(t) = K(t)− ( 1− 1t ) Q− 1tU , for all t > 0.\nUsing the fact that βn = 0, one can show that U has the form 0 ∗ · · · ∗ 0\n0... 0  . Since M1(t)1n = ( 1− 1t ) 1n, we can also show that, for t > 0, R(t)e1 = 0n and e>1 R(t) = 0 > n .\nLet t > 0. We can write:\nM1(t+ 1)M1(t) = PK(t+ 1)K(t)P >\n= P\n( t\nt+ 1 Q+\n1\nt+ 1 U +R(t+ 1) )( t− 1 t Q+ 1 t U +R(t) ) P>\n= P ( t− 1 t+ 1 Q+ 1 t+ 1 U ( In +R(t) ) +R(t+ 1)R(t) ) P>.\nRecursively, we obtain, for t > s > 0:\nM1(t : s) = M1(t) . . .M1(s+ 1) = P\n( s\nt Q+\n1 t U t−1∑ r=s R(r : s) +R(t : s)\n) P>,\nwhere we use the convention R(t− 1 : t− 1) = In. Let us now write the expected value of the estimates:\nE[S1(t)] = t∑\ns=1\nM1(t : s) B\ns Cs−1S2(0)\n= t∑ s=1 M1(t : s) B s PcQcP > c S2(0) + t∑ s=1 M1(t : s) B s PcR s−1 c P > c S2(0)\n= t∑ s=1 M1(t : s) h s + t∑ s=1 M1(t : s) B s PcR s−1 c P > c S2(0).\nThe first term can be rewritten as: t∑\ns=1\nM1(t : s) h\ns = t∑ s=1 P\n( s\nt Q+\nU\nt t−1∑ r=s R(r : s) +R(t : s)\n) P> h\ns\n= 1\nt t∑ s=1 PQP>h + 1 t t∑ s=1 PU t−1∑ r=s R(r : s)P> h s + t∑ s=1 PR(t : s)P> h s\n= Ûn(H)1n + 1\nt t∑ s=1 PU t−1∑ r=s R(r : s)P> h s + t∑ s=1 PR(t : s)P> h s\n= Ûn(H)1n + L1(t) + L2(t).\nThe second term of the expected estimates can be rewritten as: t∑ s=1 M1(t : s) B s PcR s−1 c P > c S2(0) = t∑ s=1 P ( s t Q+ U t t−1∑ r=s R(r : s) +R(t : s) ) P> B s PcR s−1 c P > c S2(0)\n= L3(t) + L4(t) + L5(t).\nNow, we need to upper bound ‖Li(t)‖ for 1 ≤ i ≤ 5.

Here, for t > 1, µR(t) can be rewritten as follow:\nµR(t) = ( t− 1 t ) λ2(1) ( 1 + (1− λ2(1)) c t ) ,\nwith c = 1λ2(1)p − 1. If c < 1, one cas use a reasoning similar to the synchronous setting and conclude. However, c is often greater than 1. In this case, one has:\nµR(t) ≤ ( t− 1 t ) λ2(1) ( 1 + c t ) .\nFor t > s > 0, the product µR(t : s) can then be bounded as follow:\nµR(t : s) ≤ s\nt λ2(1)\nt−s (\n1 + c\nt− 1\n) . . .

Using the expression of E[Zk(t)] established in (19), one has:\nE[Zk(t)] = 1\nt t∑ s=0 e>kW1 (G) s HW1 (G) s ek = 1 t t∑ s=0 e>k P >Ds1PHPD s 1P >ek,\nwhere P is the eigenvectors matrix introduced in Section B and D1 = diag(λ1(1), . . . , λn(1)). Similarly to previous proofs, we split D1 = Q1 + P1 where Q1 = diag(1, 0, . . . , 0) and R1 = diag(0, λ2(1), . . . , λn(1)). Now, we can write E[Zk(t)] = L1(t) + L2(t) + L3(t) + L4(t) with L1(t), L2(t), L3(t) and L4(t) defined as follows: L1(t) = 1 t ∑t s=1 e > k P >Qs1PHPQ s 1P >ek L2(t) = 1 t ∑t s=1 e > k P >Rs1PHPQ s 1P >ek L3(t) = 1 t ∑t s=1 e > k P >Qs1PHPR s 1P >ek\nL4(t) = 1 t ∑t s=1 e > k P >Rs1PHPR s 1P >ek .\nThe first term can be rewritten:\nL1(t) = e > k P >Q1PHPQ1P >ek = 1\nn2 1>nH1n = Ûn(H).\nThen, one has:\n|L2(t)| ≤ 1\nt t∑ s=0 ‖e>k PRs1P>HPQ1P>ek‖ ≤ 1 t t∑ s=0 ‖PRs1P>h‖\n≤ 1 t t∑ s=0 (λ2(1)) s‖h− Ûn(H)1n‖ ≤ 1 t · 1 1− λ2(1) ‖h− Ûn(H)1n‖,\nsince λ2(1) < 1. Similarly, we have |L3(t)| ≤ 1t · λ2(1) 1−λ2(1)‖h − Ûn(H)1n‖. The final term L4(t) can be bounded as follow:\nL4(t) ≤ 1\nt t∑ s=0 ∣∣e>k PRs1P>HPQ1P>ek∣∣ = 1t t∑ s=0 ∣∣∣e>k PRs1P> (H− 1nh>)PQ1P>ek∣∣∣ ≤ 1 t t∑ s=0 (λ2(1)) 2s ∥∥∥H− 1nh>∥∥∥ ≤ 1 t · 1 1− (λ2(1))2 ∥∥∥H− 1nh>∥∥∥ .\nWith above relations, the expected difference can be bounded as follow:∣∣∣E[Zk(t)]− Ûn(H)∣∣∣ ≤ |L2(t)|+ |L3(t)|+ |L4(t)| ≤ 1 t · 2 1− λ2(1) ∥∥∥h− Ûn(H)1n∥∥∥+ 1 t · 1 1− (λ2(1))2 ∥∥∥H− 1nh>∥∥∥ .\nFinally, we can conclude:∥∥∥E[Z(t)]− Ûn(H)∥∥∥ ≤ √nmax k∈[n] ∣∣∣E[Zk(t)]− Ûn(H)∣∣∣ ≤ √ n\nt · 2 1− λ2(1) ∥∥∥h− Ûn(H)1n∥∥∥+ √n t · 1 1− (λ2(1))2 ∥∥∥H− 1nh>∥∥∥ ."

      "heading" : "E Comparison to Baseline Methods",
      "text" : "In this section, we use the within-cluster point scatter problem studied in Section 5 to compare our algorithms to two — more naive — baseline methods, described below.\nGossip-flooding baseline. This baseline uses the same communication scheme than GoSta-async (Algorithm 2) to flood observations across the network, but we assume that each node has enough memory to store all the observations it receives. At each iteration, each selected node picks a random observation among those it currently holds and send it to the other (tagged with the node which initially possessed it, to avoid storing duplicates). The local estimates are computed using the subset of observations available at each node (the averaging step is removed).\nFigure 4 shows the evolution over time of the average relative error and the associated standard deviation across nodes for this baseline and GoSta-async on the networks introduced in Section 5. On average, GoSta-async slightly outperforms Gossip-flooding, and this difference gets larger as the network connectivity decreases. The variance of the estimates across nodes is also lower for GoStaasync. This confirms the interest of averaging the estimates, and shows that assuming large memory at each node is not necessary to achieve good performance. Finally, note that updating the local estimate of a node is computationally much cheaper in GoSta-async (only one function evaluation) than in Gossip-flooding (as many function evaluations as there are observations on the node).\nMaster-node baseline. This baseline has access to a master nodeM which is connected to every other node in the network. Initially, at t = 0, each node i ∈ [n] sends its observation Xi to M. Then, at each iteration t ∈ [n],M sends observationXt to every node of the network. As in Gossipflooding, the estimates are computed using the subset of observations available at each node. The performance of this baseline does not depend on the original network, since communication goes through the master-nodeM. This allows us to compare our approach to the ideal scenario of a “star” network, where a central node can efficiently broadcast information to the entire network.\nFor a fair comparison with GoSta-async, we evaluate the methods with respect to the communication cost instead of the number of iterations. Figure 5 shows the evolution of the average relative error for this baseline and GoSta-async. We can see that the Master-node baseline performs better early on, but GoSta-async quickly catches up (the better the connectivity, the sooner). This shows that our data propagation and averaging mechanisms compensate well for the lack of central node."

    "abstractText" : "Efficient and robust algorithms for decentralized estimation in networks are essential to many distributed systems. Whereas distributed estimation of sample mean statistics has been the subject of a good deal of attention, computation of U statistics, relying on more expensive averaging over pairs of observations, is a less investigated area. Yet, such data functionals are essential to describe global properties of a statistical population, with important examples including Area Under the Curve, empirical variance, Gini mean difference and within-cluster point scatter. This paper proposes new synchronous and asynchronous randomized gossip algorithms which simultaneously propagate data across the network and maintain local estimates of the U -statistic of interest. We establish convergence rate bounds of O(1/t) and O(log t/t) for the synchronous and asynchronous cases respectively, where t is the number of iterations, with explicit data and network dependent terms. Beyond favorable comparisons in terms of rate analysis, numerical experiments provide empirical evidence the proposed algorithms surpasses the previously introduced approach.",
