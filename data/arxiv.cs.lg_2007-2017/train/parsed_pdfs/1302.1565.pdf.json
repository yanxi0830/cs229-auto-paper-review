Attempts to relax this assumption involve the use of expensive it­ erative methods to discriminate among dif­ ferent structures. This paper introduces a deterministic method to learn the graphical structure of a BBN from a possibly incomplete database. Experimental evaluations show a significant robustness of this method and a remarkable independence of its execution time from the number of missing data.",
