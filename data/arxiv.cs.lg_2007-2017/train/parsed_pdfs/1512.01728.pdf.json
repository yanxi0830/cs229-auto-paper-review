      "text" : "Learning pairwise similarity is important for machine learning tasks, e.g., classification (Guo and Ying 2014; Bellet, Habrard, and Sebban 2012), clustering (Yi et al. 2012; Xing et al. 2002), ranking (Chechik et al. 2010; Lim and Lanckriet 2014), etc. Distance metric learning (DML), which aims to learn the appropriate distance (i.e., similarity) for any given pair of instances, has been studied for decades and various methods have been proposed to estimate the similarity. Given the learned metric M , most of the DML methods compute the similarity in the form of Mahalanobis distance (Mahalanobis 1936): disM (xi,xj) =\nCopyright c© 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\n(xi−xj)⊤M(xi−xj), where M has to be the positive semidefinite (PSD) matrix. The PSD constraint guarantees that the similarity value is nonnegative and symmetric, which is the requirement for distance based classification (e.g., knearest neighbor) and clustering (e.g., k-means) methods.\nFor certain applications, however, the properties of nonnegativity and symmetry are not necessary. Ranking tasks, for example, only require to output a list of examples according to the query and hence the similarity value could be arbitrary (non metric). Additionally, the task of image retrieval is known to be non-symmetric according to human judgement (Tversky 1977). In this scenario, the similarity can be measured by the similarity function in bilinear form (Guo and Ying 2014; Chechik et al. 2010): SimM (xi,xj) = x ⊤ i Mxj , which computes the inner product between two examples. Without the PSD constraint as required in DML, the matrix M in the bilinear model can be non-symmetric and the cost of optimization decreases from O(d3) (i.e., PSD projection) to O(d2), where d is the dimensionality of data. We will adopt the bilinear model in this work.\nGiven the bilinear model, an appropriate similarity function can be learned over pairwise constraints. There are two challenges when applying it directly to large-scale image data. First, the number of constraints is quadratic in the number of images (i.e., n). Although most of existing DML methods apply stochastic strategy to access one pair at each iteration for efficiency, it is impossible for them to utilize all the pairs, when n is large (e.g., the cost is at least O(n2d2) and up to O(n3d3)), which introduces the risk of the suboptimal solution. Second, images tend to have high dimensional features to capture the image content. Since the size of M is d× d, it becomes difficult to store it when d is very large. Further, with large number of parameters, it is easy to encounter the overfitting issue.\nIn this paper, we attempt to learn a good similarity function by solving a matrix regression problem (Yi et al. 2012). Unlike the conventional matrix regression, the proposed method adaptively update the target metric at each iteration to mimic the hinge loss, which is more appropriate for real world applications. Besides, different from stochastic methods, the approach is deterministic and has the closed-form solution, which is very efficient for optimization and can obtain information from all pairs of data. To adapt it for large-\nscale high dimensional image retrieval, we further explore the randomized algorithm for data compressing and the low rank assumption. Our contributions can be summarised as follows.\n• We develop an adaptive strategy for updating the target matrix in regression, which is more flexible and appropriate for learning a similarity function with pairwise constraints.\n• To further improve the scalability for large-scale problem, we develop a randomized algorithm to compress the data without sacrificing the performance. Our theoretical analysis shows that if the dataset matrix is of low rank with rank rD ≪ min{n, d}, then only O(rD log(rD)) examples are sufficient to obtain a good similarity function, which is much better over the previous result (i.e., O(d2) (Drineas, Mahoney, and Muthukrishnan 2006)). It is important when the data matrix or the target matrix cannot be loaded into the memory.\n• To alleviate the high dimensional challenge, we take the low rank assumption (Weinberger and Saul 2009) that the rank of the optimal M is significantly smaller than the dimensionality of data (i.e., r ≪ d). Then, the low rank component of M can be optimized by an alternating method efficiently. Although the corresponding optimization problem is non-convex, the recent improvement in the alternating method shows that the solution is globally optimal with the geometric convergence rate (Jain, Netrapalli, and Sanghavi 2012).\nWe conduct empirical studies on real world image datasets; comparison with the state-of-the-art methods verify both the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method."

      "text" : "Many methods have been developed to estimate pairwise similarity. Some of them can be categorized as distance metric learning, where a distance metric is learned to increase the pairwise distance involving examples from different classes and reduce the pairwise distance involving examples from the same class. The representative methods include Xing’s method (Xing et al. 2002), POLA (ShalevShwartz, Singer, and Ng 2004), ITML (Davis et al. 2007), LMNN (Weinberger and Saul 2009), and FRML (Lim and Lanckriet 2014). ITML learns a metric according to the pairwise constraints, where the distance between pairs from the same class should be smaller than a pre-defined threshold and the distance between pairs from different classes should be larger than a second threshold. LMNN is developed with triplet constraints and a metric is learned to make sure that pairs from the same classes are separated from the pairs from different classes with a large margin. PSD constraint is adopted by these methods to make sure that the learned similarity matrix is symmetric and nonnegative. All of these DML methods have demonstrated some success in real applications. However, PSD projection is time consum-\ning while its property may be not necessary in certain applications."

      "text" : "Besides these DML methods, the bilinear model is developed for learning a similarity without the PSD constraint. Different from the similarity defined on the distance of two examples, the bilinear model computes the inner product of two examples by the learned similarity function. OASIS (Chechik et al. 2010) successfully applied it to the ranking problem, which requires that the more relevant examples have larger similarity and a hinge loss is adopted for a safety margin. The corresponding optimization problem is solved by an online learning method for large-scale image retrieval task. Compared with DML, the learned matrix is not symmetric, which offers more flexibility in real world applications. Although OASIS could handle millions of images, the computational cost is still O(d2) at each iteration. Moreover, online learning cannot enumerate all triplet constraints due to its huge number (i.e., O(n3)), which may lead to a suboptimal solution. In this paper, we propose a matrix regression model for large-scale high dimensional image retrieval task."

The final set contains 8, 677 examples with 1, 000 features. We randomly select 70% for training and the rest for testing. The experiments are repeated 5 times with different splits (of the same proportion between training and test sets) and average results with standard deviation are reported in Table 1.\nFirst, it is obvious that both distance based and similarity based methods outperforms the Euclidean distance. Second, we observe that methods using the bilinear model (i.e., OASIS and SLR) are better than the distance based method. This is because the bilinear model is more flexible for ranking. Second, the proposed method outperforms other methods significantly, which is because SLR can visit all pairs and hence no information is lost. Fig. 1 shows the examples of retrieved images. The metric learned by SLR can return the right images while the metrics of other methods make certain mistakes.\nTo demonstrate the advantage of adaptive regression, we compare SLR to the variant with the fixed target matrix as in Eqn. 2, which is denoted as “SLR-Fixed”. We also include the whole metric computed from the closed-form solution as in Eqn. 3, which is denoted as “SLR-Whole” for comparison, and the result is summarized in Fig. 2.

Moreover, we find that SLR-Fixed almost performs the same as SLR-Whole, and it confirms that the alternating method can achieve global optimal solution for the non-convex problem. Finally, SLR and SLR-Fixed converges to a good solution in only 2 iterations, which is consistent with the analysis of the alternating method.\nWe further conduct the experiments to illustrate the influence of data compressing. We denote SLR with Gaussian random projection and alternating target matrix (i.e., in Alg. 3) as “SLR-G-*” and column sampling as “SLR-C-*”.\nThe number ∗ denotes the dimension after compressing and results are shown in Fig. 3.

A similar phenomenon, as for Caltech101 can be observed, where SLR achieves the best ranking performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.\nTo further verify the efficiency of the proposed method,\nwe compare the run time of methods in the experiments shown in Table 3.

The similarity between pairs of images can be measured by the distances between their high dimensional representations, and the problem of learning the appropriate similarity is often addressed by distance metric learning. However, distance metric learning requires the learned metric to be a PSD matrix, which is computational expensive and not necessary for retrieval ranking problem. On the other hand, the bilinear model is shown to be more flexible for large-scale image retrieval task, hence, we adopt it to learn a matrix for estimating pairwise similarities under the regression framework. By adaptively updating the target matrix in regression, we can mimic the hinge loss, which is more appropriate for similarity learning problem. Although the regression problem can have the closed-form solution, the computational cost can be very expensive. The computational challenges come from two aspects: the number of images can be very large and image features have high dimensionality. We address the first challenge by compressing the data by a randomized algorithm with the theoretical guarantee. For the high dimensional issue, we address it by taking low rank assumption and applying alternating method to obtain the partial matrix, which has a global optimal solution. Empirical studies on real world image datasets (i.e., Caltech and ImageNet) demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.",
