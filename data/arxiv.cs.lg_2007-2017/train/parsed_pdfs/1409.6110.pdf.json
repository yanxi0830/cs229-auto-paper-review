      "text" : "The stochastic multi-armed bandit problem (MAB) [16] offers a simple formalization for the study of sequential design of experiments. In the standard model, a learner sequentially chooses an arm out of K and receives a reward drawn from a fixed, unknown distribution relative to the chosen arm. While most of the literature in bandit theory focused on the problem of maximization of cumulative rewards, where the learner needs to trade-off exploration and exploitation, recently the pure exploration setting [5] has gained a lot of attention. Here, the learner uses the available budget to identify as accurately as possible the best arm, without trying to maximize the sum of rewards. Although many results are by now available in a wide range of settings (e.g., best-arm identification with fixed budget [2, 11] and fixed confidence [7], subset selection [6, 12], and multi-bandit [9]), most of the work considered only the multi-armed setting, with K independent arms.\nAn interesting variant of the MAB setup is the stochastic linear bandit problem (LB), introduced in [3]. In the LB setting, the input space X is a subset of Rd and when pulling an arm x, the learner observes a reward whose expected value is a linear combination of x and an unknown parameter θ∗ ∈ Rd. Due to the linear structure of the problem, pulling an arm gives information about the parameter θ∗ and indirectly, about the value of other arms. Therefore, the estimation of K meanrewards is replaced by the estimation of the d features of θ∗. While in the exploration-exploitation setting the LB has been widely studied both in theory and in practice (e.g., [1, 14]), in this paper we focus on the pure-exploration scenario.\nThe fundamental difference between the MAB and the LB best-arm identification strategies stems from the fact that in MAB an arm is no longer pulled as soon as its sub-optimality is evident (in high probability), while in the LB setting even a sub-optimal arm may offer valuable information about the parameter vector θ∗ and thus improve the accuracy of the estimation in discriminating among near-optimal arms. For instance, consider the situation when K−2 out of K arms are already discarded. In order to identify the best arm, MAB algorithms would concentrate the sampling on the two remaining arms to increase the accuracy of the estimate of their mean-rewards until the discarding condition is met for one of them. On the contrary, a LB pure-exploration strategy would seek to pull the arm x ∈ X whose observed reward allows to refine the estimate θ∗ along the dimensions which are more suited in discriminating between the two remaining arms. Recently, the best-arm identification in linear bandits has been studied in a fixed budget setting [10], in this paper we study the sample complexity required to identify the best-linear arm with a fixed confidence.\n∗This work was done when the author was a visiting researcher at Microsoft Research New-England. †Current affiliation: Google DeepMind."

      "text" : "The setting. We consider the standard linear bandit model. Let X ⊆ Rd be a finite set of arms, where |X | = K and the ℓ2-norm of any arm x ∈ X , denoted by ||x||, is upper-bounded by L. Given an unknown parameter θ∗ ∈ Rd, we assume that each time an arm x ∈ X is pulled, a random reward r(x) is generated according to the linear model r(x) = x⊤θ∗ + ε, where ε is a zero-mean i.i.d. noise bounded in [−σ;σ]. Arms are evaluated according to their expected reward x⊤θ∗ and we denote by x∗ = argmaxx∈X x⊤θ∗ the best arm in X . Also, we use Π(θ) = argmaxx∈X x⊤θ to refer to the best arm corresponding to an arbitrary parameter θ. Let ∆(x, x′) = (x − x′)⊤θ∗ be the value gap between two arms, then we denote by ∆(x) = ∆(x∗, x) the gap of x w.r.t. the optimal arm and by ∆min = minx∈X ∆(x) the minimum gap, where ∆min > 0. We also introduce the sets Y = {y = x − x′, ∀x, x′ ∈ X} and Y∗ = {y = x∗ − x, ∀x ∈ X} containing all the directions obtained as the difference of two arms (or an arm and the optimal arm) and we redefine accordingly the gap of a direction as ∆(y) = ∆(x, x′) whenever y = x− x′. The problem. We study the best-arm identification problem. Let x̂(n) be the estimated best arm returned by a bandit algorithm after n steps. We evaluate the quality of x̂(n) by the simple regret Rn = (x\n∗ − x̂(n))⊤θ∗. While different settings can be defined (see [8] for an overview), here we focus on the (ǫ, δ)-best-arm identification problem (the so-called PAC setting), where given ǫ and δ ∈ (0, 1), the objective is to design an allocation strategy and a stopping criterion so that when the algorithm stops, the returned arm x̂(n) is such that P ( Rn ≥ ǫ ) ≤ δ, while minimizing the needed number of steps. More specifically, we will focus on the case of ǫ = 0 and we will provide high-probability bounds on the sample complexity n.\nThe multi-armed bandit case. In MAB, the complexity of best-arm identification is characterized by the gaps between arm values, following the intuition that the more similar the arms, the more pulls are needed to distinguish between them. More formally, the complexity is given by the problemdependent quantity HMAB = ∑K i=1\n1 ∆2i i.e., the inverse of the pairwise gaps between the best arm and the suboptimal arms. In the fixed budget case, HMAB determines the probability of returning the wrong arm [2], while in the fixed confidence case, it characterizes the sample complexity [7].\nTechnical tools. Unlike in the multi-arm bandit scenario where pulling one arm does not provide any information about other arms, in a linear model we can leverage the rewards observed over time to estimate the expected reward of all the arms in X . Let xn = (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ Xn be a sequence of arms and (r1, . . . , rn) the corresponding observed (random) rewards. An unbiased estimate of θ∗ can be obtained by ordinary least-squares (OLS) as θ̂n = A−1xn bxn , where Axn = ∑n t=1 xtx ⊤ t ∈ R d×d and bxn = ∑n t=1 xtrt ∈ Rd. For any fixed sequence xn, through Azuma’s inequality, the prediction error of the OLS estimate is upper-bounded in high-probability as follows. Proposition 1. Let c = 2σ √ 2 and c′ = 6/π2. For every fixed sequence xn, we have1\nP ( ∀n ∈ N, ∀x ∈ X , ∣∣x⊤θ∗ − x⊤θ̂n ∣∣ ≤ c||x||A−1\nxn\n√ log(c′n2K/δ) ) ≥ 1− δ. (1)\nWhile in the previous statement xn is fixed, a bandit algorithm adapts the allocation in response to the rewards observed over time. In this case a different high-probability bound is needed.\nProposition 2 (Thm. 2 in [1]). Let θ̂ηn be the solution to the regularized least-squares problem with regularizer η and let Ãη\nx = ηId + Ax. Then for all x ∈ X and every adaptive sequence xn such\nthat at any step t, xt only depends on (x1, r1, . . . , xt−1, rt−1), w.p. 1− δ, we have ∣∣x⊤θ∗ − x⊤θ̂ηn ∣∣ ≤ ||x||(Ãη xn ) −1 ( σ √ d log (1 + nL2/η δ ) + η1/2||θ∗|| ) . (2) The crucial difference w.r.t. Eq. 1 is an additional factor √ d, the price to pay for adapting xn to the samples. In the sequel we will often resort to the notion of design (or “soft” allocation) λ ∈ Dk, which prescribes the proportions of pulls to arm x and Dk denotes the simplex X . The counterpart of the design matrix A for a design λ is the matrix Λλ = ∑ x∈X λ(x)xx\n⊤ . From an allocation xn we can derive the corresponding design λxn as λxn(x) = Tn(x)/n, where Tn(x) is the number of times arm x is selected in xn, and the corresponding design matrix is Axn = nΛλxn .\n1Whenever Prop.1 is used for all directions y ∈ Y , then the logarithmic term becomes log(c′n2K2/δ) because of an additional union bound. For the sake of simplicity, in the sequel we always use logn(K 2/δ).\n3 The Complexity of the Linear Best-Arm Identification Problem\nAs reviewed in Sect. 2, in the MAB case the complexity of the best-arm identification task is characterized by the reward gaps between the optimal and suboptimal arms. In this section, we propose an extension of the notion of complexity to the case of linear best-arm identification. In particular, we characterize the complexity by the performance of an oracle with access to the parameter θ∗.\nStopping condition. Let C(x)= {θ ∈ Rd, x ∈ Π(θ)} be the set of parameters θ which admit x as an optimal arm. As illustrated in Fig. 1, C(x) is the cone defined by the intersection of half-spaces such that C(x) = ∩x′∈X {θ ∈ R\nd, (x − x′)⊤θ ≥ 0} and all the cones together form a partition of the Euclidean space Rd. We assume that the oracle knows the cone C(x∗) containing all the parameters for which x∗ is optimal. Furthermore, we assume\nthat for any allocation xn, it is possible to construct a confidence set S∗(xn) ⊆ Rd such that θ∗ ∈ S∗(xn) and the (random) OLS estimate θ̂n belongs to S∗(xn) with high probability, i.e., P ( θ̂n ∈ S∗(xn) ) ≥ 1 − δ. As a result, the oracle stopping criterion simply checks whether the confidence set S∗(xn) is contained in C(x∗) or not. In fact, whenever for an allocation xn the set S∗(xn) overlaps the cones of different arms x ∈ X , there is ambiguity in the identity of the arm Π(θ̂n). On the other hand when all possible values of θ̂n are included with high probability in the “right” cone C(x∗), then the optimal arm is returned. Lemma 1. Let xn be an allocation such that S∗(xn) ⊆ C(x∗). Then P ( Π(θ̂n) 6= x∗ ) ≤ δ.\nArm selection strategy. From the previous lemma2 it follows that the objective of an arm selection strategy is to define an allocation xn which leads to S∗(xn) ⊆ C(x∗) as quickly as possible.3 Since this condition only depends on deterministic objects (S∗(xn) and C(x∗)), it can be computed independently from the actual reward realizations. From a geometrical point of view, this corresponds to choosing arms so that the confidence set S∗(xn) shrinks into the optimal cone C(x∗) within the smallest number of pulls. To characterize this strategy we need to make explicit the form of S∗(xn). Intuitively speaking, the more S∗(xn) is “aligned” with the boundaries of the cone, the easier it is to shrink it into the cone. More formally, the condition S∗(xn) ⊆ C(x∗) is equivalent to\n∀x ∈ X , ∀θ ∈ S∗(xn), (x∗ − x)⊤θ ≥ 0 ⇔ ∀y ∈ Y∗, ∀θ ∈ S∗(xn), y⊤(θ∗ − θ) ≤ ∆(y).\nThen we can simply use Prop. 1 to directly control the term y⊤(θ∗ − θ) and define\nS∗(xn) = { θ ∈ Rd, ∀y ∈ Y∗, y⊤(θ∗ − θ) ≤ c||y||A−1xn √ logn(K 2/δ) } . (3)\nThus the stopping condition S∗(xn) ⊆ C(x∗) is equivalent to the condition that, for any y ∈ Y∗,\nc||y||A−1 xn\n√ logn(K 2/δ) ≤ ∆(y). (4)\nFrom this condition, the oracle allocation strategy simply follows as\nx ∗ n = argmin\nxn max y∈Y∗\nc||y||A−1xn √ logn(K 2/δ)\n∆(y) = argmin xn max y∈Y∗ ||y||A−1xn ∆(y) . (5)\nNotice that this strategy does not return an uniformly accurate estimate of θ∗ but it rather pulls arms that allow to reduce the uncertainty of the estimation of θ∗ over the directions of interest (i.e., Y∗) below their corresponding gaps. This implies that the objective of Eq. 5 is to exploit the global linear assumption by pulling any arm in X that could give information about θ∗ over the directions in Y∗, so that directions with small gaps are better estimated than those with bigger gaps.\n2For all the proofs in this paper, we refer the reader to the long version of the paper [18]. 3Notice that by definition of the confidence set and since θn → θ∗ as n → ∞, any strategy repeatedly\npulling all the arms would eventually meet the stopping condition.\nSample complexity. We are now ready to define the sample complexity of the oracle, which corresponds to the minimum number of steps needed by the allocation in Eq. 5 to achieve the stopping condition in Eq. 4. From a technical point of view, it is more convenient to express the complexity of the problem in terms of the optimal design (soft allocation) instead of the discrete allocation xn. Let ρ∗(λ) = maxy∈Y∗ ||y||2Λ−1\nλ\n/∆2(y) be the square of the objective function in Eq. 5 for any design\nλ ∈ Dk. We define the complexity of a linear best-arm identification problem as the performance achieved by the optimal design λ∗ = argminλ ρ∗(λ), i.e.\nHLB = min λ∈Dk max y∈Y∗\n||y||2 Λ−1\nλ ∆2(y) = ρ∗(λ∗). (6)\nThis definition of complexity is less explicit than in the case of HMAB but it contains similar elements, notably the inverse of the gaps squared. Nonetheless, instead of summing the inverses over all the arms, HLB implicitly takes into consideration the correlation between the arms in the term ||y||2\nΛ−1 λ\n, which represents the uncertainty in the estimation of the gap between x∗ and x (when\ny = x∗ − x). As a result, from Eq. 4 the sample complexity becomes N∗ = c2HLB logn(K\n2/δ), (7) where we use the fact that, if implemented over n steps, λ∗ induces a design matrix Aλ∗ = nΛλ∗ and maxy ||y||2A−1\nλ∗\n/∆2(y) = ρ∗(λ∗)/n. Finally, we bound the range of the complexity.\nLemma 2. Given an arm set X ⊆ Rd and a parameter θ∗, the complexity HLB (Eq. 6) is such that max y∈Y∗\n||y||2/(L∆2min) ≤ HLB ≤ 4d/∆2min. (8) Furthermore, if X is the canonical basis, the problem reduces to a MAB and HMAB≤HLB≤2HMAB. The previous bounds show that ∆min plays a significant role in defining the complexity of the problem, while the specific shape of X impacts the numerator in different ways. In the worst case the full dimensionality d appears (upper-bound), and more arm-set specific quantities, such as the norm of the arms L and of the directions Y∗, appear in the lower-bound.\n4 Static Allocation Strategies\nThe oracle stopping condition (Eq. 4) and allocation strategy (Eq. 5) cannot be implemented in practice since θ∗, the gaps ∆(y), and the directions Y∗ are unknown. In this section we investigate how to define algorithms that only rely on the information available from X and the samples collected over time. We introduce an empirical stopping criterion and two static allocations.\nEmpirical stopping criterion. The stopping condition S∗(xn) ⊆ C(x∗) cannot be tested since S∗(xn) is centered in the unknown parameter θ∗ and C(x∗) depends on the unknown optimal arm x∗. Nonetheless, we notice that given X , for each\nx ∈ X the cones C(x) can be constructed beforehand. Let Ŝ(xn) be a high-probability confidence set such that for any xn, θ̂n ∈ Ŝ(xn) and P(θ∗ ∈ Ŝ(xn)) ≥ 1 − δ. Unlike S∗, Ŝ can be directly computed from samples and we can stop whenever there exists an x such that Ŝ(xn) ⊆ C(x). Lemma 3. Let xn = (x1, . . . , xn) be an arbitrary allocation sequence. If after n steps there exists an arm x ∈ X such that Ŝ(xn) ⊆ C(x) then P ( Π(θ̂n) 6= x∗ ) ≤ δ.\nArm selection strategy. Similarly to the oracle algorithm, we should design an allocation strategy that guarantees that the (random) confidence set Ŝ(xn) shrinks in one of the cones C(x) within the fewest number of steps. Let ∆̂n(x, x′) = (x − x′)⊤θ̂n be the empirical gap between arms x, x′. Then the stopping condition Ŝ(xn) ⊆ C(x) can be written as\n∃x ∈ X , ∀x′ ∈ X ,∀θ ∈ Ŝ(xn), (x− x′)⊤θ ≥ 0 ⇔ ∃x ∈ X , ∀x′ ∈ X , ∀θ ∈ Ŝ(xn), (x − x′)⊤(θ̂n − θ) ≤ ∆̂n(x, x′). (9)\nThis suggests that the empirical confidence set can be defined as\nŜ(xn) = { θ ∈ Rd, ∀y ∈ Y, y⊤(θ̂n − θ) ≤ c||y||A−1\nxn\n√ logn(K 2/δ) } . (10)\nUnlike S∗(xn), Ŝ(xn) is centered in θ̂n and it considers all directions y ∈ Y . As a result, the stopping condition in Eq. 9 could be reformulated as\n∃x ∈ X , ∀x′ ∈ X , c||x− x′||A−1 xn\n√ logn(K\n2/δ) ≤ ∆̂n(x, x′). (11) Although similar to Eq. 4, unfortunately this condition cannot be directly used to derive an allocation strategy. In fact, it is considerably more difficult to define a suitable allocation strategy to fit a random confidence set Ŝ into a cone C(x) for an x which is not known in advance. In the following we propose two allocations that try to achieve the condition in Eq. 11 as fast as possible by implementing a static arm selection strategy, while we present a more sophisticated adaptive strategy in Sect. 5. The general structure of the static allocations in summarized in Fig. 2.\nG-Allocation Strategy. The definition of the G-allocation strategy directly follows from the observation that for any pair (x, x′) ∈ X 2 we have that ||x − x′||A−1 xn ≤ 2maxx′′∈X ||x′′||A−1 xn . This suggests that an allocation minimizing maxx∈X ||x||A−1 xn\nreduces an upper bound on the quantity tested in the stopping condition in Eq. 11. Thus, for any fixed n, we define the G-allocation as\nx G n = argmin\nxn\nmax x∈X ||x||A−1xn . (12)\nWe notice that this formulation coincides with the standard G-optimal design (hence the name of the allocation) defined in experimental design theory [15, Sect. 9.2] to minimize the maximal meansquared prediction error in linear regression. The G-allocation can be interpreted as the design that allows to estimate θ∗ uniformly well over all the arms in X . Notice that the G-allocation in Eq. 12 is well defined only for a fixed number of steps n and it cannot be directly implemented in our case, since n is unknown in advance. Therefore we have to resort to a more “incremental” implementation. In the experimental design literature a wide number of approximate solutions have been proposed to solve the NP-hard discrete optimization problem in Eq. 12 (see [4, 17] for some recent results and [18] for a more thorough discussion). For any approximate G-allocation strategy with performance no worse than a factor (1+β) of the optimal strategy xGn , the sample complexity N\nG is bounded as follows. Theorem 1. If the G-allocation strategy is implemented with a β-approximate method and the stopping condition in Eq. 11 is used, then\nP [ NG ≤ 16c 2d(1 + β) logn(K 2/δ)\n∆2min ∧ Π(θ̂NG) = x∗\n] ≥ 1− δ. (13)\nNotice that this result matches (up to constants) the worst-case value of N∗ given the upper bound on HLB. This means that, although completely static, the G-allocation is already worst-case optimal.\nXY-Allocation Strategy. Despite being worst-case optimal, G-allocation is minimizing a rather loose upper bound on the quantity used to test the stopping criterion. Thus, we define an alternative static allocation that targets the stopping condition in Eq. 11 more directly by reducing its left-handside for any possible direction in Y . For any fixed n, we define the XY-allocation as\nx XY n = argmin\nxn\nmax y∈Y ||y||A−1 xn . (14)\nXY-allocation is based on the observation that the stopping condition in Eq. 11 requires only the empirical gaps ∆̂(x, x′) to be well estimated, hence arms are pulled with the objective of increasing the accuracy of directions in Y instead of arms X . This problem can be seen as a transductive variant of the G-optimal design [19], where the target vectors Y are different from the vectors X used in the design. The sample complexity of the XY-allocation is as follows. Theorem 2. If the XY-allocation strategy is implemented with a β-approximate method and the stopping condition in Eq. 11 is used, then\nP [ NXY ≤ 32c 2d(1 + β) logn(K 2/δ)\n∆2min ∧ Π(θ̂NXY ) = x∗\n] ≥ 1− δ. (15)\nAlthough the previous bound suggests that XY achieves a performance comparable to the Gallocation, in fact XY may be arbitrarily better than G-allocation (for an example, see [18]).\n5 XY-Adaptive Allocation Strategy\nInput: decision space X ∈Rd; parameter α; confidence δ Set j=1; X̂j=X ; Ŷ1=Y; ρ0=1; n0=d(d+ 1) + 1 while |X̂j | > 1 do ρj = ρj−1\nt = 1;A0 = I while ρj/t ≥ αρj−1(xj−1nj−1)/nj−1 do\nSelect arm xt = argmin x∈X max y∈Y\ny⊤(A+ xx⊤)−1y\nUpdate At = At−1 + xtx⊤t , t = t+ 1 ρj = max\ny∈Ŷj y⊤A−1t y\nend while Compute b = ∑t s=1 xsrs; θ̂j = A −1 t b X̂j+1 = X for x ∈ X do\nif ∃x′ : ||x − x′|| A −1\nt\n√ logn(K 2/δ) ≤ ∆̂j(x ′, x) then\nX̂j+1 = X̂j+1 − {x} end if\nend for Ŷj+1 = {y = (x− x\n′);x, x′ ∈ X̂j+1} end while Return Π(θ̂j)\nFigure 3: XY-Adaptive allocation algorithm\nFully adaptive allocation strategies. Although both G- and XY-allocation are sound since they minimize upper-bounds on the quantities used by the stopping condition (Eq. 11), they may be very suboptimal w.r.t. the ideal performance of the oracle introduced in Sec. 3. Typically, an improvement can be obtained by moving to strategies adapting on the rewards observed over time. Nonetheless, as reported in Prop. 2, whenever xn is not a fixed sequence, the bound in Eq. 2 should be used. As a result, a factor √ d would appear in the definition of the confidence sets and in the stopping condition. This directly implies that the sample complexity of a fully adaptive strategy would scale linearly with the dimensionality d of the problem, thus removing any advantage w.r.t. static allocations. In fact, the sample complexity of G- and XYallocation already scales linearly with d and from Lem. 2 we cannot expect to im-\nprove the dependency on ∆min. Thus, on the one hand, we need to use the tighter bounds in Eq. 1 and, on the other hand, we require to be adaptive w.r.t. samples. In the sequel we propose a phased algorithm which successfully meets both requirements using a static allocation within each phase but choosing the type of allocation depending on the samples observed in previous phases.\nAlgorithm. The ideal case would be to define an empirical version of the oracle allocation in Eq. 5 so as to adjust the accuracy of the prediction only on the directions of interest Y∗ and according to their gaps ∆(y). As discussed in Sect. 4 this cannot be obtained by a direct adaptation of Eq. 11. In the following, we describe a safe alternative to adjust the allocation strategy to the gaps.\nLemma 4. Let xn be a fixed allocation sequence and θ̂n its corresponding estimate for θ∗. If an arm x ∈ X is such that\n∃x′ ∈ X s.t. c||x′ − x||A−1xn √ logn(K 2/δ) < ∆̂n(x ′, x), (16)\nthen arm x is sub-optimal. Moreover, if Eq. 16 is true, we say that x′ dominates x.\nLem. 4 allows to easily construct the set of potentially optimal arms, denoted X̂ (xn), by removing from X all the dominated arms. As a result, we can replace the stopping condition in Eq. 11, by just testing whether the number of non-dominated arms |X̂ (xn)| is equal to 1, which corresponds to the case where the confidence set is fully contained into a single cone. Using X̂ (xn), we construct Ŷ(xn) = {y = x−x′;x, x′ ∈ X̂ (xn)}, the set of directions along which the estimation of θ∗ needs to be improved to further shrink Ŝ(xn) into a single cone and trigger the stopping condition. Note that if xn was an adaptive strategy, then we could not use Lem. 4 to discard arms but we should rely on the bound in Prop. 2. To avoid this problem, an effective solution is to run the algorithm through phases. Let j ∈ N be the index of a phase and nj its corresponding length. We denote by X̂j the set of non-dominated arms constructed on the basis of the samples collected in the phase j − 1. This set is used to identify the directions Ŷj and to define a static allocation which focuses on reducing the uncertainty of θ∗ along the directions in Ŷj . Formally, in phase j we implement the allocation\nx j nj = argmin\nxnj max y∈Ŷj ||y||A−1 xnj , (17)\nwhich coincides with a XY-allocation (see Eq. 14) but restricted on Ŷj . Notice that xjnj may still use any arm in X which could be useful in reducing the confidence set along any of the directions in\nŶj . Once phase j is over, the OLS estimate θ̂j is computed using the rewards observed within phase j and then is used to test the stopping condition in Eq. 11. Whenever the stopping condition does not hold, a new set X̂j+1 is constructed using the discarding condition in Lem. 4 and a new phase is started. Notice that through this process, at each phase j, the allocation xjnj is static conditioned on the previous allocations and the use of the bound from Prop. 1 is still correct.\nA crucial aspect of this algorithm is the length of the phases nj . On the one hand, short phases allow a high rate of adaptivity, since X̂j is recomputed very often. On the other hand, if a phase is too short, it is very unlikely that the estimate θ̂j may be accurate enough to actually discard any arm. An effective way to define the length of a phase in a deterministic way is to relate it to the actual uncertainty of the allocation in estimating the value of all the active directions in Ŷj . In phase j, let ρj(λ) = maxy∈Ŷj ||y|| 2 Λ−1\nλ\n, then given a parameter α ∈ (0, 1), we define\nnj = min { n ∈ N : ρj(λ\nx j n )/n ≤ αρj−1(λj−1)/nj−1\n} , (18)\nwhere xjn is the allocation defined in Eq. 17 and λ j−1 is the design corresponding to xj−1nj−1 , the allocation performed at phase j − 1. In words, nj is the minimum number of steps needed by the XY-adaptive allocation to achieve an uncertainty over all the directions of interest which is a fraction α of the performance obtained in the previous iteration. Notice that given Ŷj and ρj−1 this quantity can be computed before the actual beginning of phase j. The resulting algorithm using the XY-Adaptive allocation strategy is summarized in Fig. 3. Sample complexity. Although the XY-Adaptive allocation strategy is designed to approach the oracle sample complexity N∗, in early phases it basically implements a XY-allocation and no significant improvement can be expected until some directions are discarded from Ŷ . At that point, XY-adaptive starts focusing on directions which only contain near-optimal arms and it starts approaching the behavior of the oracle. As a result, in studying the sample complexity of XY-Adaptive we have to take into consideration the unavoidable price of discarding “suboptimal” directions. This cost is directly related to the geometry of the arm space that influences the number of samples needed before arms can be discarded from X . To take into account this problem-dependent quantity, we introduce a slightly relaxed definition of complexity. More precisely, we define the number of steps needed to discard all the directions which do not contain x∗, i.e. Y − Y∗. From a geometrical point of view, this corresponds to the case when for any pair of suboptimal arms (x, x′), the confidence set S∗(xn) does not intersect the hyperplane separating the cones C(x) and C(x′). Fig. 1 offers a simple illustration for such a situation: S∗ no longer intercepts the border line between C(x2) and C(x3), which implies that direction x2 − x3 can be discarded. More formally, the hyperplane containing parameters θ for which x and x′ are equivalent is simply C(x) ∩ C(x′) and the quantity\nM∗ = min{n ∈ N, ∀x 6= x∗, ∀x′ 6= x∗,S∗(xXYn ) ∩ (C(x) ∩ C(x′)) = ∅} (19) corresponds to the minimum number of steps needed by the static XY-allocation strategy to discard all the suboptimal directions. This term together with the oracle complexity N∗ characterizes the sample complexity of the phases of the XY-adaptive allocation. In fact, the length of the phases is such that either they correspond to the complexity of the oracle or they can never last more than the steps needed to discard all the sub-optimal directions. As a result, the overall sample complexity of the XY-adaptive algorithm is bounded as in the following theorem. Theorem 3. If the XY-Adaptive allocation strategy is implemented with a β-approximate method and the stopping condition in Eq. 11 is used, then\nP [ N ≤ (1 + β)max{M ∗, 16α N ∗}\nlog(1/α) log\n(c √ logn(K 2/δ)\n∆min\n) ∧ Π(θ̂N ) = x∗ ] ≥ 1− δ. (20)\nWe first remark that, unlike G and XY , the sample complexity of XY-Adaptive does not have any direct dependency on d and ∆min (except in the logarithmic term) but it rather scales with the oracle complexity N∗ and the cost of discarding suboptimal directions M∗. Although this additional cost is probably unavoidable, one may have expected that XY-Adaptive may need to discard all the suboptimal directions before performing as well as the oracle, thus having a sample complexity of O(M∗+N∗). Instead, we notice that N scales with the maximum of M∗ and N∗, thus implying that XY-Adaptive may actually catch up with the performance of the oracle (with only a multiplicative factor of 16/α) whenever discarding suboptimal directions is less expensive than actually identifying the best arm."

For a fixed confidence δ = 0.05, we compare the sampling budget needed to identify the best arm with probability at least 1 − δ. We consider a set of arms X ∈ Rd, with |X | = d+ 1 including the canonical basis (e1, . . . , ed) and an additional arm xd+1 = [cos(ω) sin(ω) 0 . . . 0]\n⊤. We choose θ∗ = [2 0 0 . . . 0]⊤, and fix ω = 0.01, so that ∆min = (x1 − xd+1)⊤θ∗ is much smaller than the other gaps. In this setting, an efficient sampling strategy should focus on reducing the uncertainty in the direction ỹ = (x1 − xd+1) by pulling the arm x2 = e2 which is almost aligned with ỹ. In fact, from the rewards obtained from x2 it is easier to decrease the uncertainty about the second component of θ∗, that is precisely the dimension which allows to discriminate between x1 and xd+1. Also, we fix α = 1/10, and the noise ε ∼ N (0, 1). Each phase begins with an initialization matrix A0, obtained by pulling once each canonical arm. In Fig. 4 we report the sampling budget of the algorithms, averaged over 100 runs, for d = 2 . . . 10.\nThe results. The numerical results show that XYAdaptive is effective in allocating the samples to shrink the uncertainty in the direction ỹ. Indeed, XY-adaptive identifies the most important direction after few phases and is able to perform an allocation which mimics that of the oracle. On the contrary, XY and G do not adjust to the empirical gaps and consider all directions as equally important. This behavior forces XY and G to allocate samples until the uncertainty is smaller than ∆min in all directions. Even though the Fully-adaptive algorithm also identifies the most informative direction rapidly, the √ d term in the bound delays the discarding of the arms and prevents the algorithm from gaining any advantage compared to XY and G. As shown in Fig. 4,\nthe difference between the budget of XY-Adaptive and the static strategies increases with the number of dimensions. In fact, while additional dimensions have little to no impact on XY-Oracle and XY-Adaptive (the only important direction remains ỹ independently from the number of unknown features of θ∗), for the static allocations more dimensions imply more directions to be considered and more features of θ∗ to be estimated uniformly well until the uncertainty falls below ∆min."

      "text" : "In this paper we studied the problem of best-arm identification with a fixed confidence, in the linear bandit setting. First we offered a preliminary characterization of the problem-dependent complexity of the best arm identification task and shown its connection with the complexity in the MAB setting. Then, we designed and analyzed efficient sampling strategies for this problem. The G-allocation strategy allowed us to point out a close connection with optimal experimental design techniques, and in particular to the G-optimality criterion. Through the second proposed strategy, XY-allocation, we introduced a novel optimal design problem where the testing arms do not coincide with the arms chosen in the design. Lastly, we pointed out the limits that a fully-adaptive allocation strategy might have in the linear bandit setting and proposed a phased-algorithm, XY-Adaptive, that learns from previous observations, without suffering from the dimensionality of the problem. Since this is one of the first works that analyze pure-exploration problems in the linear-bandit setting, it opens the way for an important number of similar problems already studied in the MAB setting. For instance, we can investigate strategies to identify the best-linear arm when having a limited budget or study the best-arm identification when the set of arms is very large (or infinite). Some interesting extensions also emerge from the optimal experimental design literature, such as the study of sampling strategies for meeting the G-optimality criterion when the noise is heterosckedastic, or the design of efficient strategies for satisfying other related optimality criteria, such as V-optimality.\nAcknowledgments This work was supported by the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research, Nord-Pas de Calais Regional Council and FEDER through the “Contrat de Projets Etat Region 2007–2013\", and European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme under grant agreement no 270327 (project CompLACS)."

      "text" : "Proof of Theorem 1. The statement follows from Prop. 1 and the performance guarantees for the different implementations of the G-optimal design.

From Prop. 1 we have that the following inequalities\n∆̂n(x ∗, x) ≥ ∆(x∗, x)− c||x∗ − x||A−1\nx G n\n√ logn(K 2/δ) ≥ ∆(x∗, x)− 2c\n√ ρG̃n logn(K 2/δ)\nn ,\nhold with probability 1 − δ. Combining this with the previous condition and since the condition must hold for all x ∈ X , we have that a sufficient condition to stop using the G-allocation is\n16c2ρG̃n logn(K 2/δ)\nn ≤ ∆min,\nwhich defines the level of accuracy that the G-allocation needs to achieve before stopping. Since ρG̃n ≤ (1 + β)d then the statement follows by inverting the previous inequality.\nProof of Theorem 2. We follow the same steps as in the proof of Theorem 1.\nC Implementation of the Allocation Strategies\nIn this section we discuss about possible implementations of the allocation strategies illustrated in sections 4 and 5 and we discuss their approximation accuracy guarantees.\nThe efficient rounding procedure. We first report the general structure of the efficient rounding procedure defined in [15, Chapter 12] to implement a design λ into an allocation xn for any fixed number of steps n. Let p = supp(λ) the support of λ,4 then we want to compute the number of pulls ni (with i = 1, . . . , p) for all the arms in the support of λ. Basically, the fast implementation of the design is obtained in two phases, as follows:\n• In the first phase, given the sample size n and the number of support points p, we calculate their corresponding frequencies ni = ⌈(n− 12p)λi⌉, where n1, n2, . . . , np are positive integers with ∑ i≤p ni ≥ n.\n• The second phase loops until the discrepancy (∑ i≤p ni ) − n is 0, either:\n– increasing a frequency nj which attains nj/λj = mini≤p(n− 1)/λi to nj+1, or – decreasing some nk with (nk − 1)/λk = maxi≤p(ni − 1)/λi to n− 1.\nAn interesting feature of this procedure is that when moving from n to n + 1 the corresponding allocations xn and xn+1 only differ for one element i which is increased by 1, i.e., the discrete allocation is monotonic in n.\n4For a fixed design λ ∈ RK , we say that its support is given by all arms in X whose corresponding features in λ are different than 0.\nImplementation of the G-allocation. A first option is to optimize a continuous relaxation of the problem and compute the optimal design. Let ρG(λ) = maxx x⊤Λ −1 λ x, the optimal design is\nλG = arg min λ∈Dk max x∈X ||x||2 Λ−1 λ = arg min λ∈Dk ρG(λ). (21)\nThis is a convex optimization problem and it can be solved using the projected gradient algorithm, interior point techniques, or multiplicative algorithms. To move from the design λG to a discrete allocation we use the efficient rounding technique presented above and we obtain that the resulting allocation xG̃t is guaranteed to be monotonic as the number of times an arm x is pulled is nondecreasing with t. Thus from xG̃t we obtain a simple incremental rule, where the arm xt is the arm for which xG̃t recommends one pull more than in x G̃ t−1. An alternative is to directly implement an incremental version of Eq. 12 by selecting at each step t the greedy arm\nxt = argmin x∈X max x′∈X\nx′⊤ ( Axt−1+xx ⊤ ) −1x′ = argmin\nx∈X max x′∈X\nx′⊤ [ A−1 xt−1 − A−1 xt−1 xx⊤A−1 xt−1\n1 + x⊤A−1xt−1x\n] x′, (22)\nwhere the second formulation follows from the matrix inversion lemma. This allocation is somehow simpler and more direct than using the continuous relaxation but it may come with a higher efficiency loss.\nBefore reporting the performance guarantees for the two implementations proposed above, we introduce an additional technical lemma which will be useful in the proofs on the performance guarantees. Although the lemma is presented for a specific definition of uncertainty ρ, any other notion including design matrices of the kind Λλ will satisfy the same guarantee.\nLemma 5. Let ρ(λ) = maxx∈X x⊤Λ−1λ x be a measure of uncertainty of interest for any design λ ∈ DK . We denote by λ∗ = argminλ∈DK ρ(λ) the optimal design and for any n > d we introduce the optimal discrete allocation as\nx ∗ n = arg min\nxn∈Xn max x∈X\nx⊤Λ−1λxnx\nn ,\nwhere λxn is the (fractional) design corresponding to xn. Then we have\nρ(λ∗) ≤ ρ(x∗n) ≤ ( 1 + p\nn\n) ρ(λ∗), (23)\nwhere p = supp(λ∗) is the number of points in the support of λ∗. If d linearly independent arms are available in X , then we can upper bound the size of the support of λ∗ and obtain\nρ(λ∗) ≤ ρ(x∗n) ≤ ( 1 + d(d+ 1)\nn\n) ρ(λ∗). (24)\nProof. The first part of the statement follows by the definition of λ∗ as the minimizer of ρ. Let x̃n by an efficient rounding technique applied on λ∗ such as the one described in Lemma 12.8 in [15]. Then x̃n has the same support as λ∗ and an efficiency loss bounded by p/n. As a result, we have\nρ(x∗n) ≤ ρ(x̃n) ≤ ( 1 + p\nn\n) ρ(λ∗),\nwhere the first inequality comes from the fact that x∗n is the minimizer of ρ among allocations of length n. Then, from Caratheodory’s theorem (see e.g., [15] ) the number of support points used in λ∗ is upper bounded by p ≤ d(d + 1)/2 + 1 (under the assumption that there are d linearly independent arms in X ). The final result follows by a rough maximization of d(d+1)/2n+1/n ≤ d(d+ 1)/n.\nRemark 1. Note that the same upper-bound for the number of support points holds for any design, due to the properties of the design matrices. In fact, any design matrix is symmetric by construction, which implies that it is completely described by D = d(d + 1)/2 elements and can thus be seen as a point in RD. Moreover, a design matrix is a convex combination of a subset of points in RD and thus it belongs to the convex hull of that subset of points. Caratheodory’s theorem states that each point in the convex hull of any subset of points in RD can be defined as a convex combination of at\nmost D+1 points. It directly follows that any design matrix can be expressed using (d(d+1)/2)+1 points.\nIt follows that the allocation xG̃t obtained applying the rounding procedure has the following performance guarantee. Lemma 6. For any t ≥ d, the rounding procedure defined in [15, Chapter 12] returns an allocation x G̃ t , whose corresponding design λ\nG̃ = λ x G̃ t is such that5\nρG(λG̃) ≤ ( 1 + d+ d2 + 2\n2t\n) d.\nProof of Lemma 6. We follow the same steps as in the proof of Lemma 5 to obtain the term β = d+d2+2\n2t . Then, noting that the performance of the optimal strategy ρ G(λ∗G) = d (from Prop. 3), the\nresults follows.\nImplementation of the XY-allocation. Notice that the complexity of the XY-allocation trivially follows from the complexity of the G-allocation and it is NP-hard. As a result, we need to propose approximate solutions to compute an allocation xX̃Yn as for the G-allocation. Let ρXY(λ) = maxy∈Y y\n⊤Λ−1λ y, then the first option is the compute the optimal solution to the continuous relaxed problem\nλXY = arg min λ∈Dk max y∈Y ||y||2 Λ−1 λ = arg min λ∈Dk ρXY(λ). (25)\nAnd then compute the corresponding discrete allocation xX̃Yn using the efficient rounding procedure. Alternatively, we can use an incremental greedy algorithm which at each step t returns the arm\nxt = argmin x∈X max y∈Y\ny⊤ ( Axt−1 + xx ⊤ )−1 y. (26)\nLemma 7. For any t ≥ d, the rounding procedure defined in [15, Chapter 12] returns an allocation x X̃Y t , whose corresponding design λ\nX̃Y = λ x X̃Y t is such that\nρXY(λX̃Y) ≤ 2 ( 1 + d+ d2 + 2\n2t\n) d.\nProof of Lemma 7. The proof follows from the fact that for any pair (x, x′)\n||x− x′||A−1xn ≤ 2 maxx′′∈X ||x ′′||A−1xn .\nThen the proof proceeds as in Lemma 6.\nImplementation of XY-adaptive allocation. The allocation rule in Eq. 17 basically coincides with the XY-allocation and its properties extend smoothly."

Since M∗ is defined as the smallest number of steps needed by the XY strategy to avoid any overlap between S∗ and the hyperplanes C(x) ∩ C(x′), then we have that after M∗ steps\nc\n√ ρXYM∗ logn(K 2/δ)\nM∗ < ǫ∗.

Thus nj ≤ M∗.\nCase 2: √ ρjnj nj ≤ ǫ∗ c √\nlogn(K 2/δ)\n. We first relate the performance at phase j with the performance of\nthe oracle.

Thus\nρjnj ≤ maxy∈Y∗ y⊤Λ−1λ x ∗ nj y\n∆2(y) max y∈Ŷj ∆2(y) = ρ∗nj max y∈Ŷj ∆2(y). (32)\nThis relationship does not provide a bound on nj yet.

We remind that the arms denoted x1, . . . , x5 form the canonical basis and arm x6 = [cos(ω) sin(ω) 0 0 0].\nWe can notice that even though the Fully-adaptive algorithm identifies the most informative direction and focuses the sampling on arm x2, its sample complexity still has a growth linear in the dimension, due to the extra √ d term in his bound. Consequently, the advantage over the static strategies is canceled. On the other hand, XY-adaptive “learns” the gaps from the observations and allocates the samples very similarly to XY-oracle, without suffering a large loss in terms of the sampling budget. However, XY-adaptive’s sample complexity has to account for the the re-initializations made at the beginning of a new phase.\nFinally, we notice that in this problem that static allocations, XY and G, perform a uniform allocation over the canonical arms. Another interesting remark is that the number of pulls to one canonical arm is smaller than the samples that XY-oracle allocated to x2. This is explained by the “mutual information” coming from the multiple observations on all directions, which helps in reducing the overall uncertainty of the confidence set."

We characterize the complexity of the problem and introduce sample allocation strategies that pull arms to identify the best arm with a fixed confidence, while minimizing the sample budget. In particular, we show the importance of exploiting the global linear structure to improve the estimate of the reward of near-optimal arms. We analyze the proposed strategies and compare their empirical performance. Finally, as a by-product of our analysis, we point out the connection to the G-optimality criterion used in optimal experimental design.",
