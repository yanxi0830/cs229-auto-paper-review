      "text" : "Collaborative ltering is an e ective recommendation technique wherein the preference of an individual can potentially be predicted based on preferences of other members. Early algorithms often relied on the strong locality in the preference data, that is, it is enough to predict preference of a user on a particular item based on a small subset of other users with similar tastes or of other items with similar properties. More recently, dimensionality reduction techniques have proved to be equally competitive, and these are based on the co-occurrence patterns rather than locality. This paper explores and extends a probabilistic model known as Boltzmann Machine for collaborative ltering tasks. It seamlessly integrates both the similarity and cooccurrence in a principled manner. In particular, we study parameterisation options to deal with the ordinal nature of the preferences, and propose a joint modelling of both the user-based and item-based processes. Experiments on moderate and large-scale movie recommendation show that our framework rivals existing well-known methods."

      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Collaborative ltering is based on the idea that we can predict preference of an user on unseen items by using preferences already expressed by the user and others. For example, if we want to predict how much the user likes a particular movie we may look for similar users who have rated the movie before (Resnick et al., 1994). Alternatively, the rating for this new movie can be based on ratings of other similar movies that the user has watched (Sarwar et al., 2001). This similarity-based approach relies on the strong local-\nity in the neighbourhood of highly correlated users or items. More recent development has suggested that dimensionality reduction techniques like SVD (Salakhutdinov et al., 2007), PLSA (Hofmann, 2004) and LDA (Marlin, 2004) are also competitive. The idea is to assume a low dimensional representation of rating data, which, once learnt, can be used to generate unseen ratings. Unlike the similarity-based approach, this does not assume any locality in the data.\nIn this paper, we take the view that these approaches are complementary and they address di erent aspects of the user's preferences. Speci cally, we explore the application of an undirected graphical model known as Boltzmann Machines (BMs) (Ackley et al., 1985) for the problem. The strength of BMs comes from the capacity to integrate the latent aspects of user's preferences as well as the correlation between items and between users. The undirected nature of the model allows exible encoding of data, and at the same time, it supports inference and learning in an principled manner. For example, the model supports missing ratings and joint predictions for a set of items and users. It provides some measure of con dence in each prediction made, making it easy to assess the nature of recommendation and rank results. With the hidden variables we can project user's preferences and item ratings onto a latent low dimensional space for further processing. Note that its probabilistic integration di ers from the current practice of blending multiple independent models (Koren, 2008).\nImportantly, we go beyond the standard BMs in a number of ways. Firstly, we explore various parameterisations to deal with the ordinal nature of ratings (e.g. if the true rating is 3 stars in a 5-star scale, then predicting 4 stars is preferred to predicting 5 stars). The standard discrete graphical models, on the other hand, count both the predictions as errors. One way to deal with this issue is to approximate them by continuous variables as done in (Hofmann, 2004) but this is only meaningful for numerical ratings. Secondly,\nprevious BMs generally assume that each subset of observational variables are generated from an hidden process of the same type, and the data comes with a set of i.i.d instances. In collaborative ltering, on the other hand, it is much more plausible to assume that observed ratings are co-generated by both the userbased and item-based processes. As a result, the data instances are no longer independently and identically distributed. To deal with this, we propose to integrate data instances into a single BM, in which, every rating is associated with both the user-based and itembased processes. Further, this paper studies approximate learning strategies for large BMs, including Contrastive Divergence (Hinton, 2002) (CD), a structural extension to Pseudo-Likelihood (Besag, 1975) (PL), and the combination of CD and PL for the joint model."

      "text" : "Denote by U = {1, 2, . . . ,M} the set of M users, and I = {1, 2, . . . ,K} the set of K items in the recommendation system of interest. Let us further denote byS the set of values a user can rate (e.g., S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} in the discrete case or S = [0, 1] in the continuous case). We use u throughout this paper to index the user and i to index the item. Let I(u) be the set of indices of items rated by user u. Typically, the size of I(u) is much smaller than the total number of items in the database (i.e. |I(u)| K) because each user usually votes for only a small subset of items.\nIn this section, we rst present probabilistic modelling from a single user perspective using Boltzmann machines (BMs). A user-centric BM in our view is an undirected graphical model representing user information and the set of associated rated items. A graphical\nmodel representation is shown in Fig. 1. There are two components in the model:\n• a hidden layer to capture the latent aspects of a user modelled by a d-dim binary random vector variable h = (h1, h2, ..., hd), and\n• a visible layer representing ratings on di erent items observed for this user, captured by a random vector r(u) = (ri)i∈I(u) . Each element variable ri receives values in the set S.\nFor the sake of understanding, we consider here discrete ratings where S is a nite discrete set and leave the case of continuous-valued ratings to the Appendix A.2. For clarity, we will drop explicit mention of user index u and the membership relation i ∈ I(u) and reinstate them whenever confusion may arise.\nIn the extreme view, the user-centric model should have represented both rated and non-rated items, treating all non-rated items as hidden variables at the bottom layer. However, since we do not have the knowledge of which items the user will rate in the future while the number of items is typically large (at the scale of millions in real-world scenarios), it will be impractical to include all the unknown ratings into the model. Our strategy is to limit to only known ratings at training time and gradually introduce an additional unknown rating at the prediction time as an unobserved variable subject to be inferred.\nTo parameterise our model, we rst consider two additional kinds of features extracted from the set of ratings: for each rating ri we extract a vector of features {fa(ri)}Aa=1, and for each rating pair{ri, rj} a feature vector {fb(ri, rj)}Bb=1. While fa(ri) captures some intrinsic property of the item i and the rating ri, fb(ri, rj) encodes correlation between the two item i, j and their corresponding ratings. Four types of parameters are introduced (c.f. Fig. 1): each hidden unit hk is parameterised with αk, each feature fa (ri) at the rating ri with βia, each pair (hk, fa (ri)) with γkia, and each item-to-item correlation feature fb (ri, rj) with λijb. For the user u, the model state negative energy is now ready to be de ned as\n−E(u)(h, r) =  ∑ 1≤k≤d αkhk + ∑ i∈I(u),a βiafa(ri) + ∑ i∈I(u),k,a γikahkfa(ri)\n+ ∑ i,j∈I(u);i 6=j ∑ b λijbfb(ri, rj)\nwhere αk, βia, γika and λijb are model parameters which are shared among users as shown to be outside the plate in Fig.1 . Finally, the user-centric model distribution follows\nP (u)(h, r) = 1\nZ(u) exp{−E(u)(h, r)} (1)\nwhere Z(u) = ∑\nh,r exp{−E(u)(h, r)} is the normalising constant. Denote by hk,1 the assignment hk = 1. The conditional distributions are (again we drop user index u)\nP (hk,1 | r) = [ 1 + exp { −αk −\n∑ ia γikafa(ri) }]−1 P (ri|r¬i,h) ∝ exp {I (ri,h) + J (ri, r¬i)}\nwhere r¬i denote the set of ratings by the same user u other than ri, and\nI (ri,h) = ∑ a βiafa(ri) + ∑ ka γikafa(ri)hk\nJ (ri, r¬i) = ∑ j 6=i ∑ b λijbfb(ri, rj)\nFor the purpose of dimensionality reduction we can use the vector {P (hk,1|r)}dk=1 as a continuous representation of the user's preference."

      "text" : "In this paper we consider the case where user preferences are expressed in term of ordinal ratings, i.e., the set of rating values S is a set of n ordinal values, and let us denote it by S = {R1, R2, ...Rn}. A straightforward approach is to simply ignore the ordinal property and treat the ratings as categorical variables. In particular, the input bias feature can simply be an identity function fs(ri) = I[ri ≡ Rs], and the correlation feature can be treated as the similarity between the two neighbour ratings fb(ri, rj) = I[ri ≡ rj ]. Another way is to treat them as numerical values, for example, as random Gaussian variables (after appropriate preprocessing, see Appendix A.2 for a detailed treatment). However the shortcoming is that this treatment is only meaningful when such a numerical interpretation exists.\nA better way is to exploit the ordering property: if the true rating by the user u on item i is ri = Rs, then we would want to predict the rating as close to Rs as possible. Denote by Rs′ Rs′+1 the preference of Rs′ to Rs′+1, the ordering of preferences when the true rating is Rs can be expressed as\nRs Rs−1.... R1 Rs Rs+1... Rn\nIt is essential to design features {fa(ri)}Aa=1 to capture the information induced from these expressions. As Rs split the set S into two subsets, we create one set of features corresponding to s′ < s and another set corresponding to s” > s, i.e. fdowns′ (Rs) = (s ′ − s)I[s′ < s]\nand fups” (Rs) = (s” − s)I[s” > s], respectively, where I[.] is the indicator function. For correlation between two items (i, j), we can measure the distance between two corresponding ratings ri = Rs and rj = Rs′ by user u, i.e. fb(ri, rj) = |s′ − s|."

One method is to use Gibbs sampling to approximate the gradients. However, unbiased Gibbs sampling may take too much time to converge. We follow a sampling strategy called Contrastive-Divergence (CD) (Hinton, 2002), in that we start the sampling from the data distribution, and stop the random walks after a few steps. This certainly introduces bias, but it is enough to relax the distribution toward the true distribution, and more importantly, it is very e cient.\nAnother method is to utilise Pseudo-likelihood (PL) (Besag, 1975), and we approximate the model loglikelihood by\nLPL(r̄) = ∑ i∈I(u) logP (r̄i|r̄¬i)\nNote that in the original PL, there are no hidden variables, thus computing the local conditional distribution P (r̄i|r̄¬i) is easy. In our case, the pseudolikelihood and its gradient can also be computed exactly and e ciently but the derivations are rather involved, and we leave the details in the Appendix A.1."

      "heading" : "3 JOINT MODELLING OF USERS",
      "text" : "AND ITEMS\nIn the previous section, we have assumed that ratings are generated by some user-centric process. Since users and items play an equal role in the data, we can alternatively assume that there exists some itemcentric process that generates ratings. Thus we can alternatively model the ratings observed for each item instead of user in a manner similar to Section 2. The more plausible assumption, however, is that a rating is co-generated by both the user-centric and item-centric processes. This can be realised by combining these two modelling approaches into a single uni ed BM, as depicted in Figure 2.\nMore speci cally, every user and item is modelled with its own hidden layer. Let d′ be the dimensionality of the hidden variables associated with items, there are Md+Kd′ hidden nodes in the joint model (every rating is associated with two hidden layers, one per the user and one per the item). The number of input nodes is the number of ratings in the whole database. Each input node corresponding to user u and item i is possibly connected to |I(u)|+ |U (i)|−2 other input nodes, where U (i) denotes the set of all users who rate item i. Thus, the resulting BM is a probabilistic database that supports various inference tasks.\nDenote by r and h respectively the set of all input variables (i.e., observed ratings) and all hidden variables of the entire model. The energy of the entire system is\nE(r,h) = ∑ u∈U E(u)(r(u),h(u)) + ∑ i∈I E(i)(r(i),h(i))\nwhere\n−E(i)(r(i),h(i)) =  ∑ k θkhk + ∑ u∈U(i),a ηuafa(ru) + ∑ u∈U(i),k,a νukahkfa(ru)\n+ ∑ u,v∈U(i);u6=v ∑ b ωuvbfb(ru, rv)\nwhere θ, η, ν, ω are respective item-centric model parameters that play similar roles to α, β, γ, λ in usercentric models.\nLet r̄ denote all assigned rating values in the training data. Since the model structure is complex, we look for decomposition to simplify computation. As ratings can be decomposed by either user indices or item indices, we appeal to structured pseudo-likelihood learning where we try to maximise the log pseudo-likelihood instead3:\nLPL(r̄) = 1 2 (∑ u∈U logP (r̄(u)|r̄¬u)+ ∑ i∈I logP (r̄(i)|r̄¬i) )\nThis objective function has a nice property that parameters associated with users and items are separated in corresponding components. Naturally, it suggests an alternating parameter updating strategy. Let us consider P (r̄(u) | r̄¬u). Using the Markov property, r̄¬u reduces to ratings by all neighbours of user u. Since each item rated by user u has its own hidden variables and integrating out these variables in standard likelihood learning may be expensive (although feasible), we further propose a mean- eld approximation approach, similar to that described in Section 2.3. More speci cally, when we update parameter associated with user u, we considered the hidden layer for item i observed with value {P (h(i)k′,1|r̄(i))}d ′\nk′=1. The learning now reduces to that described in Section 2.2. The overall algorithm can be summarised as follows\n• Loop until stopping criteria met:\nUse {P (h(i)k′,1|r̄(i))}d ′\nk′=1 as hidden values per item i, for all i ∈ I. Fix item models parameters, update user model parameters by maximising ∑ u∈U logP (r̄\n(u)|r̄¬u). Use {P (h(u)k,1|r̄(u))}dk=1 as hidden values per user u, for all u ∈ U . Fix user model parameters, update item model parameters by maximising ∑ i∈I logP (r̄\n(i)|r̄¬i). 3Note that there is a single distribution P (r,h) for the\nwhole data.\nIn the testing phase, we introduce a single node ruj to the model and compute r∗uj = arg maxruj P (ruj |r̄), which can be simpli ed further by noting that P (ruj |r̄) = P (ruj |r̄(u), r̄(j)). We can also make use of the mean- eld approximation similar to that in Section 2.3. More speci cally, we make use of all the conditional distributions of hidden variables {P (h(i)k′,1|r̄(i))}d ′ k′=1 for each item i and {P (h(u)k,1|r̄(u))}dk=1 for each user u, then compute the energy decrease as\nEQ(ruj , r̄) =  −∑a βjafa(ruj)−∑a ηuafa(ru) −∑k P (h(u)k,1|r̄(u))∑a γjkafa(ruj) −∑i∈I(u),b λijbfb(r̄i, rj) −∑k P (h(j)k,1|r̄(j))∑a νukafa(ru) −∑v∈U(j) ∑b ωuvbfb(r̄u, rv)"

For each user, roughly 80% of ratings is used for training and the rest is for evaluation.\nWe implement three variants of the BMs: the categorical, the ordinal and the Gaussian. For the Gaussian BMs, we need to normalise the ratings to obtain random numbers following the standard normal distribution N (0; 1). To determine the connectivity at the input layers, we rst compute the Pearson correlation between user pairs and item pairs as in standard similarity-based methods (e.g. see (Sarwar et al., 2001)), and keep only positively correlated pairs.

The evaluation criteria\nincludes the standard recall/precision measures, and the ranking utility adapted from (Breese et al., 1998). The utility is based on the assumption that the value of a recommendation, if it interests a user, is reduced exponentially with its position down the list.

The BMs di er from Bayesian networks in that BMs are undirected models which Bayesian networks are directed.\nOur method resembles dependency networks when pseudo-likelihood (Besag, 1975) learning is employed and no hidden variables are modelled, but dependency networks are generally inconsistent.\nThe dimensionality reduction capacity of the BMs is shared by other probabilistic models, including mixture models, probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) (Hofmann, 2004) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Marlin, 2004).

We empirically shown that BMs are competitive in the movie recommendation problem.\nThis work can be furthered in a number of ways. First we need to handle incremental parameter updating when new users or items are available.

Expanding Z(ri|r̄¬i) and note that all potentials associated with hk = 0 become 1, we obtain\nZ(ri|r̄¬i) = φi(ri) ∏ j 6=i ψij(ri, r̄j)×\n× [∏ k ( 1 + φk(hk,1) ψik(hk,1, ri) ψik(hk,1, r̄i) ∏ j ψjk(hk,1, r̄j) )]\nThus we can compute all the Z(ri|r̄¬i) in O(|S|dNu2) time for all items rated by the user u.\nNow we come to the gradient of the pseudo-likelihood\n∂LPL(r̄) = ∑ i\n( ∂ logZ(r̄i|r̄¬i)− ∂ logZ(r̄¬i) ) (3)\nRecall that Z(r̄¬i) = ∑ ri Z(ri|r̄¬i), we have\n∂ logZ(r̄¬i) = 1\nZ(r̄¬i) ∑ ri ∂Z(ri|r̄¬i)\n= 1\nZ(r̄¬i) ∑ ri Z(ri|r̄¬i)∂ logZ(ri|r̄¬i)\n= ∑ ri P (ri|r̄¬i)∂ logZ(ri|r̄¬i)\nThus Eq.3 reduces to ∂LPL(r̄) = ∑ i (∑ ri {I[ri = r̄i]− P (ri|r̄¬i)}∂ logZ(ri|r̄¬i) )\n= ∑ i (∑ ri D(ri|r̄¬i)∂ logZ(ri|r̄¬i) )\nwhere I[.] is an identity function and D(ri|r̄¬i) = I[ri = r̄i]− P (ri|r̄¬i). Let us consider ∂ logZ(ri|r̄¬i). It is known that ∂ logZ(ri|r̄¬i)\n∂αk = P (hk,1|ri, r̄¬i)\n∂ logZ(ri|r̄¬i) ∂βja = fa(ri)I[i = j]\n∂ logZ(ri|r̄¬i) ∂γjka = { P (hk,1|ri, r̄¬i)fa(ri) for i = j P (hk,1|ri, r̄¬i)fa(r̄j) for i 6= j\nwhere P (hk,1|ri, r̄¬i) is φk(hk,1)ψik(hk,1, ri) ∏ j ψjk(hk,1, r̄j)\nψik(hk,1, r̄i) + φk(hk,1)ψik(hk,1, ri) ∏ j ψjk(hk,1, r̄j)\nFinally, we need to sum over all the visible nodes as in Eq.3\n∂LPL(r̄) ∂αk = ∑ i ∑ ri D(ri|r̄¬i)P (hk,1|ri, r̄¬i) ∂LPL(r̄) ∂βja = ∑ rj D(rj |r̄¬j)fa(rj)\n∂LPL(r̄) ∂γjka =\n{∑ rj D(rj |r̄¬j)P (hk|rj , r̄¬j)∆fa(rj)\n+fa(r̄j) ∂L(r̄) ∂αk\nwhere ∆fa(rj) = fa(rj)− fa(r̄j).\nA.2 BMs WITH GAUSSIAN RATINGS\nSince ratings are sometimes provided in a numerical scale, they can be approximated by continuous variables, as suggested in (Hofmann, 2004). The energy of the system is given as\nE(h, r) = { −∑k αkhk −∑i,k γikrihk + ∑ i r2i 2 − ∑ i βiri − ∑ i,j 6=i λijrirj\nHere we assume that P (ri|r¬i, h) = N (µi; 1), where µi = βi + ∑ k γikhk + ∑ j 6=i λijrj . Again, Gibbs sampling can be used for evaluating log-likelihood gradients in learning. In predicting new ratings, we can apply the mean- eld approximation strategy described in Section 2.3, and compute the mode of the normal distribution P (rj |r̄,h), which is simply µj\nµj = βj + ∑ k γjkP (hk,1|r̄) + ∑ i λij r̄i\nMean- eld approximation to PL learning:\nRecall that the PL learning requires the conditional distribution P (ri|r̄¬i), which is not Gaussian, making evaluation di cult. To turn it into a Gaussian, we can apply the mean- eld approximation\nP (ri|r̄¬i) = ∑ h P (ri,h|r̄¬i)\n≈ Q(ri|r̄¬i) ∑ h ∏ k Q(hk|r̄¬i)\nFurther approximation Q(hk|r̄¬i) ≈ P (hk|r̄) gives Q(ri|r̄¬i) ∝\nexp ( − r 2 i\n2 + βiri + ∑ k P (hk,1|r̄)γikri + ∑ j 6=i λijrir̄j ) Thus Q(ri|r̄¬i) is a Gaussian with mean µi = βi +∑ k P (hk|r̄)γik + ∑ j 6=i λij r̄j .\nSince the mean of a Gaussian is also its mode, PL learning can be approximately carried out by minimising the reconstruction error\nE = 1 2 ∑ i (r̄i − µi)2\nLet i = r̄i − µi. The gradients are ∂E ∂βi\n= − i ∂E ∂αk = −P (hk,1|r̄) ∑ i iγik ∂E ∂γik = −P (hk,1|r̄) ( i + P (hk,1|r̄)ri ∑ j jγjk )\n= −P (hk,1|r̄) ( i − ri\n∂E ∂hk,1 ) ∂E ∂λij = − ir̄j − j r̄i"

Early algorithms often relied on the strong locality in the preference data, that is, it is enough to predict preference of a user on a particular item based on a small subset of other users with similar tastes or of other items with similar properties. More recently, dimensionality reduction techniques have proved to be equally competitive, and these are based on the co-occurrence patterns rather than locality. This paper explores and extends a probabilistic model known as Boltzmann Machine for collaborative ltering tasks. It seamlessly integrates both the similarity and cooccurrence in a principled manner. In particular, we study parameterisation options to deal with the ordinal nature of the preferences, and propose a joint modelling of both the user-based and item-based processes. Experiments on moderate and large-scale movie recommendation show that our framework rivals existing well-known methods.",
