      "text" : "while preserving the strong guarantee of differential privacy. Our main contributions are four different algorithms for private Bayesian inference on probabilistic graphical models. These include two mechanisms for adding noise to the Bayesian updates, either directly to the posterior parameters, or to their Fourier transform so as to preserve update consistency. We also utilise a recently introduced posterior sampling mechanism, for which we prove bounds for the specific but general case of discrete Bayesian networks; and we introduce a maximum-a-posteriori private mechanism. Our analysis includes utility and privacy bounds, with a novel focus on the influence of graph structure on privacy. Worked examples and experiments with Bayesian naïve Bayes and Bayesian linear regression illustrate the application of our mechanisms."

      "text" : "We consider the problem faced by a statistician B who analyses data and communicates her findings to a third party A . While B wants to learn as much as possible from the data, she doesn’t want A to learn about any individual datum. This is for example the case where A is an insurance agency, the data are medical records, and B wants to convey the efficacy of drugs to the agency, without revealing the specific illnesses of individuals in the population. Such requirements of privacy are of growing interest in the learning Chaudhuri and Hsu (2012); Duchi, Jordan, and Wainwright (2013), theoretical computer science Dwork and Smith (2009); McSherry and Talwar (2007) and databases communities Barak et al. (2007); Zhang et al. (2014) due to the impact on individual privacy by real-world data analytics.\nIn our setting, we assume that B is using Bayesian inference to draw conclusions from observations of a system of random variables by updating a prior distribution on parameters (i.e., latent variables) to a posterior. Our goal is to release an approximation to the posterior that preserves privacy. We adopt the formalism of differential privacy to characterise how easy it is for A to discover facts about the individual data from the aggregate posterior. Releasing the posterior permits external parties to make further inferences at will. For example, a third-party pharmaceutical might use the released posterior as a prior on the efficacy of drugs, and update it with their own patient data. Or they could form a predictive posterior for classification or regression, all while preserving differential privacy of the original data.\nOur focus in this paper is Bayesian inference in probabilistic graphical models (PGMs), which are popular as a tool for modelling conditional independence assumptions. Similar to the effect on statistical and computational efficiency of non-private inference, a central tenet of this paper is that independence structure should impact privacy. Our mechanisms and theoretical bounds are the first to establish such a link between PGM graph structure and privacy.\nMain Contributions. We develop the first mechanisms for Bayesian inference on the flexible PGM framework (cf. Table 1). We propose two posterior perturbation mechanisms for networks with likelihood functions from exponential families and conjugate\nar X\niv :1\n51 2.\n06 99\n2v 1\n[ cs\n.A I]\n2 2\nD ec\n2 01\n5\npriors, that add Laplace noise Dwork et al. (2006) to posterior parameters (or their Fourier coefficients) to preserve privacy. The latter achieves stealth through consistent posterior updates. For general Bayesian networks, posteriors may be non-parametric. In this case, we explore a mechanism Dimitrakakis et al. (2014) which samples from the posterior to answer queries—no additional noise is injected. We complement our study with a maximum a posteriori estimator that leverages the exponential mechanism McSherry and Talwar (2007). Our utility and privacy bounds connect privacy and graph/dependency structure, and are complemented by illustrative experiments with Bayesian naïve Bayes and linear regression.\nRelated Work. Many individual learning algorithms have been adapted to maintain differential privacy, including regularised logistic regression Chaudhuri and Monteleoni (2008), the SVM Rubinstein et al. (2012); Chaudhuri, Monteleoni, and Sarwate (2011), PCA Chaudhuri, Sarwate, and Sinha (2012), the functional mechanism Zhang et al. (2012) and trees Jagannathan, Pillaipakkamnatt, and Wright (2009).\nProbabilistic graphical models have been used to preserve privacy. Zhang et al. (2014) learned a graphical model from data, in order to generate surrogate data for release; while Williams and McSherry (2010) fit a model to the response of private mechanisms to clean up output and improve accuracy. Xiao and Xiong (2012) similarly used Bayesian credible intervals to increase the utility of query responses.\nLittle attention has been paid to private inference in the Bayesian setting. We seek to adapt Bayesian inference to preserve differential privacy when releasing posteriors. Dimitrakakis et al. (2014; 2015) introduce a differentially-private mechanism for Bayesian inference based on posterior sampling—a mechanism on which we build— while Zheng (2015) considers further refinements. Wang, Fienberg, and Smola (2015) explore Monte Carlo approaches to Bayesian inference using the same mechanism, while Mir (2012) was the first to establish differential privacy of the Gibbs estimator McSherry and Talwar (2007) by minimising risk bounds.\nThis paper is the first to develop mechanisms for differential privacy under the general framework of Bayesian inference on multiple, dependent r.v.’s. Our mechanisms consider graph structure and include a purely Bayesian approach that only places conditions on the prior. We show how the (stochastic) Lipschitz assumptions of Dimitrakakis et al. (2014) lift to graphs of r.v.’s, and bound KL-divergence when releasing an empirical posterior based on a modified prior. While Chaudhuri, Monteleoni, and Sarwate (2011) achieve privacy in regularised Empirical Risk Minimisation through objective randomisation, we do so through conditions on priors. We develop an alternate approach that uses the additive-noise mechanism of Dwork et al. (2006) to perturb posterior parameterisations; and we apply techniques due to Barak et al. (2007), who released marginal tables that maintain consistency in addition to privacy, by adding Laplace noise in the Fourier domain. Our motivation is novel: we wish to guarantee privacy against omniscient attackers and stealth against unsuspecting third parties."

      "text" : "Under the setting of Example 1, we can add Laplace noise to the posterior parameters. Algorithm 1 releases perturbed parameter updates for the Beta posteriors, calculated simply by counting. It then adds zero-mean Laplace-distributed noise to the updates ∆ω = (· · · ,∆αi,j ,∆βi,j , · · · ). This is the final dependence on D. Finally, the perturbed updates ∆ω′ are truncated at zero to rule out invalid Beta parameters and are upper truncated at n. This yields an upper bound on the raw updates and facilitates an application of McDiarmid’s bounded-differences inequality (cf. Lemma A.1 in the Appendix) in our utility analysis. Note that this truncation only improves utility (relative to the utility pre-truncation), and does not affect privacy.\nAlgorithm 1 Laplace Mechanism on Posterior Updates 1: Input data D; graph I, {πi | i ∈ I}; parameter > 0 2: calculate posterior updates: ∆αi,j ,∆βi,j for all i ∈ I, j ∈ {0, 1}|πi|\n3: perturb updates: ∆α′i,j , ∆αi,j + Lap ( 2|I| ) ,\n∆β′i,j , ∆βi,j + Lap ( 2|I| ) .\n4: truncate: Z(1)i,j , 1[0,n](∆α ′ i,j), Z (2) i,j , 1[0,n](∆β ′ i,j) 5: output Zi,j = (Z (1) i,j , Z (2) i,j )\nPrivacy. To establish differential privacy of our mechanism, we must calculate a Lipschitz condition for the vector ∆ω called global sensitivity Dwork et al. (2006).\nLemma 1. For any neighbouring datasets D, D̃, the corresponding updates ∆ω,∆ω̃ satisfy ‖∆ω −∆ω̃‖1 ≤ 2|I|.\nProof. By changing the observations of one datum, at most two counts associated with each Xi can change by 1.\nCorollary 1. Algorithm 1 preserves -differential privacy.\nProof. Based on Lemma 1, the intermediate ∆ω′ preserve -differential privacy Dwork et al. (2006). Since truncation depends only on ∆ω′, theZ preserves the same privacy.\nUtility on Updates. Before bounding the effect on the posterior of the Laplace mechanism, we demonstrate a utility bound on the posterior update counts.\nProposition 1. With probability at least 1 − δ, for δ ∈ (0, 1), the update counts computed by Algorithm 1 are close to the non-private counts\n‖∆ω −∆ω′‖∞ ≤ 2|I| ln\n( 2m\nδ\n) ,\nwhere m = ∑ i∈I 2 |πi|.\nThis bound states that w.h.p., none of the updates can be perturbed beyondO(|I|2/ ). This implies the same bound on the deviation between ∆ω and the revealed truncated Z.\nUtility on Posterior. We derive our main utility bounds for Algorithm 1 in terms of posteriors, proved in the Appendix. We abuse notation, and use ξ to refer to the prior density; its meaning will be apparent from context. Given priors ξi,j(θi,j) = Beta (αi,j , βi,j), the posteriors on n observations are\nξi,j(θi,j |D) = Beta(αi,j + ∆αi,j , βi,j + ∆βi,j) .\nThe privacy-preserving posterior parametrised by the output of Algorithm 1 is ξ′i,j(θi,j |D) = Beta ( αi,j + Z (1) i,j , βi,j + Z (2) i,j ) .\nIt is natural to measure utility by the KL-divergence between the joint product posteriors ξ(θ|D) and ξ′(θ|D), which is the sum of the component-wise divergences, with each having known closed form. In our analysis, the divergence is a random quantity, expressible as the sum ∑m i,j fi,j(Zi,j), where the randomness is due to the added noise. We demonstrate this r.v. is not too big, w.h.p.\nTheorem 1. Let m = ∑ i∈I 2\n|πi|. Assume that Zi,j are independent and f is a mapping from Zm to R: f(· · · , zi,j , · · · ) , ∑ i,j fi,j(zi,j).

      "text" : "Algorithm 1 follows Kerckhoffs’s Principle Kerckhoffs (1883) of “no security through obscurity”: differential privacy defends against a mechanism-aware attacker. However additional stealth may be required in certain circumstances. An oblivious observer will be tipped off to our privacy-preserving activities by our independent perturbations, which are likely inconsistent with one-another (e.g., noisy counts forX1, X2 and X2, X3 will say different things about X2). To achieve differential privacy and stealth, we turn to Barak et al. (2007)’s study of consistent marginal contingency table release. This section presents a particularly natural application to Bayesian posterior updates.\nDenote by h ∈ R{0,1}|I| the contingency table over r.v.’s I induced by D: i.e., for each combination of variables j ∈ {0, 1}|I|, component or cell hj is a non-negative count of the observations in D with characteristic j. Geometrically h is a real-valued\nfunction over the |I|-dimensional Boolean hypercube. Then the parameter delta’s of our first mechanism correspond to cells of (|πi|+ 1)-way marginal contingency tables Cπi(h) where vector πi , πi+ei and the projection/marginalisation operator is defined as (\nCj(h) ) γ , ∑\nη:〈η,j〉=γ\nhη . (1)\nWe wish to release these statistics as before, however we will not represent them under their Euclidean coordinates but instead in the Fourier basis {f j : j ∈ {0, 1}|I|} where\nf jγ , (−1)〈γ,j〉2−|I|/2 .\nDue to this basis structure and linearity of the projection operator, any marginal contingency table must lie in the span of few projections of Fourier basis vectors Barak et al. (2007):\nTheorem 2. For any table h ∈ R{0,1}|I| and set of variables j ∈ {0, 1}|I|, the marginal table on j satisfies Cj(h) = ∑ γ j 〈fγ , h〉Cj(fγ).\nThis states that marginal j lies in the span of only those (projected) basis vectors fγ with γ contained in j. The number of values needed to update Xi is then 2|πi|+1, potentially far less than suggested by (1). To release updates for two r.v.’s i, j ∈ I there may well be significant overlap 〈πi, πj〉; we need to release once, coefficients 〈fγ , h〉 for γ in the downward closure of variable neighbourhoods:\nNI , ⋃ i∈I ⋃ j πi j .\nPrivacy. By (Barak et al., 2007, Theorem 6) we can apply Laplace additive noise to release these Fourier coefficients.\nCorollary 2. For any > 0, releasing for each γ ∈ NI the Fourier coefficient 〈fγ , h〉+ Lap ( 2|NI | −12−|I|/2 ) (and Algorithm 2) preserves -differential privacy.\nRemark 1. Since |NI | ≤ |I|21+maxi∈I indeg(i), at worst we have noise scale\n|I|22+maxi indeg(i)−|I|/2/ .\nThis compares favourably with Algorithm 1’s noise scale provided no r.v. is child to more than half the graph. Moreover the denser the graph—the more overlap between nodes’ parents and the less conditional independence assumed—the greater the reduction in scale. This is intuitively appealing.\nConsistency. What is gained by passing to the Fourier domain, is that the perturbed marginal tables of Corollary 2 are consistent: anything in the span of projected Fourier basis vectors corresponds to some valid contingency table on I with (possibly negative) real-valued cells Barak et al. (2007).\nAlgorithm 2 Laplace Mechanism in the Fourier Domain 1: Input data D; graph I, {πi | i ∈ I}; prior parameters α,β 0; parameters t, > 0\n2: define contingency table h ∈ R{0,1}|I| on D 3: define downward closure NI = ⋃ i∈I ⋃ j πi j 4: for γ ∈ NI do 5: Fourier coefficient zγ = 〈fγ , h〉+ Lap ( 2|NI | 2|I|/2\n) 6: end for 7: increment first coefficient z0 ← z0 + 4t|NI | 2\n2|I|/2\n8: for i ∈ I do 9: project marginal for Xi as hi = ∑ γ πi zγC\nπi(fγ) 10: for j πi do 11: output posterior param ( αij + h i ei+j , βij + h i j ) 12: end for 13: end for\nNon-negativity. So far we have described the first stage of Algorithm 2. The remainder yields stealth by guaranteeing releases that are non-negative w.h.p. We adapt an idea of Barak et al. (2007) to increase the coefficient of Fourier basis vector f0, affecting a small increment to each cell of the contingency table. While there is an exact minimal amount that would guarantee non-negativity, it is data dependent. Thus our efficient O (|NI |)-time approach is randomised.\nCorollary 3. For t > 0, adding 4t|NI |2 −12−k/2 to f0’s coefficient induces a nonnegative table w.p. ≥ 1− exp(−t).\nParameter t trades off between the probability of non-negativity and the resulting (minor) loss to utility. In the rare event of negativity, re-running Algorithm 2 affords another chance of stealth at the cost of privacy budget . We could alternatively truncate to achieve validity, sacrificing stealth but not privacy.\nUtility. Analogous to Proposition 1, each perturbed marginal is close to its unperturbed version w.h.p.\nTheorem 3. For each i ∈ I and δ ∈ (0, 1), the perturbed tables in Algorithm 2 satisfy with probability at least 1− δ:\n∥∥Cπi(h)− hi∥∥ 1 ≤ 4|NI | ( 2|πi| log |NI | δ + t|NI | ) .\nNote that the scaling of this bound is reasonable since the table hi involves 2|πi|+1\ncells."

The results are reported in Figure 1, where average performance is taken over 100 repeats to account for randomness in train/test split, and randomised mechanisms.\nThe small size of this data represents a challenge in our setting, since privacy is more difficult to preserve under smaller samples Dwork et al.

Following our generic mechanisms, the noise added to sufficient statistics is independent on training set size, and is similar in scale. t was set for the Fourier approach, so that stealth was achieved 90% of the time—those times that contributed to the plot.

To evaluate our approach we used the U.S. census records dataset from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series Minnesota Population Center (2009) with 370k records and 14 demographic features. To predict Annual Income, we train on 10% data with the remainder for testing. Figure 2 displays MSE under varying prior precision b (inverse of covariance) and weights with bounded norm 10/ √ b (chosen conservatively). As expected, more concentrated prior (larger b) leads to worse MSE for both mechanisms, as stronger priors reduce data influence. Compared with linear\nregression, private regression suffers only slightly worse MSE. At the same time the posterior sampler enjoys increasing privacy (that is proportional to the bounded norm as given in the Appendix)."

      "text" : "We have presented a suite of mechanisms for differentially-private inference in graphical models, in a Bayesian framework. The first two perturb posterior parameters to achieve privacy. This can be achieved either by performing perturbations in the original parameter domain, or in the frequency domain via a Fourier transform. Our third mechanism relies on the choice of a prior, in combination with posterior sampling. We complement our mechanisms for releasing the posterior, with private MAP point estimators. Throughout we have proved utility and privacy bounds for our mechanisms, which in most cases depend on the graph structure of the Bayesian network: naturally, conditional independence affects privacy. We support our new mechanisms and analysis with applications to two concrete models, with experiments exploring the privacyutility trade-off.\nAcknowledgements.

Recall that a normal linear regression model with i.i.d Gaussian noise is given as follows,\nyi = d∑ j=1 x (j) i w (j) + i, i ∼ N(0, σ2).\nThe normal likelihood function, as a product of likelihoods for each of the individual components of y = (y1, . . . , yn), is given by\npw(y|x,w;σ2) = 1 (2πσ2)n/2 e− 1 2σ2 (y−xw)T (y−xw).\nGiven observations D, we are interested in computing the sensitivity (in terms of data/observation) of this likelihood, that is supw,D,D′ | ln pw(D) pw(D′)\n|.

Our main contributions are four different algorithms for private Bayesian inference on probabilistic graphical models. These include two mechanisms for adding noise to the Bayesian updates, either directly to the posterior parameters, or to their Fourier transform so as to preserve update consistency. We also utilise a recently introduced posterior sampling mechanism, for which we prove bounds for the specific but general case of discrete Bayesian networks; and we introduce a maximum-a-posteriori private mechanism. Our analysis includes utility and privacy bounds, with a novel focus on the influence of graph structure on privacy. Worked examples and experiments with Bayesian naïve Bayes and Bayesian linear regression illustrate the application of our mechanisms.",
