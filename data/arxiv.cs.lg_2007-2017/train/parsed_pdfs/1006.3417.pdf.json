INTRODUCTION\nGame theory has recently been used as an effective tool to model and solve many security problems in computer and communication networks. In a noncooperative matrix game between an Attacker and a Defender, if the payoff matrices are assumed to be known to both players, each player can compute the set of Nash equilibria of the game and play one of these strategies to maximize her expected gain (or minimize its expected loss). However, in practice, the players do not necessarily have full knowledge of each other’s payoff matrix. For repeated games, a mechanism called fictitious play (FP) can be used for each player to learn her opponent’s motivations. In a FP process, each player observes all the actions and makes estimates of the mixed strategy of her opponent. At each stage, she updates this estimate and plays the pure strategy that is the best response (or generated based on the best response) to the current estimate of the other’s mixed strategy. It can be seen that in a FP process, if one player plays a fixed strategy (either of the pure or mixed type), the other player’s sequence of strategies will converge to the best response to this fixed strategy. Furthermore, it has been shown that, for many classes of games, such a FP process will finally render both players playing a Nash equilibrium (NE).\nThis research was supported by grants from the Deutsche Telekom Laboratories (Berlin, Germany) and the Boeing Company.\nTamer Başar and Kien C. Nguyen are with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Coordinated Science Laboratory, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1308 W Main St., Urbana, IL 61801, USA basar1@illinois.edu, knguyen4@illinois.edu\nTansu Alpcan is with the Deutsche Telekom Laboratories and the Technical University of Berlin, Ernst-Reuter-Platz 7, D-10587 Berlin, Germany tansu.alpcan@telekom.de\nSpecifically, we examine a two-player game, where an Attacker (denoted as player 1 or P1) and a Defender (denoted as player 2 or P2) participate in a discrete-time repeated nonzero-sum matrix game. In a general setting, the Attacker has m possible actions and the Defender has n posssible actions to choose from. For example, when m = n = 2, the Attacker’s actions could be to attack one node in a two-node network, and those of the Defender are to defend one of these two nodes. Players do not have access to each other’s payoff function. They adjust their strategies based on each other’s actions which they observe.\nIn a stochastic FP process, each player makes a maximum likelihood estimation of her opponent’s mixed strategy. As will be seen later on, this will result in a time-varying update of the opponent’s empirical frequency, where the weight of the action at time step k is 1/k. In a practical repeated security game, however, we notice a couple of possible complications. First, players may not have the exact and synchronized time steps. Second, each player may want to adjust the weight of the other’s current action to converge either faster or more accurately to the equilibrium. A more flexible scheme to update the estimate of the mixed strategy may be needed in such situations. Motivated by these practical considerations, we examine in this paper a time-invariant frequency update mechanism for fictitious play. Also, as a side note, such a time-invariant update mechanism will allow us to use the analysis tools applicable only to time-invariant systems.\nSecurity games have been examined extensively in a large number of papers, see for example, [1], [2], [3], [7], [18], [14]. Surveys on applications of game theory to network security can be found in [6], [17]. Relevant literature on fictitious play can be found in [16], [12], [5], [19], [20], [11], [13], [15]. A comprehensive exposition of learning in games can be found in [8].\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we provide an overview of the static game and the standard stochastic FP process, and then introduce the stochastic FP with time-invariant frequency update. The analysis for FP with time-invariant frequency update is given in Section III. In Section IV, we introduce an adaptive algorithm based on the time-invariant FP process. Next, simulation results are given in Section V. Finally, some concluding remarks will end the paper."

      "text" : "We consider here static security games, where each player Pi, i = 1, 2, has two possible actions (or pure strategies). We use vi, to denote the action of Pi. Let ∆(2) be the simplex in ℜ2, i.e.,\n∆(2) ≡ { s ∈ ℜ2|s1, s2 ≥ 0 and s1 + s2 = 1 } . (1)\nEach vi takes value in the set of (two) vertices of ∆(2): vi = [1 0]\nT for the first action, and vi = [0 1]T for the second action. In a static game, player Pi selects an action vi according to a mixed strategy pi ∈ ∆(2). The (instant) payoff for player Pi is1 vTi Miv−i + τiH(pi), where Mi is the payoff matrix of Pi, and H(pi) is the entropy of the probability vector pi, H(pi) = −pTi log(pi). The weighted entropy τiH(pi) with τi ≥ 0 is introduced to boost mixed strategies. In a security game, τi signifies how much player i wants to randomize its actions, and thus is not necessarily known to the other player. Also, for τ1 = τ2 = 0 (referred to as classical FP), the best response mapping can be setvalued, while it has a unique value when τi > 0 (referred to as stochastic FP). For a pair of mixed strategy (p1, p2), the utility functions are given by the expected payoffs:\nUi(pi, p−i) = E [ vTi Miv−i ] + τiH(pi)\n= pTi Mip−i + τiH(pi). (2)\nNow, the best response mappings βi : ∆(2) → ∆(2) are defined as:\nβi(p−i) = arg max pi∈∆(2) Ui(pi, p−i). (3)\nIf τi > 0, the best response is unique as mentioned earlier, and is given by:\nβi(p−i) = σ\n(\nMip−i τi\n)\n, (4)\nwhere the soft-max function σ : ℜ2 → Interior(∆(2)) is defined as\n(σ(x))j = exj\nex1 + ex2 , j = 1, 2. (5)\nNote that (σ(x))j > 0, and thus the range of the soft-max function is just the interior of the simplex.\n1As standard in the game theory literature, the index −i is used to indicate those of other players, or the opponent in this case.\nFinally, a (mixed strategy) Nash equilibrium is defined to be a pair (p̄1, p̄2) ∈ ∆(2)×∆(2) such that for all pi ∈ ∆(2)\nUi(pi, p̄−i) ≤ Ui(p̄i, p̄−i). (6)\nWe can also write a Nash equilibrium (p̄1, p̄2) as the fixed point of the best response mappings:\np̄i = βi(p̄−i), i = 1, 2. (7)"

      "text" : "We start the analysis with the following result for the static games given in Subsection II-A.\nProposition 1: The static 2-player 2-action game in II-A with Assumption 1 and τ1, τ2 > 0 admits a unique Nash equilibrium.\nProof: In what follows, let r1 ≡ (r11 , r 2 1) T , r2 ≡ (r12 , r 2 2) T , β1(r2) ≡ (β11(r2), β 2 1(r2))\nT , and β2(r2) ≡ (β12(r2), β 2 2(r2))\nT . We first use the Brouwer fixed point theorem (see for example [4]) to prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium, then use monotonicity of β11(r 1 2) and β12(r 1 1) to prove that the fixed point is unique. Here we write\nβ11(r 1 2) as a scalar-valued function of the only independent variable r12 using the fact that r2 ∈ ∆(2), or r 1 2 + r 2 2 = 1. Function β12(r 1 1) is defined similarly. Also, as r1, r2 ∈ ∆(2), a pair (r11 , r 1 2) completely specifies the estimated frequencies of the players. As seen from Equation (7), a Nash equilibrium (r̄1, r̄2) is a fixed point of the best response mapping:\nri = βi(r−i), i = 1, 2.\nIt suffices to write this mapping as r = β(r), where r = (r11 , r 1 2) T . Specifically, the mapping β can be detailed as:\nr11 = β 1 1(r 1 2) =\n(\nσ\n(\nM1r2 τ1\n))\n1\n= e\n{\n1 τ1 [ar1 2 +b(1−r1\n2 )] }\ne\n{\n1 τ1 [ar1 2 +b(1−r1\n2 )] }\n+ e\n{\n1 τ1 [cr1 2 +d(1−r1\n2 )] } .\nIt can be seen that β11(r 1 2) ∈ (0, 1). Similarly, we have\nr12 = β 1 2(r 1 1) ∈ (0, 1).\nThus β is a transformation from [0, 1]2 to [0, 1]2, which is a compact convex set. As both mappings β11 and β 1 2 that constitute β are continuous, β is also a continuous transformation. Using the Brouwer fixed point theorem, there exists at least one fixed point r̄ such that r̄ = β(r̄), which is a Nash equilibrium of the static game. Now we examine the derivatives of β11(r 1 2) and β 1 2(r 1 1) with respect to their own independent variables:\ndβ11(r2)\ndr12 =\n1 τ1 [(a− c) + (d− b)]β11(r2)β 2 1(r2),\ndβ12(r1)\ndr11 =\n1 τ2 [(e− f) + (h− g)]β21(r1)β 2 2(r1).\nFrom Assumption 1, (a − c) + (d − b) < 0 and (e − f) + (h − g) > 0. Thus β11(r 1 2) is strictly decreasing in r12 , and β 1 2(r 1 1) is strictly increasing in r 1 1 . Now suppose that there exist two distinct Nash equilibria, (r′1, r ′ 2) and (r ′′ 1 , r ′′\n2 ). Obviously, r′1 6= r ′′ 1 , otherwise we will have r ′ 2 = r ′′\n2 , and these two points coincide. Without loss of generality, assume that r′1 < r ′′ 1 . As β 1 2(r 1 1) is strictly increasing in r 1 1 , we have that r′2 < r ′′ 2 . However, β 1 1(r 1 2) is strictly decreasing in r 1 2 , so r′1 > r ′′\n1 , which is contradictory to the initial assumption. Thus the Nash equilibrium is unique. We illustrate in Figure 1 the curves β11(r 1 2) and β 1 2(r 1 1) with the values of M1, M2, τ1, and τ2 as shown. The intersection of these two curves is the Nash equilibrium of the static game."

(19)\nProof: As can be seen in Equations (14), this is a deterministic nonlinear discrete-time time-invariant system. We linearize the system at the fixed point and examine stability properties of the linearized system using techniques described in standard textbooks for nonlinear systems (e.g., [10]). Using the mean dynamic (14), where\nr1(k) =\n(\nr11(k) r21(k)\n)\n, r2(k) =\n(\nr12(k) r22(k)\n)\n, (20)\nit can be seen that a pair (r̄1, r̄2) that satisfies r̄i = βi(r̄−i), i = 1, 2, is a fixed point of the system.

The evolution of the game is based on a stochastic fictitious play process, where players do not have access to each other’s payoff matrix. Each has to observe the other’s actions up to present and plays the action generated based on the best response to these observations. In a regular fictitious play process, each player makes a maximum likelihood estimate of her opponent’s mixed strategy, which results in a time-varying update based on the previous estimate and current action. In this paper, we explore an alternative scheme for frequency update, whose mean dynamic is instead time-invariant. We examine convergence properties of the mean dynamic of the fictitious play process with such an update scheme, and establish local stability of the equilibrium point when both players are restricted to two actions. We also propose an adaptive algorithm based on this time-invariant frequency update.",
