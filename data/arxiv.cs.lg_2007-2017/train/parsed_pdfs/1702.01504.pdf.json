      "text" : "Support vector machines (SVMs) is a popular machine learning technique, owning to its theoretical and practical advantages, which has been successfully employed in many real-world application domains. However, when shifting to imbalanced dataset, SVM will produce an undesirable model that is biased toward the majority class and has low performance on the minority class. Imbalanced learning not only presents significant new challenges to the data research community [1,2,3] but also raises many critical questions in real-world data intensive applications.In fact, in most imbalanced learning problems, the misclassification error of the minority class is far costlier than that of the majority class. Following we will give an example to clarify this problem.\nFigure 1 is the mine and gas burst electromagnetic monitoring data for one month. The red line means taking place mine and gas burst accident on the date of 05/03/2011. One day before the accident, the blue line, means the burst premonition data, which is the object we focused on. If we can classify correctly the premonition data from the other normal data, we can pre-alarm the burst accident and avoid the accident taking place. From the Fig. 1, one month electromagnetic monitoring data is 7989, and there are only 210 premonition data. If we set the premonition data is positive class, and the other normal data is negative class, then the Imbalance Ratio, equals to the ratio of negative class data number and positive class data number, that is 37.04. In fact, the\n2\nmine and gas burst accident rarely take place, so the imbalance ratio even larger. For this burst electromagnetic monitoring data, we expect positive class and negative class can be classified correctly under this extreme imbalance ratio.\nSVMs classifier resist the data imbalance from three categories: Data level, Algorithm level and Hybrid methods. Data-level methods mainly includes oversampling and undersampling, which may have the danger of hardly maintain the original minor data distribution and also may lose the important majority data information seperately. Algorithm-level methods concentrate on modifying existing learners to alleviate their bias towards majority groups. Cost-sensitive methods is a typical representation of this category. The main problem is it is difficult to set the actual values in the cost matrix and often they are not given by expert beforehand in many real-life problems. The penalty parameter(C) is determined empirically, or is calculated according to the evaluation metric, which need to be computed iteratively and time consuming. Decision threshold adjustment is another kind of algorithm-level solution for dealing with class imbalance. Unlike the other correction techniques, decision threshold adjustment strategy runs after modeling a classifier. However, the existing decision threshold adjusting approaches generally give the moving distance of classification boundary empirically, but which cannot answer the question that how far the classification hyperplane should be moved towards the majority class. Hybrid methods usually combine the algorithmlevel methods and data-level methods to extract their strong points and reduce their weakness, which can be applied to arbitrary classifier and not only restrict to SVMs.\nFrom the other side, recently, one interesting directions indicates that imbalance ratio is not the sole source of learning difficulties. Even if the disproportion is high, but both classes are well represented and come from non-overlapping distribution we may obtain good classification rates using canonical classifiers. Nevertheless, a good\n3 imbalance learning algorithm should fully understand and exploit the minority class structure.\nThe cluster probability density function(PDF) can naturedly express the class structure and distribution.In this paper, we proposed an cluster Probability optimized CSSVM method ,named as PCS-SVM ,whose C value determined by the cluster probabilistic density function.We adjust the hyperplane through optimization the value of C for the positive class data, that is adjustment the upper bound of α . First, we introduce the L2 norm to optimization function, the dual Lagrangian form of the modified objective function includes the parameter of C+ and C−. Compared to the traditional SMO algorithm results, the new α expression function is only different from the similarity expression of support vector x and y. Then, we construct the connection between similarity and the cluster probability of two points. This is an important measure differentiate the probability density of majority class and minority class. Last, selection two opposite support vector, one is positive but false classified to negative, the other is true negative. By correcting a false negative support vector to a true positive support vector according to cluster possibility, achieve the decision boundary removing toward the majority (negative) class."

      "text" : "In previous work, the class imbalance correction strategies for SVM mainly includes resampling [4] ,cost-sensitive [5,6], decision threshold adjustment [7], and hybrid methods [8]. Resampling can be accomplished either by oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class. However, both sampling techniques have their advantages and disadvantage. Oversampling makes the classifier overfitting and increases the time of modeling, while undersampling often causes information loss.In order to bypass this problem, [4] proposed a Model-Based Oversampling method for imbalanced time series data considering the sequence structure when oversampling. Considering data structure and distribution is the trend of this area.\nThe Different Error Costs (DEC) method is a cost-sensitive learning solution proposed in [9] to overcome the same cost (i.e. C) for both positive and negative misclassification in the penalty term. As given in Equation (1)\nmin( 1 2 ‖w‖2 +C+ ∑\nyi=+1 ξi +C− ∑ yi=−1 ξi) (1)\ns.t.\n{\nyi − (wT xi + b)> 1− ξi ξi > 0\nIn this method, the SVM soft margin objective function is modified to assign two misclassification costs, C+ and C− is the misclassification cost for positive and negative class examples separately. As a rule of thumb, [10] have reported that reasonably good classification results could be retained from the DEC method by setting the C−/C+ equal to the minority-to-majority class ratio. One-class Learning [11] trained an SVM model only with the minority class examples. [12] assigned C− = 0 and C+ = 1/N+, these methods have been observed to be more effective than general data rebalancing\n4 methods. zSVM is another algorithm modification proposed for SVMs in [13] to learn from imbalance datasets, which is an typical decision threshold adjustment method. In this method, first an SVM model is developed by using the original imbalanced training dataset. Then, the decision boundary of the resulted model is modified to remove its bias toward the majority class. In zSVM method, the magnitude of the α+i is increased by multiplying all of them by a particular value z. Then, the modified SVM decision function can be represented as follows:\nf (x) = sign(z∗ N1\n∑ i=1\nα+i yiK(xi,x)+ N2\n∑ i=1 α−i yiK(xi,x)+b) (2)\nThe z value is optimized by gradually increasing the value of z from 0 to some positive value, M, and G-mean is adopted as the evaluation measure to determine the optimal z. The speed and efficiency of zSVM determined by the step length from 0 to M."

Under this condition, given α1 is negative and α2 is positive, the optimization function turns into:\nL(α2) = γ − sα2 +α2 − 1 2 (γ − sα2)2K11 − 1 2 α22 K22 − s(γ − sα2)α2K12\n− y1(γ − sα2)v1 − y2α2v2 + constant− α21\n4C− − α22 4C+\n(13)\nThen in order to simplicity, we give C− = 1, and due to α1 = γ − sα2, s = y1 ∗ y2 = −1, derivate of Equation (13), the results is\n− s+ 1+ sγK11−K11α2 −α2K22 − sγK12 + 2α2K12 + sy1v1 − y2v2 − α2\n2C+ − α2 2 = 0\n⇒ αnew2 = y2(E1 −E2)+αold2 (K11 +K22 − 2K12)\nK11 +K22 − 2(K12 − 1\n4C+ − 1 4 )\n(14)\nCompared to Equation (11), the expression of αnew2 has the change in denominator:\nFrom K11 +K22 − 2K12 to K11 +K22 − 2(K12 − 1\n4C+ − 1 4 )\nFrom the Equation (14), we can conclude that considering the cost of false positive classification can by means of adjusting the value of similarity matrix, that is, update the similarity of K12 to Knew12 = K old 12 − 1 4C+ − 1 4 . Through this adjustment, the new value of α2 will decrease, under the condition of the other α unchanged, ‖w‖= p ∑\ni=1 αiyixi will\nalso decrease, that is, the max margin of hyperplane will increase. As the positive support vector we selected are unchanged, increasing of max margin means the hyperplane move towards the majority data. Then, we will discuss how to determine the value of Knew12 .\nIn Fig. 2, green points are the minority (positive) class, and the yellow points are the majority (negative) class. At the first, in order to maintain the correctness of majority class, the hyperplane is bias against the minority, whereas the false negative rate is high. Based on the first classifier model, we select two nearest support vectors, one is false negative (point A, in red color), and the other is true positive (point B, in green color). For the old hyperplane (shown as in Fig. 2(a)), point A is more near to the negative point according to the similarity function than the other positive ones. If we can adjust the similarity of point A and its nearest true positive neighbor (such as point B), let the similarity larger than the similarity of point B and its nearest true positive neighbor (such as point C), then the new hyperplane (shown as in Fig. 2(b)) will classify the point A correctly.\nThe next problem is how to determine the new Knew12 . We only know that using the old learning model, A and B are classified as different class, and B and C are classified as the same class. If we suppose the probabilistic density function of minority cluster is P1(Ki j), and that of different cluster is P0(Ki j), then the probability of B and C belong to the minority cluster is pBC = P1(KBC), and the probability of A and B belong to the\ndifferent cluster is pAB = P0(KAB), the probability of A and B belong to the minority cluster is pnewAB = P1(KAB). Then we can get the Equation (15)\nKAB KnewAB ∝ pAB pnewAB , KAB KBC ∝ pAB pBC\n(15)\nUnder the same probabilistic density function P1(Ki j), if we hope pnewAB > pBC, then KnewAB > KBC, we can get:\nKAB KnewAB ≤ KAB KBC ∝ pAB pBC ⇒ KABnew ≥ k×KAB × pBC pAB\n(16)\nKnewAB = KAB − 1\n4C+ − 1 4 > k×KAB × pBC pAB\n⇒ KAB(1− k× pBC pAB )− 1 4 > 1 4C+ ⇒ KAB · pAB − k× pBC\npAB − 1 4 > 1 4C+\n⇒C+ > pAB\n4KAB(pAB − k× pBC)− pAB\nWithout loss of generality, we set k = 1. In Equation (16), the value of C+ depends on three parameters, KAB, pAB and pBC. KAB is known, so the problem is how to obtain the pAB and pBC. According to the reference [14], the similarity matrix W is modeled as\n8 beta distributions, which are defined on the interval of (0, 1), parameterized by two positive shape parameters α and β . In this case, let Wi j is a sample from a beta distribution that is parameterized by Θk = (αk,βk), such that it is skewed towards one. If Wi j is in off-diagonal blocks, then let Θ0 = (α0,β0) be the parameters for the beta distribution, then it is smaller than any other beta distributions. The probability density function of Wi j can be expressed as:\np(Wi j|{Θk}Kk=1,Θ0,Z) = Beta(Wi j|α0,β0) 1−∑Kk zikz jk\nK\n∏ k=1 Beta(Wi j|αk,βk)zikz jk (17)\nzn is a K-element cluster indicator zn = {znk}Kk=1 such that znk = 1 if xn belongs to the kth cluster, and otherwise znk = 0. zn follows a categorical distribution, and π is a sample from a symmetric Dirichlet distribution\nThe prior distributions to the beta distribution parameters Θk and Θ0 are given:\np{Θk|ς)∞Beta( αk\nαk +βk |ας ,βς )Lognormal(αk +βk|µς ,σ2ς ) (18)\np{Θ0|η)∞Beta( αk\nαk +βk |αη ,βη)Lognormal(αη +βη |µη ,σ2η) (19)\nWe want to calculate the posterior distribution for the latent variables given the observed similarity matrix and the hyper-parameters, i.e.\np(π ,Z,{Θk}Kk=1,Θ0|W,ς ,η ,λ ) (20)\nIt is computationally intractable to directly calculate this posterior distribution. Therefore, a vibrational distribution q(π ,Z,{Θk}Kk=1,Θ0) is used to approximate the posterior distribution p. This distribution q can be factorized such that\nq(π ,Z,{Θk}Kk=1,Θ0) = qπ(π) N\n∏ n=1\nqzn(zn) K\n∏ k=1 qΘk(Θk)qΘ0(Θ0) (21)\nThen estimate each factorization using W,ς ,η ,λ and lastly get the probability of (19). Lastly, according to the similarity matrix and given hyper-parameters, we can get the element probability density function of Wi j, namely, the value of p0 and p2."

We focus on binary-class imbalanced problem, however, our method can be easily extended to multi-class imbalance classification. Information about standard benchmark datasets data sets is summarized in Table 1.\nFirst, we tested our proposed algorithm in comparison with five other single classification algorithms based on SVM, including:\n1. Standard SVM (SSVM): SVM classifier without any class imbalance correction technologies. 2. SVM with random undersampling (SVM-RUS): It firstly adopts RUS to preprocess the original training set, then trains SVM classifier using the balanced training data. 3. SVM with random oversampling (SVM-ROS): It first adopts ROS to preprocess the original training set, then trains SVM with classifier using the balanced training data. 4. SVM with SMOTE (SVM-SMOTE) [15]: It firstly adopts SMOTE algorithm to oversampling the minority class instances and to make the data set balance, then trains SVM classifier using the balanced training data. 5. Weighted SVM (CS-SVM) [10] : It assigns different values for the penalty factor C belong to different classes, to guarantee the fairness of classifier modeling, we make C+/C− equal to imbalance ratio (IR).\nIn the experiments, for each data set, we performed a fivefold cross validation. In views of the randomness of classification results, we repeated the cross-validation process for 20 times and provided the results in the mean values. All algorithms were\n10\nimplemented in Matlab 2015b running environment and SVM was realized by libSVM toolbox. Specifically, for SVM, polynomial kernel and RBF kernel function was adopted, the penalty factor C and the width parameter σ of RBF function were all tuned by using grid search. We evaluated these six classification algorithms by three mainly used evaluation criterions in imbalanced classification: F-measure, G mean and AUC. For each evaluation criterions and kernel function, we separate our method into two groups: one group is algorithm-level SVM method, our method PCS-SVM is compared with SVM and CS-SVM; The other group is sampling-level SVM method, our method combined with SMOTE named as PCS-SMOTE-SVM is compared with undersampling(SVM-RUS), oversampling (SVM-ROS) and SMOTE sampling SVM methods (SVM-SMOTE)."

Cost-sensitive adjustment approach is a typical algorithm-level method resisting the data set imbalance. For SVMs classifier, which is modified to incorporate varying penalty parameter(C) for each of considered groups of examples. However, the C value is determined empirically, or is calculated according to the evaluation metric, which need to be computed iteratively and time consuming. This paper presents a novel cost-sensitive SVM method whose penalty parameter C optimized on the basis of cluster probability density function(PDF) and the cluster PDF is estimated only according to similarity matrix and some predefined hyper-parameters. Experimental results on various standard benchmark data sets and real-world data with different ratios of imbalance show that the proposed method is effective in comparison with commonly used cost-sensitive techniques.",
