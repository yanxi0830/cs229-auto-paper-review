      "text" : "We consider the standard K-armed adversarial bandit problem, which is a game played over T rounds between a learner and an adversary. In every round t ∈ {1, . . . , T } the learner chooses a probability distribution pt = (pi,t)16i6K over {1, . . . ,K}. The adversary then chooses a loss vector ℓt = (ℓi,t)16i6K ∈ [0, 1]K , which may depend on pt. Finally the learner samples an action from pt denoted by It ∈ {1, . . . ,K} and observes her own loss ℓIt,t. The learner would like to minimise her regret, which is the difference between cumulative loss suffered and the loss suffered by the optimal action in hindsight.\nRT (ℓ1:T ) =\nT∑\nt=1\nℓIt,t − min 16i6K\nT∑\nt=1\nℓi,t ,\nwhere ℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]TK is the set of losses chosen by the adversary. A famous strategy is called Exp3, which satisfies E[RT (ℓ1:T )] = O( √\nKT log(K))) where the expectation is taken over the randomness in the algorithm and the choices of the adversary [Auer et al., 2002]. There is also a lower bound showing that for every learner there is an adversary for which the expected regret is E[RT (ℓ1:T )] = Ω( √ KT ) [Auer et al., 1995]. If the losses are chosen ahead of time, then the adver-\nsary is called oblivious, and in this case there exists a learner for which E[RT (ℓ1:T )] = O( √ KT ) [Audibert and Bubeck, 2009]. One might think that this is the end of the story, but it is not so. While the worst-case expected regret is one quantity of interest, there are many situations where a refined regret guarantee is more informative. Recent research on adversarial bandits has primarily focussed on these issues, especially the questions of obtaining regret guarantees that hold with high probability as well as stronger guarantees when the losses are “nice” in some sense. While there are now a wide range of strategies with upper bounds that depend on various quantities, the literature is missing lower bounds for many cases, some of which we now provide.\nWe focus on three classes of lower bound, which are described in detail below. The first addresses the optimal regret achievable with high probability, where we show there is little room for improvement over existing strategies. Our other results concern lower bounds that depend on some kind of regularity in the losses (“nice” data). Specifically we prove lower bounds that replace T in the regret bound with the loss of the best action (called first-order bounds) and also with the quadratic variation of the losses (called second-order bounds).\nHigh probability bounds Existing strategies Exp3.P [Auer et al., 2002] and Exp-IX [Neu, 2015] are tuned with a confidence parameter δ ∈ (0, 1) and satisfy for some universal constant c > 0\nP\n(\nRT (ℓ1:T ) > c √ KT log(K/δ) ) 6 δ . (1)\nAn alternative tuning of Exp-IX or Exp3.P [Bubeck and Cesa-Bianchi, 2012] leads to a single algorithm for which\n∀δ ∈ (0, 1) P ( RT (ℓ1:T ) > c √ KT ( √ log(K) + log(1/δ) √\nlog(K)\n))\n6 δ . (2)\nThe difference is that in (1) the algorithm depends on δ while in (2) it does not. The cost of not knowing δ is that the log(1/δ) moves outside the square root. In Section 2 we prove two lower bounds showing that there is little room for improvement in either (1) or (2).\nFirst-order bounds An improvement over the worst-case regret bound of O( √ TK) is the socalled improvement for small losses. Specifically, there exist strategies (eg., FPL-TRIX by Neu [2015] with earlier results by Stoltz [2005], Allenberg et al. [2006], Rakhlin and Sridharan [2013]) such that for all ℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]KT\nE[RT (ℓ1:T )] 6 O (√ L∗TK log(K) +K log(KT ) )\n, with L∗T = min 16i6K\nT∑\nt=1\nℓi,t , (3)\nwhere the expectation is with respect to the internal randomisation of the algorithm (the losses are fixed). This result improves on the O( √ KT ) bounds since L∗T 6 T is always guaranteed and sometimes L∗T is much smaller than T . In order to evaluate the optimality of this bound, we first rewrite it in terms of the small-loss balls Bα,T defined for all α ∈ [0, 1] and T > 1 by\nBα,T , { ℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]KT : L∗T T 6 α } . (4)\nCorollary 1. The first-order regret bound (3) of Neu [2015] is equivalent to:\n∀α ∈ [0, 1], sup ℓ1:T∈Bα,T\nE[RT (ℓ1:T )] 6 O (√ αTK log(K) +K log(KT ) ) .\nThe proof is straightforward. Our main contribution in Section 3 is a lower bound of the order of√ αTK for all α ∈ Ω(log(T )/T ). This minimax lower bound shows that we cannot hope for a better bound than (3) (up to log factors) if we only know the value of L∗T .\nSecond-order bounds Another type of improved regret bound was derived by Hazan and Kale [2011b] and involves a second-order quantity called the quadratic variation.\nQT =\nT∑\nt=1\n‖ℓt − µT ‖22 6 TK\n4 , (5)\nwhere µT = 1T ∑T\nt=1 ℓt is the mean of all loss vectors. (In other words, QT /T is the sum of the empirical variances of all the K arms). Hazan and Kale [2011b] addressed the general online linear optimisation setting. In the particular case of adversarial K-armed bandits with an oblivious adversary (as is the case here), they showed that there exists an efficient algorithm such that for some absolute constant c > 0 and for all T > 2\n∀ℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]KT , E[RT (ℓ1:T )] 6 c ( K2 √ QT logT +K 1.5 log2 T +K2.5 logT ) . (6)\nAs before we can rewrite the regret bound (6) in terms of the small-variation balls Vα,T defined for all α ∈ [0, 1/4] and T > 1 by\nVα,T , {\nℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]KT : QT TK 6 α\n}\n. (7)\nCorollary 2. The second-order regret bound (6) of Hazan and Kale [2011b] is equivalent to:\n∀α ∈ [0, 1/4], sup ℓ1:T∈Vα,T\nE[RT (ℓ1:T )] 6 c ( K2 √ αTK logT +K3/2 log2 T +K5/2 log T ) .\nThe proof is straightforward because the losses are deterministic and fixed in advance by an oblivious adversary. In Section 4 we provide a lower bound of order √ αTK that holds whenever α = Ω(log(T )/T ). This minimax lower bound shows that we cannot hope for a bound better than (7) by more than a factor of K2 √ logT if we only know the value of QT . Closing the gap is left as an open question.\nTwo impossibility results in the bandit setting We also show in Section 4 that, in contrast to the full-information setting, regret bounds involving the cumulative variance of the algorithm as in [Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2007] cannot be obtained in the bandit setting. More precisely, we prove that two consequences that hold true in the full-information case, namely: (i) a regret bound proportional to the effective range of the losses and (ii) a bounded regret if one arm performs best at all rounds, must fail in the worst case for every bandit algorithm.\nAdditional notation and key tools Before the theorems we develop some additional notation and describe the generic ideas in the proofs. For 1 6 i 6 K let Ni(t) be the number of times action i has been chosen after round t. All our lower bounds are derived by analysing the regret incurred by strategies when facing randomised adversaries that choose the losses for all actions from the same joint distribution in every round (sometimes independently for each action and sometimes not). Ber(α) denotes the Bernoulli distribution with parameter α ∈ [0, 1]. If P and Q are measures on the same probability space, then KL(P,Q) is the KL-divergence between them. For a < b we define clip[a,b](x) = min {b,max {a, x}} and for x, y ∈ R we let x ∨ y = max{x, y}. Our main tools throughout the analysis are the following information-theoretic lemmas. The first bounds the KL divergence between the laws of the observed losses/actions for two distributions on the losses.\nLemma 1. Fix a randomised bandit algorithm and two probability distributions Q1 and Q2 on [0, 1]K . Assume the loss vectors ℓ1, . . . , ℓT ∈ [0, 1]K are drawn i.i.d. from either Q1 or Q2, and denote by Qj the joint probability distribution on all sources of randomness when Qj is used (formally, Qj = Pint ⊗ (Q⊗Tj ), where Pint is the probability distribution used by the algorithm for its internal randomisation). Let t > 1. Denote by ht = (Is, ℓIs,s)16s6t−1 the history available at the beginning of round t, by Q(ht,It)j the law of (ht, It) under Qj , and by Qj,i the ith marginal distribution of Qj . Then,\nKL (\nQ (ht,It) 1 ,Q (ht,It) 2\n)\n=\nK∑\ni=1\nEQ1 [ Ni(t− 1) ] KL ( Q1,i, Q2,i ) .\nResults of roughly this form are well known and the proof follows immediately from the chain rule for the relative entropy and the independence of the loss vectors across time (see [Auer et al., 2002] or Appendix A). One difference is that the losses need not be independent across the arms, which we heavily exploit in our proofs by using correlated losses. The second key lemma is an alternative to Pinsker’s inequality that proves useful when the Kullback-Leibler divergence is larger than 2. It has previously been used for bandit lower bounds (in the stochastic setting) by Bubeck et al. [2013].\nLemma 2 (Lemma 2.6 in Tsybakov 2008). Let P and Q be two probability distributions on the same measurable space. Then, for every measurable subset A (whose complement we denote by Ac),\nP (A) +Q(Ac) > 1\n2 exp\n( −KL(P,Q) ) ."

      "text" : "We prove two new high-probability lower bounds on the regret of any bandit algorithm. The first shows that no strategy can enjoy smaller regret than Ω( √\nKT log(1/δ)) with probability at least 1− δ. Upper bounds of this form have been shown for various algorithms including Exp.3P [Auer et al., 2002] and Exp3-IX [Neu, 2015]. Although this result is not very surprising, we are not aware of any existing work on this problem and the proof is less straightforward than one might expect. An added\nbenefit of our result is that the loss sequences producing large regret have two special properties. First, the optimal arm is the same in every round and second the range of the losses in each round is O( √ K log(1/δ)/T ). These properties will be useful in subsequent analysis. In the second lower bound we show that any algorithm for which E[RT (ℓ1:T )] = O( √ KT ) must\nnecessarily suffer a high probability regret of at least Ω( √ KT log(1/δ)) for some sequence ℓ1:T . The important difference relative to the previous result is that strategies with log(1/δ) appearing inside the square root depend on a specific value of δ, which must be known in advance. Theorem 1. Suppose K > 2 and δ ∈ (0, 1/4) and T > 32(K − 1) log(2/δ), then there exists a sequence of losses ℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]KT such that\nP\n(\nRT (ℓ1:T ) > 1\n27\n√ (K − 1)T log(1/(4δ)) ) > δ/2 ,\nwhere the probability is taken with respect to the randomness in the algorithm. Furthermore ℓ1:T can be chosen in such a way that there exists an i such that for all t it holds that ℓi,t = minj ℓj,t and maxj,k{ℓj,t − ℓk,t} 6 √ (K − 1) log(1/(4δ))/T/(4 √ log 2).\nTheorem 2. Suppose K > 2, T > 1, and there exists a strategy and constant C > 0 such that for any ℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]KT it holds that E[RT (ℓ1:T )] 6 C √\n(K − 1)T . Let δ ∈ (0, 1/4) satisfy √\n(K − 1)/T log(1/(4δ)) 6 C and T > 32 log(2/δ). Then there exists ℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]KT for which\nP\n(\nRT (ℓ1:T ) >\n√\n(K − 1)T log(1/(4δ)) 203C\n)\n> δ/2 ,\nwhere the probability is taken with respect to the randomness in the algorithm.\nCorollary 3. If p ∈ (0, 1) and C > 0, then there does not exist a strategy such that for all T , K , ℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]KT and δ ∈ (0, 1) the regret is bounded by P ( RT (ℓ1:T ) > C √ (K − 1)T logp(1/δ) ) 6 δ.\nThe corollary follows easily by integrating the assumed high-probability bound and applying Theorem 2 for sufficiently large T and small δ. The proof may be found in Appendix E.\nProof of Theorems 1 and 2 Both proofs rely on a carefully selected choice of correlated stochastic losses described below. Let Z1, Z2, . . . , ZT be a sequence of i.i.d. Gaussian random variables with mean 1/2 and variance σ2 = 1/(32 log(2)). Let ∆ ∈ [0, 1/30] be a constant that will be chosen differently in each proof and define K random loss sequences ℓ11:T , . . . , ℓ K 1:T where\nℓji,t =\n \n clip[0,1](Zt −∆) if i = 1 clip[0,1](Zt − 2∆) if i = j 6= 1 clip[0,1](Zt) otherwise .\nFor 1 6 j 6 K let Qj be the measure on ℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]KT and I1, . . . , IT when ℓi,t = ℓji,t for all 1 6 i 6 K and 1 6 t 6 T . Informally, Qj is the measure on the sequence of loss vectors and actions when the learner interacts with the losses sampled from the jth environment defined above. Lemma 3. Let δ ∈ (0, 1) and suppose ∆ 6 1/30 and T > 32 log(2/δ). Then Qi ( RT (ℓ i 1:T ) > ∆T/4 ) > Qi (Ni(T ) 6 T/2)− δ/2 and EQi [RT (ℓi1:T )] > 7∆EQi [T −Ni(T )]/8.\nThe proof may be found in Appendix D.\nProof of Theorem 1. First we choose the value of ∆ that determines the gaps in the losses by ∆ = √\nσ2(K − 1) log(1/(4δ))/(2T ) 6 1/30. By the pigeonhole principle there exists an i > 1 for which EQ1 [Ni(T )] 6 T/(K−1). Therefore by Lemmas 2 and 1, and the fact that the KL divergence between clipped Gaussian distributions is always smaller than without clipping (see Lemma 7 in Appendix B),\nQ1 (N1(T ) 6 T/2) +Qi (N1(T ) > T/2) > 1\n2 exp\n( −KL (\nQ (hT ,IT ) 1 ,Q (hT ,IT ) i\n))\n> 1\n2 exp\n(\n−EQ1 [Ni(T )](2∆) 2\n2σ2\n)\n> 1\n2 exp\n(\n− 2T∆ 2\nσ2(K − 1)\n)\n= 2δ .\nBut by Lemma 3\nmax k∈{1,i}\nQk ( RT (ℓ k 1:T ) > T∆/4 ) > max {Q1 (N1(T ) 6 T/2) , Qi (Ni(T ) 6 T/2)} − δ/2\n> 1\n2 (Q1 (N1(T ) 6 T/2) +Qi (N1(T ) > T/2))− δ/2 > δ/2 .\nTherefore there exists an i ∈ {1, . . . ,K} such that\nQi\n(\nRT (ℓ i 1:T ) >\n√\nσ2T (K − 1) 32 log\n( 1\n4δ\n))\n= Qi ( RT (ℓ i 1:T ) > T∆/4 ) > δ/2 .\nThe result is completed by substituting the value of σ2 = 1/(32 log(2)) and by noting that maxj,k{ℓj,t − ℓk,t} 6 2∆ 6 √ (K − 1) log(1/(4δ))/T/(4 √ log 2) Qi-almost surely.\nProof of Theorem 2. By the assumption on δ we have ∆ = 7σ 2\n16C √ K−1 T log ( 1 4δ ) 6 1/30. Suppose\nfor all i > 1 that\nEQ1 [Ni(T )] > σ2\n2∆2 log\n( 1\n4δ\n)\n.

Therefore there exists an i > 1 for which Eq. (8) does not hold. Then by the same argument as the previous proof it follows that\nmax k∈{1,i} Qk\n(\nRT (ℓ k 1:T ) >\n7σ2\n4 · 16C √ (K − 1)T log 1 4δ\n)\n= max k∈{1,i}\nQk ( RT (ℓ k 1:T ) > T∆/4 ) > δ/2 .\nThe result is completed by substituting the value of σ2 = 1/(32 log(2))."

      "heading" : "3 First-Order Lower Bound",
      "text" : "First-order upper bounds provide improvement over minimax bounds when the loss of the optimal action is small. Recall from Corollary 1 that first-order bounds can be rewritten in terms of the smallloss balls Bα,T defined in (4). Theorem 3 below provides a new lower bound of order √ L∗TK, which matches the best existing upper bounds up to logarithmic factors. As is standard for minimax results this does not imply a lower bound on every loss sequence ℓ1:T . Instead it shows that we cannot hope for a better bound if we only know the value of L∗T . Theorem 3. Let K > 2, T > K ∨ 118, and α ∈ [(c log(32T ) ∨ (K/2))/T, 1/2], where c = 64/9. Then for any randomised bandit algorithm supℓ1:T∈Bα,T E[RT (ℓ1:T )] > √ αTK/27, where the expectation is taken with respect to the internal randomisation of the algorithm.\nOur proof is inspired by that of Auer et al. [2002, Theorem 5.1]. The key difference is that we take Bernoulli distributions with parameter close to α instead of 1/2. This way the best cumulative loss L∗T is ensured to be concentrated around αT , and the regret lower bound √ αTK ≈ √\nα(1 − α)TK can be seen to involve the variance α(1 − α)T of the binomial distribution with parameters α and T .\nFirst we state the stochastic construction of the losses and prove a general lemma that allows us to prove Theorem 3 and will also be useful in Section 4 to a derive a lower bound in terms of the quadratic variation. Let ε ∈ [0, 1 − α] be fixed and define K probability distributions (Qj)Kj=1 on [0, 1]KT such that under Qj the following hold:\n• All random losses ℓi,t for 1 6 i 6 K and 1 6 t 6 T are independent. • ℓi,t is sampled from a Bernoulli distribution with parameterα+ε if i 6= j, or with parameter α if i = j.\nLemma 4. Let α ∈ (0, 1), K > 2, and T > K/(4(1−α)). Consider the probability distributionsQj on [0, 1]KT defined above with ε = (1/2) √\nα(1− α)K/T , and set Q̄ = 1K ∑K\nj=1 Qj . Then for any randomised bandit algorithm E[RT (ℓ1:T )] > √\nα(1 − α)TK/8, where the expectation is with respect to both the internal randomisation of the algorithm and the random loss sequence ℓ1:T which is drawn from Q̄.\nThe assumption T > K/(4(1− α)) above ensures that ε 6 1− α, so that the Qj are well defined.\nProof of Lemma 4. We lower bound the regret by the pseudo-regret for each distribution Qj :\nEQj\n[ T∑\nt=1\nℓIt,t − min 16i6K\nT∑\nt=1\nℓi,t\n]\n> EQj\n[ T∑\nt=1\nℓIt,t\n]\n− min 16i6K EQj\n[ T∑\nt=1\nℓi,t\n]\n=\nT∑\nt=1\nEQj [ α+ ε− ε1{It=j} ] − Tα = Tε\n(\n1− 1 T\nT∑\nt=1\nQj(It = j)\n)\n, (9)\nwhere the first equality follows because EQj [ℓIt,t] = EQj [EQj [ℓIt,t|ℓ1:t−1, It]] = EQj [α + ε − ε1{It=j}] since under Qj , the conditional distribution of ℓt given (ℓ1:t−1, It) is simply ⊗Ki=1B(α + ε − ε1{i=j}). To bound (9) from below, note that by Pinsker’s inequality we have for all t ∈ {1, . . . , T } and j ∈ {1, . . . ,K}, Qj(It = j) 6 Q0(It = j) + (KL(QIt0 ,QItj )/2)1/2, where Q0 = Ber(α)⊗KT is the joint probability distribution that makes all the ℓi,t i.i.d. Ber(α), and Q It 0 and Q It j denote the laws of It under Q0 and Qj respectively. Plugging the last inequality above into (9), averaging over j = 1, . . . ,K and using the concavity of the square root yields\nEQ̄\n[ T∑\nt=1\nℓIt,t − min 16i6K\nT∑\nt=1\nℓi,t\n]\n> Tε\n\n1− 1 K −\n√ √ √ √ 1\n2T\nT∑\nt=1\n1\nK\nK∑\nj=1\nKL ( Q\nIt 0 ,Q It j\n)\n\n , (10)\nwhere we recall that Q̄ = 1K ∑K\nj=1 Qj . The rest of the proof is devoted to upper-bounding KL(QIt0 ,Q It j ). Denote by ht = (Is, ℓIs,s)16s6t−1 the history available at the beginning of round t. From Lemma 1\nKL (\nQ It 0 ,Q It j\n) 6 KL (\nQ (ht,It) 0 ,Q (ht,It) j\n)\n= EQ0 [ Nj(t− 1) ] KL ( B(α+ ε),B(α) )\n6 EQ0 [ Nj(t− 1)\n] ε2\nα(1− α) , (11)\nwhere the last inequality follows by upper bounding the KL divergence by the χ2 divergence (see Appendix B). Averaging (11) over j ∈ {1, . . . ,K} and t ∈ {1, . . . , T } and noting that ∑Tt=1(t − 1) 6 T 2/2 we get\n1\nT\nT∑\nt=1\n1\nK\nK∑\nj=1\nKL ( Q\nIt 0 ,Q It j\n) 6 1\nT\nT∑\nt=1\n(t− 1)ε2 Kα(1− α) 6\nTε2\n2Kα(1− α) .\nPlugging the above inequality into (10) and using the definition of ε = (1/2) √ α(1− α)K/T yields\nEQ̄\n[ T∑\nt=1\nℓIt,t − min 16i6K\nT∑\nt=1\nℓi,t\n]\n> Tε\n(\n1− 1 K − 1 4\n)\n> 1\n8\n√\nα(1− α)TK .\nProof of Theorem 3. We show that there exists a loss sequence ℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]KT such that L∗T 6 αT and E[RT (ℓ1:T )] > (1/27) √ αTK. Lemma 4 above provides such kind of lower bound, but without the guarantee on L∗T . For this purpose we will use Lemma 4 with a smaller value of α (namely, α/2) and combine it with Bernstein’s inequality to prove that L∗T 6 Tα with high probability.\nPart 1: Applying Lemma 4 with α/2 (note that T > K > K/(4(1−α)) by assumption on T and α) and noting that maxj EQj [RT (ℓ1:T )] > EQ̄[RT (ℓ1:T )] we get that for some j ∈ {1, . . . ,K} the probability distribution Qj defined with ε = (1/2) √ (α/2)(1− α/2)K/T satisfies\nEQj [RT (ℓ1:T )] > 1\n8\n√ α\n2\n(\n1− α 2\n)\nTK > 1\n32\n√ 6αTK (12)\nsince α 6 1/2 by assumption.\nPart 2: Next we prove that Qj(L ∗ T > Tα) 6\n1\n32T . (13)\nTo this end, first note that L∗T 6 ∑T\nt=1 ℓj,t. Second, note that under Qj , the ℓj,t, t > 1, are i.i.d. Ber(α/2). We can thus use Bernstein’s inequality: applying Theorem 2.10 (and a remark on p.38) of Boucheron et al. [2013] with Xt = ℓj,t − α/2 6 1 = b, with v = T (α/2)(1 − α/2), and with c = b/3 = 1/3), we get that, for all δ ∈ (0, 1), with Qj-probability at least 1− δ,\nL∗T 6\nT∑\nt=1\nℓj,t 6 Tα\n2 +\n√\n2T α\n2\n(\n1− α 2\n)\nlog 1\nδ +\n1 3 log 1 δ\n6 Tα\n2 +\n(\n1 + 1\n3\n)√\nTα log 1\nδ 6\nTα\n2 +\nTα\n2 = Tα , (14)\nwhere the second last inequality is true whenever Tα > log(1/δ) and that last is true whenever Tα > (8/3)2 log(1/δ) = c log(1/δ). By assumption on α, these two conditions are satisfied for δ = 1/(32T ), which concludes the proof of (13).\nConclusion: We show by contradiction that there exists a loss sequence ℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]KT such that L∗T 6 αT and\nE[RT (ℓ1:T )] > 1\n64\n√ 6αTK , (15)\nwhere the expectation is with respect to the internal randomisation of the algorithm. Imagine for a second that (15) were false for every loss sequence ℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]KT satisfying L∗T 6 αT . Then we would have 1{L∗\nT 6αT}EQj [RT (ℓ1:T )|ℓ1:T ] 6 (1/64)\n√ 6αTK almost surely (since the internal\nsource of randomness of the bandit algorithm is independent of ℓ1:T ). Therefore by the tower rule for the first expectation on the r.h.s. below, we would get\nEQj [RT (ℓ1:T )] = EQj\n[\nRT (ℓ1:T )1{L∗ T 6αT}\n]\n+ EQj\n[\nRT (ℓ1:T )1{L∗ T >αT}\n]\n6 1\n64\n√ 6αTK + T ·Qj(L∗T > Tα) 6 1\n64\n√ 6αTK + 1\n32 <\n1\n32\n√ 6αTK (16)\nwhere (16) follows from (13) and by noting that 1/32 < (1/64) √ 6αTK since α > K/(2T ) > 4/(6T ) > 4/(6TK). Comparing (16) and (12) we get a contradiction, which proves that there exists a loss sequence ℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]KT satisfying both L∗T 6 αT and (15). We conclude the proof by noting that √ 6/64 > 1/27. Finally, the condition T > K ∨ 118 is sufficient to make the interval[\n(c log(32T ) ∨ (K/2))/(T ), 12 ] non empty."

Afterwards we prove that bandit strategies cannot adapt to losses that lie in a small range or the existence of an action that is always optimal.\nLower bound in terms of quadratic variation We prove a lower bound of Ω( √ αTK) over any small-variation ball Vα,T (as defined by (7)) for all α = Ω(log(T )/T ). This minimax lower bound matches the upper bound of Corollary 2 up to a multiplicative factor of K2 √\nlog(T ). Closing this gap is left as an open question, but we conjecture that the upper bound is loose (see also the COLT open problem by Hazan and Kale [2011a]). Theorem 4. Let K > 2, T > (32K) ∨ 601, and α ∈ [(2c1 log(T ) ∨ 8K)/T, 1/4], where c1 = (4/9)2(3 √ 5 + 1)2 6 12. Then for any randomised bandit algorithm,\nsupℓ1:T∈Vα,T E[RT (ℓ1:T )] > √ αTK/25, where the expectation is taken with respect to the internal randomisation of the algorithm.\nThe proof is very similar to that of Theorem 3; it also follows from Lemma 4 and Bernstein’s inequality. It is postponed to Appendix C.\nImpossibility results In the full-information setting (where the entire loss vector is observed after each round) Cesa-Bianchi et al. [2007, Theorem 6] designed a carefully tuned exponential weighting algorithm for which the regret depends on the variation of the algorithm and the range of the losses:\n∀ℓ1:T ∈ RKT , E[RT (ℓ1:T )] 6 4 √ VT logK + 4ET logK + 6ET , (17)\nwhere the expectation is taken with respect to the internal randomisation of the algorithm and ET = max16t6T max16i,j6K |ℓi,t − ℓj,t| denotes the effective range of the losses and VT = ∑T t=1 VarIt∼pt(ℓIt,t) denotes the cumulative variance of the algorithm (in each round t the expert’s action It is drawn at random from the weight vector pt). The bound in (17) is not closedform because VT depends on the algorithm, but has several interesting consequences:\n1. If for all t the losses ℓi,t lie in an unknown interval [at, at + ρ] with a small width ρ > 0, then VarIt∼pt(ℓIt,t) 6 ρ 2/4, so that VT 6 Tρ2/4. Hence\nE[RT (ℓ1:T )] 6 2ρ √ T logK + 4ρ logK + 6ρ .\nTherefore, though the algorithm by Cesa-Bianchi et al. [2007, Section 4.2] does not use the prior knowledge of at or ρ, it is able to incur a regret that scales linearly in the effective range ρ. 2. If all the losses ℓi,t are nonnegative, then by Corollary 3 of [Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2007] the second-order bound (17) implies the first-order bound\nE[RT (ℓ1:T )] 6 4\n√\nL∗T\n(\nMT − L∗T T\n)\nlogK + 39MT max{1, logK} , (18)\nwhere MT = max16t6T max16i6K ℓi,t . 3. If there exists an arm i∗ that is optimal at every round t (i.e., ℓi∗,t = mini ℓi,t for all t > 1),\nthen a translation-invariant algorithm with regret guarantees as in (18) above suffers a bounded regret. This is the case for the algorithm1 of Cesa-Bianchi et al. [2007, Section 4.1] tuned with E = 1 (if all losses lie in [0, 1]). Then by the translation invariance of the algorithm all losses ℓi,t appearing in the regret bound can be replaced with the translated losses ℓi,t − ℓi∗,t > 0, so that a bound of the same form as (18) implies a regret bound of O(logK). 4. Assume that the loss vectors ℓt are i.i.d. with a unique optimal arm in expectation (i.e., there exists i∗ such that E[ℓi∗,1] < E[ℓi,1] for all i 6= i∗). Then using the Hoeffding-Azuma inequality we can show that the algorithm of Cesa-Bianchi et al. [2007, Section 4.2] has with high probability a bounded cumulative variance VT , and therefore (by (17)) incurs a bounded regret, in the same spirit as in de Rooij et al. [2014], Gaillard et al. [2014].\nWe already know that point 2 has a counterpart in the bandit setting. If one is prepared to ignore logarithmic terms, then point 4 also has an analogue in the bandit setting due to the existence of logarithmic regret guarantees for stochastic bandits [Lai and Robbins, 1985]. The following corollaries show that in the bandit setting it is not possible to design algorithms to exploit the range of the losses or the existence of an arm that is always optimal. We use Theorem 1 as a general tool but the bounds can be improved to √ TK/30 by analysing the expected regret directly (similar to Lemma 4). Corollary 4. Let K > 2, T > 32(K − 1) log(14) and ρ > 0.22 √\n(K − 1)/T . Then for any randomised bandit algorithm, supℓ1,...,ℓT∈Cρ E[RT (ℓ1:T )] > √\nT (K − 1)/504, where the expectation is with respect to the randomness in the algorithm, and Cρ , { x ∈ [0, 1]K : maxi,j |xi − xj | 6 ρ } . Corollary 5. Let K > 2 and T > 32(K − 1) log(14). Then, for any randomised bandit algorithm, there is a loss sequence ℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]KT such that there exists an arm i∗ that is optimal at every round t (i.e., ℓi∗,t = mini ℓi,t for all t > 1), but E[RT (ℓ1:T )] > √\nT (K − 1)/504, where the expectation is with respect to the randomness in the algorithm.\nProof of Corollaries 4 and 5. Both results follow from Theorem 1 by choosing δ = 0.15. Therefore there exists an ℓ1:T such that P{RT (ℓ1:T ) > √\n(K − 1)T log(1/(4 · 0.15)/27} > 0.15/2, which implies (since RT (ℓ1:T ) > 0 here) that E[RT (ℓ1:T )] > √\n(K − 1)T/504. Finally note that ℓ1:T ∈ Cρ since ρ > √ (K − 1) log(1/(4δ))/T/(4 √ log 2) and there exists an i such that ℓi,t 6 ℓj,t for all j and t. 1The fully automatic algorithm of Cesa-Bianchi et al. [2007, Section 4.2] is not translation-invariant because the estimated ranges Et only take values on a dyadic grid."

Next we write QX|Yj the law of X conditionally on Y underQj . By the chain rule for the Kullback-Leibler divergence, note that\nKL (\nQ (ht,It) 1 ,Q (ht,It) 2\n)\n=\nt−1∑\ns=1\nEQ1\n[ KL (\nQ Is|hs 1 ,Q Is|hs 2\n) +KL (\nQ ℓIs,s|(hs,Is) 1 ,Q ℓIs,s|(hs,Is) 2\n)]\n+ EQ1\n[ KL (\nQ It|ht 1 ,Q It|ht 2\n)]\n. (19)\nNote that Q1(Is = i|hs) = pi,s = Q2(Is = i|hs) for all s (by definition of a randomised algorithm with weight vector ps at time s), so that the first and third KL terms equal zero. As for the second one, we can check that QℓIs,s|(hs,Is)j = Qj,Is (the Is-th marginal of Qj).

A variant of it in the discrete setting can be found, e.g., in Cover and Thomas [2006]. The main message is that transforming the data at hand can only reduce the ability to distinguish between two probability distributions.\nLemma 5 (Contraction of entropy). Let P and Q be two probability distributions on the same measurable space (Ω,F), and let X be any random variable on (Ω,F). Denote by PX and QX the law of X under P and Q respectively. Then,\nKL ( PX ,QX ) 6 KL(P,Q) .\nNext we recall an inequality between the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the chi-squared divergence. In the particular case of Bernoulli distributions with parameters p, q ∈ [0, 1], these divergences are given respectively by2\nkl(p, q) = p log p q + (1− p) log 1− p 1− q and χ 2(p, q) = (p− q)2 q(1− q) .\nLemma 6 (Consequence of Lemma 2.7 in Tsybakov 2008). Let p, q ∈ [0, 1]. Then\nkl(p, q) 6 χ2(p, q) .\nThe final lemma is a straightforward corollary of Lemma 5 and the KL divergence between two Gaussians.\nLemma 7. For a 6 b and define clip[a,b](x) = max {a,min {x, b}}. Let Z be normally distributed with mean 1/2 and variance σ2 > 0. Define X = clip[0,1](Z) and Y = clip[0,1](Z − ε) for ε ∈ R.

As in the proof of Theorem 3, we use Lemma 4 with α/2 and combine it with Bernstein’s inequality to prove that QT 6 αTK with high probability.\nPart 1: Applying Lemma 4 with α/2 (note that T > 32K > K/(4(1 − α)) by assumption on T and α) and noting that maxj EQj [RT (ℓ1:T )] > EQ̄[RT (ℓ1:T )] we get that for some j ∈ {1, . . . ,K} the probability distribution Qj defined with ε = (1/2) √ (α/2)(1− α/2)K/T satisfies\nEQj [RT (ℓ1:T )] > 1\n8\n√ α\n2\n(\n1− α 2\n)\nTK > 1\n32\n√ 7αTK (20)\nsince α 6 1/4 by assumption.\nPart 2: Next we prove that\nQj(QT > αTK) 6 1\n32T .

Recall that under Qj , the ℓi,t, t > 1, are i.i.d. Ber ( αji ) where α j i = (α/2) + ε1{i6=j} (we used Lemma 4 with α/2). We now apply Bernstein’s inequality exactly as after (13): combined with a union bound, it yields that, for all δ ∈ (0, 1), with Qj-probability at least 1 − δ, for all i ∈ {1, . . . ,K},\nT∑\nt=1\nℓi,t 6 Tα j i +\n√\n2Tαji\n( 1− αji ) log K\nδ +\n1 3 log K δ\n6 T (α\n2 + ε\n)\n+\n√\n2T (α\n2 + ε\n)\nlog K\nδ +\n1 3 log K δ .

By the assumption α > 2c1 log(T )/T > c1 log(32TK)/T (since T > 32K), the condition Tα > c1 log(K/δ) is satisfied for δ = 1/(32T ) (as well as the weaker condition Tα > 4 log(K/δ) mentioned above). We conclude the proof of (21) via QT = ∑K i=1 vi,T 6 ∑K i=1 ∑T t=1 ℓi,t 6 αTK by (23).\nConclusion: We show by contradiction that there exists a loss sequence ℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]KT such that QT 6 αTK and\nE[RT (ℓ1:T )] > 1\n64\n√ 7αTK , (24)\nwhere the expectation is with respect to the internal randomisation of the algorithm.

Then we would have 1{QT6αTK}EQj [RT (ℓ1:T )|ℓ1:T ] 6 (1/64) √ 7αTK almost surely (since the internal source of randomness of the bandit algorithm is independent of ℓ1:T ). Therefore, using the tower rule for the first expectation on the r.h.s. below, we would get\nEQj [RT (ℓ1:T )] = EQj [ RT (ℓ1:T )1{QT6αTK} ] + EQj [ RT (ℓ1:T )1{QT>αTK} ]\n6 1\n64\n√ 7αTK + T ·Qj(QT > αTK)\n6 1\n64\n√ 7αTK + 1\n32 <\n1\n32\n√ 7αTK (25)\nwhere (25) follows from (21) and by noting that 1/32 < (1/64) √ 7αTK since α > 8K/T > 4/(7TK). Comparing (25) and (20) we get a contradiction, which proves that there exists a loss sequence ℓ1:T ∈ [0, 1]KT satisfying both QT 6 αTK and (24). We conclude the proof by noting that √ 7/64 > 1/25.\nNota: the assumption T > (32K) ∨ 601 is sufficient to make the interval [ 2c1 log(T )∨(8K)\nT , 1 4\n]\nnon empty."
