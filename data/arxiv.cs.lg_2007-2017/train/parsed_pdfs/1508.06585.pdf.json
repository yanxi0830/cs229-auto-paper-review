An universal net can be tentatively described as one which, among other things: i) works for a variety of applications, i.e. visual recognition/reconstruction, speech recognition/reconstruction, natural language processing, etc; ii) performs various tasks: classification, generation, probability density estimation, etc; iii) is self-contained, i.e., does not use specialized external machine learning methods; iv) is biologically plausible."

      "text" : "The input of a neural net is typically a set of P observations {xµ}Pµ=1, which can be represented mathematically as row-vectors in the space spanned by observables {xi}Ni=1, e.g., the N pixels on a screen. The net is then asked to perform classification, estimation, generation, etc, tasks on it. In generative nets, this is accomplished by randomly generating L latent observations {z(κ)µ }Lκ=1 for every observation xµ. This induced “uncertainty” of the µ-th\nstate is modeled by a model conditional density p(z|xµ). It is the copy-cat, in imaginary time/space, of the (squared) wave function from quantum mechanics1, and fully describes the µ-th conditional state ( xµ, {z(κ)µ }Lκ=1 ) . In statistical mechanics parlance, the latents are fluctuating microscopic variables, while the macroscopic observables are obtained from them via some aggregation. In the absence of physical time, observations are thus interpreted as partial equilibria of independent small parts of the expanded (by a factor of L) original data set.\nThe quality of the model conditional density, or more generally - the model joint density p(z,xµ) - is judged by the “distance” from the implied marginal density p(x) =∫ p(x, z)dz to the empirical marginal density r(x). This distance is called cross-entropy or negative log-likelihood and denoted by− logL(r||p) := E(− log p(x))r(x), where E()r() is an expectation with respect to r(). Its minimization is the ultimate goal."

He used an exponential model density pExp() in space and derived the Brownian diffusion i.e., Gaussian model density pG() in space/time. They are special cases of a broad class of densities - Gibbs or exponential densities - which form the foundation of classic statistical mechanics. Gibbs densities are variational maximum-entropy densities and hence optimal for modeling equilibria.\nWe argue in sub-sections 2.3, 3.2 that Gibbs densities are also optimal for modeling fully-generative equilibrium nets, and call the nets using them Gibbs machines. They were inspired by the first fully-generative nets - the variational auto-encoders (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2014), (Rezende et al., 2014) - and employ the same upper bound (3.4) for the negative log-likelihood (because of its univer-\n1 Strictly speaking, we will employ unbounded densities and hence stochastic analysis formalism and its centerpiece - the diffusion equation.

      "text" : "Unlike physics and Brownian particles, human data is decidedly non-equilibrium in nature and exhibits large fluctuations and non-Gaussian behavior. Unfortunately, some of the key features of modern neural nets, like non-linear activation functions and dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014), come at the high price of Gaussianizing the data set.\nQuantifying non-Gaussianity and “distance” from equilibrium is not easy when dealing with large number of observables N and observations P . Fortunately, there is a one-dimensional proxy for non-Gaussianity of a multidimensional data set: the non-Gaussianity of the negative Gaussian log-likelihoods {− log pG(zµ)}µ. Here, − log pG(zµ) = 12zµC(z)\n−1zµ +const, with a multivariate Gaussian NNlat(0,C(z)) as model density and C(z) the empirical covariance2. These negative observation entropies, as interpreted by Einstein, are related to singular value decomposition and are central in theory of fluctuations (Landau & Lifshitz, 1980), chapter 12. Their second moment E ( (log pG(zµ)) 2 ) r\nis proportional to the multivariate kurtosis measuring the “fatness” of the density.\nThe right quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot in Figure 1 shows the Gaussianization effect of non-linearities and dropout for the MNIST data set (LeCun et al., 2015). Nonlinearities Gaussianize because they are compressive in nature and “rectify” the unlikely (with large negative loglikelihoods) observations, which we refer to as intricates, see Figure 3. Dropout Gaussianizes because it drops latent variables and hence decreases the kurtosis."

For the typical case P −Nlat →∞, it is proportional to the chi-squared density χ2Nlat(), which in turn converges to a rescaled GaussianN (0, 1), as Nlat →∞.\n3Recall that, for a given row-vector observation xµ, its conjugate is x̌µ = xµC−1, where C is the covariance matrix.

We show on the top (respectively, bottom) plot in Figure 3 the most (respectively, least) 30 intricate images in MNIST, in descending order of Gaussian negative log-likelihood − log pG(xµ) ≥ 0, from the class corresponding to the digit 8.\nIn order to preserve the non-Gaussianity of the data, and improve performance significantly along the way, we will combine classifiers with auto-encoders - hence the name auto-classifier-encoder (ACE). Auto-encoders have a reconstruction error in their negative log-likelihood and thus force the net to be more faithful to the raw data.

An universal net will hence tend to work better when the dimension of latent layers Nlat ≥ N , i.e. have the so-called overcomplete representation (Coates et al., 2011). When Nlat >> N , for any given N -dimensional observation xµ, only a small number of latents {zµj}Nlatj=1 deviate significantly from zero, as on the left plot of Figure 2. For these sparse representations, sampling from high-entropy Gaussian-like densities, as on the right plot of Figure 2, is flawed. Sampling instead from “fat-tail” densities offers a significant performance improvement for MNIST, Figure 8, right.

Statistical mechanics deals with it by introducing higher-hierarchy densities which are conditional on low-hierarchy densities. Clusterization aggregates the low-\nhierarchy partial equilibria - the observations - into higherhierarchy partial equilibria - clusters, sub-section 1.2.\nTo mimic this universal phenomenon, in its second, generative, installment, ACE combines a classifier and a generative auto-encoder in the same space of observables, in a brand of an auto-encoder supervision, Figure 4. ACE generalizes the classic idea of using separate decoders for separate classes, (Hinton et al., 1995). In training, the conditional latent density p(z|xµ) from sub-section 1.2 is generalized to p(z|xµ, cµ), where cµ is the class or label of the µ-th observation. Since, of course, classification labels can not be used on the testing set, the sampling during testing is from a mixture of densities, with class probabilities supplied by the classifier (hence the dashed line in Figure 4). The ACE is universal in the sense of subsection 1.1 and achieves state-of-the-art performance, both as a classifier and a density estimator, Figure 8.

      "text" : "When the dimensionality Nlat of the ACE latent layer is low, traversing the latent dimension in some uniform fashion describes the latent manifold for a given class. Figure 5 shows the dominant dimension for each of the 10 classes in MNIST. This so-called manifold learning by modern feed-forward nets was pioneered by the contractive autoencoders (CAE) (Rifai et al., 2012). A symmetry in our context is, loosely speaking, a one-dimensional parametric transformation, which leaves the log-likelihood unchanged. In probabilistic terms, this is equivalent to the existence of a one-parametric density, from which “symmetric” observations are sampled, see (1.2) below.\nNets currently learn symmetries from the training data, after it is artificially augmented, e.g. by adding rotated, translated, rescaled, etc, images, in the case of visual recogni-\ntion. But once a symmetry is learned, it does not make sense to re-learn it for every new data set.\nWe hence propose the reverse approach: add the symmetry explicitly to the latent layer, alongside its Noether invariant, (Gelfand & Fomin, 1963). As an example, consider translational symmetries in a two-dimensional system with coordinates (z(h), z(v)) ∈ R2. They imply the conservation of the horizontal and vertical momenta (−i}∂/∂z(h),−i}∂/∂z(v)) = (p(h), p(v)) ∈ R2 and a quantum mechanical wave function ∼ e i }p (h)(z(h)−h)+ i}p (v)(z(v)−v), where (h, v) are offsets, (Landau & Lifshitz, 1977), section 15.

Latents are not a priori given but rather sampled from a closed-form conditional model density p(z|x). The optimization target hence is the mixed empirical density r(x, z) = 1P ∑ µ δ(x −xµ)p(z|xµ) (Kulhavỳ, 1996), section 2.3;(Cover & Thomas, 2006), problem 3.12.

      "text" : "There is a broad class of probability density families - Gibbs or exponential families - which dominate the choices of model densities, both in physics and neural nets. This class includes a sufficiently large number of density families: Gaussian, Bernoulli, exponential, gamma, etc. Their general closed form is:\npλ(z) = p(z)\nZ e−\n∑M s=1 λsMs(z), (2.3)\nwhere p(z) is an arbitrary prior density, λ = {λs} are Lagrange multipliers, Mj(z) are so-called sufficient statistics, and Z = ∫ pλ(z)dz is the normalizing partition function. The sufficient statistics in physics form a complete set of state variables like energy, momenta, number of particles, etc, fully describing the µ-th conditional state, sub-section 1.2, see (Landau & Lifshitz, 1980), sections 28,34,35,110. In probability, the sufficient statistics are typically monomials like M1(z) = z, M2(z) = z2, etc, whose expectations form the moments m1, m2, etc, of a given multi-dimensional density. As proposed in subsection 1.5, one can add to the list the symmetry statistics, see subsection 3.3 for details.\nvations: the latent variables can in general contain information from more than one observation, as for example in the case of time series auto-regression.\nThe Gibbs class is special because it is the variational maximum entropy class: it is the unique functional form which maximizes the entropy Sp(f), computed with respect to the reference measure p(), across the universe {f(z)} of all densities with fixed expectations of the sufficient statistics E(Ms(z))f = ms, s = 1, ...,M , see (Cover & Thomas, 2006), chapter 12. The Lagrange multipliersλ= λ(m) are computed so as to satisfy these constraints and are hence functions of the vector m = {ms}Ms=1.\nThe Gibbs class is special in even stronger sense: it is a minimum divergence class. For an arbitrary prior density p(z), the Kullback-Leibler divergence D(pλ(z)||p(z))) minimizes the divergence D(f(z)||p(z)) across the universe {f(z)} of all densities with fixed expectations of the sufficient statistics E(Ms(z))f = ms, s = 1, ...,M . This follows from the variational Pythagorean theorem (Kulhavỳ, 1996), section 3.3:\nD(f(z)||p(z)) = D(f(z)||pλ(z)) +D(pλ(z)||p(z)) ≥ ≥ D(pλ(z)||p(z)). (2.4)\nIn our context, for a given observation xµ, choosing a wave function from the Gibbs type is equivalent to choosing a conditional model density:\np(z|xµ) = p(z)\nZ e−\n∑M s=1 λs(m(xµ))Ms(z). (2.5)\nWe made explicit the indirect dependence of λs on xµ via the constraints vector m = m(xµ). As we will see in sub-section 3.2, minimizing the divergence D(f(z)||p(z)) across an unknown a priori family of conditional distributions p(z|xµ) = f(z), is crucial for the quality of a generative net. The minimum divergence property (2.4) implies that we are always better off choosing p(z|xµ) from a Gibbs class, as in (2.5), hence the name Gibbs machines.\nIn practice, in order for p(z|xµ) to be tractable, p(z) has to be from a specific parametric family within the Gibbs class: then both p(z) and p(z|xµ) will be tractable and in the same family, e.g. Gaussian, exponential, etc.\nExcept for the symmetry statistics, sub-sections 1.5, 3.3, the conditional moments m = m(xµ) for the µ-th quantum state are free parameters. Together with the Lagrange multipliers of the symmetry statistics, they can be thought of as quantum numbers distinguishing the partial equilibrium states from one another, section 1.2. These quantum numbers are added to the rest of the free net parameters, to be optimized by standard methods, like back-propagation/ stochastic gradient descent, etc.\nGibbs densities are only a special case (for q = 1) of the broad class of q-Gibbs (or q-exponential) densities. The corresponding nonextensive statistical mechanics (Tsallis, 2009), describes more adequately long-range-interacting\nmany-body systems like typical human-generated data sets. Many of the properties of the exponential class remain true for the q-exponential class (Amari & Ohara, 2011), see open problem 4 in section 5."

Assuming completeness of the state variables, Boltzmann machines adopt as joint model density the Boltzmann density, a special case of the Gibbs equilibrium density from sub-section 2.3: pB(x, z) = 1 Z e − 1T E(x,z), with a single sufficient statistics - a bi-linear energy function E(, ), a trivial prior and temperature T = 1. It is not tractable because the partition function Z = ∫ p(x, z)dxdz can not be computed in closed form. On the other hand, for discrete data, the conditional density of the restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) is tractable and is the familiar Fermi density pF (z|xµ) = 1/(1+ eE(xµ,z)). The intractable joint density term in (2.2) is handled by approximations of its gradients like contrastive divergence (Hinton, 2002), to avoid brute-force Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.\nDue to the simple bi-linear shape of the log-likelihood i.e. energy, RBM-s have latent variables conditionally independent on the visible variables (and vice versa). Despite their limitations when handling non-binary data, deep Boltzmann machines (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009) are arguably still the dominant universal nets: They perform well both as classifiers (Srivastava et al., 2014) and probability density estimators (Salakhutdinov & Murray, 2008)."

      "text" : "The motivation for the non-generative ACE comes from the Einstein observation entropies {− log pG(zµ)}µ in subsection 1.4 and their relation to singular value decomposition (SVD). Recall that the SVD of the B × N data matrix X with B observations and N observables is X = VΛWT . The B × B matrix VVT is i) a projection mapping; ii) its diagonals are up to a constant the negative Gaussian log-likelihoods {− log pG(zµ)}µ; and iii) it is invariant on X, i.e. X = VVTX.\nLets us consider a shallow auto-encoder, Figure 6, left, and its dual in the space of observations, Figure 6, right. It can be shown that for tied weights V(2) = V(1)T , in the absence of non-linearities, the optimal B×Nlat hidden layer solution Ho on the left is Ho = V(2) = V (Georgiev, 2015b). The divergence of VVTX from X is thus the reconstruction error in the dual space and minimizing it gets us closer to the optimal Ho. If we treat the first hidden layer H of a classifier as the rescaled dual weight matrix\nTowards universal neural nets: Gibbs machines and ACE. √ BV(2), we arrive at the dual reconstruction error :\n− logL′recon = 1\nB N∑ i=1 E(− logϕ(HHTxi/B))xi , (4.1)\nfor a given column-vector observable xi = {xµi}Bµ=1 and sigmoid non-linearity ϕ(), see Appendix A.\nThe non-generative ACE has as minimization target the composite negative log-likelihood (1.1), with − logLAE replaced by the dual reconstruction error (4.1). The orthogonality VTV = INlat of V implies the need for an additional batch normalization, similar to (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015), see Appendix A.\nThe best known results for the test classification error of feed-forward, non-convolutional nets, without artificial data augmentation, are in the 0.9-1% handle (Srivastava et al., 2014), table 2. As shown on the right of Figure 7, the non-generative ACE offers a 20-30% improvement."

Laplacian sampling density is used in training and the mixed Laplacian in testing, with the explicit formulas for the generative error in Appendix B. The generative ACE produces similarly outstanding classification results as the non-generative ACE on the regular MNIST data set, Figure 8, left. Even without tweaking hyper-parameters, it also produces outstanding results for the density estimation of the binarized MNIST data set, Figure 8, right. An upper bound for the negative log-likelihood in the 86-87 handle is in the ballpark of the best non-recurrent nets, (Gregor et al., 2015), table 2."

      "text" : "ACE code used for cited experiments is in (Georgiev, 2015a). All cited nets are implemented on a single GeForce GTX 970 GPU and the Theano platform (Bastien et al., 2012), tapping into Theano-Lights standard net implementations (Popov, 2015). Optimizer is ADAM (Kingma & Ba, 2014) stochastic gradient descent back-propagation. Specific hyper-parameters are in the text. We used only two standard sets of hyper-parameters, one for the classifier branch and one for the auto-encoder branch and have not done hyper-parameter optimizations.\nFor reconstruction error of a binarized µ-th rowobservation xµ = {xµi}Ni=1 and its reconstruction x̂µ, we use the standard binary cross-entropy (Bastien et al., 2012): E(− log x̂µ)xµ = = ∑ i(−xµi log x̂µi −(1 − xµi)(1 − log x̂µi)), with x̂µ the image of a sigmoid non-linearity ϕ. The batch negative log-likelihood is − logLrecon = 1 B ∑B µ=1 E(− log x̂µ)xµ . In the space of observations, as on right plot of Figure 6, the dual reconstruction error is the same binary cross-entropy E(− log x̂i)xi , but for the ith observable xi = {xµi}Bµ=1 and a sum over µ instead of i. The batch negative log-likelihood is − logL′recon = 1B ∑N i=1 E(− log x̂i)xi , with a normalization factor conforming to the space of observables.\nThe non-linearities are tanh() in the auto-encoder branch and two-unit maxout (Goodfellow et al., 2013) in the classifier branch. Weight matrices of size P × N are initialized as random Gaussian matrices, normalized by the order of magnitude of their largest eigen-value √ P + √ N . As discussed in sub-section 4.1, hidden observables in the first and last hidden layer of classifiers are batch-normalized i.e. de-meaned and divided by their second moment. Unlike (Ioffe & Szegedy, 2015), batch normalization is enforced identically in both the train and test set, hence test results depend slightly on the test batch."

In order to have zero generative error when (µ, σ)→ (0, 1), we parametrize the conditional posterior as p(z|.) = pLap(z;µ, σ √ 0.5).
