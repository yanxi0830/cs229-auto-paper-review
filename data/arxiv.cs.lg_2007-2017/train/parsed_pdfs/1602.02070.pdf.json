INTRODUCTION\nIn many applications in signal processing, computer vision and machine learning, the data has an intrinsic low-rank structure. One desires to extract this structure efficiently from the noisy observations. Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA) [7], a linear dimensionality reduction algorithm can be used to exactly describe a dataset lying on a single linear lowdimensional subspace. Low-rank Representation (LRR) [19], on the other hand can be used for data drawn from multiple linear subspaces. However, these methods suffer from two prominent problems:\n1) They do not recover non-linear low-rank structures. 2) They do not scale for big datasets Y ∈ <p×n (large p\nand large n, where p is the number of features). Many high dimensional datasets lie intrinsically on a smooth and very low-dimensional manifold that can be characterized by a graph G between the data samples [4]. For a matrix\nAffiliation: Signal Processing Laboratory 2 (LTS2), EPFL STI IEL, Lausanne, CH-1015, Switzerland. Phone: +41 21 69 34754. † G.

N.Shahid and N.Perraudin are supported by the SNF grant no. 200021 154350/1 for the project “Towards signal processing on graphs”.G.Puy was funded by the European Research Council, PLEASE project (ERC-StG-2011-277906).\nY ∈ <p×n, a K-nearest neighbor undirected graph between the rows or columns of Y is denoted as G = (V, E), where E is the set of edges and V is the set of vertices. The first step in the construction of G consists of connecting each yi to its K nearest neighbors yj (using Euclidean distance), resulting in |E| connections. The yi correspond to rows of Y if the graph G is the row graph or to the columns if G is a column graph. The K-nearest neighbors are non-symmetric but a symmetric weighted adjacency matrix W is computed via a Gaussian kernel as Wij = exp(−‖(yi− yj)‖22/σ2) if yj is connected to yi or vice versa and 0 otherwise. Let D be the diagonal degree matrix of G which is given as: Dii = ∑ jWij . Then, the combinatorial Laplacian that characterizes the graph G is defined as L = D − W and its normalized form as Ln = D−1/2(D −W )D−1/2 [38].\nIt is imperative to represent such datasets as a function of the smooth variations of the non-linear manifold, rather than a linear subspace. We refer to such a representation as a non-linear low-rank structure. In this context, the graph eigenvectors serve as a legitimate tool to characterize the smooth variations of the manifold. Consider the example of a 2D circle embedded in a 3D space as shown in the left most plot of Fig. 1. The noisy version of this circle qualifies as an example of a non-linear low-rank (2D) manifold embedded in a high dimensional (3D) space. Ideally one would like to recover the 2D circle as shown in the rightmost plot of Fig. 1, however, RPCA just reduces the manifold to a point in the space. Extensions of RPCA and LRR such as Robust PCA on Graphs (RPCAG) [35] and Graph Regularized LRR (GLRR) [20] propose to incorporate graph regularization as a method to recover non-linear low-rank structures. These methods still suffer from the scalability problem for big datasets.\nRandomized techniques come into play to deal with the scalability problem associated with very high dimensional data (the case of large p) [43], [5], [44], [18], [13], [23], [29], [30], [12] using the tools of compression [8]. These works improve upon the computational complexity by reducing only the data dimension p but still scale in the same manner w.r.t n. The case of large n can be tackled by using the sampling schemes accompanied with Nystrom method [40]. However, this method works efficiently only for low-rank kernel matrices and does not recover the low-rank data matrix itself. Scalable extensions of LRR such as [45] exist but they focus only on the subspace clustering application. Recently, Aravkin et. al [1] proposed to speed-up RPCA and ease the parameter selection problem, however, the variational approach does not qualify\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n02 07\n0v 4\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 4\nO ct\n2 01\n6\nto represent the non-linear low-rank structures. How to tackle the case of big n and non-linearity simultaneously then?\nFor many machine learning applications involving big data, such as clustering, an approximate low-rank representation might suffice. The recently introduced Fast Robust PCA on Graphs (FRPCAG) [36] approximates a recovery method for non-linear low-rank datasets, which are called Low-rank matrices on graphs. Inspired by the underlying stationarity assumption [27], the authors introduce a joint notion of lowrankness for the features and samples (rows and columns) of a data matrix. More specifically, a low-rank matrix on graphs is defined as a matrix whose rows and columns belong to the span of the first few eigenvectors of the graphs constructed between its rows and columns.\nFRPCAG does not require an SVD and scales linearly with n. It relies on fast dual graph filtering operations which involve matrix vector multiplications and can be parallelized on a GPU in every iteration. However, the size of the problem is still an issue for big datasets because the problem cannot be broken down into small sub-problems and the solution merged at the end. Thus, for the non-GPU implementation, it still suffers from 1) memory requirements 2) cost of k-means for clustering 3) the cost of parameter tuning for large p and large n and 4) scalability for very big datasets. This said, sometimes one might not even have access to the full dataset Y . This is typical, for instance for the biomedical applications, such as MRI and tomography. In such applications the number of observations are limited by the data acquisition protocols. In MRI, the number of observations is proportional to the time and dose required for the procedure. In tomography one might have access to the projections only. Thus, FRPCAG is not be usable if 1) the dataset is large and 2) only a subset of the dataset or measurements are available. Despite the above limitations of the data acquisition, one might have access to some additional information about the unobserved samples. In MRI for instance, sparsity of the samples in the Fourier domain serves as a good prior."

We mostly limit ourselves to the case 1 above, where a graphical prior is available or can be conveniently constructed for the complete set of observations for the application under consideration.

      "text" : "PCA has been widely used for two different types of applications: 1) Low-rank recovery and 2) clustering in the low-dimensional space. It is crucial to point out here that the clustering is not a standard application of PCA, because PCA is just a feature extraction method. However, the clustering experiments had been widely adopted as a standard procedure to demonstrate the quality of the feature extraction methods [11], [41], [46], [15], [6], [37], [14]. Thus, to be consistent with the state-of-the-art, our contributions focus on both of the above applications. Below we describe our contributions in detail.\n1. Sampling & RIP for low-rank matrices on graphs: To solve the scalability problem of FRPCAG we propose to perform a dual uniform sampling of the data matrices, along rows and columns. We present a restricted isometry property (RIP) for low-rank matrices on graphs and relate it to the cumulative coherence of the graph eigenvectors. FRPCAG is then used to recover the low-rank representation for the sampled data.\n2. Decoders for low-rank recovery: We present two (ideal and alternate) convex and efficient decoders for recovering the full low-rank matrix from the corresponding low-rank matrix of the sampled data. However, our main contribution comprises the set of 3 additional parallel, low-cost and parameterfree approximate decoders, which significantly boost the speed of our framework by introducing a few approximations. Our rigorous theoretical analysis also proves that the recovery error of the above decoders depends on the spectral gaps of the row and column graph Laplacians.\n3. Low-Rank Clustering: For the clustering application of PCA, we propose a low-cost and parallel scheme based on\nCPCA. The key idea is to decode the labels of the complete dataset from the labels of a sampled low-rank dataset, without computing the complete low-rank matrix.\n4. Extensive Experimentation: Low-rank recovery experiments on 3 real video datasets and clustering experiments on 5 benchmark datasets reveal that the performance of our model is comparable to 10 different state-of-the-art PCA and nonPCA based methods. We also study some cases where CPCA fails to perform as well as the state-of-the-art.\nOur proposed framework is inspired by the recently introduced sampling of band-limited signals on graphs [28]. While we borrow several concepts from here, our framework is significantly different from [28] in many contexts. We target the low-rank recovery of matrices, whereas [28] targets the recovery of band-limited signals / vectors. For our framework it is important for the data matrix to be low-rank jointly on the row and column graphs. Thus, our sampling scheme and RIP are generalized for two graphs. The design of a sampling scheme is the major focus of [28], while we just focus on the case of uniform sampling and instead focus on how much to sample jointly given the two graphs. Of course, our method can be extended directly for the other sampling schemes in [28]. A major difference lies in the application domain and hence the experiments. Unlike [28], we target two applications related to PCA: 1) low-rank recovery and 2) clustering. Thus, contrary to [28] our proposed decoders are designed for these applications. A major contribution of our work in contrast to [28] is the design of approximate decoders for low-rank recovery and clustering which significantly boost the speed of our framework for big datasets without compromising on the performance.\nII. A GLIMPSE OF COMPRESSIVE PCA (CPCA) Let Lc ∈ Rn×n be the Laplacian of the graph Gc connecting the different columns of Y and Lr ∈ Rp×p the Laplacian of the graph Gr that connects the rows of Y . Furthermore, let Lc = QΛcQ> = QkcΛckcQ>kc + Q̄kcΛ̄ckcQ̄ > kc\n, where Λckc ∈ <kc×kc is a diagonal matrix of lower eigenvalues and Λ̄ckc ∈ <(n−kc)×(n−kc) is a diagonal matrix of higher graph eigenvalues. Similarly, let Lr = PΛrP> = PkrΛrkrP>kr + P̄kr Λ̄rkr P̄ > kr\n. All the values in Λr and Λc are sorted in increasing order. For a K-nearest neighbors graph constructed from kc-clusterable data (along columns) one can expect λkc/λkc+1 ≈ 0 as λkc ≈ 0 and λkc λkc+1. We refer to the ratio λkc/λkc+1 as the spectral gap of Lc. The same holds for the Laplacian Lr. Then, low-rank matrices on graphs can be defined as following and recovered by solving FRPCAG [36].\nDefinition 1. A matrix Y ∗ ∈ Rp×n is (kr, kc)-low-rank on the graphs Lr and Lc if its columns yj ∈ span(Pkr ) for all j = 1, . . . , n and its rows yi ∈ span(Qkc) for all i = 1, . . . , p. The set of (kr, kc)-low-rank matrices on the graphs Lr and Lc is denoted by LR(Pkr , Qkc).\nGiven a data matrix Y ∈ <p×n = X̄ + Ē, where X̄ ∈ LR(Pkr , Qkc) and Ē models the errors, the goal is to develop a method to efficiently recover X̄ . We propose to 1) Construct\nLaplacians Lr and Lc between the rows and columns of Y using the scheme of Section II. 2) Sample the rows and columns of Y to get a subsampled matrix Ỹ = Ỹ ∗ + E using the sampling scheme of Section III. 3) Construct the compressed Laplacians L̃r, L̃c from Lr,Lc (Section IV-A). 4) Determine a low-rank matrix X̃ for Ỹ with L̃r, L̃c in algorithm 1 of FRPCAG:\nmin X̃\nφ(Ỹ − X̃) + γc tr(X̃L̃cX̃>) + γr tr(X̃>L̃rX̃),\nwhere φ is a loss function (possibly lp norm), X̃ = X̃∗ + Ẽ = MrX̄Mc + Ẽ, Ẽ models the errors in the recovery of the subsampled low-rank matrix X̃ and Mr,Mc are the row and column sampling matrices whose design is discussed in Section III. 5) Use the decoders presented in Section V to decode the low-rank matrix X̄ = X̄∗+E∗ (where E∗ denotes the error on the recovery of optimal X̄∗) on graphs Lr,Lc if the task is low-rank recovery, or perform k-means on X̃ to get cluster labels C̃ and use the clustering algorithm (presented in Section VI) to get the cluster labels C for the full matrix X .\nThroughout this work we use the approximate nearest neighbor algorithm (FLANN [21]) for graph construction whose complexity is O(np log(n)) for p n [33] (and it can be performed in parallel).\nIII. RIP FOR LOW-RANK MATRICES ON GRAPHS\nLet Mr ∈ <ρr×p be the subsampling matrix for sampling the rows and Mc ∈ <n×ρc for sampling the columns of Y . Mc and Mr are constructed by drawing ρc and ρr indices Ωc = {ω1 · · ·ωρc} and Ωr = {ω1 · · ·ωρr} uniformly without replacement from the sets {1, 2, · · · , n} and {1, 2, · · · , p} and satisfy:\nM ijc = { 1 if i = ωj 0 otherwise M ij r = { 1 if j = ωi 0 otherwise. (1)\nNow, the subsampled data matrix Ỹ ∈ <ρc×ρr can be written as Ỹ = MrYMc. CPCA requires Mr and Mc to be constructed such that the “low-rankness” property of the data Y is preserved under sampling. Before discussing this, we introduce a few basic definitions in the context of graphs Gc and Gr.\nDefinition 2. (Graph cumulative coherence). The cumulative coherence of order kc, kr of Gc and Gr is:\nνkc = max 1≤i≤n\n√ n‖Q>kc∆ c i‖2 & νkr = max\n1≤j≤p\n√ p‖P>kr∆ r j‖2,\nwhere ∆c ∈ {0, 1}n,∆r ∈ {0, 1}p are binary vectors and ∆ci = 1 if the i\nth entry of ∆c is 1 and 0 otherwise. Thus, ∆ci corresponds to a specific node of the graph.\nIn the above equations Q>kc∆ c i and P > kr ∆rj characterize the first kc and kr fourier modes [38] of the nodes i and j on the graphs Gc and Gr respectively. Thus, the cumulative coherence is a measure of how well the energy of the (kr, kc) low-rank matrices spreads over the nodes of the graphs. These quantities exactly control the number of vertices ρc and ρr that\nneed to be sampled from the graphs Gr and Gc such that the properties of the graphs are preserved [28].\nConsider the example where a particular node i has a high coherence. Then, it implies that their exist some low-rank signals whose energy is highly concentrated on the node i. Removing this node would result in a loss of information in the data. If the coherence of this node is low then removing it in the sampling process would result in no loss of information. We already mentioned that we are interested in the case of uniform sampling. Therefore in order to be able to sample a small number of nodes uniformly from the graphs, the cumulative coherence should be as low as possible.\nWe remind that for our application we desire to sample the data matrix Y such that its low-rank structure is preserved under this sampling. How can we ensure this via the graph cumulative coherence? This follows directly from the fact that we are concerned about the data matrices which are also low-rank with respect to the two graphs under consideration Y ∈ LR(Pkr , Qkc). In simple words, the columns of the data matrix Y belong to the span of the eigenvectors Pkr and the rows to the span of Qkc . Thus, the coherence conditions for the graph directly imply the coherence condition on the data matrix Y itself. Therefore, using these quantities to sample the data matrix Y will ensure the preservation of two properties under sampling: 1) the structure of the corresponding graphs and 2) the low-rankness of the data matrix Y . Given the above definitions, we are now ready to present the restricted-isometry theorem for the low-rank matrices on the graphs.\nTheorem 1. (Restricted-isometry property (RIP) for low-rank matrices on graphs) Let Mc and Mr be two random subsampling matrices as constructed in (1). For any δ, ∈ (0, 1), with probability at least 1− ,\n(1− δ)‖Y ‖2F ≤ np\nρrρc ‖MrYMc‖2F ≤ (1 + δ)‖Y ‖2F (2)\nfor all Y ∈ LR(Pkr , Qkc) provided that\nρc ≥ 27\nδ2 ν2kc log\n( 4kc ) & ρr ≥ 27\nδ2 ν2kr log\n( 4kr ) , (3)\nwhere νkc , νkr characterize the graph cumulative coherence as in Definition 2 and npρcρr is just a normalization constant which quantifies the norm conservation in (2).\nProof: Please refer to Appendix A. Theorem 1 is a direct extension of the RIP for k-bandlimited signals on one graph [28]. It states that the information in Y ∈ LR(Pkr , Qkc) is preserved with overwhelming probability if the sampling matrices (1) are constructed with a uniform sampling strategy satisfying (3). Note that ρr and ρc depend on the cumulative coherence of the graph eigenvectors. The better spread the eigenvectors are, the smaller is the number of vertices that need to be sampled.\nIt is proved in [28] that νkc ≥ √ kc and νkr ≥ √ kr. Hence, when the lower bounds are attained, one only needs to sample an order of O(kc log(kc)) columns and O(kr log(kr)) rows to ensure that the RIP (eq. (3)) holds. This is the ideal scenario.\nHowever, one can also have νkc = √ n or νkr = √ p in some situations. Let us give some examples. The lower bound on νk is attained, e.g, when the graph is the regular lattice. In this case the graph Fourier transform is the “usual” Fourier transform and νk = √ k for all k. Another example where the lower bound is attained is when the graph contains k disconnected components of identical size. In this case, one can prove that νk = √ k. Intuitively, we guess that the coherence remains close to this lower bound when these k components are weakly interconnected.\nThe upper bound on νk is attained when, for example, the graph has one of its nodes not connected to any other node. In this case, one must sample this node. Indeed, there is no way to guess the value of the signal on this node from any neighbour. As the sampling is random, one is sure to sample this node only when all the nodes are sampled. Uniform sampling is not the best strategy in this setting. Furthermore, note that such a case is only possible if the graph is noisy or the data has strong outliers. One should resort to a more distribution aware sampling in such a case as presented in [28].\nWe choose in this paper to present the results using a uniform distribution for simplicity. Note however that one can adapt the sampling distribution to the underlying structure of the graph to ensure optimal sampling results. A consequence of the result in [28] is that there always exist distributions that ensure that the RIP holds when sampling O(kr log(kr)) rows and O(kc log(kc)) columns only. The optimal sampling distribution for which this result holds is defined in [28] (see Section 2.2). Furthermore, a fast algorithm to compute this distribution also exists (Section 4 of [28]).\nIV. COMPRESSED LOW-RANK MATRIX Once the compressed dataset Ỹ ∈ <ρr×ρc is obtained the low-rank representation has to be extracted which takes into account the graph structures. Thus we propose the following two step strategy:\n1) Construct graphs for compressed data. 2) Run Fast Robust PCA on Graphs (FRPCAG) on the\ncompressed data. These two steps are elaborated in the following subsections."

Then, as argued in theorem III.4 of [9] two nodes α, β are not connected in L̃c if there is no path between them in Lc via Ω̄. Assume that each of the connected components has the same number of nodes. Then, if the sampling is done uniformly\nwithin each of the connected components according to the sampling bounds described in eq.(3), one can expect L̃c to have kc connected components as well. This is an inherent property of the Kron reduction method. However, for the case of large variation of the number of nodes among the connected components one might want to resort to a more distribution aware sampling scheme. Such schemes have been discussed in [28] and have not been addressed in this work. Nevertheless, the Kron reduction strategy mentioned here is independent of the sampling strategy used. The same concepts holds for L̃r as well.\nThe Kron reduction method involves the multiplication of 3 sparse matrices. The only expensive operation above is the inverse of L(Ω̄, Ω̄) which can be performed with O(OlKn) cost using the Lancoz method [39], where Ol is the number of iterations for Lancoz approximation."

Now we begin to describe these steps in detail.\n1) Step 1: Splitting the alternate decoder: Using the SVD of X and X̃ and the invariance property of the trace under\ncyclic permutations, we can replace (8) by:\nmin U,V ‖MrUΣV >Mc − Ũ Σ̃Ṽ >‖2F + γ̄c tr(Σ2V >LcV )+\nγ̄r tr(U >LrUΣ2) s.t: U>U = Ik, V >V = Ik. (10)\nThe above eq. introduces two new variables based on the SVD of X , i.e, U ∈ Rp×k and V ∈ Rn×k. Clearly, with the introduction of these new variables, one needs to specify k as the dimension of the subspaces U and V . We propose the following strategy for this:\n1) First, determine Σ̃ by one inexpensive SVD of X̃ ∈ Rρr×ρc . This costs O(ρ2rρc) for ρr < ρc. 2) Then set k equal to the number of entries in Σ̃ which are above a threshold.\nIt is important to note that so far eq.(10) and the alternate decoder eq.(8) are equivalent. Also note that we did not introduce the singular values Σ as an additional variable in eq.(10) because they are related to the singular values X̃ of X̃ . We argue this as following: If (9) holds for the alternate decoder then ‖Σ̄∗− Σ̄‖F (where Σ̄∗, Σ̄ are the singular values of X̄∗, X̄) is also bounded as argued in the discussion of Appendix C. Thus, the singular values Σ and Σ̃ of X and X̃ differ approximately by the normalization constant of theorem 1, i.e,\nΣ =\n√ np\nρrρc(1− δ) Σ̃\nNote that with the above relationship, the subspaces U, V can be solved independently of each other. Thus eq.(10) can be decoupled as following which separately solves the subspace (U and V ) learning problems.\nmin U ‖MrU − Ũ‖2F + γ\n′\nr tr(U >LrU) s.t: U>U = Ik,\nmin V ‖V >Mc − Ṽ ‖2F + γ\n′\nc tr(V >LcV ) s.t: V >V = Ik.\n(11)\n2) Step 2: Dropping Orthonormality Constraints: Solving (11) is as expensive as (8) due to the orthonormality constraints (as explained in appendix D). Therefore, we drop the constraints and get\nmin U ‖MrU − Ũ‖2F + γ\n′\nr tr(U >LrU), (12)\nmin V ‖V >Mc − Ṽ ‖2F + γ\n′\nc tr(V >LcV ). (13)\nThe solutions to (12) & (13) are not orthonormal anymore. The deviation from the orthonormality depends on the constants γ ′ r and γ ′ c, but X = UΣV > is still a good enough (error characterized in Theorem 4) low-rank representation due to the intuitive explanation that we present here. We argue that the solutions of eqs.(12) &(13) are feasible solutions of the joint non-convex, factorized, and graph regularized low-rank optimization problem like the one presented in [31]. Let A\nand B be the subspaces that we want to recover then we can re-write the problem studied in [31] as following:\nmin A,B ‖MrAB>M>c − X̃‖2F + γ\n′ r tr(A >LrA) + γ ′ c tr(B >LcB)\nThe above non-convex problem does not require A and B to be orthonormal, but is still widely used for recovering a low-rank X = AB>. Our problem setting (eqs.(12) &(13)) is just equivalent except that it is convex as we decouple the learning of two subspaces due to the known Σ that relates U and V . Thus, for any orthonormal U, V and a scaling matrix Σ, A = U √ Σ and B = V √ Σ is a feasible solution. Thus, dropping the orthonormality constraints does not effect the final solution X .\n3) Step 3: Subspace Upsampling: Eqs. (12) &(13) require the tuning of two parameters γ ′ r and γ ′\nc which can be computationally cumbersome. Therefore, our final step in the construction of the approximate decoder is to get rid of the two parameters. But before we present the final construction step we study the problems eqs.(12) &(13) and their solutions more closely.\nFirst, note that solving eqs.(12) &(13) is equivalent to making the following assumptions:\nŨ = MrŪ + Ẽ u and Ṽ = V̄ Mc + Ẽv,\nwhere the columns of Ū , ūi ∈ span(Pkr ), i = 1, · · · , p, and the columns of V̄ v̄j ∈ span(Qkc), j = 1, · · · , n and Ẽu ∈ <ρr×ρr , Ẽv ∈ <ρc×ρc model the noise in the estimate of the subspaces.\nSecondly, the closed form solutions of eqs.(12) &(13) are given as following:\nU = (M>r Mr + γ ′ rLr)−1M>r Ũ , (14)\nV = (McM > c + γ\n′ cLc)−1McṼ . (15)\nThus, problems (12) & (13) decode the subspaces U and V such that they are smooth on their respective graphs Lr and Lc. This can also be referred to as 1) simultaneous decoding and 2) subspace denoising stage. We call it a ‘subspace denoising’ method because the operator (M>r Mr + γ ′\nrLr)−1 can be viewed as low-pass filtering the subspace U in the graph fourier domain.\nNote that we want to decode and denoise Ũ and Ṽ which are in turn determined by the SVD of X̃ . Furthermore, X̃ has been determined by solving the FRPCAG problem of eq.(4). FRPCAG is already robust to noise and outliers, therefore, it is safe to assume that the subspaces determined from it, i.e, Ũ and Ṽ are also noise and outlier free. Thus, the extra denoising step (performed via graph filtering) of eqs.(12) &(13) is redundant.\nTherefore, we can directly upsample Ũ and Ṽ to determine U and V without needing a margin for noise. To do this, we reformulate eq.(12) as follows:\nmin U\n1\nγ′r ‖MrU − Ũ‖2F + tr(U>LrU).\nFor γ ′\nr → 0, 1γ′r → ∞, the emphasis on first term of the objective increases and it turns to an equality constraint MrU = Ũ . The same holds for eq.(13) as well. Thus, the modified problems are:\nmin U tr(U>LrU) and min V tr(V >LcV ) s.t: MrU = Ũ , s.t: M>c V = Ṽ . (16)\nNote that now we have a parameter-free decode stage. It is important now to study the theoretical guarantees on eq. (16). To do this, as eqs. (16) are a specific case of eqs. (12) & (13), we first study the guarantees on eqs. (12) & (13) in Theorem 4. Then, based on this study we directly present the guarantees on the final approximate decoder of eq. (16) in Theorem 5.\nTheorem 4. Let Mr and Mc be such that (2) holds and γ′r, γ ′ c > 0. Let also U\n∗ and V ∗ be respectively the solutions of (12) and (13) with Ũ = MrŪ + Ẽu and Ṽ = McV̄ + Ẽv , where ūi ∈ span(Pkr ), i = 1, · · · , p, v̄j ∈ span(Qkc), j = 1, · · · , n, Ẽu ∈ <ρr×ρr , Ẽv ∈ <ρc×ρc . We have:\n‖Ū∗ − Ū‖F ≤\n√ 2p\nρr(1− δ)\n[( 2 +\n1√ γ′rλkr+1\n) ‖Ẽu‖F\n+ (√ λkr λkr+1 + √ γ′rλkr ) ‖Ū‖F ] , and\n‖E∗‖F ≤\n√ 2\nγ′rλkr+1 ‖Ẽu‖F + √ 2 λkr λkr+1 ‖Ū‖F .\nwhere Ū∗ = PkrP > kr X and E∗ = U∗ − Ū∗. The same inequalities with slight modification also hold for V ∗, which we omit because of space constraints.\nProof: Please refer to Appendix E.\nTheorem 5. Let Mr and Mc be such that (2) holds. Let also U∗ and V ∗ be the solutions of (16) with Ũ = MrŪ and Ṽ = McV̄ , where ūi ∈ span(Pkr ), i = 1, · · · , p, v̄j ∈ span(Qkc), j = 1, · · · , n. We have:\n‖U∗ − Ū‖F ≤\n√ 2p\nρr(1− δ) √ λkr λkr+1 ‖Ū‖F\nwhere U∗ = PkrP > kr X . The same inequalities with slight modification also hold for V ∗, which we omit because of space constraints.\nProof: The proof directly follows from the proof of Theorem 4 by using Ẽu = 0 and γ ′\nr = 0. As X̄ = Ū Σ̄V̄ >, we can say that the error with eqs.(16) is upper bounded by the product of the errors of the individual subspace decoders. Also note that the error again depends on the spectral gaps defined by the ratios λkc/λkc+1 and λkr/λkr+1.\nThe solution to the above problems is simply a graph upsampling operation as explained in Lemma 1.\nLemma 1. Let S ∈ <c×r and R ∈ <d×r be the two matrices such that d < r and d < c. Furthermore, let M ∈ <d×c be a sampling matrix as constructed in (1) and L ∈ <c×c be a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix. We can write S = [S>a |S>b ]>, where Sb ∈ <d×r and Sa ∈ <(c−d)×r are the known and unknown submatrices of S. Then the exact and unique solution to the following problem:\nmin Sa\ntr(S>LS), s.t: MS = R (17)\nis given by Sa = −L−1aaLabR.\nProof: Please refer to Appendix F. Using Lemma 1 and the notation of Section IV-A we can\nwrite:\nU =\n[ −L−1r (Ω̄r, Ω̄r)Lr(Ω̄r,Ωr)Ũ\nŨ ] V = [ −L−1c (Ω̄c, Ω̄c)Lc(Ω̄c,Ωc)Ṽ\nṼ\n] . (18)\nEqs. (18) involves solving a sparse linear system. If each connected component of the graph has at least one labeled element, Lr(Ω̄r, Ω̄r) is full rank and invertible. If the linear system above is not large then one can directly use eq. (18). However, to avoid inverting the big matrix we can use the standard Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method to solve it. Note that the eqs. (18) and even PCG can be implemented in parallel for every column of U and V . This gives a significant advantage over the alternate decoder in terms of computation time. The cost of this decoder is O(OlKkn) where Ol is the number of iterations for the PCG method. The columns of U and V are not normalized with the above solution, therefore, a unit norm normalization step is needed at the end. Once U, V are determined, one can use X = U Σ̃V > √ np/ρrρc(1− δ) to determine the required low-rank matrix X . The decoder for approximate recovery is presented in Algorithm 2.\nAlgorithm 2 Subspace Upsampling based Approximate Decoder for low-rank recovery\nINPUT: X̃ ∈ <ρc×ρr , Lr ∈ <p×p, Lc ∈ <n×n 1. do SV D(X̃) = Ũ Σ̃Ṽ > 2. find k such that Σ̃k,k/Σ̃1,1 < 0.1 3.

Set ui = ui/‖ui‖F , vi = vi/‖vi‖F ,∀i = 1, · · · , k 5. Set Σ = √ np\nρrρc(1−δ) Σ̃\n6. Set X = UΣV > OUTPUT: The full low-rank X ∈ <p×n\nTwo other approximate decoders for low-rank recovery are presented in Appendix G.\nVI. DECODER FOR CLUSTERING As already mentioned earlier, PCA has been widely used for two types of applications: 1) low-rank recovery and 2) clustering. Therefore, in this section, we present a method to perform clustering using our framework.\nFor the clustering application we do not need the full lowrank matrix X . Thus, we propose to do k-means on the lowrank representation of the sampled data X̃ obtained using (4), extract the cluster labels C̃ and then decode the cluster labels C for X on the graphs Lr and Lc.\nLet C̃ ∈ {0, 1}ρc×k be the cluster labels of X̃ (for k clusters) which are obtained by performing k-means. Then,\nC̃ij = { 1 if x̃i ∈ jth cluster 0 otherwise.\nNote that each of the columns c̃i of C̃ is the cluster indicator for one of the k clusters. The goal now is to decode the cluster indicator matrix C ∈ {0, 1}n×k. We refer to the Compressive Spectral Clustering (CSC) framework [42], where the authors solve a similar problem by arguing that each of the columns of C can be obtained by assuming that it lies close to the span(Qkc), where Qkc are the first kc Laplacian eigenvectors of the graph Gc. This requires solving the following convex minimization problem:\nmin C ‖M>c C − C̃‖2F + γ tr(C>LcC) (19)\nThe above problem can be solved independently for each of the columns of C, thus,\nmin ci ‖M>c ci − c̃i‖22 + γc>i Lcci (20)\nFurthermore, note that the graph Gr is not required for this process. Eq.(20) gives a faithful solution for ci if the sampling operator Mc satisfies the restricted isometry property RIP. Thus, for any δc, c ∈ (0, 1), with probability at least 1− c,\n(1− δc)‖w‖22 ≤ n\nρc ‖w>Mc‖22 ≤ (1 + δc)‖w‖22 (21)\nfor all w ∈ span(Qkc) provided that\nρc ≥ 3\nδ2c ν2kc log ( 2kc c ) . (22)\nThis holds true as a consequence of Theorem 1 (eq.(30) in the proof of Theorem 1 and Theorem 5 in [28]).\nEq.(20) requires the tuning of a model parameter γ which we want to avoid. Therefore, we use the same strategy as for the approximate low-rank decoder in Section V-C. The cluster labels c̃i are not noisy because they are obtained by running k-means on the result of FRPCAG eq.(4), which is robust to outliers. Thus, we set γ = 0 in eq.(20) and propose to solve the following problem:\nmin ci\nc>i Lcci s.t: M>c ci = c̃i. (23)\nAccording to Lemma 1, the solution is given by:\nci =\n[ −L−1c (Ω̄c, Ω̄c)Lc(Ω̄c,Ωc)c̃i\nc̃i\n] . (24)\nIdeally, every row of the matrix C should have 1 in exactly one of the k columns, indicating the cluster membership of that data sample. However, the solution C ∈ Rn×k obtained by solving the above problem is not binary. Thus, to finalize the cluster membership (one of the k columns), we perform a maximum pooling for each of the rows of C, i.e,\nCij ← {\n1 if Cij = max{Cij ∀ j = 1 · · · k} 0 otherwise.\nAlgorithm 3 summarizes this procedure.\nAlgorithm 3 Approximate Decoder for clustering\nINPUT: X̃ ∈ <ρc×ρr , Lc ∈ <n×n 1. do k-means on X̃ to get the labels C̃ ∈ {0, 1}ρc×k 2. Solve eqs. (23) for every column of C as following: for i = 1, . . . k do\nsolve minci c > i Lcci s.t M>c ci = c̃i using PCG\nend for 3. Set Cij = 1 if max{Cij ∀ j = 1 · · · k} and 0 otherwise. OUTPUT: cluster indicators for X: C ∈ {0, 1}n×k\nTheorem 6. Let Mc be such that (21) holds. Let also c∗i be the solution of (23) with c̃i = M>c c̄i, where c̄i ∈ span(Qkc), i = 1, · · · , n. We have:\n‖ci∗ − c̄i‖2 ≤ √\nn\nρc(1− δc) √ λkc λkc+1 ‖c̄i‖2\nwhere c∗i = QkcQ > kc ci.\nProof: The proof directly follows from the proof of Theorem 3.2 in [28]. These steps have been repeated in the proof of Theorem 4 in Appendix E as well. Using c∗i = ū ∗ i , c̄i = ūi, n = p, ρc = ρr in eq.(41) one can get theoretical guarantees for eq. (20). Then, by using ẽui = 0 and γ = 0 we get the result of above theorem.\nComputational Complexity: A summary of all the decoders and their computational complexities is presented in Table X of Appendix H. The complete CPCA algorithm and the computational complexities of different steps are presented in Table I. For K, k, ρr, ρc, p n CPCA algorithm scales as O(nkK) per iteration. Thus, assuming that the row and column graphs are available from external source, a speedup of p/k per iteration is obtained over FRPCAG and p2/k over RPCA. A detailed explanation regarding the calculation of complexities of CPCA and other models is presented in\nTable XI and Appendix H.\nMemory Requirements: We compare the memory requirements of CPCA with FRPCAG. For a matrix Y ∈ Rp×n, FRPCAG and CPCA require the construction of two graphs Gr, Gc whose Laplacians Lr ∈ Rp×p, Lc ∈ Rn×n are used in the core algorithm. However, these Laplacians are sparse, therefore the memory requirement for Lr, Lc is O(K(|Er| + |Ec|)) respectively. The core algorithm of FRPCAG requires operation on the full matrix Y and the graph Laplacians Lr, Lc. As |Er| ≈ Kp and |Ec| ≈ Kn therefore, the memory\nrequirement for the regularization terms tr(XLcX>) and tr(X>LrX) is O(Knp). For the CPCA algorithm, assuming n > p and letting ρr = p/b and ρc = n/a, the complexity of FRPCAG on the sampled data is O(Knp/(ab)) and the approximate decode stage for subspaces of dimension k is O(Knk). Thus the overall memory requirement of CPCA is O(Kn(p/(ab) + k)). As compared to FRPCAG, an improvement of pab/(p + kab) is obtained. For example for n = 1000, p = 200, a = 10, b = 1, k = 10, a reduction of approximately 6.6 times is obtained.\nConvergence of CPCA: The CPCA based algorithm (Table I) has two main steps: 1) FRPCAG on the compressed data matrix and 2) low-rank matrix or cluster label decoding. FRPCAG is solved by the FISTA (Algorithm 1) and the decode step is solved using the PCG method. Both of these methods have been well studied in terms of their convergence guarantees. More specifically, one can refer to [3] for a detailed study on FISTA and [2] for PCG. Therefore, we do not include the convergence analysis here for brevity.\nVII. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We perform two types of experiments corresponding to two applications of PCA 1) Data clustering and 2) Low-rank recovery using two open-source toolboxes: the UNLocBoX [26] and the GSPBox [25]."

      "heading" : "A. Clustering",
      "text" : "1) Experimental Setup: Datasets: We perform our clustering experiments on 5 benchmark databases (as in [35], [36]): CMU PIE, ORL, YALE, MNIST and USPS. For the USPS and ORL datasets, we further run two types of experiments 1) on subset of datasets and 2) on full datasets. The experiments on the subsets of the datasets take less time so they are used to show the efficiency of our model for a wide variety of noise types. The details of all datasets used are provided in Table XII of Appendix H.\nNoise & Errors: CPCA is a memory and computationally efficient alternative for FRPCAG. An important property of FRPCAG is its robustness to noise and outliers, just like RPCA. Therefore, it is important to study the performance of CPCA under noise and corruptions similar to those for FRPCAG and RPCA. To do so we add 3 different types of noise in all the samples of datasets in different experiments: 1) Gaussian noise and 2) Laplacian noise with standard deviation ranging from 5% to 20% of the original data 3) Sparse noise (randomly corrupted pixels) occupying 5% to 20% of each data sample.\nComparison with other methods: We compare the clustering performance of CPCA with 11 other models including: 1) k-means on original data 2) Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) [4] 3) Locally Linear Embedding (LLE) [32] 4) Standard PCA 5) Graph Laplacian PCA (GLPCA) [14] 6) Manifold Regularized Matrix Factorization (MMF) [46] 7) Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) [17] 8) Graph Regularized Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (GNMF) [6] 9) Robust PCA (RPCA) [7] 10) Robust PCA on Graphs (RPCAG) [35] and\n11) Fast Robust PCA on Graphs (FRPCAG) [36]. RPCA and RPCAG are not used for the evaluation of MNIST, USPS large and ORL large datasets due to computational complexity of these models.\nPre-processing: All datasets are transformed to zero-mean and unit standard deviation along the features / rows. For MMF the samples are additionally normalized to unit-norm. For NMF and GNMF only the unit-norm normalization is applied to all the samples of the dataset as NMF based models can only work with non-negative data.\nEvaluation Metric: We use clustering error as a metric to compare the clustering performance of various models. The clustering error for LE, PCA, GLPCA, MMF, NMF and GNMF is evaluated by performing k-means on the principal components V (note that these models explicitly learn V , where X = UΣV >). The clustering error for RPCA, RPCAG and FRPCAG is determined by performing k-means directly on the low-rank X . For our CPCA method, k-means is performed on the small low-rank X̃ and then the labels for full X are decoded using Algorithm 3. Parameter Selection: To perform a fair validation for each of the models we use a range of values for the model parameters as presented in Table XIII of Appendix H. For a given dataset, each of the models is run for each of the parameter tuples in this table and the best clustering error is reported. Furthermore, PCA, GLPCA, MMF, NMF and GNMF are non-convex models so they are run 10 times for each of the parameter tuple. RPCA, RPCAG, FRPCAG and CPCA based models are convex so they are run only once. Although our CPCA approach is convex, it involves a bit of randomness due to the sampling step. Due to the extensive nature of the experimental setup, most of the clustering experiments are performed under one sampling condition. However, it is interesting to study the variation of error under different sampling scenarios. For this purpose we perform some additional experiments on the USPS dataset. For our proposed CPCA, we use a convention CPCA(a, b), where a and b denote the downsampling factors on the columns and rows respectively. A uniform sampling strategy is always used for CPCA. Graph Construction: The K-nearest neighbor graphs\nGr, Gc are constructed using FLANN [22] as discussed in Section II. The small graphs G̃r, G̃c can also be constructed using FLANN or the Kron reduction strategy of Section IV-A. For all the experiments reported in this paper we use K-nearest neighbors = 10 and Gaussian kernel for the adjacency matrices W . The smoothing parameters σ2 for the Gaussian kernels are automatically set to the average distance of the K-nearest neighbors.\n2) Discussion on clustering performance: We point out here that the purpose of our clustering experiments is threefold: • To show the efficiency of CPCA for a wide variety of\nnoise and errors and downsampling. • To study the conditions under which CPCA performs\nworse than the other models. • To study the variation of performance under different\nsampling scenarios. For this purpose, we test CPCA under a variety of downsampling for different datasets. Cases with p n and n p carry special interest. Therefore, we present our discussion below in the light of the above goals.\nTables II, III, IV & V present the clustering results for USPS small, USPS large, MNIST large, MNIST small, ORL small, ORL large, CMU PIE and YALE datasets. Note that not all the models are run for all the datasets due to computational constraints. The best results are highlighted in bold and the second best in blue. From Table II for the USPS dataset, it is clear that our proposed CPCA model attains comparable clustering results to the state-of-the-art RPCAG and FRPCAG models and better than the others in most of the cases. Similar observation can be made about the MNIST large dataset from Table V in comparison to FRPCAG.\nIt is important to note that for the USPS and MNIST datasets p n. Thus, for the USPS dataset, the compression is only applied along the columns (n) of the dataset. This compression results in clustering error which is comparable to the other state-of-the-art algorithms. As p = 256 for the USPS dataset, it was observed that even a 2 times downsampling on p results in a loss of information and the clustering quality deteriorates. The same observation can be made about ORL small, ORL large and YALE datasets from Tables III, IV for CPCA (2,2). i.e, two times downsampling on both rows and columns. On the other hand the performance of CPCA (1,2) is reasonable for the ORL small dataset. Recall that CPCA (a,b) means a downsampling by a and b across columns and rows (samples and features). Also note that for ORL dataset n p.\nFinally, we comment about the results on MNIST small dataset (p = 784, n = 1000) from Table II. It is clear that FRPCAG (no compression) results in the best performance. CPCA (5,1) results in a highly undersampled dataset which does not capture enough variations in the MNIST small dataset to deliver a good clustering performance. This particular case supports the fact that compression does not always yield a good performance at the advantage of reduced complexity. Therefore, we study this phenomena below.\nThe above findings for the MNIST dataset are intuitive as it only makes sense to compress both rows and columns in our CPCA based framework if a reasonable speed-up can be obtained without compromising the performance, i.e, if both n and p are large. If either n or p is small then one might only apply compression along the larger dimension, as the compression on the smaller dimension would not speed up the computations significantly. For example, for the USPS dataset, a speed-up of p/k = 256/10 ≈ 25 times would be obtained\nover FRPCAG by compressing along the samples (columns n) only without a loss of clustering quality. Our experiments showed that this speed up increased upto 30 by compressing along the features but with a loss of performance (The results are not presented for brevity).\nTables II, III, IV & V also show that CPCA is quite robust to a variety of noise and errors in the dataset. Even in the presence of higher levels of Gaussian and Laplacian noise, CPCA performs comparable to other methods for the USPS dataset. Thus, CPCA tends to preserve the robustness property of FRPCAG. This will also be clear from the lowrank recovery experiments in the next section.\n3) Computation Time vs Performance & Sampling: It is interesting to compare 1) the time needed for FRPCAG and CPCA to perform clustering 2) the corresponding clustering error and 3) the sub-sampling rates in CPCA. Table V shows such a comparison for 70,000 digits of MNIST with (10, 2) times downsampling on the (columns, rows) respectively for CPCA. The time needed by CPCA is an order of magnitude lower than FRPCAG. Note that the time reported here does not include the construction of graphs Gr, Gc as both methods use the same graphs. Furthermore, these graphs can be constructed in the order of a few seconds if parallel processing is used. The time for CPCA includes steps 2 to 5 and 7 of Table I. For the information about the graph construction time, please refer to Table VI and the discussion thereof.\nTable VI presents the computational time and number of iterations for the convergence of CPCA, FRPCAG, RPCAG & RPCA on different sizes and dimensions of the datasets. We also present the time needed for the graph construction. The computation is done on a single core machine with a 3.3 GHz processor without using any distributed or parallel computing tricks. An ∞ in the table indicates that the algorithm did not converge in 4 hours. It is notable that our model requires a very small number of iterations to converge irrespective of the size of the dataset. Furthermore, the model is orders of magnitude faster than RPCA and RPCAG. This is clearly observed from the experiments on MNIST dataset where our proposed model is 100 times faster than RPCAG. Specially for MNIST dataset with 25000 samples, RPCAG and RPCA did not converge even in 4 hours whereas CPCA converged in less than a minute.\n4) Effect of random sampling: An interesting observation can be made from Table V for the MNIST dataset: the error of CPCA is also lower than FRPCAG. Such cases can also be observed in USPS dataset (Table II). As the downsampling step is random, it might remove some spurious samples sometimes and the clustering scheme (Section VI) becomes robust to these samples. For the clustering application, the spurious samples mostly lie on the cluster borders and deteriorate the\nclustering decision. For the computational purposes (validation for all the noise scenarios) Tables II & V correspond to one run of the CPCA for one specific sampling case.\nIn order to study the effect of random sampling on the clustering performance, we perform an experiment on the full USPS dataset (256 × 10000) with different levels of artificial noise. The results in Fig. 2 correspond to 10 runs of the CPCA under different uniform sampling scenarios. For this experiment, we downsample 10 times along the columns (digits), whereas no downsampling is used across the features and then add different levels of Gaussian noise from 0 to 15% in the dataset. Thus, we downsample the dataset, run FRPCAG to get a low-rank X̃ ∈ R256×1000, perform k-means (k = 10) and then use the approximate clustering decoder (Algorithm 3) to decode the labels for the full dataset. This process is repeated over the whole parameter grid γ ′ r, γ ′\nc ∈ (0, 30) and the minimum error over the grid is considered. Each of the boxplots in this figure summarize the clustering error over 10 runs of CPCA(10,1) for different levels of Gaussian noise. The mean clustering error is 15.05% for the case of no noise and 15.2%, 15.6% and 16% for 5%, 10% and 15% Gaussian noise respectively. Furthermore, the standard deviation for each of the boxplots varies between 0.4% to 0.55%. This result clearly shows that the CPCA performance is quit robust to random sampling. Similar results were observed for other datasets and are not reported here for the purpose of brevity.\nIt is interesting to study the reduction in the total time attained by using CPCA as compared to FRPCAG. Table VI can be used to perform this comparison as well. For example, for the MNIST dataset with 5000 samples, the total time (including graph construction) for FRPCAG is 28.2 secs and that for CPCA is 20.1 secs. Thus, a speed-up of 1.4 times is obtained over FRPCAG. The time required for the construction\nof the graph between the samples or features is often more than that required for the CPCA to converge. This is a small computational bottleneck of the graph construction algorithm. While graph learning or graph construction is an active and interesting field of research, it is not a part of this work. The state-of-the-art results [16], [24], [34] do not provide any scalable solutions yet.\n5) Rank Preservation Under Downsampling: An interesting question about CPCA is if it preserves the underlying rank of the dataset under the proposed sampling scheme. Table VII shows that the rank is preserved even in the presence of noise. For this experiment, we take different datasets and corrupt them with different types of noise and perform cross-validation for clustering using the parameter range for CPCA mentioned in Table XIII (see Appendices). Then, we report the rank of X̃ for the parameter corresponding to the minimum clustering error. As X̃ is approximately low-rank so we use the following strategy to determine the rank k: Σ̃k,k/Σ̃1,1 < 0.1. FRPCAG assumes that the number of clusters ≈ rank of the dataset. Our findings show that this assumption is almost satisfied for the sampled matrices even in the presence of various types of noise. Thus, the rank is preserved under the proposed sampling strategy. For clustering experiments, the lowest error with CPCA occurs when the rank ≈ number of clusters.\n6) Clustering error vs downsampling rate: Table VIII shows the variation of clustering error of CPCA with different downsampling factors across rows and columns of the USPS\ndataset (256 × 10, 000). Obviously, higher downsampling results in an increase in the clustering error. However, note that we can downsample the samples (columns) by a factor of 5 without observing an error increase. The downsampling of features results in an error increase because the number of features for this dataset is only 256 and downsampling results in a loss of information. Similar behavior can also be observed for the ORL small and ORL large datasets in Table III where the performance of CPCA is slightly worse than FRPCAG because the number of samples n for ORL is only 400."

All the frames are vectorized and arranged in a data matrix Y whose columns correspond to frames. The graph Gc is constructed between the columns of Y and the graph Gr is constructed between the rows of Y following the methodology of Section II. Fig. 3 shows the recovery of low-rank frames for one actual frame of each of the videos. The first row corresponds to a frame from the video of a shopping mall lobby, the second row to a restaurant food counter and the third row to an airport lobby. The leftmost plot in each row shows the actual frame, the other 5 show the recovered low-rank representations using RPCA, RPCAG, FRPCAG and CPCA with two different uniform downsampling rates. For CPCA Algorithm 2 is used and the rank k for the approximate decoder is set such that Σ̃k,k/Σ̃1,1 < 0.1, where Σ̃ are the singular values of X̃ .\nFor the 2nd and 3rd rows of Fig. 3 it can be seen that our proposed model is able to separate the static backgrounds very accurately from the moving people which do not belong to the static ground truth. However, the quality is slightly\n7https://sites.google.com/site/backgroundsubtraction/test-sequences\ncompromised in the 1st row where the shadow of the person appears in the low-rank frames recovered with CPCA. In fact, this person remains static for a long time in the video and the uniform sampling compromises the quality slightly.\nTable IX presents the computational time in seconds of RPCA, RPCAG, FRPCAG and CPCA for low-rank recovery of different videos in Fig. 3. The time reported here corresponds to steps 2 to 6 of Table I, Algorithm 1 of [36] for FRPCAG, [7] for RPCA and [35] for RPCAG, excluding the construction of graphs Gr, Gc. The speed-up observed for these experiments from Table IX is 10 times over FRPCAG and 100 times over RPCA and RPCAG.\nFig. 4 presents a comparison of the quality of the lowrank static background extracted using the alternate (8) and approximate decoders discussed in (18) for a video (1st row) of Fig. 3. Clearly, the alternate decoder performs slightly better than the approximate decoders but at the price of tuning of two model parameters.\nFig. 5 presents a comparison of the quality of low-rankness for the same video extracted using the approximate decoder (18) using different downsampling factors on the pixels and frames. It is obvious that the quality of low-rankness remains intact even with higher downsampling factors."

      "text" : "Throughout this work we assume that the graphs Gc and Gr for the complete data matrix Y are either available or can be constructed directly from Y itself using the standard graph construction algorithms. This is a reasonable assumption if one wants to reduce the computational burden by downsampling on the datasets. However, often the complete data matrix Y is not available and the goal is to obtain an estimate of Y from some side information. Typical examples include Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (MRI), Computational Tomography (CT) and Electron Tomography (ET) where one only has access to the projections b of Y acquired through a known projection operator A. The purpose here is not to reduce the computational burden but to acquire a good enough estimate of Y from b. Furthermore, for such applications, there is no notion of row or column projection / sampling operators. Nevertheless, one might want to exploit the row and column smoothness assumption for the purpose of reconstruction. While, this is not a significant part of our current work, it is still an obvious open question and the answer comes from an extension of this work. Therefore, to be complete, we propose a framework for such problems which might require a low-rank reconstruction from a few projections. It is important to emphasize though that the goal is not to compare and evaluate the performance rigorously with the state-of-the-art. In fact we mention this here just to give a flavour of how the current framework can be extended for such problems.\nAssume that a CT sample, for example, a Shepp-Logan phantom of the size X ∈ Rp×n needs to be reconstructed from its projections b ∈ Rm, obtained via a line projection matrix A ∈ Rm×np. Thus, b = Avec(X) + e, where e ∈ Rm models the noise in the projections. We propose to reconstruct the sample X by solving the following optimization problem:\nmin X ‖Avec(X)− b‖22 + γr tr(X>LrX) + γc tr(XLcX>),\n(25) where Lr,Lc are the row and column graph Laplacians between the rows and columns of X . Since, these graphs are not available in the beginning, one can obtain an initial estimate of X by running a standard compressed sensing problem for a few iterations and then construct these graphs from this estimate. The estimated graphs can also be improved after every few iterations from the more refined X .\nFig. 6 shows the reconstruction of a 64 × 64 Modified Shepp-Logan phantom from 20% projections using eq.(25). The initial estimate of the graphs Gr,Gc between the rows and\ncolumns of the phantom is obtained from the first 3 iterations of the compressed sensing based recovery problem and then these graphs are updated every 5 iterations. Our future work will focus on a detailed study of this method.\nVIII. CONCLUSION\nWe present Compressive PCA on Graphs (CPCA) which approximates a recovery of low-rank matrices on graphs from their sampled measurements. It is supported by the proposed restricted isometry property (RIP) which is related to the coherence of the eigenvectors of graphs between the rows and columns of the data matrix. Accompanied with several efficient, parallel, parameter free and low-cost decoders for low-rank recovery and clustering, the presented framework gains a several orders of magnitude speed-up over the low-rank recovery methods like Robust PCA. Our theoretical analysis reveals that CPCA targets exact recovery for low-rank matrices which are clusterable across the rows and columns. Thus, the error depends on the spectral gaps of the graph Laplacians. Extensive clustering experiments on 5 datasets with various types of noise and comparison with 11 state-of-the-art methods reveal the efficiency of our model. CPCA also achieves stateof-the-art results for background separation from videos."

    "abstractText" : "We introduce a novel framework for an approximate recovery of data matrices which are low-rank on graphs, from sampled measurements. The rows and columns of such matrices belong to the span of the first few eigenvectors of the graphs constructed between their rows and columns. We leverage this property to recover the non-linear low-rank structures efficiently from sampled data measurements, with a low cost (linear in n). First, a Resrtricted Isometry Property (RIP) condition is introduced for efficient uniform sampling of the rows and columns of such matrices based on the cumulative coherence of graph eigenvectors. Secondly, a state-of-the-art fast low-rank recovery method is suggested for the sampled data. Finally, several efficient, parallel and parameter-free decoders are presented along with their theoretical analysis for decoding the low-rank and cluster indicators for the full data matrix. Thus, we overcome the computational limitations of the standard linear low-rank recovery methods for big datasets. Our method can also be seen as a major step towards efficient recovery of nonlinear low-rank structures. For a matrix of size n × p, on a single core machine, our method gains a speed up of p/k over Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA), where k p is the subspace dimension. Numerically, we can recover a low-rank matrix of size 10304×1000, 100 times faster than Robust PCA.",
