      "text" : "Modern data science applications increasingly involve learning complex probabilistic models over massive datasets. In many cases, the datasets are distributed into multiple machines at different locations, between which communication is expensive or restricted; this can be either because the data volume is too large to store or process in a single machine, or due to privacy constraints as these in healthcare or financial systems. There has been a recent growing interest in developing communication-efficient algorithms for probabilistic learning with distributed datasets; see e.g., Boyd et al. (2011); Zhang et al. (2012); Dekel et al. (2012); Liu and Ihler (2014); Rosenblatt and Nadler (2014) and reference therein.\nThis work focuses on a one-shot approach for distributed learning, in which we first learn a set of local models from local machines, and then combine them in a fusion center to form a single model that integrates all the information in the local models. This approach is highly efficient in both computation and communication costs, but casts a challenge in designing statistically efficient combination strategies. Many studies have been focused on a simple linear averaging method that linearly averages the parameters of the local models (e.g., Zhang et al., 2012, 2013; Rosenblatt and Nadler, 2014); although nearly optimal asymptotic error rates can be achieved, this simple method tends to degenerate in practical scenarios for models with non-convex log-likelihood or non-identifiable parameters (such as latent variable models, and neural models), and is not applicable at all for models with non-additive parameters (e.g., when the parameters have discrete or categorical values, or the parameter dimensions of the local models are different).\nA better strategy that overcomes all these practical limitations of linear averaging is the KL-averaging method (Liu and Ihler, 2014; Merugu and Ghosh, 2003), which finds a model that minimizes the sum of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to all the local models. In this way, we directly combine the models, instead of the parameters. The exact KL-averaging is not computationally tractable because of the intractability of calculating KL divergences; a practical approach is to draw (bootstrap)\nar X\niv :1\n60 7.\n01 03\n6v 1\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n4 J\nul 2\nsamples from the given local models, and then learn a combined model based on all the bootstrap data. Unfortunately, the bootstrap noise can easily dominate in this approach and we need a very large bootstrap sample size to obtain accurate results. In Section 3, we show that the MSE of the estimator obtained from the naive way is O(N−1 + (dn)−1), where N is the total size of the observed data, and n is bootstrap sample size of each local model and d is the number of machines. This means that to ensure a MSE of O(N−1), which is guaranteed by the centralized method and the simple linear averaging, we need dn & N ; this is unsatisfying since N is usually very large by assumption.\nIn this work, we use variance reduction techniques to cancel out the bootstrap noise and get better KL-averaging estimates. The difficulty of this task is first illustrated using a relatively straightforward control variates method, which unfortunately suffers some of the practical drawback of the linear averaging method due to the use of a linear correction term. We then propose a better method based on a weighted M-estimator, which inherits all the practical advantages of KL-averaging. On the theoretical part, we show that our methods give a MSE of O(N−1 + (dn2)−1), which significantly improves over the original bootstrap estimator. Empirical studies are provided to verify our theoretical results and demonstrate the practical advantages of our methods.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the background, and Section 3 introduces our methods and analyze their theoretical properties. We present numerical results in Section 4 and conclude the paper in Section 5. Detailed proofs can be found in the appendix."

      "heading" : "2 Background and Problem Setting",
      "text" : "Suppose we have a dataset X = {xj , j = 1, 2, ..., N} of size N , i.i.d. drawn from a probabilistic model p(x|θ∗) within a parametric family P = {p(x|θ) : θ ∈ Θ}; here θ∗ is the unknown true parameter that we want to estimate based on X . In the distributed setting, the dataset X is partitioned into d disjoint subsets, X = ⋃d k=1X\nk, where Xk denotes the k-th subset which we assume is stored in a local machine. For simplicity, we assume all the subsets have the same data size (N/d).\nThe traditional maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) provides a natural way for estimating the true parameter θ∗ based on the whole dataset X ,\nGlobal MLE: θ̂mle = arg max θ∈Θ d∑ k=1 N/d∑ j=1 log p(xkj | θ), where Xk = {xkj }. (1)\nHowever, directly calculating the global MLE is challenging due to the distributed partition of the dataset. Although distributed optimization algorithms exist (e.g., Boyd et al., 2011; Shamir et al., 2014), they require iterative communication between the local machines and a fusion center, which can be very time consuming in distributed settings, for which the number of communication rounds forms the main bottleneck (regardless of the amount of information communicated at each round).\nWe instead consider a simpler one-shot approach that first learns a set of local models based on each subset, and then send them to a fusion center in which they are combined into a global model that captures all the information. We assume each of the local models is estimated using a MLE based on subset Xk from the k-th machine:\nLocal MLE: θ̂k = arg max θ∈Θ N/d∑ j=1 log p(xkj | θ), where k ∈ [d] = {1, 2, · · · , d}. (2)\nThe major problem is how to combine these local models into a global model. The simplest way is to linearly average all local MLE parameters:\nLinear Average: θ̂linear = 1\nd d∑ k=1 θ̂k.\nComprehensive theoretical analysis has been done for θ̂linear (e.g., Zhang et al., 2012; Rosenblatt and Nadler, 2014), which show that it has an asymptotic MLE of E||θ̂linear − θ∗|| = O(N−1). In fact, it is equivalent to the global MLE θ̂mle up to the first order O(N−1), and several improvements have been developed to improve the second order term (e.g., Zhang et al., 2012; Huang and Huo, 2015).\nUnfortunately, the linear averaging method can easily break down in practice, or is even not applicable when the underlying model is complex. For example, it may work poorly when the likelihood has multiple modes, or when there exist non-identifiable parameters for which different parameter values correspond to a same model (also known as the label-switching problem); models of this kind include latent variable models and neural networks, and appear widely in machine learning. In addition, the linear averaging method is obviously not applicable when the local models have different numbers of parameters (e.g., Gaussian mixtures with unknown numbers of components), or when the parameters are simply not additive (such as parameters with discrete or categorical values). Further discussions on the practical limitaions of the linear averaging method can be found in Liu and Ihler (2014).\nAll these problems of linear averaging can be well addressed by a KL-averaging method which averages the model (instead of the parameters) by finding a geometric center of the local models in terms of KL divergence (Merugu and Ghosh, 2003; Liu and Ihler, 2014). Specifically, it finds a model p(x | θ∗KL) where θ ∗ KL is obtained by θ ∗ KL = arg minθ ∑d k=1 KL(p(x|θ̂k) || p(x|θ)), which is equivalent to,\nExact KL Estimator: θ∗KL = arg max θ∈Θ\n{ η(θ) ≡ d∑ k=1 ∫ p(x | θ̂k) log p(x | θ)dx } . (3)\nLiu and Ihler (2014) studied the theoretical properties of the KL-averaging method, and showed that it exactly recovers the global MLE, that is, θ∗KL = θ̂mle, when the distribution family is a full exponential family, and achieves an optimal asymptotic error rate (up to the second order) among all the possible combination methods of {θ̂k}. Despite the attractive properties, the exact KL-averaging is not computationally tractable except for very simple models. Liu and Ihler (2014) suggested a naive bootstrap method for approximation: it draws parametric bootstrap sample {x̃kj }nj=1 from each local model p(x|θ̂k), k ∈ [d] and use it to approximate each integral in (3). The optimization in (3) then reduces to a tractable one,\nKL-Naive Estimator: θ̂KL = arg max θ∈Θ\n{ η̂(θ) ≡ 1\nn d∑ k=1 n∑ j=1 log p(x̃kj | θ) } . (4)\nIntuitively, we can treat each X̃k = {x̃kj }nj=1 as an approximation of the original subset Xk = {xkj } N/d j=1 , and hence can be used to approximate the global MLE in (1).\nUnfortunately, as we show in the sequel, the accuracy of θ̂KL critically depends on the bootstrap sample size n, and one would need n to be nearly as large as the original data size N/d to make θ̂KL achieve the baseline asymptotic rate O(N−1) that the simple linear averaging achieves; this is highly undesirably since N is often assumed to be large in distributed learning settings."

      "text" : "We propose two variance reduction techniques for improving the KL-averaging estimates and discuss their theoretical and practical properties. We start with a concrete analysis on the KL-naive estimator θ̂KL, which was missing in Liu and Ihler (2014).\nAssumption 1. 1. log p(x | θ), ∂ log p(x|θ)∂θ , and ∂2 log p(x|θ) ∂θ∂θ>\nare continuous for ∀x ∈ X and ∀θ ∈ Θ; 2. ∂\n2 log p(x|θ) ∂θ∂θ> is positive definite and C1 ≤ ‖∂ 2 log p(x|θ) ∂θ∂θ> ‖ ≤ C2 in a neighbor of θ∗ for ∀x ∈ X , and C1, C2 are some positive constans.\nTheorem 2. Under Assumption 1, θ̂KL is a consistent estimator of θ∗KL as n→∞, and\nE(θ̂KL − θ∗KL) = o( 1 dn ), E‖θ̂KL − θ∗KL‖2 = O( 1 dn ),\nwhere d is the number of machines and n is the bootstrap sample size for each local model p(x | θ̂k).\nThe proof is in Appendix A. Because the MSE between the exact KL estimator θ∗KL and the true parameter θ∗ is O(N−1) as shown in Liu and Ihler (2014), the MSE between θ̂KL and the true\nparameter θ∗ is\nE‖θ̂KL − θ∗‖2 ≈ E‖θ̂KL − θ∗KL‖2 + E‖θ ∗ KL − θ ∗‖2 = O(N−1 + (dn)−1). (5)\nTo make the MSE between θ̂KL and θ∗ equal O(N−1), as what is achieved by the simple linear averaging, we need draw dn & N bootstrap data points in total, which is undesirable since N is often assumed to be very large by the assumption of distributed learning setting (one exception is when the data is distributed due to privacy constraint, in which case N may be relatively small).\nTherefore, it is a critical task to develop more accurate methods that can reduce the noise introduced by the bootstrap process. In the sequel, we introduce two variance reduction techniques to achieve this goal. One is based a (linear) control variates method that improves θ̂KL using a linear correction term, and another is a multiplicative control variates method that modifies the M-estimator in (4) by assigning each bootstrap data point with a positive weight to cancel the noise. We show that both method achieves a higher O(N−1 + (dn2)−1) rate under mild assumptions, while the second method has more attractive practical advantages."

      "heading" : "3.1 Control Variates Estimator",
      "text" : "The control variates method is a technique for variance reduction on Monte Carlo estimation (e.g., Wilson, 1984). It introduces a set of correlated auxiliary random variables with known expectations or asymptotics (referred as the control variates), to balance the variation of the original estimator. In our case, since each bootstrapped subsample X̃k = {x̃kj }nj=1 is know to be drawn from the local model p(x | θ̂k), we can construct a control variate by re-estimating the local model based on X̃k:\nBootstrapped Local MLE: θ̃k = arg max θ∈Θ n∑ j=1 log p(x̃kj | θ), for k ∈ [d], (6)\nwhere θ̃k is known to converge to θ̂k asymptotically. This allows us to define the following control variates estimator:\nKL-Control Estimator: θ̂KL−C = θ̂KL + d∑ k=1 Bk(θ̃k − θ̂k), (7)\nwhere Bk is a matrix chosen to minimize the asymptotic variance of θ̂KL−C ; our derivation shows that the asymptotically optimal Bk has a form of\nBk = −( d∑ k=1 I(θ̂k)) −1I(θ̂k), k ∈ [d], (8)\nwhere I(θ̂k) is the empirical Fisher information matrix of the local model p(x | θ̂k). Note that this differentiates our method from the typical control variates methods where Bk is instead estimated using empirical covariance between the control variates and the original estimator (in our case, we can not directly estimate the covariance because θ̂KL and θ̃k are not averages of i.i.d. samples).The procedure of our method is summarized in Algorithm 1. Note that the form of (7) shares some similarity with the one-step estimator in Huang and Huo (2015), but Huang and Huo (2015) focuses on improving the linear averaging estimator, and is different from our setting.\nWe analyze the asymptotic property of the estimator θ̂KL−C , and summarize it as follows.\nTheorem 3. Under Assumption (1), θ̂KL−C is a consistent estimator of θ∗KL as n → ∞, and its asymptotic MSE is guaranteed to be smaller than the KL-naive estimator θ̂KL, that is,\nnE‖θ̂KL−C − θ∗KL‖2 < nE‖θ̂KL − θ ∗ KL‖2, as n→∞.\nIn addition, whenN > n×d, the θ̂KL−C has “zero-variance” in that E‖θ̂KL−θ∗KL‖2 = O((dn2)−1). Further, in terms of estimating the true parameter, we have\nE‖θ̂KL−C − θ∗‖2 = O(N−1 + (dn2)−1). (9)\nAlgorithm 1 KL-Control Variates Method for Combining Local Models 1: Input: Local model parameters {θ̂k}dk=1. 2: Generate bootstrap data {x̃kj }nj=1 from each p(x|θ̂k), for k ∈ [d]. 3: Calculate the KL-Naive estimator, θ̂KL = arg maxθ∈Θ ∑d k=1 1 n ∑n j=1 log p(x̃ k j |θ).\n4: Re-estimate the local parameters θ̃k via (6) based on the bootstrapped data subset {x̃kj }nj=1, for k ∈ [d].\n5: Estimate the empirical Fish information matrix I(θ̂k) = 1n ∑n j=1 ∂log p(x̃kj |θ̂k) ∂θ ∂log p(x̃kj |θ̂k) ∂θ > ,\nfor k ∈ [d]. 6: Ouput: The parameter θ̂KL−C of the combined model is given by (7) and (8).\nThe proof is in Appendix B. From (9), we can see that the MSE between θ̂KL−C and θ∗ reduces to O(N−1) as long as n & (N/d)1/2, which is a significant improvement over the KL-naive method which requires n & N/d. When the goal is to achieve an O( ) MSE, we would just need to take n & 1/(d )1/2 when N > 1/ , that is, n does not need to increase with N when N is very large.\nMeanwhile, because θ̂KL−C requires a linear combination of θ̂k, θ̃k and θ̂KL, it carries the practical drawbacks of the linear averaging estimator as we discuss in Section 2. This motivates us to develop another KL-weighted method shown in the next section, which achieves the same asymptotical efficiency as θ̂KL−C , while still inherits all the practical advantages of KL-averaging."

      "heading" : "3.2 KL-Weighted Estimator",
      "text" : "Our KL-weighted estimator is based on directly modifying the M-estimator for θ̂KL in (4), by assigning each bootstrap data point x̃kj a positive weight according to the probability ratio p(x̃ k j | θ̂k)/p(x̃ k j | θ̃k) of the actual local model p(x|θ̂k) and the re-estimated model p(x|θ̃k) in (6). Here the probability ratio acts like a multiplicative control variate (Nelson, 1987), which has the advantage of being positive and applicable to non-identifiable, non-additive parameters. Our estimator is defined as\nKL-Weighted Estimator: θ̂KL−W = arg max θ∈Θ\n{ η̃(θ) ≡ d∑ k=1 1 n n∑ j=1 p(x̃kj |θ̂k) p(x̃kj |θ̃k) log p(x̃kj |θ) } .\n(10) We first show that this weighted estimator η̃(θ) gives a more accurate estimation of η(θ) in (3) than the straightforward estimator η̂(θ) defined in (4) for any θ ∈ Θ.\nLemma 4. As n→∞, η̃(θ) is a more accurate estimator of η(θ) than η̂(θ), in that\nnVar(η̃(θ)) ≤ nVar(η̂(θ)), as n→∞, for any θ ∈ Θ. (11)\nThis estimator is motivated by Henmi et al. (2007) in which the same idea is applied to reduce the asymptotic variance in importance sampling. Similar result is also found in Hirano et al. (2003), in which it is shown that a similar weighted estimator with estimated propensity score is more efficient than the estimator using true propensity score in estimating the average treatment effects. Although being a very powerful tool, results of this type seem to be not widely known in machine learning, except several applications in semi-supervised learning (Sokolovska et al., 2008; Kawakita and Kanamori, 2013), and off-policy learning (Li et al., 2015).\nWe go a step further to analyze the asymptotic property of our weighted M-estimator θ̂KL−W that maximizes η̃(θ). It is natural to expect that the asymptotic variance of θ̂KL−W is smaller than that of θ̂KL based on maximizing η̂(θ); this is shown in the following theorem.\nTheorem 5. Under Assumption 1, θ̂KL−W is a consistent estimator of θ∗KL as n→∞, and has a better asymptotic variance than θ̂KL, that is,\nnE‖θ̂KL−W − θ∗KL‖2 ≤ nE‖θ̂KL − θ ∗ KL‖2, when n→∞.\nAlgorithm 2 KL-Weighted Method for Combining Local Models 1: Input: Local MLEs {θ̂k}dk=1. 2: Generate bootstrap sample {x̃kj }nj=1 from each p(x|θ̂k), for k ∈ [d]. 3: Re-estimate the local model parameter θ̃k in (6) based on bootstrap subsample {x̃kj }nj=1, for\neach k ∈ [d]. 4: Output: The parameter θ̂KL−W of the combined model is given by (10).\nWhen N > n × d, we have E‖θ̂KL−W − θ∗KL‖2 = O((dn2)−1) as n → ∞. Further, its MSE for estimating the true parameter θ∗ is\nE‖θ̂KL−W − θ∗‖2 = O(N−1 + (dn2)−1). (12)\nThe proof is in Appendix C. This result is parallel to Theorem 3 for the linear control variates estimator θ̂KL−C . Similarly, it reduces to an O(N−1) rate once we take n & (N/d)1/2.\nMeanwhile, unlike the linear control variates estimator, θ̂KL−W inherits all the practical advantages of KL-averaging: it can be applied whenever the KL-naive estimator can be applied, including for models with non-identifiable parameters, or with different numbers of parameters. The implementation of θ̂KL−W is also much more convenient (see Algorithm 2), since it does not need to calculate the Fisher information matrix as required by Algorithm 1."

We first numerically verify the convergence rates predicted by our theoretical results using simulated data, and then demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in a challenging setting when the number of parameters of the local models are different as decided by Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Finally, we conclude our experiments by testing our methods on a set of real world datasets.\nThe models we tested include probabilistic principal components analysis (PPCA), mixture of PPCA and Gaussian Mixtures Models (GMM). GMM is given by p(x | θ) = ∑m s=1 αsN (µs,Σs)\nwhere θ = (αs,µs,Σs). PPCA model is defined with the help of a hidden variable t, p(x | θ) =∫ p(x | t; θ)p(t | θ)dt, where p(x | t; θ) = N (x; µ + W t, σ2), and p(t | θ) = N (t; 0, I) and\nθ = {µ, W, σ2}. The mixture of PPCA is p(x | θ) = ∑m s=1 αsps(x | θs), where θ = {αs,θs}ms=1 and each ps(x | θs) is a PPCA model. Because all these models are latent variable models with unidentifiable parameters, the direct linear averaging method are not applicable. For GMM, it is still possible to use a matched linear averaging which matches the mixture components of the different local models by minimizing a symmetric KL divergence; the same idea can be used on our linear control variates method to make it applicable to GMM. On the other hand, because the parameters of PPCA-based models are unidentifiable up to arbitrary orthonormal transforms, linear averaging and linear control variates can no longer be applied easily. We use expectation maximization (EM) to learn the parameters in all these three models."

Because there is also an non-identifiability problem in calculating the MSE, we again use the symmetric KL divergence to match the mixture components, and evaluate the MSE on WW> to avoid the non-identifiability w.r.t. orthonormal transforms. To verify the convergence rates w.r.t. n, we fix d and let the total dataset N be very large so that N−1 is negligible. Figure 1 shows the results when we vary n, where we can see that the MSE of KL-naive θ̂KL is O(n−1) while that of KL-control θ̂KL−C and KL-weighted θ̂KL−W are O(n−2); both are consistent with our results in (5), (9) and (12).\nIn Figure 2(a), we increase the number d of local machines, while using a fix n and a very large N , and find that both θ̂KL and θ̂KL−W scales as O(d−1) as expected. Note that since the total\nobservation data size N is fixed, the number of data in each local machine is (N/d) and it decreases as we increase d. It is interesting to see that the performance of the KL-based methods actually increases with more partitions; this is, of course, with a cost of increasing the total bootstrap sample size dn as d increases. Figure 2(b) considers a different setting, in which we increase d when fixing the total observation data size N , and the total bootstrap sample size ntot = n× d. According to (5) and (12), the MSEs of θ̂KL and θ̂KL−W should be about O(n−1tot) and O(dn −2 tot) respectively when N is very large, and this is consistent with the results in Figure 2(b). It is interesting to note that the MSE of θ̂KL is independent with d while that of θ̂KL−W increases linearly with d. This is not conflict with the fact that θ̂KL−W is better than θ̂KL, since we always have d ≤ ntot.\nFigure 2(c) shows the result when we set n = (N/d)α and vary α, where we find that θ̂KL−W quickly converges to the global MLE as α increases, while the KL-naive estimator θ̂KL converges significantly slower. Figure 2(d) demonstrates the case when we increase N while fix d and n, where we see our KL-weighted estimator θ̂KL−W matches closely with N , except when N is very large in which case the O((dn2)−1) term starts to dominate, while KL-naive is much worse. We also find the linear averaging estimator performs poorly, and does not scale with O(N−1) as the theoretical rate claims; this is due to unidentifiable orthonormal transform in the PPCA model that we test on."

Then we have\nθ̂KL − θ∗KL = ( d∑ k=1 I(θ̂k,θ ∗ KL)) −1 d∑ k=1 1 n n∑ j=1 ṡ(x̃kj ;θ ∗ KL) + op( 1 n ) = 0. (21)\nBy the central limit theorem, 1√ n ∑n j=1 ṡ(x̃ k j ;θ ∗ KL) converges to a normal distribution. By some simple calculation, we have\nCov(θ̂KL−θ∗KL, θ̂KL−θ ∗ KL) =\n1 n ( d∑ k=1 I(θ̂k,θ ∗ KL)) −1 d∑ k=1 Var(ṡ(x;θ∗KL) | θ̂k)( d∑ k=1 I(θ̂k,θ ∗ KL)) −1.\n(22) According to our Assumption 1, we already know I(θ̂k,θ∗KL) is positive definite, C1 ≤ ‖I(θ̂k,θ∗KL)‖ ≤ C2. We have ( ∑d k=1 I(θ̂k,θ ∗ KL)) −1 = O( 1d ) and ∑d k=1 Var(ṡ(x;θ ∗ KL) | θ̂k) = O(d). Therefore, E‖θ̂KL − θ∗KL‖2 = trace(Cov(θ̂KL − θ ∗ KL, θ̂KL − θ ∗ KL)) = O( 1 nd ). Because the MSE between the exact KL estimator θ∗KL and the true parameter θ ∗ is O(N−1) as shown in Liu and Ihler (2014), the MSE between θ̂KL and the true parameter θ∗ is\nE‖θ̂KL − θ∗‖2 ≈ E‖θ̂KL − θ∗KL‖2 + E‖θ ∗ KL − θ ∗‖2 = O(N−1 + (dn)−1). We complete the proof of this theorem."

A simple method is to linearly average the parameters of the local models, which, however, tends to be degenerate or not applicable on non-convex models, or models with different parameter dimensions. One more practical strategy is to generate bootstrap samples from the local models, and then learn a joint model based on the combined bootstrap set. Unfortunately, the bootstrap procedure introduces additional noise and can significantly deteriorate the performance. In this work, we propose two variance reduction methods to correct the bootstrap noise, including a weighted M-estimator that is both statistically efficient and practically powerful. Both theoretical and empirical analysis is provided to demonstrate our methods.",
