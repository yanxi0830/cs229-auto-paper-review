      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "The stochastic multi-armed bandit is a classical model for characterizing the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in many decision-making problems in stochastic environments. The popular objectives include maximizing the cumulative sum of rewards, or minimizing the cumulative regret (see e.g., [CBL06, BCB12]). However, in many application domains, the exploration phase and the evaluation phase are separated. The decision-maker can perform a pure-exploration phase to identify an optimal (or nearly optimal) solution, and then keep exploiting this solution. Such problems arise in application domains such as medical trials [Rob85, AB10], communication network [AB10], crowdsourcing [ZCL14, CLTL15]. In particular, the problem of identifying the single best arm in a stochastic bandit game has been has received considerable attention in recent years [AB10, EDMM06, MT04, JMNB14, KKS13, CL15]. The generalization to identifying the top-k arms has also been studied extensively [GGL12, KTAS12, KK13, KCG14, ZCL14, CLTL15]. Since these problems are closely related to the problem we study in the paper, we formally define it as follows.\n∗Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences (IIIS), Tsinghua University, Beijing, China.

Research partly supported by NSF awards CCF-1016799 and CCF-1319811.\nProblem 1. (Best-k-Arm) There are n unknown distributions D1,D2, . . . ,Dn, all supported on [0, 1]. Let the mean of Di be µi. At each step we choose a distribution and get an i.i.d. sample from the distribution. Our goal is to find the k distributions with the largest means (exactly or approximately), with probability at least 1− δ, using as few samples as possible.\nThe distributions above are also called arms in the multi-armed bandit literature. We denote the kth largest mean by µ[k]. In addition, we assume µ[k] and µ[k+1] are different (so the optimal top-k answer is unique).\nIn certain applications such as online ad allocations, there is a natural combinatorial constraint over the set of arms, and we can only choose a subset of arms subject to the given constraint (Best-k-Arm simply involves a cardinality constraint). Motivated by such applications, Chen et al. [CLK+14] introduced the combinatrial pure exploration problem. They considered the general setting with arbitrary combinatorial constraint, and propose several algorithms. In this paper, we consider the same problem under a matroid constraint, one of the most popular combinatorial constraint. The matroid constraint was also discuss in length in [CLK+14].\nThe notion of matroid (see Section 2 for the definition) is an abstraction of many combinatorial structures, including the sets of linearly independent vectors in a given set of vectors, the sets of spanning forests in an undirected graph and many others. We note that Best-k-Arm is a special case of a matroid constraint, since all subsets of size of at most k form a uniform matroid. Now, we formally define the matroid pure exploration bandit problem as follows.\nDefinition 1.1. (Best-Basis) In a Best-Basis instance S = (S,M), we are given a set S of n arms. Each arm a ∈ S is associated with an unknown reward distribution Da, supported on [0, 1], with mean µa (which is unknown as well). Without loss of generality, we assume all arms have distinct means.\nWe are also given a matroid M = (S,I) with ground set identified with the set S of arms. The weight function µ : S → R+ simply sets the weight of a to be the mean of Da; i.e., µ(a) = µa for all a ∈ S. The weights are initially unknown, and are only learned by sampling arms. Our goal is to find a basis (a.k.a. a maximal independent set) of the matroid with the maximum total weight/cost (exactly or approximately), with probability at least 1− δ, using as few samples as possible.\nBesides including Best-k-Arm as a special case, the Best-Basis problem also captures the following natural problems, motivated by various applications.\n1. Suppose we have m disjoint groups G1, . . . , Gm of arms, and we would like to pick the best ki arms from group Gi (where kis are given integers). This is exactly the best-basis problem for a partition matroid. Note that PAC version of the problem cannot be modeled as a disjoint collection of best-k-problems.\nThe special case where ki = 1 has been studied in [GGLB11, BWV12] (under the fixed budget setting). They are motivated by a clinical problem with m subpopulations, where one would like to decide the best ki treatments from the options available for subjects from each subpopulation.\n2. Beside the above constraints for the groups, we may have an additional global constraint on the total number of arms we can choose. This is a special case of a laminar matroid.\n3. An application mentioned in [CLK+14] is the following. Consider a network where the delay of the links are stochastic. A network routing system wants to build a minimum spanning tree to connect all nodes, where the weight of each edges are expected delay of that link. A spanning tree is a basis in a graphical matroid.\n4. Consider a set of workers and a set of tasks. Each worker is able to do only a subset of tasks (which defines a worker-task bipartite graph). Each worker must be assigned to one task (so we need to build a matching between the workers and the tasks) and the reward of a task is stochastic. We would like to identify the set of tasks that can be completed by the set of workers and have maximum total reward. This combinatorial structure (over the subsets of tasks) is a transversal matroid. This problem (or variants) may find applications in crowdsourcing or online advertisement.\nThere are two natural formulations of the Best-Basis problem: in one, we need to identify the unique optimal basis with a certain confidence, and in some others we can settle for an approximate optimal basis (the PAC setting). We now formally define these problems, and present our results."

      "text" : "Definition 1.2. (Exact-Basis) Given a Best-Basis instance S = (S,M) and a confidence level δ > 0, the goal is to output the optimal basis of M (one that maximizes ∑ a∈I µa) with probability at least 1− δ, using as few samples as possible.\nWithout loss of generality, assume that matroid M has no isolated elements (i.e., elements that are included in every basis) and no loops (i.e., elements that belong to no basis), since we can always include or ignore them without affecting the solution. We use OPT(M) to denote the optimal basis (as well as the optimal total weight) for matroid M. For a subset of elements F ⊆ S, let MF denote the restriction of M to F , and M/F denote the contraction of M by F (see Definition 2.3). Note that OPT(M/{e}) + µ(e) is the optimal cost among all bases including e. Naturally, the sample complexity of an algorithm for Exact-Basis depends on the parameters of the problem instance. In particular, we need to define the following gap parameter.\nDefinition 1.3 (Gap). Given a matroid M = (S,I) with cost function µ : S → R+, such that all costs are distinct, define the gap of an element e ∈ S to be\n∆M,µe := { OPT(M)− OPT(MS\\{e}) e ∈ OPT(M) OPT(M)− (OPT(M/{e}) + µ(e)) e 6∈ OPT(M)\nIntuitively, for an element e ∈ OPT(M), its gap is the loss if we do not select e, whereas for an element e /∈ OPT(M), its gap is the loss if we are forced to select e. Since we assume that elements have distinct weights, ∆e > 0 for all arms e. We note that Definition 1.3 is the same as the gap definition in [CLK+14] and generalizes the gaps defined for the Best-k-Arm problem used in [KTAS12] (in Best-k-Arm, the gap of an arm e to be ∆e = µe − µ[k+1] if e is a top-k arm, and ∆e = µ[k] − µe otherwise). Chen et al. [CLK+14] obtained an algorithm with sample complexity\n( ∑\ne∈S\n∆−2e (ln δ −1 + lnn+ ln ∑ e∈S ∆−2e )\n) ,\nwhen specialized to Exact-Basis. 1 We improve upon their result by proving the following theorem.\nTheorem 1.4 (Main Result for Exact Identification). There is an algorithm for Exact-Basis, that returns the optimal basis for S, with probability at least 1− δ, and uses at most\nO\n( ∑\ne∈S\n∆−2e (ln δ −1 + ln k + ln ln∆−1e )\n)\nsamples. Here, k = rank(M) is the size of a basis of M.\nObserve that the dependence is now on the rank of the matroid k, rather than the number of elements n which may be much larger than k. Moreover, the dependence on ∆e is doubly logarithmic.\nFor the special case of the k-uniform matroid, the problem becomes the Best-k-Arm problem, for which the current state-of-the-art is O( ∑n i=1∆ −2 [i] (ln δ −1 + ln ∑n i=1 ∆ −2 [i] )), obtained by [KTAS12]. Theorem 1.4 improves upon this result for the typical case when ln ∑n\ni=1∆ −2 [i] is larger than ln k.\nTheorem 1.4 also matches the recent upper bound of O( ∑n\ni=2∆ −2 [i] (ln ln∆ −1 [i] + ln δ −1)) for Best-\n1-Arm, due to Karnin et al. [KKS13] and Jamieson et al. [JMNB14]. Chen et al. [CLK+14] proved an Ω( ∑\ne∈S ∆ −2 e ln δ −1) lower bound for the problem. Moreover, Kalyanakrishnan et al. [KTAS12] showed an Ω(nε−2(ln δ−1 + ln k)) lower bound for a PAC version (the Explore-k metric, see Section 1.2) of Best-k-Arm. Indeed, in their lower bound instances, all arms have gap ∆e = ε. If we apply our exact algorithm on those instances, the sample complexity is O(nε−2(ln δ−1 + ln k + ln ln ε−1)). Hence, the first two terms of our upper bound are probably necessary in light of the above lower bounds."

      "text" : "Next we discuss our results for the PAC setting. Several notions of approximation were used for the special case of Best-k-Arm, when we return a set I of k arms. Kalyanakrishnan et al. [KTAS12] required that the mean of every arm in I be at least µ[k] − ε (The Explore-k metric). Zhou et al. [ZCL14] required that the average mean 1k ∑ e∈I µe of I be at least 1 k ∑k i=1 µ[i] − ε; we call such a solution an average-ε-optimal solution. Finally, Cao et al. [CLTL15] proposed a stronger metric that required the mean of the ith arm in I be at least µ[i] − ε, for all i ∈ [k]. This notion, which we call elementwise-ε-optimality extends to general matroids: we need that ith largest arm in our solution is at least the ith largest mean in the optimal solution minus ε.\nIn this paper we introduce the stronger notion of an ε-optimal solution.\nDefinition 1.5. (PAC-Basis and ε-optimality) We are given a matroid M = (S,I) with cost function µ : S → R+. We say a basis I is ε-optimal (with respect to µ), if I is an optimal solution for the modified cost function µI,ε, defined as follows:\nµI,ε(e) = { µ(e) + ε for e ∈ I µ(e) for e 6∈ I.\n1Their algorithm works for arbitrary combinatorial constraint. The sample complexity depends on a width parameter of the constraint, which is roughly the number of elements needed to be exchanged from one feasible solution to another. The width can be as large as n. For a matroid, the width is 2.\nIn other words, if we add ε to each element in I, I would become an optimal solution.\nThe proof of the following proposition can be found in the appendix.\nProposition 1.6. For a Best-Basis instance, an ε-optimal solution is also elementwise-ε-optimal. The converse is not necessarily true.\nTheorem 1.7 (Main Result for PAC Setting). There is an algorithm for PAC-Basis which returns an ε-optimal solution for S = (S,M), with probability at least 1− δ, and uses at most\nO(nε−2 · (ln k + ln δ−1))\nsamples, where k = rank(M).\nThis theorem generalizes and strengthens the results in [KTAS12, CLTL15], in which the same sample complexity was obtained for Best-k-Arm under Explore-k and elementwise-ε-optimality metrics, respectively. In fact, this sample complexity is optimal, since an Ω(nε−2(ln k + ln δ−1)) lower bound is known for Explore-k for the special case of Best-k-Arm, due to [KTAS12]."

      "text" : "Several prior algorithms for the PAC versions of Best-1-Arm and Best-k-Arm (e.g., [KKS13, ZCL14, EDMM02]) were elimination-based, roughly using the following framework: In the rth round, we sample each remaining arm Qr times, 2 and eliminate all arms whose empirical means\n2Typically, Qr increases exponentially with r.\nfall below a certain threshold. This threshold can be either a percentile, as in [EDMM02, ZCL14] or an ε-optimal arm obtained by some PAC algorithm, such as in [KKS13]. After eliminating some arms, we proceed to the next round. Small variations to this procedure are possible, e.g., if the number of remaining arms is not much larger than k, we can directly use the näıve uniform sampling algorithm. A main difference in prior works is in their analysis, due to the different PAC-optimality metrics. However, we cannot easily extend this framework to either PAC-Basis or PAC-BasisAvg, since it is not clear how to eliminate even a small constant fraction of arms while ensuring that the optimal value for the remaining set does not drop. Indeed, due to the combinatorial structure of the matroid, we cannot perform elimination based solely on fixed thresholds.\nWe resolve the issue by applying a sampling-and-pruning technique developed by Karger, and used by Karger, Klein, and Tarjan in their expected linear-time randomized algorithm for minimum spanning tree. Here is the high-level idea, in the context of the PAC-Basis problem. We pick a random subset F by including each arm independently with some small constant probability p, and recursively find an ε/3-optimal basis I for the subset F . The key idea is that this basis I can be used to eliminate a significant proportion of arms, while ensuring that the remaining set still contains a desirable solution. Hence, after eliminating those arms, we can recurse on the remaining arms. Unlike the previous algorithms which eliminate arms based on a single threshold, we perform the elimination based on the solution I of a random subset. We feel this extension of the sampling and pruning technique to bandit problems will find other applications.\nAnother popular approach for pure exploration problems is based on upper or lower confidence bounds (UCB or LUCB) (see e.g., [KTAS12, CLK+14]). While being very flexible and easy to apply, the analysis of all such bounds inevitably requires a union bound of all rounds (which is at least n), thus incurring a log n factor, which is worse than the optimal log k factor that we obtain."

      "text" : "The problem of identifying the single best arm, a very special case of our problem, has been studied extensively. For the PAC version of the problem, 3 Even-Dar et al. [EDMM02] provided an algorithm with sample complexity O(nε−2 · ln δ−1), which is also optimal. For the exact version, Mannor and Tsitsiklis [MT04] proved a lower bound of Ω( ∑n i=2 ∆ −2 [i] ln δ −1). [Far64] showed a lower bound of Ω(∆−2[2] ln ln∆ −1 [2] ) even if there are only two arms. Karnin et al. [KKS13] obtained an upper bound of O( ∑n\ni=2∆ −2 [i] (ln ln∆ −1 [i] + ln δ −1)), matching Farrell’s lower bound for two arms.\nJamieson et al. [JMNB14] obtained the same result using a UCB-like algorithm. Very Recently, Chen and Li [CL15] provided a new lower bound of Ω( ∑n i=2 ∆ −2 [i] ln lnn) and an improved upper\nbound of O ( ∆−2[2] ln ln∆ −1 [2] + ∑n i=2 ∆ −2 [i] ln δ −1 + ∑n i=2 ∆ −2 [i] ln lnmin(n,∆ −1 [i] ) ) .\nIn all aforementioned results, we require that the (PAC or exact) algorithm returns a correct answer with probability at least 1− δ. This is called the fixed confidence setting in the literature. Another popular setting is the fixed budget setting, in which the total number of samples is subject to a given budget constraint, and we would like to minimize the failure probability (see e.g., [BWV13, GGL12, KKS13, CLK+14]). Some prior work ([AB10, BWV13, ABL13]) also considered the objective of making the expected simple regret at most ε (i.e., 1k ( ∑k i=1 µ[i] − E[ ∑ a∈T µa]) ≤ ε), which is a somewhat weaker objective.\n3 Since the solution only contains one arm, all different notions of PAC optimality mentioned in Section 1.2 are equivalent.\nThere is a large body of work on minimizing the cumulative regret in online multi-armed bandit games with various combinatorial constraints in different feedback settings (see e.g., [CBL06, BCB12, CBL12, ABL13, CWY13] and the references therein). In an online bandit game, there are T rounds. In the tth round, we can play a combinatorial subset Si of arms. The goal is to minimize T ∑ a∈OPT µa − ∑T t=1 ∑ a∈St\nµa. We note that it is possible to obtain an expected simple regret of ε for Best-Basis, with at most O(nε−2) samples, using the semi-bandit regret bound in [ABL13]. In particular, they provided an online mirror descent algorithm and showed a cumulative regret of√ knT in the semi-bandit feedback setting (i.e., we can only observe the rewards from the arms we played ), where k is the maximum cardinality of a feasible set. By setting T = nk−1ε−2, we get a cumulative regret of n/ε. If we uniformly randomly pick a solution from {St}t∈[T ], we can see that Et∈[T ] 1 k ( ∑ a∈OPT µa − ∑ a∈St µa) ≤ ε. One drawback of their algorithm is that it needs to solve a convex program over the matroid polytope, which can be computationally expensive, while our algorithm is purely combinatorial and very easy to implement.\nIn recent and concurrent work, Gabillon et al. [GLG+16] proposed a new complexity notion for the general combinatorial pure exploration problem, and developed new algorithms in both fixed budget and the fixed confidence setting. They showed that in some cases, the sample complexity of their algorithms is better than that of [CLK+14]. While the current implementations of their algorithm have an exponential running time, even for general matroid constraints, it is an interesting problem to get more efficient algorithms, and to combine their notion of complexity with our techniques."

      "heading" : "2.1 Useful Facts about Matroids",
      "text" : "While there are many equivalent definitions for matroids, we find this one most convenient.\nDefinition 2.1 (Matroid). A matroid M(S,I) consists of a finite set S (called the ground set), and a non-empty family I of subsets of S (with sets in I being called independent sets), satisfying the following:\ni. Any subset of an independent set is an independent set. ii. Given two sets I, J ∈ I, if |I| > |J |, there exists element e ∈ I \\ J such that J ∪ {e} ∈ I.\nFor convenience, we often write I ∈ M instead of I ∈ I to denote that I is an independent set of M. An independent set is maximal if it is not a proper subset of another independent set; a maximal independent set is called a basis.\nDefinition 2.2 (Rank). Given matroid M(S,I) and set A ⊆ S, the rank of A, denoted by rankM(A), is the cardinality of a maximal independent subset contained in A.\nWhen M is clear from context, we merely write rank(A). All bases of a matroid have the same cardinality. We use rank(M), instead of rank(S), to denote the cardinality of every basis of M. We often need to work with the set of independent sets restricted to a subset of elements. Sometimes we can determine to include some elements as a partial solution, we need to work the the rest of the matroid, conditioning on the partial solution. We need the definitions of matroid restrictions and matroid contractions to formalize the above situations.\nDefinition 2.3 (Matroid restrictions and contractions). Let M(S,I) be a matroid. For A ⊆ S, we define the restriction of M to A as follows: MA is also a matroid with ground set A; an independent set of M which is a subset of A is an independent of MA. The contraction of A is defined as follows: M/A is the matroid with ground set S′ = {e ∈ S | rank({e} ∪ A) > rank(A)}, and the independent set family I ′ = {I ⊆ S′ | rank(I ∪ A) = |I|+ rank(A)}.\nBoth MA and M/A are indeed matroids. Sometimes, we may also write M|A and M/A to avoid successive subscripts. In our paper, we only need to contract an independent set A ∈ I. In this case, rank(A) = |A|, and the definition simplifies to the following: a set I (disjoint from A) is independent in M/A, if I ∪A is independent in M.\nDefinition 2.4 (Isolated Elements and Loops). For a matroid M = (S,I) and element e ∈ S, we say e is an isolated element, if it is contained in all bases of M (or equivalently, rank(S) > rank(S \\ {e})). We say e is a loop if it belongs to no basis of M.\nClearly, since the mean of each arm is nonnegative, we can directly select all isolated elements and contract out these elements. Also, we can simply ignore those loops. From now on, we can assume without loss of generality that there is no isolated element or loop in M.\nDefinition 2.5 (Block). Let M(S,I) be a matroid. Given a subset A ⊂ S and an element e such that e 6∈ A, we say A blocks e, if rankM(A ∪ {e}) = rankM(A).\nIntuitively, e is blocked by A if adding e is not useful in increasing the cardinality of the maximal independent set in A. Note that, if A ⊆ B, e 6∈ B and A blocks e, then clearly B also blocks e, due to the submodularity of rank: rank(B ∩ {e}) − rank(B) ≤ rank(A ∩ {e}) − rank(A). We have the following lemma characterizing when a subset A blocks an element e.\nLemma 2.6. If A blocks e, every basis I of MA blocks e.\nProof. Since A blocks e, rankM(A∪{e}) = rankM(A). Consider a basis I of MA. rankM(I∪{e}) ≤ rankM(A ∪ {e}) = rankM(A) = rankM(I). Hence, I blocks e as well.\nThen we define what is an optimal solution for a matroid with respect to a cost function µ.\nDefinition 2.7. Given a matroid M(S,I), and an injective cost/weight function µ : S → R+, let µ(I) := ∑ e∈I µ(e) denote the total weight of elements in the independent set I ∈ M . We say I is an optimal basis (with respect to µ) if µ(I) has the maximum value among all independent sets in I. We define OPTµ(M) = maxI∈I µ(I). With slight abuse of notation, we may also use OPTµ(M) to denote the optimal basis. When µ is clear from the context, we simply write OPT(M).\nFrom now on, we assume the cost of each element is distinct. It is well known that the optimal basis OPT(M) is unique (under the distinctness assumption) and can be obtained by a simple greedy algorithm: We first sort the elements in the decreasing order of their cost. Then, we attempt to add the elements greedily one by one in this order, to the current solution, which is initially empty.\nWe are given matroid M = (S,I) with cost function µ : S → R+. For a subset A ⊆ S, we define\nA≥aµ := {e ∈ A | µ(e) ≥ a}.\nWe define A>aµ , A ≤a µ , A <a µ similarly. Sometimes we omit the subscript µ if it is clear from the context. Finally, the following characterizations of optimal solutions for M all follow from the greedy procedure.\nLemma 2.8. For a matroid M(S,I), cost function µ : S → R+ and basis I ∈ I, the following statements are equivalent:\ni. I is an optimal basis for M with respect to µ. ii. For any e ∈ I, S>µ(e) does not block e. iii. For any e ∈ S \\ I, I≥µ(e) blocks e. iv. For any r ∈ R, I≥r is a basis in MS≥r ."

      "text" : "Our optimal PAC algorithm applies the sampling and pruning technique, initially developed in the celebrated work of Karger, Klein and Tarjan [KKT95]. They used the technique to obtain an expected linear-time algorithm for computing the minimum spanning tree.\nWe first describe the high level idea from [KKT95], which will be instructive for our later development. Suppose we want to find the maximum spanning tree (MST). We first construct a subgraph F by sampling each edge with probability p; this subgraph may not be connected, so we solve the maximum-weight spanning forest I of F . The key idea is this: we can use I to prune a lot “useless”\nedges in the original graph. Formally, an edge e = (u, v) is useless if edges with larger cost in I can connect u and v: this is because the cheapest edge in a cycle does not belong to the MST). (In other words, e is useless if it is blocked by I>µ(e).) Having removed these useless edges, we again recurse on the remaining graph, which now has much fewer edges, to find the MST. A crucial ingredient of the analysis in [KKT95] is to show that I can indeed prune a lot of edges.\nA proof from [KKT95, Kar98] or [MR10, pp. 299-300] shows that an optimal solution from a random subset can help us prune a substantial amount of elements.\nLemma 3.6. ([KKT95, Lemma 2.1 and Remark 2.3]) Given a matroid M = (S,I) with an injective cost function µ : S → R+, sample a subset F of S by selecting each element independently with probability p. An element e ∈ S is called F -good if F>µ(e) does not block e, else it is F -bad. If the r.v. X denotes the number of F -good elements in S, then X is stochastically dominated by NegBin(rank(M); p).\nWe also introduce a lemma which shows an ε-optimal solution I in F can be used to eliminate some sub-optimal arms.\nLemma 3.7. For a matroid M = (S,I) with cost function µ : S → R+, Let F ⊆ S be a subset, and I be an α-optimal basis for MF for some α > 0. If an element e ∈ S \\ I is F -bad, I≥µ(e)−α blocks e.\nProof. As e is F -bad, F≥µ(e) blocks e. Let r = µ(e)− α, and\nD = (F \\ I)≥r+α ∪ I≥r = (F \\ I)≥µ(e) ∪ I≥µ(e)−α.\n(In other words, we first add α to the cost of every element in I, then consider all element with cost at least µ(e) in F ). Then by Lemma 2.8(4) and the fact I is α-optimal for MF , I≥µ(e)−α is maximal for MD (in fact, it is optimal for MD w.r.t. the modified cost function). Clearly F≥µ(e) ⊆ D, so D blocks e as well. Hence I≥µ(e)−α also blocks e, by Lemma 2.6."

The algorithm runs as follows: If the number of arms |S| is sufficiently small, we simply run the näıve uniform sampling algorithm. Otherwise, we sample a subset F of S by selecting each arm with probability p independently, and recurse on the subinstance SF = (F,MF ) to find an α-optimal solution I, where α = ε/3. Next, we uniformly sample each arm in S by calling UniformSample (S, λ, δ ·p/8k), where λ = ε/12. Then, we use I to eliminate those sub-optimal arms in S \\ I. More precisely, a sub-optimal arm e is blocked by the arms of I with empirical values larger than µ̂e − α− 2λ. Finally, we invoke the algorithm recursively on the remaining arms to find an α-optimal solution, which we output as the final result. The pseudo-code can be found in Algorithm 3.\nNote that UniformSample (step 6) is the only step in which we take samples from the arms. Also note that in both recursive calls we set the approximation error to be α = ε/3. Effectively, this makes sure that an arms surviving in deeper recursive call are sampled more times.

Here k = rank(M), and n = |S|. Let c1, c2 be two constants to be specified later. We will prove by induction on |S| that with probability at least 1− δ, PAC-SamplePrune (S = (S,M), ε, δ) returns an ε-optimal solution, using at most c1 · (|S|ε−2 · (ln k + ln δ−1 + c2)) samples. Remember that p = 0.01. We first consider the simple case where |S| is not much larger than k. When |S| ≤ 2p−2 ·max(4 · ln 8δ−1, k), we have that ln |S| = O(ln δ−1+ln k). So the number of samples of Näıve-I is O(|S|ε−2 · (ln |S| + ln δ−1)) = O(|S|ε−2 · (ln k + ln δ−1)); by Lemma 3.5, the returned basis is ε-optimal with probability at least 1− δ. Hence the theorem holds in this case. Now consider the case where |S| > 2p−2 · max(4 · ln 8δ−1, k), and inductively assume that the theorem is true for all instances of size smaller than |S|. We first need the following lemma, which describes the good events that happen with high probability.\nLemma 3.8. Let O be the unique optimal solution for S = (S,M). With probability at least 1− δ/2, the following statements hold simultaneously.\n1. |F | ≤ 2p · |S| (F is obtained in Line 3). 2. There are at most p · |S| F -good elements in S. 3. |µe − µ̂e| ≤ λ, for all elements e ∈ O ∪ I (I is obtained in Line 5). 4. I is an α-optimal solution for F .\nProof. Let n = |S|. By Corollary A.2, we have that\nPr[|F | > 2pn] = Pr[Bin(n, p) > 2pn] ≤ e−pn/3 ≤ δ/8,\nfor n ≥ 8p−2(ln 8δ−1). Moreover, let X be the r.v. denoting the number of F -good elements in S. By Lemma 3.6, X is dominated by NegBin(k; p), and hence\nPr[X > pn] ≤ Pr[NegBin(k; p) > pn] = Pr[Bin(pn, p) < k] ≤ Pr[Bin(pn, p) < 1 2 p2n] ≤ e− 18p2n ≤ δ/8.\nThe second inequality holds since p2n ≥ 2k, while the last inequality is due to 18p2n ≥ ln δ−1+ln 8. In addition, by Lemma 2.9 and a trivial union bound over all arms in O ∪ I, the third statement holds with probability at least 1− (p · δ/8k) · (2k) ≥ 1− δ/8. Finally, conditioning on the first statement, we have |F | < |S|, and hence by the induction hypothesis, with probability at least 1− δ/8, I is an α-optimal solution for F . Putting them together, all four statements hold with probability at least 1− δ/8 · 4 = 1− δ/2.\nNow let E denote the event that all statements in Lemma 3.8 hold. We show each F -bad element in S \\ I has a constant probability to be eliminated.\nLemma 3.9. Conditioning on E, for an F -bad element e ∈ S \\ I, Pr[e ∈ S′] ≤ δ · p/8k.\nProof. Conditioning on E , I is α-optimal for F . Hence, by Lemma 3.7, for an F -bad element e ∈ S \\ I, I≥µe−αµ blocks e. By Lemma 3.5, |µ̂e − µe| ≤ λ with probability 1 − p · δ/8k. Moreover, conditioning on E , we have |µ̂a −µa| ≤ λ for every element a ∈ I (by Lemma 3.8.3). Consequently, I≥µe−αµ ⊆ I≥µ̂e−α−2λµ̂ , which implies that I ≥µ̂e−α−2λ µ̂ blocks e. By the definition of S\n′, this means e /∈ S′. Hence, we have Pr[e ∈ S′ | E ] ≤ δ · p/8k.\nNow, we show that with high probability, S′ is a 2ε/3-approximate subset of S, and the size of S′ is much smaller than |S|.\nLemma 3.10. Conditioning on E, |S′| ≤ 2p|S|, and S′ is an (α + 4λ)-approximate subset of S, with probability 1− δ/4.\nProof. Conditioned on event E , there are at most p · |S| F -good elements in S (by Lemma 3.8.2). If X denotes the number of F -bad elements in S \\ I which remain in S′, Lemma 3.9 implies E[X] ≤ δ · (p/8k) · |S \\ I| ≤ δ · p/8 · |S|. By Markov’s inequality, we have Pr[X ≥ 0.5p|S|] ≤ Pr[X ≥ 4 · δ−1E[X]] ≤ δ/4. So there are at most |I| + 1.5p · |S| ≤ k + 1.5p|S| ≤ 2p|S| elements in S′ with probability at least 1− δ/4. For the second part, observe that O ∪ S′ ⊆ S is a 0-approximate subset of S, so by Lemma 3.4, it suffices to show S′ is an (α + 4λ)-approximate subset for O ∪ S′. Still conditioned on event E , for all arms e ∈ I ∪ O, we have |µe − µ̂e| ≤ λ. So for an arm e ∈ O \\ S′, we have I≥µ̂e−α−2λµ̂ blocks e (otherwise, e should be included in S′), which implies I≥µe−α−4λµ blocks e. Since I ⊆ S′, we can see S′ is an (α+ 4λ)-approximate subset of S′ ∪O by Definition 3.2.\nFinally, we are ready to prove Theorem 1.7.\nProof of Theorem 1.7. Let EG be the intersection of the event E , the event that Lemma 3.10 holds and the event that PAC-SamplePrune (line 8) outputs correctly. Conditioning on event E , |S′| < |S|, so by the induction hypothesis, the last event happens with probability at least 1 − δ/4. Hence, Pr[EG] ≥ 1− δ/2 − δ/4 − δ/4 = 1− δ. We condition our following argument on EG. First we show the algorithm is correct. By Lemma 3.10, S′ is an (α + 4λ)-approximate subset of S, and the returned basis J is an α-optimal solution of S′, hence also an α-approximate subset of\nS′. By the “transitivity” property of Lemma 3.4, J is an (α + α + 4λ)-approximate subset of S. This is an ε-optimal solution of S since α+ α+ 4λ = ε.\nBy Lemma 3.8 and Lemma 4.1, we have |F | ≤ 2p · |S| and |S′| ≤ 2p · |S|. By the induction hypothesis, the total number of samples in both recursive calls (line 6 and line 8) can be bounded by c1 · 4p|S|ε−2(ln δ−1 + ln k + c2) · 9 ≤ 36c1p · |S|ε−2(ln δ−1 + ln k + c2). The number of samples incurred by UniformSample (line 7) can be bounded by\n|S|λ−2 · (ln δ−1 + ln 16 + ln p−1 + ln k)/2 ≤ 72|S|ε−2 · (ln δ−1 + ln 16 + ln p−1 + ln k).\nNow, let c2 = ln 16 + ln p −1, which is a constant. Then the total number of samples is bounded by\n(36p · c1 + 72)|S|ε−2 · (ln δ−1 + ln k + c2).\nSetting c1 = max(120, c0), and plugging in p = 0.01, we can see the above quantity is bounded by c1 · |S|ε−2 · (ln δ−1 + ln k + c2), which completes the proof.\nAlgorithm 4: Exact-ExpGap (S, ε, δ) Data: An Exact-Basis instance S = (S,M), with rank(M) = k, approx. error ε,\nconfidence level δ.

If we denote the unique optimal basis by OPT, and let BAD be the set of all other arms in S \\OPT, our goal for the Exact-Basis problem is to find this set OPT with confidence 1− δ using as few samples as possible. Our algorithm Exact-ExpGap is based on our previous PAC result for PAC-Basis, and also borrow some idea from the Exponential-Gap-Eliminating algorithm by [KKS13]. It will run in rounds. In each round, it either tries to eliminate some arms in BAD (we call such a round an eliminationround), or adds some arms from OPT into our solution and removes them from further consideration (we call such a round a selection-round). Let us give some details about these two kinds of rounds. Let Mcur be the current matroid defined over the remaining arms, nopt be the number of remaining arms in OPT, and nbad be the number of remaining arms in BAD.\n1. (elimination-round) When nopt ≤ nbad, we are in an elimination-round.

We sample each arm in I by calling UniformSample(I, εr/2, δr/nopt) to estimate their means. We do the same for arms Scur \\ I by calling UniformSample(Scur \\ I, εr, δr/nopt). Note the confidence parameter is not low enough to give accurate estimations for all arms in Scur \\ I with high probability: that would require us reducing the parameter to δr/|Scur \\ I|. However, we will be satisfied with being accurate only for arms in OPT \\ I with probability δr.\nFinally, we use I to eliminate some sub-optimal arms. In particular, an arm e should be eliminated if I≥µ̂e+1.5εrµ̂ blocks e, where µ̂ is the cost function defined by the empirical means obtained from the above UniformSample procedures.\n2. (selection-round) When nbad < nopt, we are in a selection-round. In the r th selection-round,\nwe sample all the arms in Mcur by calling UniformSample(Scur, εr, δr/|Scur|).

In the rth elimination-round, the specification of the failure probabilities of PAC-SamplePrune and UniformSample imply the first three statements hold with probability 1 − 3δr.

A trivial union bound over all rounds gives\nPr[¬E ] ≤ +∞∑\nr=1\n(3δr + δr) =\n+∞∑\nr=1\n4δ/100r3 ≤ δ/5,\nand the lemma follows immediately.\nLemma 4.2. Conditioning on E, the subset Ans returned by the algorithm is the optimal basis OPT.\nProof. We condition on E in the following discussion. We show that the algorithm only deletes arms from BAD in every elimination-round, and it only selects arms from OPT in every selection-round. We say a round is correct if it satisfies the above requirements. We prove all rounds are correct by induction. Consider a round, and suppose all previous rounds are correct. Hence, at the beginning of the current round, Ans clearly is a subset of OPT, and OPT(Mcur) = OPT \\Ans. There are two cases:\nIf the current round is an elimination-round, consider an arm u ∈ OPT(Mcur) = OPT\\Ans. We can see that I>µuµ does not block u in Mcur, by the characterization of the matroid optimal solutions in Lemma 2.8.2. Since |µ̂u −µu| < εr for all u ∈ OPT(Mcur), and |µ̂e −µe| < εr/2 for all e ∈ I, we also have I≥µ̂u+1.5εrµ̂ does not block u in Mcur. Hence u ∈ Snew, and it is not eliminated.\nNext, consider a selection-round and an arm u ∈ BAD ∩ Scur. By the induction hypothesis, in the beginning of the round, u 6∈ OPT(Mcur). Then, we can see u is blocked by (Scur \\ {u})≥µuµ in Mcur by Lemma 2.8.3. Again, for all arms e in Scur, |µe − µ̂e| < εr, so u is also blocked by (Scur \\ {u})≥µ̂u−2εrµ̂ in Mcur. Hence u 6∈ U , and is not selected into Ans. Finally, if the algorithms returns, we have |Ans| = |OPT| = rank(M). Since Ans ⊆ OPT, it must be the case that Ans = OPT."

We partition the arms in OPT and BAD based on their gaps, as follows:\nOPTs = {u ∈ OPT | 2−s ≤ ∆u < 2−s+1}, BADs = {u ∈ BAD | 2−s ≤ ∆u < 2−s+1}.\nMoreover, we define OPTr,s := S r sele ∩ OPTs, i.e., the set of arms in OPTs not selected in the rth selection-round—recall that in a selection-round we aim to select those arms into OPT. Similarly, define BADr,s := S r elim ∩ BADs as the set of arms in BADs not eliminated the rth eliminationround—again, in an elimination-round we aim to delete those arms in BAD.\nVery roughly speaking, the sth round is dedicated to deal with those arms with gap roughly O(2−s) (namely, an arm in OPTs is likely to be selected in the s\nth selection-round and an arm in BADs is likely to be eliminated in the sth elimination-round).

All the following arguments are conditioned on event E . We first prove a useful lemma which roughly states that if we select some elements in OPT and remove some elements in BAD, the gap of the remaining instance does not decrease.\nLemma 4.4. For two subsets A,B of S such that A ⊆ OPT ⊆ B, consider the matroid M′ = (M|B)/A. Let S′ be its ground set. For all element u ∈ S′, we have that ∆M′u ≥ ∆Mu .\nProof. By the definition of matroid contraction and the fact that A is independent, we can see for any subset U ⊆ S′, U is independent in M′ iff U ∪ A is independent in M. We also have rankM′(S\n′) = rankM(S)− |A| and OPT \\A is the unique optimal solution for M′. Now, let u ∈ S′. Suppose u ∈ OPT(M′) = OPT \\ A. Suppose for contradiction that ∆M′u < ∆Mu . Then we have a basis I contained in S′ \\ {u} in M′ such that\nµ(I) = µ(OPT \\ A)−∆M′u > µ(OPT \\ A)−∆Mu .\nBut this means I ∪A is a basis contained in S \\ {u} in M such that µ(I ∪A) > OPT(M) −∆Mu , contradicting to the definition of ∆Mu . Note that a non-isolated element in M may become isolated in M′ (for which ∆M′u = +∞). Then, we consider the case u 6∈ OPT(M′) = OPT \\ A. The argument is quite similar. Suppose for contradiction that ∆M ′\nu < ∆ M u . This means that there exists a basis I in M′ such that u ∈ I and\nµ(I) > OPT(M′) − ∆Mu = µ(OPT \\ A) − ∆Mu . But this means A ∪ I is a basis in M such that µ(A ∪ I) > OPT−∆Mu . Since u ∈ (A ∪ I), this contradicts the definition of ∆Mu .\nProof of Lemma 4.3. We first prove |OPTr,s| = 0 for r ≥ s. Suppose we are at the beginning of the rth selection-round. Let A = Ans and B = Scur ∪ Ans. We can see A ⊆ OPT ⊆ B and Mcur = (M|B)/A. For any arm u ∈ OPTr−1,s such that s ≤ r, we have ∆u ≥ 2−s ≥ 2−r ≥ 4εr. By Lemma 4.4, we have ∆Mcuru ≥ ∆Mu ≥ 4εr, which means (Scur \\ {u})>µu−4εrµ does not block u. Note that conditioning on E , |µe − µ̂e| < εr for all e ∈ Scur. This implies that (Scur \\ {u})≥µ̂u−2εrµ̂ does not block u as well. So u ∈ U (U is defined in line 21) and consequently |OPTr,s| = 0.

For any arm u ∈ BADr−1,s such that s ≤ r, we have ∆u ≥ 2−s ≥ 2−r ≥ 4εr. By Lemma 4.4, we have ∆Mcuru ≥ ∆Mu ≥ 4εr. So (Scur)≥µu+4εrµ blocks u in Mcur by the definition of ∆Mcuru . As I is εr-optimal for Mcur, we also have u is blocked by I≥µu+3εrµ in Mcur. This implies that u /∈ I. Since we have |µu − µ̂u| < εr with probability 1− δr, combining with the fact that |µe − µ̂e| < εr/2 for all e ∈ I (guaranteed by E), u is blocked by I>µ̂u+1.5εrµ̂ with probability 1 − δr. This implies that u 6∈ BADr,s (u should be eliminated in line 12). From the above, we can see that\nE[|BADr,s|] ≤ δr|BADr−1,s|.\nBy Markov inequality, we have Pr[|BADr,s| ≥ 18 |BADr−1,s|] ≤ 8δr, which concludes the proof.\nFinally, everything is in place to prove Theorem 1.4.\nProof of Theorem 1.4. Let EG be the intersection of event E and the event that Lemma 4.3 holds. By Lemma 4.1 and Lemma 4.3, Pr[EG] ≥ 1− δ. Now we condition on this event. The correctness has been proved in Lemma 4.2. We only need to bound the sample complexity of Exact-ExpGap.\nWe first consider the number samples taken by the UniformSample procedure. We handle the samples taken by PAC-SamplePrune later. Now, we bound the total number of samples taken from\narms in OPTs in all selection-round s. Notice that we can safely ignore all samples on arms in BAD since nopt ≥ nbad. By Lemma 4.3, |OPTr,s| = 0 for r ≥ s. So it can be bounded as:\nO\n( s∑\nr=1\n|OPTr−1,s| · (lnnopt + ln δ−1r )ε−2r\n) ≤ O ( s∑\nr=1\n|OPTs| · (ln k + ln δ−1 + ln r)ε−2r\n)\n≤ O ( |OPTs| · (ln k + ln δ−1 + ln s) · 4s ) .\nNext, we consider the number of samples from elimination-round s. In an elimination-round, since nopt ≤ nbad, we only need to bound the number of samples from BAD. The total number of samples taken from arms in BADs in the first s elimination-rounds can be bounded as:\nO\n( s∑\nr=1\n|BADr−1,s| · (ln |Scur|+ ln δ−1r )ε−2r\n) ≤ O ( |BADs| · (ln k + ln δ−1 + ln s) · 4s )\nThe inequality holds since |Scur| ≤ nopt + nbad ≤ 2nopt ≤ 2k in a selection-round. Now, we bound the number of samples from the remaining rounds. Since |BADr,s| ≤ 18 |BADr−1,s| when r ≥ s, we have:\nO\n( +∞∑\nr=s+1\n|BADr−1,s| · (ln |Scur|+ ln δ−1r )ε−2r\n) = O ( +∞∑\nr=s+1\n1\n8r−s · |BADs| · (ln k + ln δ−1 + ln r)ε−2r\n)\n= O ( |BADs| · (ln k + ln δ−1 + ln s) · 4s )\nPutting them together, we can see the number of samples incurred by UniformSample is bounded by:\nO\n( +∞∑\ns=1\n(|BADs|+ |OPTs|) · (ln k + ln δ−1 + ln s) · 4s ) ,\nwhich simplifies to O (∑\ne∈S ∆ −2 e (ln k + ln δ −1 + ln ln∆−1e ) ) . Finally, we consider the number of\nsamples taken by PAC-SamplePrune. Noticing nopt = rank(Mcur), the number of samples is O(|Scur|(ln nopt + ln δ−1r )ε−2r ). So PAC-SamplePrune does not affect the sample complexity, and we finish our proof."

      "text" : "The following procedure Elimination is our main ingredient. Roughly speaking, it can help us to eliminate a constant fraction of the remaining arms while preserving the value of the optimal solution.\nThe idea of the procedure is similar to PAC-SamplePrune in Section 3. It runs as follows. It first samples a random subset F by choosing each element with probability p independently. Then it finds a ǫ/5-optimal solution I for F using PAC-SamplePrune. Afterwards, we estimate the means of all arms in I by calling UniformSample(I, α, δ/6k). This guarantees the additive errors for all arms in I are at most α = ε/5, with probability at least 1− δ/6. Then we take a uniform number Q0 = β\n−2max(ln 6δ/k, ln 200/2) of samples from the other arms. Next, we use I to eliminate those sub-optimal arms in S \\ I based on their empirical means. More precisely, an arm e should be eliminated if it is blocked by the arms of I with empirical means larger than the empirical mean of e minus 3ε/5. The pseudo-code can be found in Algorithm 6.\nAlgorithm 6: Elimination(S, ε, δ) Data: A PAC-Basis-Avg instance S = (S,M), with rank(M) = k, approximation error ε,\nconfidence level δ.

Let µ̂e be its empirical mean. 7 Return S′ = I ∪ {e ∈ S \\ I | I≥µ̂e−λ−α−βµ̂ does not block e}\nWe first specify the event we condition our analysis on. The proof of the following lemma is almost identical to that for Lemma 3.8 and can be found in the appendix.\nLemma 5.2. With probability at least 1− 2δ/3, the following statements hold: 1. |F | ≤ 2pN = O(k + ln δ−1). 2. The number of F -good elements in S is at most 0.04N . 3. I is λ-optimal for F . 4. |µe − µ̂e| ≤ α for all elements e ∈ I.\nDenote the event described in the previous Lemma by E . In the following we condition on event E . For notational convenience, we define the average value of a subset.\nDefinition 5.3. Given a matroid M = (S,I) and µ : S → R+ be a cost function, for any subset A ⊆ S, define the average value of A to be\nvalM,µ(A) := { OPTµ(MA)/rank(A) rank(A) = rank(S), −∞ rank(A) < rank(S).\nWhen M or µ is clear from the context, we omit it for convenience.\nThe following lemma summarizes the properties of Elimination, which roughly says that we can eliminate a significant portion of arms while the value does not drop by much.\nLemma 5.4. Let N = |S|. Suppose N ≥ 100 · (k + ln δ−1 + ln 6) and Elimination(S, ε, δ) returns S′. With probability at least 1− δ, the following statements hold:\n1. val(S′) ≥ val(S)− ε. 2. |S′| ≤ 0.1|S|. 3. It takes O (( (1 + ln δ−1/k)|S| + (k + ln δ−1)(ln k + ln δ−1) ) ε−2 ) samples.\nProof. Let O be the optimal solution of S, and Õ = O \\ I. We prove the first claim by showing valµ(I ∪ (O∩S′)) ≥ valµ(O)−ε = valµ(S)−ε. Now, we fix the set I found in step 4 (which satisfies E). For each arm u ∈ Õ, set ∆u = min{w ∈ R | I≥µu−wµ blocks u}. Note that for fixed I, ∆u is a fixed number for each u. As u ∈ Õ ⊆ O, we must have ∆u ≥ 0. Let γ = λ+ 2α+ β. For each u ∈ O, let ηu = max(0,∆u − γ) if u ∈ Õ, otherwise let ηu = 0. Note that ηu is a fixed number, if we fix I. For each u ∈ O, we also define the random variables Xu as follows:\nXu = { 0 if u ∈ S′; ηu if u ∈ O \\ S′.\nNote that the randomness of Xu is only due to step 6 (which may cause u ∈ S′ or u /∈ S′). We define X = 1k ∑ u∈O Xu. Now, we show Pr[X > β] ≤ δ/6. Note those random variables are independent. We first show that for each u ∈ O, Pr[Xu = ηu] ≤ exp(−η2u · 2Q0). It trivially holds for the case ηu = 0. So we only need to consider the case ∆u > γ. Suppose u 6∈ S′. So, we have I≥µ̂u−λ−α−βµ̂ blocks u. Since |µe − µ̂e| ≤ α for all arms e ∈ I, we have I≥µ̂u−λ−2α−βµ = I ≥µ̂u−γ µ blocks u as well (recall γ = λ + 2α + β). By the definition of ∆u, we have µ̂u − γ ≤ µu − ∆u, which means µ̂u − µu < γ −∆u = −ηu. By Proposition A.1.1, we have Pr[µ̂u − µu < −ηu] ≤ exp(−η2u · 2Q0). So Pr[Xu = ηu] ≤ Pr[µ̂u − µu < −ηu] ≤ exp(−η2u · 2Q0).\nThen we can apply Proposition A.3 with t = 2Q0 and obtain\nPr[X > β] < exp(−β2 · kQ0) ≤ δ/6.\nNow, we show X ≤ β implies valµ(I ∪ (O ∩S′)) ≥ valµ(O)− ε. We define a new cost function µ̃ on I ∪O as follows:\nµ̃(e) = { µe e ∈ (I ∪O) ∩ S′ µe −∆e e ∈ Õ \\ S′.\nNote that I ⊆ S′, hence µ̃ is well-defined for all elements in I ∪O. For all element u ∈ Õ \\ S′, by the definition of ∆u, I ≥µ̃(u) µ̃ = I ≥µu−∆u µ blocks u. Hence, we have\nOPTµ̃(I ∪O) = OPTµ̃((I ∪O) ∩ S′).\nBy the definition of µ̃, we can see that\nOPTµ((I ∪O) ∩ S′) ≥ OPTµ̃((I ∪O) ∩ S′) = OPTµ̃(I ∪O) ≥ OPTµ(I ∪O)− ∑\nu∈Õ\\S′\n∆u.\nThe first inequality is due to the fact that ∆u > 0 for all u ∈ Õ. The last inequality is due to the fact that the total value we added is no more than\n∑ u∈Õ\\S′ ∆u. Note that ∑ u∈Õ\\S′ ∆u ≤ ∑ u∈O(Xu+γ)\nby the definition of Xu. Hence X ≤ β implies ∑\nu∈Õ\\S′ ∆u ≤ (β + γ) · k ≤ k · ε, which further implies\nvalµ(S ′) ≥ valµ(I ∪ (O ∩ S′)) ≥ valµ(I ∪O)− ε = valµ(S)− ε.\nThis proves the first claim.\nNext, we prove the second claim. Let NB be the number of F -bad elements in S \\ I. Then by Lemma 5.2 and N ≥ 100k, NB ≥ N−0.04N−k ≥ 0.95N . Let e be an F -bad element in S\\I. F≥µeµ blocks e. Since I is λ-optimal for F , we have I≥µe−λµ blocks e by Lemma 3.7. By Proposition A.1.1, with probability at least 1−2 exp(−2Q0β2) ≥ 1− 1100 , |µe−µ̂e| ≤ β. In that case, since |µu−µ̂u| ≤ α for all elements u ∈ I, we have that I≥µe−λµ ⊆ I≥µ̂e−λ−α−βµ̂ , which means I ≥µ̂e−λ−α−β µ̂ blocks e. Hence, e 6∈ S′. Then we can see that for each F -bad element in S \\I, with probability ≤ 1100 , it is in S′. All these events are independent. So let Y denote the number of the remaining F -bad elements in S \\ I. By the above argument, we can see Y is stochastically dominated by Bin(NB , 1100 ). Then applying Corollary A.2, we can obtain that\nPr[Y > 0.05N ] ≤ Pr[Bin(NB , 1/100) > 0.05N ] ≤ Pr[Bin(N, 1/100) > 0.05N ] ≤ exp(−42 · 0.01N/3) ≤ exp(−0.01N) ≤ δ/6.\nSo with probability at least 1 − 2δ/3 − 2δ/6 = 1 − δ, Y ≤ 0.05N , and |S′| ≤ N − (NB − Y ) ≤ N − (0.95N − 0.05N) ≤ 0.1|S|, which proves the second claim. Finally, we examine the sample complexity. Since |F | = O(k+ln δ−1), we can see that the procedure PAC-SamplePrune(F, λ, δ/6) takes O((k + ln δ−1)(ln k + ln δ−1)ε−2) samples by Theorem 1.7. By Lemma 2.9, UniformSample(I, α, δ/6k) takes O(k(ln k + ln δ−1)ε−2) samples. Finally, the sampling step (line 6) incurs O((|S|+ln δ−1/k)ε−2) samples. Summing them together, we can see the sample complexity of Elimination is as claimed."

Note that when nk ≤ 10 or ln δ−1 > k ln nk , Näıve-II(S, ε, δ) returns a correct solution and takes O(n(1 + ln δ−1/k)) samples. So from now on we assume ln δ−1 ≤ k ln nk and n > 10k. Note that by a simple union bound, with probability at least 1 − δ, all calls to Elimination return correctly, and the last call to Näıve-II also returns correctly.

Now, consider the sorted list of the arms according to the modified cost function µI,ε. The arm ai is ranked after oi and all oj with j < i.

In a Best-Basis instance, we are given n stochastic arms with unknown reward distributions, as well as a matroid M over the arms. Let the weight of an arm be the mean of its reward distribution. Our goal is to identify a basis of M with the maximum total weight, using as few samples as possible. The problem is a significant generalization of the best arm identification problem and the top-k arm identification problem, which have attracted significant attentions in recent years. We study both the exact and PAC versions of Best-Basis, and provide algorithms with nearlyoptimal sample complexities for these versions. Our results generalize and/or improve on several previous results for the top-k arm identification problem and the combinatorial pure exploration problem when the combinatorial constraint is a matroid.",
