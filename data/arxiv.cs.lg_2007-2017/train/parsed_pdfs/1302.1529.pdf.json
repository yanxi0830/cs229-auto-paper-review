When a multi­ link lookahead search is used, the computa­ tional complexity of the learning algorithm increases. We study how to use parallelism to tackle the increased complexity in learn­ ing such models and to speed up learning in large domains. An algorithm is proposed to decompose the learning task for parallel pro­ cessing. A further task decomposition is used to balance load among processors and to in­ crease the speed-up and efficiency. For learn­ ing from very large datasets, we present a re­ grouping of the available processors such that slow data access through file can be replaced by fast memory access. Our implementation in a parallel computer demonstrates the ef­ fectiveness of the algorithm.",
