      "text" : "In recent years, distributed estimation, learning and prediction has attracted a considerable attention in wide variety of disciplines with applications ranging from sensor networks to social and economic networks [1–6]. In this broad class of problems, agents aim to learn the true value of a parameter often called the underlying state of the world. The state could represent a product, an opinion, a vote, or a quantity of interest in a sensor network. Each agent observes a private signal about the underlying state at each time period, and communicates with her neighbors to augment her imperfect observations. Despite the wealth of research in this area when the underlying state is fixed (see e.g. [1–3, 7]), often the state is subject to some change over time(e.g. the price of stocks) [8–11]. Therefore, it is more realistic to study models which allow the parameter of interest to vary. In the non-distributed context, such models have been studied in the classical literature on time-series prediction, and, more recently, in the literature on online learning under relaxed assumptions about the nature of sequences [12]. In this paper we aim to study the sequential prediction problem in the context of a social network and noisy feedback to agents.\nWe consider a stochastic optimization framework to describe an online social learning problem when the underlying state of the world varies over time. Our motivation for the current study is the results of [8] and [9] where authors propose a social learning scheme in which the underlying state follows a simple random walk. However, unlike [8] and [9], we assume a geometric random walk evolution with an associated rate of change. This enables us to investigate the interplay of social learning, network structure, and the rate of state change, especially in the interesting case that the rate is\ngreater than unity. We then pose the social learning as an optimization problem in which individuals aim to suffer the smallest possible loss as they observe the stream of signals. Of particular relevance to this work is the work of Duchi et al. in [13] where the authors develop a distributed method based on dual averaging of sub-gradients to converge to the optimal solution. In this paper, we restrict our attention to quadratic loss functions regularized by a quadratic proximal function, but there is no fixed optimal solution as the underlying state is dynamic. In this direction, the key observation is the decomposition of the global loss function into local loss functions. We consider two decompositions for the global objective, each of which gives rise to a single-consensus-step belief update mechanism. The first method incorporates the averaged prior beliefs among neighbors with the new private observation, while the second one takes into account the observations in the neighborhood as well. In both scenarios, we establish that the estimates are eventually unbiased, and we characterize an explicit expression for the mean-square deviation(MSD) of the beliefs from the truth, per individual. Interestingly, this quantity relies on the whole spectrum of the communication matrix which exhibits the formidable role of the network structure in the asymptotic learning. We observe that the estimators outperform the upper bound provided for MSD in the previous work [8]. Furthermore, only one of the two proposed estimators can compete with the centralized optimal Kalman Filter [14] in certain circumstances. This fact underscores the dependence of optimality on decomposition of the global loss function. We further highlight the influence of connectivity on learning by quantifying the ratio of MSD for a complete versus a disconnected network. We see that this ratio is always less than unity and it can get arbitrarily close to zero under some constraints.\nOur next contribution is to provide an upper bound for regret of the proposed methods, defined as an average of errors in estimating the parameter up to a given time minus the long-run expected loss due to noise and dynamics alone. This finite-time regret analysis is based on the recently developed concentration inequalities for matrices and it complements the asymptotic statements about the behavior of MSD.\nFinally, we examine the trade-off between the network sparsity and learning quality in a microscopic level. Under mild technical constraints, we see that losing each connection has detrimental effect on learning as it monotonically increases the MSD. On the other hand, capturing agents communications with a graph, we introduce the notion of optimal edge as the edge whose addition has the most effect on learning in the sense of MSD reduction. We prove that such a friendship is likely to occur between a pair of individuals with high self-reliance that have the least common neighbors."

The agents indexed by i ∈ V seek the underlying state of the world, xt ∈ R, which varies over time and evolves according to\nxt+1 = axt + rt, (1)\nwhere rt is a zero mean innovation, which is independent over time with finite variance E[r2t ] = σ 2 r , and a ∈ R is the expected rate of change of the state of the world, assumed to be available to all agents, and could potentially be greater than unity. We assume the initial state x0 is a finite random variable drawn independently by the nature. At time period t, each agent i receives a private signal yi,t ∈ R, which is a noisy version of xt, and can be described by the linear equation\nyi,t = xt + wi,t, (2)\nwhere wi,t is a zero mean observation noise with finite variance E[w2i,t] = σ 2 w, and it is assumed to be independent over time and agents, and uncorrelated to the innovation noise. Each agent i forms an estimate or a belief about the true value of xt at time t conforming to an update mechanism that will be discussed later. Much of the difficulty of this problem stems from the hardness of tracking a dynamic state with noisy observations, especially when |a| > 1, and communication mitigates the difficulty by virtue of reducing the effective noise."

We analyze both class of estimators noting that one might expect (5) to perform better than (4) due to more information availability.\nNote that the choice of constant step size provides an insight on the interplay of persistent innovation and learning abilities of the network. We remark that agents can easily learn the fixed rate of change a by taking ratios of observations, and we assume that this has been already performed by the agents in the past. The case of a changing a is beyond the scope of the present paper. We also point out that the real-valued (rather than vector-valued) nature of the state is a simplification that forms a clean playground for the study of the effects of social learning, effects of friendships, and other properties of the problem."

      "text" : "In this section, we study the behavior of estimators (4) and (5) in the mean and mean-square sense, and we provide the regret analysis.\nIn the following proposition, we establish a tight bound for a, under which agents can achieve asymptotically unbiased estimates using proper signal weight. Proposition 3 (Unbiased Estimates). Given the network G with corresponding communication matrix P satisfying Assumption 1, the rate of change of the social network in (4) and (5) must respect the constraint\n|a| < 2 1− λN (P ) ,\nto allow agents to form asymptotically unbiased estimates of the underlying state.\nProposition 3 determines the trade-off between the rate of change and the network structure. In other words, changing less than the rate given in the statement of the proposition, individuals can always track xt with bounded variance by selecting an appropriate signal weight. However, the proposition does not make any statement on the learning quality. To capture that, we define the steady state Mean Square Deviation(MSD) of the network from the truth as follows. Definition 4 ((Steady State-)Mean Square Deviation). Given the network G with a rate of change which allows unbiased estimation, the steady state of the error processes in (7) is defined as follows\nΣ̂ , lim t→∞ E[ξ̂tξ̂ T t ] and Σ̃ , limt→∞ E[ξ̃tξ̃ T t ].\nHence, the (Steady State-)Mean Square Deviation of the network is the deviation from the truth in the mean-square sense, per individual, and it is defined as\nˆMSD , 1\nN Tr(Σ̂) and ˜MSD ,\n1\nN Tr(Σ̃).\nTheorem 5 (MSD). Given the error processes (7) with ρ(Q) < 1, the steady state MSD for (4) and (5) is a function of the communication matrix P , and the signal weight α as follows\nˆMSD(P, α) = RMSD(α) + ŴMSD(P, α) ˜MSD(P, α) = RMSD(α) + W̃MSD(P, α), (10)\nwhere\nRMSD(α) , σ2r\n1− a2(1− α)2 , (11)\nand\nŴMSD(P, α) , 1\nN\nN ∑\ni=1\na2α2σ2w\n1− a2(λi(P )− α)2 and W̃MSD(P, α) ,\n1\nN\nN ∑\ni=1\na2α2σ2wλ 2 i (P )\n1− a2(λi(P )− α)2 . (12)\nTheorem 5 shows that the steady state MSD is governed by all eigenvalues of P contributing to WMSD pertaining to the observation noise, while RMSD is the penalty incurred due to the innovation noise. Moreover, (5) outperforms (4) due to richer information diffusion, which stresses the importance of global loss function decomposition.\nOne might advance a conjecture that a complete network, where all individuals can communicate with each other, achieves a lower steady state MSD in the learning process since it provides the most information diffusion among other networks. This intuitive idea is discussed in the following corollary beside a few examples.\nCorollary 6. Denoting the complete, star, and cycle graphs on N vertices by KN , SN , and CN , respectively, and denoting their corresponding Laplacians by LKN , LSN , and LCN , under conditions of Theorem 5,\n(a) For P = I − 1−αN LKN , we have\nlim N→∞\nˆMSDKN = RMSD(α) + a 2α2σ2w. (13)\n(b) For P = I − 1−αN LSN , we have\nlim N→∞\nˆMSDSN = RMSD(α) + a2α2σ2w\n1− a2(1− α)2 . (14)\n(c) For P = I − βLCN , where β must preserve unbiasedness, we have\nlim N→∞\nˆMSDCN = RMSD(α) + ∫ 2π\n0\na2α2σ2w 1− a2(1− β(2− 2 cos(τ)) − α)2 dτ 2π . (15)\n(d) For P = I − 1NLKN , we have\nlim N→∞\n˜MSDKN = RMSD(α). (16)\nProof. Noting that the spectrum of LKN , LSN and LCN are, respectively [15], {λN = 0, λN−1 = N, ..., λ1 = N}, {λN = 0, λN−1 = 1, ..., λ2 = 1, λ1 = N}, and {λi = 2 − 2 cos(2πiN )}N−1i=0 , substituting each case in (10), and taking the limit over N , the proof follows immediately.\nTo study the effect of communication let us consider the estimator (4). Under purview of Theorem 5 and Corollary 6, the ratio of the steady state MSD for a complete network (13) versus a fully disconnected network(P = IN ) can be computed as\nlim N→∞ ˆMSDKN ˆMSDdisconnected = σ2r + a 2α2σ2w(1− a2(1− α)2) σ2r + a 2α2σ2w ≈ 1− a2(1− α)2,\nfor σ2r ≪ σ2w . The ratio above can get arbitrary close to zero which, indeed, highlights the influence of communication on the learning quality.\nWe now consider Kalman Filter(KF) [14] as the optimal centralized counterpart of (5). It is wellknown that the steady state KF satisfies a Riccati equation, and when the parameter of interest is scalar, the Riccati equation simplifies to a quadratic with the positive root\nΣKF = a2σ2w − σ2w +Nσ2r +\n√\n(a2σ2w − σ2w +Nσ2r)2 + 4Nσ2wσ2r 2N .\nTherefore, comparing with the complete graph (16), we have\nlim N→∞\nΣKF = σ 2 r ≤ σ2r 1− a2(1− α)2 ,\nand the upper bound can be made tight by choosing α = 1 for |a| < 1|λN (P )−1| . If |a| ≥ 1 |λN (P )−1| we should choose an α < 1 to preserve unbiasedness as well.\nOn the other hand, to evaluate the performance of estimator (4), we consider the upper bound\nMSDBound = σ2r + α 2σ2w α , (17)\nderived in [8], for a = 1 via a distributed estimation scheme. For simplicity, we assume σ2w = σ 2 r = σ2, and let β in (15) be any diminishing function of N . Optimizing (13), (14), (15), and (17) over α, we obtain\nlim N→∞ ˆMSDKN ≈ 1.55σ2 < lim N→∞ ˆMSDSN = lim N→∞ ˆMSDCN ≈ 1.62σ2 < MSDBound = 2σ2,\nwhich suggests a noticeable improvement in learning even in the star and cycle networks where the number of individuals and connections are in the same order.\nRegret Analysis\nWe now turn to finite-time regret analysis of our methods. The average loss of all agents in predicting the state, up until time T , is\n1\nT\nT∑\nt=1\n1\nN\nN∑\ni=1\n(x̂i,t − xt)2 = 1\nT\nT∑\nt=1\n1\nN Tr(ξ̂tξ̂Tt ) .\nAs motivated earlier, it is not possible, in general, to drive this average loss to zero, and we need to subtract off the limit. We thus define regret as\nRT , 1\nT\nT∑\nt=1\n1\nN Tr(ξ̂tξ̂Tt )−\n1\nT\nT∑\nt=1\n1\nN Tr(Σ̂) =\n1\nN Tr\n(\n1\nT\nT∑\nt=1\nξ̂tξ̂ T t − Σ̂ ) ,\nwhere Σ̂ is from Definition 4. We then have for the spectral norm ‖ · ‖ that\nRT ≤ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ 1 T T∑\nt=1\nξtξ T t − Σ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ ∥ , (18)\nwhere we dropped the distinguishing notation between the two estimators since the analysis works for both of them. We, first, state a technical lemma from [16] that we invoke later for bounding the quantity RT . For simplicity, we assume that magnitudes of both innovation and observation noise are bounded.\nLemma 7. Let {st}Tt=1 be an independent family of vector valued random variables, and let H be a function that maps T variables to a self-adjoint matrix of dimension N . Consider a sequence {At}Tt=1 of fixed self-adjoint matrices that satisfy\n( H(ω1, ..., ωt, ..., ωT )−H(ω1, ..., ω′t, ..., ωT ) )2 A2t ,\nwhere ωi and ω′i range over all possible values of si for each index i. Letting Var = ‖ ∑T t=1 A 2 t‖, for all c ≥ 0, we have\nP { ∥ ∥H(s1, ..., sT )− E[H(s1, ..., sT )] ∥ ∥ ≥ c } ≤ Ne−c2/8Var.\nTheorem 8. Under conditions of Theorem 5 together with boundedness of noise maxt≤T ‖st‖ ≤ s for some s > 0, the regret function defined in (18) satisfies\nRT ≤ 1\nT ( ‖ξ0‖2 1− ρ2(Q) ) + 1 T ( 2s‖ξ0‖\n( 1− ρ(Q) )2\n)\n+ 1\nT\n( s2\n( 1− ρ2(Q) )2\n)\n+ 1√ T\n8s2 √\n2 log Nδ\n(1 − ρ(Q))2 ,\n(19)\nwith probability at least 1− δ.\nWe mention that results that are similar in spirit have been studied for general unbounded stationary ergodic time series in [17–19] by employing techniques from the online learning literature. On the other hand, our problem has the network structure and the specific evolution of the hidden state, not present in the above works."

      "heading" : "4 The Impact of New Friendships on Social Learning",
      "text" : "In the social learning model we proposed, agents are cooperative and they aim to accomplish a global objective. In this direction, the network structure contributes substantially to the learning process. In this section, we restrict our attention to estimator (5), and characterize the intuitive idea that making(losing) friendships can influence the quality of learning in the sense of decreasing(increasing) the steady state MSD of the network.\nTo commence, letting ei denote the i-th unit vector in the standard basis of RN , we exploit the negative semi-definite, edge function matrix\n∆P (i, j) , −(ei − ej)(ei − ej)T, (20) for edge addition(removal) to(from) the graph. Essentially, if there is no connection between agents i and j,\nPǫ , P + ǫ∆P (i, j), (21)\nfor ǫ < min{pii, pjj}, corresponds to a new communication matrix adding the edge {i, j} with a weight ǫ to the network G, and subtracting ǫ from self-reliance of agents i and j. Proposition 9. Let G− be the network resulted by removing the bidirectional edge {i, j} with the weight ǫ from the network G, so P−ǫ and P denote the communication matrices associated to G− and G, respectively. Given Assumption 1, for a fixed signal weight α the following relationship holds\n˜MSD(P, α) ≤ ˜MSD(P−ǫ, α), (22) as long as P is positive semi-definite, and |a| < 1|α| .\nUnder a mild technical assumption, Proposition 9 suggests that losing connections monotonically increases the MSD, and individuals tend to maintain their friendships to obtain a lower MSD as a global objective. However, this does not elaborate on the existence of individuals with whom losing or making connections could have an immense impact on learning. We bring this concept to light in the following proposition with finding a so-called optimal edge which provides the most MSD reduction, in case it is added to the network graph.\nProposition 10. Given Assumption 1, a positive semi-definite P , and |a| < 1|α| , to find the optimal edge with a pre-assigned weight ǫ ≪ 1 to add to the network G, we need to solve the following optimization problem\nmin {i,j}/∈E\nN∑\nk=1\n(\nhk(i, j) , zk(i, j)\n( 2(1− α2a2)λk(P ) + 2a2αλ2k(P ) )\n( 1− a2(λk(P )− α)2 )2\n)\n, (23)\nwhere\nzk(i, j) , (v T k∆P (i, j)vk)ǫ, (24)\nand {vk}Nk=1 are the right eigenvectors of P . In addition, letting ζmax = maxk>1 |λk(P )− α|,\nmin {i,j}/∈E\nN∑\nk=1\nhk(i, j) ≥ min {i,j}/∈E\n−2ǫ ( (1− α2a2)(pii + pjj) + a2α([P 2]ii + [P 2]jj − 2[P 2]ij) )\n( 1− a2ζ2max\n)2 .\n(25)\nProof. Representing the first order approximation of λk(Pǫ) using definition of zk(i, j) in (24), we have λk(Pǫ) ≈ λk(P ) + zk(i, j) for ǫ ≪ 1. Based on Theorem 5, we now derive\n˜MSD(Pǫ, α)− ˜MSD(P, α) ∝ N ∑\nk=1\n( λk(Pǫ)− λk(P ) )( (1− α2a2)(λk(Pǫ) + λk(P )) + 2a 2αλk(P )λk(Pǫ) )\n( 1− a2(λk(P )− α)2 )( 1− a2(λk(Pǫ)− α)2 )\n≈\nN ∑\nk=1\nzk(i, j) ( 2(1− α2a2)λk(P ) + 2a 2αλ2k(P ) + (1− α 2a2 + 2a2αλk(P ))zk(i, j) )\n( 1− a2(λk(P )− α)2 )( 1− a2(λk(P )− α+ zk(i, j))2 )\n=\nN ∑\nk=1\nzk(i, j) ( 2(1− α2a2)λk(P ) + 2a 2αλ2k(P ) )\n( 1− a2(λk(P )− α)2 )\n2 +O(ǫ2),\nnoting that zk(i, j) is O(ǫ) from the definition (24). Minimizing ˜MSD(Pǫ, α) − ˜MSD(P, α) is, hence, equivalent to optimization (23) when ǫ ≪ 1. Taking into account that P is positive semidefinite, zk(i, j) ≤ 0 for k ≥ 2, and v1 = 1N/ √ N which implies z1(i, j) = 0, we proceed to the lower bound proof using the definition of hk(i, j) and ζmax in the statement of the proposition, as follows\nN∑\nk=1\nhk(i, j) =\nN∑\nk=2\nzk(i, j) ( 2(1− α2a2)λk(P ) + 2a2αλ2k(P ) )\n( 1− a2(λk(P )− α)2 )2\n≥ 1( 1− a2ζ2max )2\nN∑\nk=2\nzk(i, j) ( 2(1− α2a2)λk(P ) + 2a2αλ2k(P ) ) .\nSubstituting zk(i, j) from (24) to above, we have\nN∑\nk=1\nhk(i, j) ≥ 2ǫ\n( 1− a2ζ2max )2\n( N∑\nk=1\n( vTk∆P (i, j)vk )( (1− α2a2)λk(P ) + a2αλ2k(P )\n) )\n= 2ǫ\n( 1− a2ζ2max\n)2 Tr\n(\n∆P (i, j)\nN∑\nk=1\n( (1 − α2a2)λk(P ) + a2αλ2k(P ) ) vkv T k\n)\n= 2ǫ\n( 1− a2ζ2max\n)2 Tr\n(\n∆P (i, j) ( (1− α2a2)P + a2αP 2\n) )\n.\nUsing the facts that Tr(∆P (i, j)P ) = −pii−pjj+2pij and Tr(∆P (i, j)P 2) = −[P 2]ii− [P 2]jj + 2[P 2]ij according to definition of ∆P (i, j) in (20), and pij = 0 since we are adding a non-existent edge {i, j}, the lower bound (25) is derived.\nBeside posing the optimal edge problem as an optimization, Proposition 10 also provides an upper bound for the best improvement that making a friendship brings to the network. In view of (25), forming a connection between two agents with more self-reliance and less common neighbors, minimizes the lower bound, which offers the most maneuver for MSD reduction."

      "text" : "We studied a distributed online learning problem over a social network. The goal of agents is to estimate the underlying state of the world which follows a geometric random walk. Each individual receives a noisy signal about the underlying state at each time period, so she communicates with her neighbors to recover the true state. We viewed the problem with an optimization lens where agents want to minimize a global loss function in a collaborative manner. To estimate the true state, we proposed two methodologies derived from a different decomposition of the global objective. Given the structure of the network, we provided a tight upper bound on the rate of change of the parameter which allows agents to follow the state with a bounded variance. Moreover, we computed the averaged, steady state, mean-square deviation of the estimates from the true state. The key observation was optimality of one of the estimators indicating the dependence of learning quality on the decomposition. Furthermore, defining the regret as the average of errors in the process of learning during a finite time T , we demonstrated that the regret function of the proposed algorithms decays with a rate O(1/ √ T ). Finally, under mild technical assumptions, we characterized the influence of network pattern on learning by observing that each connection brings a monotonic decrease in the MSD."
