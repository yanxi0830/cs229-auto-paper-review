      "text" : "In many tasks, a single object can be described using information from different channels (or views). For example, a 3-D object can be described using pictures from different angles; a website can be described using the words it contains, and the hyperlinks it contains; an image can be described using different features, such as SIFT feature, and HOG feature; in daily life, a person can be characterized using age, height, weight and so on. These data all comes from different aspects and channels. Multi-view problems aim to improve existing single view model by learning a model utilizing data collected from multiple channels (Rüping and Scheffer 2005) (de Sa 2005) (Zhou and Burges 2007).\nLow-rank regression model has been proved to be an effective learning mechanism by exploring the low-rank structure of real life data (Xiang et al. 2012) (Evgeniou and Pontil 2007) (Cai et al. 2013). Existing regression models only work on single view data. To be specific, linear regression finds a linear model with respect to the single view feature data to fit target class data (Seber and Lee 2012). Let matrix B ∈ <p×c be the parameter of the linear model. Linear regression solves a problem of minB ||Y − XTB||2F , where Copyright c© 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.\nX = [x1,x2, ...,xn] ∈ <p×n is the single view feature data matrix and Y ∈ <n×c is the target class indicator matrix. Ridge regression can achieve better results by adding a Frobenius norm based regularization on linear regression loss objective (Hoerl and Kennard 1970) (Marquaridt 1970). Ridge regression solves the problem minB ||Y −XTB||2F + λ||B||2F , where λ is the regularization weight parameter. Cai (Cai et al. 2013) showed that whenB is low-rank, regression is equivalent to linear discriminant analysis based regressions. However, all these work only works for single-view problems.\nIn this paper, we propose a multi-view low-rank regression model by imposing low-rank constraints on regression model. This model can be solved using closed-form solution directly. In linear regression, low rank parameter matrix Bν is dependent on view ν. Through theoretical analysis, we show that multi-view low-rank regression model is equivalent to do regression in the subspace of each view. In other words, let Bν = AνB, and it is equivalent to find the shared regression parameter matrix B under the subspace transformation Aν with respect to view ν. Extensive experiments performed on 4 multi-view datasets show that the proposed model outperforms single-view regression model and reveals that low-rank structure can improve the classification result of a full-rank model.\nNotations. In this paper, matrices are written in uppercase letters, such as X, Y . Vectors are written in bold lower case letters, such as x, y. Tr(X) means the trace operation for matrix X ."

We will compare the performance of multi-view low-rank regression model with a full-rank model in experiment section.\nIn the case of multi-view full-rank regression, rank s = c, there is no constraint on Bν in Eq.(1) and we will not use Eq.(2).

Existing multi-view approaches mainly are inspired from spectral clustering and subspace learning. de Sa (de Sa 2005) developed a spectral clustering algorithm for only two views by creating a bipartite graph based on the “minimizing-disagreement” idea. Zhou (Zhou and Burges 2007) developed a multi-view spectral clustering model via generalizing the single view normalized cut to the multi-view case. They try to find a cut which is close to be optimal on each single-view graph by exploiting a mixture of Markov chains associated with graphs of different views. Kumar (Kumar and Daumé 2011) proposed a co-training flavour spectral clustering algorithm and use spectral embedding from one view to constrain the similarity graph used for the other view. Kumar (Kumar, Rai,\nand Daume 2011) used the philosophy of co-regularization, which has been used in the past for semi-supervised learning problems, to make the clusterings in different views agree with each other.\nMulti-view learning models from the point of view of subspace learning mainly try to find a subspace for each view and then develop a learning model across views in their subspaces. Canonical-Correlation Analysis (CCA) (Hotelling 1936) was first used to study the correlation of two views in their respective subspaces. Hardoon (Hardoon, Szedmak, and Shawe-Taylor 2004) (Hardoon and Shawe-Taylor 2009) designed an Kernel Canonical-Correlation Analysis to extract patterns from two views. Chaudhuri (Chaudhuri et al. 2009) proposed a CCA-based subspace multi-view learning approach to find a subspace such that the objects of different classes are well-separated and within-class distance is minimized. Greene (Greene and Cunningham 2009) developed a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) (Lee and Seung 1999) approach to effectively identify common patterns and reconcile between-view disagreements by combining data from multiple views.\nThe proposed multi-view low-rank regression model should be categorized into the class of subspace learning multi-view. The important contribution of this paper is that we developed low-rank regression model to study multiview problems. Surprisingly, there exists closed form solution to multi-view low-rank regression model."

      "heading" : "Model learning",
      "text" : "Through model learning, we systematically explore the best settings of regression bias, regularization weight parameter λν and how to do classification using multi-view regression.\nEffect of regression bias To validate that adding bias to regression will reduce fitting residual, Figure 1 compares the residual of class indicator matrix Y using two fνk values: (1). using Eq.(5), denoted by “With bias” line (red circle line), (2)fνk = 0, denoted by “No bias” line (blue dot line). Residual r is defined as\nr = v∑\nν=1\n‖Y −XTν AνB‖2F . (18)\nr is the summation of label matrix residuals over all views. Theoretically, adding biasF ν could produce a more accurate fitting model, which means a model has smaller residual r. We examine this property by using rank s = 1, ..., c− 1. As we can see from Figure 1, for all the 4 datasets, the residual using bias is always smaller than the residual without bias using all different ranks. In Figure 1a, 1c, and 1d, the residual with bias (“With bias” line) is smaller than the residual without bias (“No bias” line). For MSRC data, the residual with bias is about 3 less than the residual without bias; for Caltech data, Figure 1b shows that the residual with bias is less than residual without bias; for Cornell data, the residual with bias is about 2 less on all rank numbers; for Cora data, the residual with bias is about 2 less on all rank numbers. In all, our results show that multi-view regression using bias could produce more accurate fitting models with less model residuals. In the following experiments, the default setting of all experiments is using bias.\nClassification using regression In multi-view regression, there are different ways to do classification. For single-view low-rank regression (Cai et al. 2013),\nmin A,B ‖Y −XTAB‖2F + λ‖AB‖2F , (19)\nwhere A ∈ <p×s, B ∈ <s×c and AB is the low-rank regression parameter matrix, the following decision function is applied to classify a testing point x ∈ <p×1 into one of the c classes,\narg max 1≤j≤c (y)j , (20)\nwhere vector y = xTAB ∈ <1×c, class j corresponds to the index of the maximum value in vector y.\nIn multi-view case, we predict a class using each view and then use majority voting to decide the final class. For example, for view ν, we use the following decision function to classify a testing point xν ∈ <p×1 into one of the c classes,\narg max 1≤j≤c (yν)j , (21)\nwhere vector yν = xTν AνB ∈ <1×c, xν is the data vector of view ν, ν = 1, 2, ..., v. Thus we predict a class label using every view. We have v predicted classes and apply majority voting on v results. The class with most votes is assigned to this data point. If the top two classes get same number of votes, we assign them with 0.5 probability, etc.. We call this majority voting as “Voting” in Figure 2.\nIn this regression prediction problem, however, we can theoretically derive another voting method denoted as “Sum”. Since our starting point is Eqs.(1-3), after obtaining Aν and B through training, for a testing point x, we learn y that minimizes the difference between label vector y and projected data of each views xTν AνB:\nmin y\nv∑\nν=1\n‖y − xTν AνB‖2F . (22)\nIt is obvious that the solution of Eq.(22) is given as\ny = ( v∑\nν=1\nxTAνB)/v. (23)\nOnce y is computed, we use Eq.(20) to obtain the class. The classification accuracy using the two methods, Sum and Voting, is shown in Figure 2. As we can see from the results, for data Caltech, Cornell and Cora, Sum method has better results than Voting method obviously. Overall, the Sum voting method is better for regression based classification approach for multi-view regression. In the following experiments, the default setting of every experiment is using Sum method.\nRegularization weight parameter λν Regularization weight parameter λν affects the regression model and classification accuracy directly. Many researchers tune this regularization weight parameter exponentially within a specific domain, such as from 10−5 to 105. It is very time consuming and misleading. In fact, regularization weight parameter λν has direct contribution to the eigenvalues of (XνXTν +λνI), as shown in Eq.(7). A large λν could change the distribution of eigenvalues of (XνXTν +λνI) significantly. While a small λν preserves the original eigenvalues distribution ofXνXTν . Thus, we constrain λν to be the following 3 cases:\n1. The summation for all the eigenvalues of XνXTν . This will change the distribution of eigenvalues of (XνXTν + λνI) more significantly. Since Xν is normalized rowwisely, λν = Tr(XνXTν ) = pν , where pν is dimension of view ν. In Figure 3, result using this method is denoted as “p”.\n2. The average of all the eigenvalues of XνXTν . So λν = Tr(XνXTν )/pν = 1, where pν is dimension of view ν. In Figure 3, result using this method is denoted as “1”.\n3. The 90%th largest eigenvalue. For example, ifXνXTν has 200 non-zero eigenvalues sorted from large to small, we let λν be the 90% × 200 = 180th eigenvalue. This will change the distribution of eigenvalues of (XνXTν + λνI) slightly and still preserve the original eigenvalue distribution of XνXTν . In Figure 3, result using this method is denoted as “p90”.\nFigure 3a shows that, for MSRC data, λν = 1 and “p90” performs better than using the summation of all eigenvalues (λν = pν). In Figure 3b, λν = 1 can beat “p90” and λν = pν . In Figure 3c, λν = 1 also has the best accuracy for rank s = 2, 3, 4. For data Cora, using different λν does not affect accuracy too much. Over all, we choose λν as the average of all eigenvalues of XνXTν , which is λν = 1. In the following experiments, the default setting of every experiment is using λν = 1.\nComparison with single view Multi-view regression uses data or information from multiple channels, such as different image features, both webpage citations view and contents view. Generally, we expect that multi-view regression can produce better results by exploiting information from multiple views. In this part, we compare multi-view low-rank regression with single-view low-rank regression (see (Cai et al. 2013)). Figure 4 shows that multi-view low-rank regression produces better classification accuracy than single-view regression for different ranks (rank s is from 1 to c − 1). “MV” denotes multiview accuracy, “V1”, “V2”, ..., denote the accuracy using\ndifferent single view. For example, Figure 4a shows that, for data MSRC, multi-view regression has much higher accuracy than all single-view low-rank regression when rank s = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Figure 4b shows that, when rank s > 4, multi-view regression has much higher accuracy than all the four single views. In Figure 4c, view “V1” has very good accuracy, but multi-view regression has better results than view “V1” when s = 1, 3. In Figure 4d, multi-view outperforms single-view when s = 4, 5, 6.\nComparison of ridge regression and linear regression Linear regression (when λν = 0) and ridge regression (when λν 6= 0) are closely related. Previous research (Hoerl and Kennard 1970) (Cai et al. 2013) shows that ridge regression will have better performance than linear regression. However, all existing work is based on single view. Does multiview ridge regression produce better results than multiview linear regression? We will examine the performance of multi-view linear regression and ridge regression on the 4 multi-view data with respect to different ranks. We can get linear regression by simply setting λν = 0 in our existing multi-view ridge regression model. Figure 5 shows that multi-view low-rank ridge regression (“Ridge” line in the figure) produces better classification accuracy than multiview low-rank linear regression (when λν = 0, “Linear” line in the figure) in datasets MSRC, Caltech and Cornell. For dataset Cora, ridge regression get slightly better results than linear regression when rank s = 3, 4, 5, 6."

    "abstractText" : "Real life data often includes information from different channels. For example, in computer vision, we can describe an image using different image features, such as pixel intensity, color, HOG, GIST feature, SIFT features, etc.. These different aspects of the same objects are often called multi-view (or multi-modal) data. Lowrank regression model has been proved to be an effective learning mechanism by exploring the low-rank structure of real life data. But previous low-rank regression model only works on single view data. In this paper, we propose a multi-view low-rank regression model by imposing low-rank constraints on multi-view regression model. Most importantly, we provide a closed-form solution to the multi-view low-rank regression model. Extensive experiments on 4 multi-view datasets show that the multi-view low-rank regression model outperforms single-view regression model and reveals that multiview low-rank structure is very helpful. Introduction In many tasks, a single object can be described using information from different channels (or views). For example, a 3-D object can be described using pictures from different angles; a website can be described using the words it contains, and the hyperlinks it contains; an image can be described using different features, such as SIFT feature, and HOG feature; in daily life, a person can be characterized using age, height, weight and so on. These data all comes from different aspects and channels. Multi-view problems aim to improve existing single view model by learning a model utilizing data collected from multiple channels (Rüping and Scheffer 2005) (de Sa 2005) (Zhou and Burges 2007). Low-rank regression model has been proved to be an effective learning mechanism by exploring the low-rank structure of real life data (Xiang et al. 2012) (Evgeniou and Pontil 2007) (Cai et al. 2013). Existing regression models only work on single view data. To be specific, linear regression finds a linear model with respect to the single view feature data to fit target class data (Seber and Lee 2012). Let matrix B ∈ <p×c be the parameter of the linear model. Linear regression solves a problem of minB ||Y − XB||F , where Copyright c © 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved. X = [x1,x2, ...,xn] ∈ <p×n is the single view feature data matrix and Y ∈ <n×c is the target class indicator matrix. Ridge regression can achieve better results by adding a Frobenius norm based regularization on linear regression loss objective (Hoerl and Kennard 1970) (Marquaridt 1970). Ridge regression solves the problem minB ||Y −XB||F + λ||B||F , where λ is the regularization weight parameter. Cai (Cai et al. 2013) showed that whenB is low-rank, regression is equivalent to linear discriminant analysis based regressions. However, all these work only works for single-view problems. In this paper, we propose a multi-view low-rank regression model by imposing low-rank constraints on regression model. This model can be solved using closed-form solution directly. In linear regression, low rank parameter matrix B is dependent on view ν. Through theoretical analysis, we show that multi-view low-rank regression model is equivalent to do regression in the subspace of each view. In other words, let B = AνB, and it is equivalent to find the shared regression parameter matrix B under the subspace transformation Aν with respect to view ν. Extensive experiments performed on 4 multi-view datasets show that the proposed model outperforms single-view regression model and reveals that low-rank structure can improve the classification result of a full-rank model. Notations. In this paper, matrices are written in uppercase letters, such as X, Y . Vectors are written in bold lower case letters, such as x, y. Tr(X) means the trace operation for matrix X . Multi-view Low Rank Regression Assume that there are v views and c classes, pν is the dimension of view ν, nj is the sample size of the j-th class, and n is the total sample size. Let Xν = [x1 , ...,x ν n] ∈ <pν×n be the data matrix of view ν, ν = 1, 2, ..., v, and Y = [y1, ...,yc] ∈ <n×c is the normalized class indicator matrix, i.e. Yij = 1/ √ nj if the i-th data point belongs to the j-th class and Yij = 0 otherwise. We try to minimize the residual of low rank regression model in each class and in each view.
