      "text" : "We study the problem faced by a decision-maker whose goal is to estimate a number of regression problems equally well (i.e., with a small prediction error for each of them), and has to adaptively allocate a limited budget of samples to the problems in order to gather information and improve its estimates. Two aspects of the problem formulation are key and drive the algorithm design: 1) The observations Y collected from each regression problem depend on side information (i.e., contexts X ∈ Rd) and we model the relationship between X and Y in each problem i as a linear function with unknown parameters βi ∈ Rd, and 2) The “hardness” of learning each parameter βi is unknown in advance and may vary across the problems. In particular, we\n1Stanford University, Stanford, CA, USA. 2DeepMind, Mountain View, CA, USA (The work was done when the author was with Adobe Research). 3Inria Lille, France.

Imagine a drug company that has developed several treatments for a particular form of disease. Now it is interested in having an accurate estimate of the performance of each of these treatments for a specific population of patients (e.g., at a particular geographical location). Given the budget allocated to this experiment, a number of patients n can participate in the clinical trial. Volunteered patients arrive sequentially over time and they are represented by a contextX ∈ Rd summarizing their profile. We model the health status of patientX after being assigned to treatment i by scalar Yi ∈ R, which depends on the specific drug through a linear function with parameter βi (i.e., Yi ≈ XTβi). The goal is to assign each incoming patient to a treatment in such a way that at the end of the trial, we have an accurate estimate for all βi’s. This will allow us to reliably predict the expected health status of each new patientX for any treatment i. Since the parameters βi and the noise levels are initially unknown, achieving this goal requires an adaptive allocation strategy for the n patients. Note that while n may be relatively small, as the ethical and financial costs of treating a patient are high, the distribution of the contexts X (e.g., the biomarkers of cancer patients) can be precisely estimated in advance.\nThis setting is clearly related to the problem of pure exploration and active learning in multi-armed bandits (Antos et al., 2008), where the learner wants to estimate the mean of a finite set of arms by allocating a finite budget of n pulls. Antos et al. (2008) first introduced this setting where the objective is to minimize the largest mean square error (MSE) in estimating the value of each arm. While the optimal solution is trivially to allocate the pulls proportionally to the variance of the arms, when the variances are unknown an exploration-exploitation dilemma arises, where variance and value of the arms must be estimated at the same time in order to allocate pulls where they are more needed (i.e., arms with high variance). Antos et al. (2008) proposed a forcing algorithm where all arms are pulled at least √ n times before allocating pulls proportionally to the estimated variances. They derived bounds on the regret, measuring the difference between the MSEs of the learnar X iv :1\n70 3.\n00 57\n9v 2\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n2 9\nJu l 2\n01 7\ning algorithm and an optimal allocation showing that the regret decreases as O(n−3/2). A similar result is obtained by Carpentier et al. (2011) that proposed two algorithms that use upper confidence bounds on the variance to estimate the MSE of each arm and select the arm with the larger MSE at each step. When the arms are embedded in Rd and their mean is a linear combination with an unknown parameter, then the problem becomes an optimal experimental design problem (Pukelsheim, 2006), where the objective is to estimate the linear parameter and minimize the prediction error over all arms (see e.g., Wiens & Li 2014; Sabato & Munos 2014). In this paper, we consider an orthogonal extension to the original problem where a finite number of linear regression problems is available (i.e., the arms) and random contexts are observed at each time step. Similarly to the setting of Antos et al. (2008), we assume each problem is characterized by a noise with different variance and the objective is to return regularized least-squares (RLS) estimates with small prediction error (i.e., MSE). While we leverage on the solution proposed by Carpentier et al. (2011) to deal with the unknown variances, in our setting the presence of random contexts make the estimation problem considerably more difficult. In fact, the MSE in one specific regression problem is not only determined by the variance of the noise and the number of samples used to compute the RLS estimate, but also by the contexts observed over time.\nContributions. We propose TRACE-UCB, an algorithm that simultaneously learns the “hardness” of each problem, allocates observations proportionally to these estimates, and balances contexts across problems. We derive performance bounds for TRACE-UCB in expectation and highprobability, and compare the algorithm with several baselines. TRACE-UCB performs remarkably well in scenarios where the dimension of the contexts or the number of instances is large compared to the total budget, motivating the study of the high-dimensional setting, whose analysis and performance bounds are reported in App. F of Riquelme et al. (2017a). Finally, we provide simulations with synthetic data that support our theoretical results, and with real data that demonstrate the robustness of our approach even when some of the assumptions do not hold."

      "text" : "The problem. We consider m linear regression problems, where each instance i ∈ [m] = {1, . . . ,m} is characterized by a parameter βi ∈ Rd such that for any context X ∈ Rd, a random observation Y ∈ R is obtained as\nY = XTβi + i, (1)\nwhere the noise i is an i.i.d. realization of a Gaussian distribution N (0, σ2i ). We denote by σ2max = maxi σ2i and\nby σ2 = 1/m ∑ i σ 2 i , the largest and the average variance, respectively. We define a sequential decision-making problem over n rounds, where at each round t ∈ [n], the learning algorithm A receives a context Xt drawn i.i.d. from N (0,Σ), selects an instance It, and observes a random sample YIt,t according to (1). By the end of the experiment, a training set Dn = {Xt, It, YIt,t}t∈[n] has been collected and all the m linear regression problems are solved, each problem i ∈ [m] with its own training set Di,n (i.e., a subset of Dn containing samples with It = i), and estimates of the parameters {β̂i,n}i∈[m] are returned. For each β̂i,n, we measure its accuracy by the mean-squared error (MSE)\nLi,n(β̂i,n)=EX [ (XTβi−XTβ̂i,n)2 ] =‖βi−β̂i,n‖2Σ. (2)\nWe evaluate the overall accuracy of the estimates returned by the algorithm A as\nLn(A) = max i∈[m]\nEDn [ Li,n(β̂i,n) ] , (3)\nwhere the expectation is w.r.t. the randomness of the contexts Xt and observations Yi,t used to compute β̂i,n. The objective is to design an algorithm A that minimizes the loss (3). This requires defining an allocation rule to select the instance It at each step t and the algorithm to compute the estimates β̂i,n, e.g., ordinary least-squares (OLS), regularized least-squares (RLS), or Lasso. In designing a learning algorithm, we rely on the following assumption.\nAssumption 1. The covariance matrix Σ of the Gaussian distribution generating the contexts {Xt}nt=1 is known.\nThis is a standard assumption in active learning, since in this setting the learner has access to the input distribution and the main question is for which context she should ask for a label (Sabato & Munos, 2014; Riquelme et al., 2017b). Often times, companies, like the drug company considered in the introduction, own enough data to have an accurate estimate of the distribution of their customers (patients).\nWhile in the rest of the paper we focus on Ln(A), our algorithm and analysis can be easily extended to similar objectives such as replacing the maximum in (3) with average across all instances, i.e., 1/m ∑m i=1 EDn [ Li,n(β̂i,n) ] , and\nusing weighted errors, i.e., maxi wi EDn [ Li,n(β̂i,n) ] , by updating the score to focus on the estimated standard deviation and by including the weights in the score, respectively. Later in the paper, we also consider the case where the expectation in (3) is replaced by the high-probability error (see Eq. 17).\nOptimal static allocation with OLS estimates. While the distribution of the contexts is fixed and does not depend on the instance i, the errors Li,n(β̂i,n) directly depend on the variances σ2i of the noise i. We define an optimal baseline\nobtained when the noise variances {σ2i }mi=1 are known. In particular, we focus on a static allocation algorithm Astat that selects each instance i exactly ki,n times, independently of the context,1 and returns an estimate β̂i,n computed by OLS as\nβ̂i,n = ( XTi,nXi,n )−1 XTi,nYi,n, (4)\nwhere Xi,n ∈ Rki,n×d is the matrix of (random) samples obtained at the end of the experiment, and Yi,n ∈ Rki,n is its corresponding vector of observations. It is simple to show that the global error corresponding to Astat is\nLn(Astat) = max i∈[m] σ2i ki,n\nTr ( ΣEDn [ Σ̂−1i,n ]) , (5)\nwhere Σ̂i,n = XTi,nXi,n/ki,n ∈ Rd×d is the empirical covariance matrix of the contexts assigned to instance i. Since the algorithm does not change the allocation depending on the contexts and Xt ∼ N (0,Σ), Σ̂−1i,n is distributed as an inverse-Wishart and we may write (5) as\nLn(Astat) = max i∈[m] dσ2i ki,n − d− 1 . (6)\nThus, we derive the following proposition for the optimal static allocation algorithm A∗stat. Proposition 1. Given m linear regression problems, each characterized by a parameter βi, Gaussian noise with variance σ2i , and Gaussian contexts with covariance Σ, let n > m(d + 1), then the optimal OLS static allocation algorithm A∗stat selects each instance\nk∗i,n = σ2i∑ j σ 2 j n+ (d+ 1)\n( 1− σ 2 i\nσ2\n) , (7)\ntimes (up to rounding effects), and incurs the global error\nL∗n = Ln(A∗stat) = σ2 md\nn +O\n( σ2 ( md\nn\n)2) . (8)\nProof. See Appendix A.1.2\nProposition 1 divides the problems into two types: those for which σ2i ≥ σ̄2 (wild instances) and those for which σ2i < σ̄\n2 (mild instances). We see that for the first type, the second term in (7) is negative and the instance should be selected less frequently than in the context-free case (where the optimal allocation is given just by the first term). On the other hand, instances whose variance is below the\n1This strategy can be obtained by simply selecting the first instance k1,n times, the second one k2,n times, and so on.\n2All the proofs can be found in the appendices of the extended version of the paper (Riquelme et al., 2017a).\nmean variance should be pulled more often. In any case, we see that the correction to the context-free allocation (i.e., the second term) is constant, as it does not depend on n. Nonetheless, it does depend on d and this suggests that in high-dimensional problems, it may significantly skew the optimal allocation.\nWhile A∗stat effectively minimizes the prediction loss Ln, it cannot be implemented in practice since the optimal allocation k∗i requires the variances σ 2 i to be known at the beginning of the experiment. As a result, we need to devise a learning algorithm A whose performance approaches L∗n as n increases. More formally, we define the regret of A as\nRn(A) = Ln(A)− Ln(A∗stat) = Ln(A)− L∗n, (9)\nand we expect Rn(A) = o(1/n). In fact, any allocation strategy that selects each instance a linear number of times (e.g., uniform sampling) achieves a lossLn = O(1/n), and thus, a regret of orderO(1/n). However, we expect that the loss of an effective learning algorithm decreases not just at the same rate as L∗n but also with the very same constant, thus implying a regret that decreases faster than O(1/n)."

Equation (6) suggests that while the parameters of the context distribution, particularly its covariance Σ, do\nnot impact the prediction error, the noise variances play the most important role in the loss of each problem instance. This is in fact confirmed by the optimal allocation k∗i,n in (7), where only the variances σ2i appear. This evidence suggests that an algorithm similar to GAFS-MAX (Antos et al., 2008) or CH-AS (Carpentier et al., 2011), which were designed for the context-free case (i.e., each instance i is associated to an expected value and not a linear function) would be effective in this setting as well. Nonetheless, (6) holds only for static allocation algorithms that completely ignore the context and the history to decide which instance It to choose at time t. On the other hand, adaptive learning algorithms create a strong correlation between the dataset Dt−1 collected so far, the current context Xt, and the decision It. As a result, the sample matrix Xi,t is no longer a random variable independent of A, and using (6) to design a learning algorithm is not convenient, since the impact of the contexts on the error is completely overlooked. Unfortunately, in general, it is very difficult to study the potential correlation between the contexts Xi,t, the intermediate estimates β̂i,t, and the most suitable choice It. However, in the next lemma, we show that if at each step t, we select It as a function of Dt−1, and not Xt, we may still recover an expression for the final loss that we can use as a basis for the construction of an effective learning algorithm.\nLemma 2. Let A be a learning algorithm that selects the instances It as a function of the previous history, i.e., Dt−1 = {X1, I1, YI1,1, . . . , Xt−1, It−1, YIt−1,t−1} and computes estimates β̂i,n using OLS. Then, its loss after n steps can be expressed as\nLn(A) = max i∈[m] EDn [ σ2i ki,n Tr ( ΣΣ̂−1i,n )] , (10)\nwhere ki,n = ∑n t=1 I{It = i} and Σ̂i,n = XTi,nXi,n/ki,n.\nProof. See Appendix B.\nRemark 1 (assumptions). We assume noise and contexts are Gaussian. The noise Gaussianity is crucial for the estimates of the parameter β̂i,t and variance σ̂2i,t to be independent of each other, for each instance i and time t (we actually need and derive a stronger result in Lemma 9, see Appendix B). This is key in proving Lemma 2, as it allows us to derive a closed form expression for the loss function which holds under our algorithm, and is written in terms of the number of pulls and the trace of the inverse empirical covariance matrix. Note that β̂i,t drives our loss, while σ̂2i,t drives our decisions. One way to remove this assumption is by defining and directly optimizing a surrogate loss equal to (10) instead of (3). On the other hand, the Gaussianity of contexts leads to the whitened inverse covariance estimate ΣΣ̂−1i,n being distributed as an inverse Wishart. As there\nis a convenient closed formula for its mean, we can find the exact optimal static allocation k∗i,n in Proposition 1, see (7). In general, for sub-Gaussian contexts, no such closed formula for the trace is available. However, as long as the optimal allocation k∗i,n has no second order n\nα terms for 1/2 ≤ α < 1, it is possible to derive the same regret rate results that we prove later on for TRACE-UCB.\nEquation (10) makes it explicit that the prediction error comes from two different sources. The first one is the noise in the measurements Y, whose impact is controlled by the unknown variances σ2i ’s. Clearly, the larger the σ 2 i is, the more observations are required to achieve the desired accuracy. At the same time, the diversity of contexts across instances also impacts the overall prediction error. This is very intuitive, since it would be a terrible idea for the research center discussed in the introduction to estimate the parameters of a drug by providing the treatment only to a hundred almost identical patients. We say contexts are balanced when Σ̂i,n is well conditioned. Therefore, a good algorithm should take care of both aspects.\nThere are two extreme scenarios regarding the contributions of the two sources of error. 1) If the number of contexts n is relatively large, since the context distribution is fixed, one can expect that contexts allocated to each instance eventually become balanced (i.e., TRACE-UCB does not bias the distribution of the contexts). In this case, it is the difference in σ2i ’s that drives the number of times each instance is selected. 2) When the dimension d or the number of arms m is large w.r.t. n, balancing contexts becomes critical, and can play an important role in the final prediction error, whereas the σ2i ’s are less relevant in this scenario. While a learning algorithm cannot deliberately choose a specific context (i.e., Xt is a random variable), we may need to favor instances in which the contexts are poorly balanced and their prediction error is large, despite the fact that they might have small noise variances.\nAlgorithm. TRACE-UCB is designed as a combination of the upper-confidence-bound strategy used in CH-AS (Carpentier et al., 2011) and the loss in (10), so as to obtain a learning algorithm capable of allocating according to the estimated variances and at the same time balancing the error generated by context mismatch. We recall that all the quantities that are computed at every step of the algorithm are indexed at the beginning and end of a step t by i, t− 1 (e.g., σ̂2i,t−1) and i, t (e.g., β̂i,t), respectively. At the end of each step t, TRACE-UCB first computes an OLS estimate β̂i,t, and then use it to estimate the variance σ̂2i,t as\nσ̂2i,t = 1 ki,t − d ∥∥Yi,t −XTi,tβ̂i,t∥∥2,\nwhich is the average squared deviation of the predictions based on β̂i,t. We rely on the following concentration in-\nequality for the variance estimate of linear regression with Gaussian noise, whose proof is reported in Appendix C.1.\nProposition 3. Let the number of pulls ki,t ≥ d + 1 and R ≥ maxi σ2i . If δ ∈ (0, 3/4), then for any instance i and step t > m(d+ 1), with probability at least 1− δ2 , we have\n|σ̂2i,t − σ2i | ≤ ∆i,t ∆ = R\n√ 64\nki,t − d\n( log 2mn\nδ\n)2 . (11)\nGiven (11), we can construct an upper-bound on the prediction error of any instance i and time step t as\nsi,t−1 = σ̂2i,t−1 + ∆i,t−1 ki,t−1 Tr ( ΣΣ̂−1i,t−1 ) , (12)\nand then simply select the instance which maximizes this score, i.e., It = arg maxi si,t−1. Intuitively, TRACE-UCB favors problems where the prediction error is potentially large, either because of a large noise variance or because of significant unbalance in the observed contexts w.r.t. the target distribution with covariance Σ. A subtle but critical aspect of TRACE-UCB is that by ignoring the current context Xt (but using all the past samples Xt−1) when choosing It, the distribution of the contexts allocated to each instance stays untouched and the second term in the score si,t−1, i.e., Tr(ΣΣ̂−1i,t−1), naturally tends to d as more and more (random) contexts are allocated to instance i. This is shown by Proposition 4 whose proof is in Appendix C.2.\nProposition 4. Force the number of samples ki,t ≥ d+ 1. If δ ∈ (0, 1), for any i ∈ [m] and step t > m(d + 1) with probability at least 1− δ/2, we have ( 1− CTr √ d\nki,t\n)2 ≤\nTr (\nΣΣ̂−1i,t ) d ≤ ( 1 + 2CTr √ d\nki,t\n)2 ,\nwith CTr = 1 + √ 2 log(4nm/δ)/d.\nWhile Proposition 4 shows that the error term due to context mismatch tends to the constant d for all instances i as the number of samples tends to infinity, when t is small w.r.t. d and m, correcting for the context mismatch may significantly improve the accuracy of the estimates β̂i,n returned by the algorithm. Finally, note that while TRACEUCB uses OLS to compute estimates β̂i,t, it computes its returned parameters β̂i,n by ridge regression (RLS) with regularization parameter λ as\nβ̂λi = (X T i,nXi,n + λI) −1XTi,nYi,n. (13)\nAs we will discuss later, using RLS makes the algorithm more robust and is crucial in obtaining regret bounds both in expectation and high probability.\nPerformance Analysis. Before proving a regret bound for TRACE-UCB, we report an intermediate result (proof in App. D.1) that shows that TRACE-UCB behaves similarly to the optimal static allocation.\nTheorem 5. Let δ > 0. With probability at least 1 − δ, the total number of contexts that TRACE-UCB allocates to each problem instance i after n rounds satisfies\nki,n ≥ k∗i,n − C∆ + 8CTr\nσ2min\n√ nd\nλmin − Ω(n1/4) (14)\nwhereR ≥ σ2max is known by the algorithm, and we defined C∆ = 16R log(2mn/δ) and λmin = σ2min/ ∑ j σ 2 j .\nWe now report our regret bound for the TRACE-UCB algorithm. The proof of Theorem 6 is in Appendix D.2.\nTheorem 6. The regret of the Trace-UCB algorithm, i.e., the difference between its loss and the loss of optimal static allocation (see Eq. (8)), is upper-bounded by\nLn(A)− L∗n ≤ O ( 1\nσ2min ( d λminn )3/2) . (15)\nEq. (15) shows that the regret decreases asO(n−3/2) as expected. This is consistent with the context-free results (Antos et al., 2008; Carpentier et al., 2011), where the regret decreases as n−3/2, which is conjectured to be optimal. However, it is important to note that in the contextual case, the numerator also includes the dimensionality d. Thus, when n d, the regret will be small, and it will be larger when n ≈ d. This motivates studying the high-dimensional setting (App. F). Eq. (15) also indicates that the regret depends on a problem-dependent constant 1/λmin, which measures the complexity of the problem. Note that when σ2max ≈ σ2min, we have 1/λmin ≈ m, but 1/λmin could be much larger when σ2max σ2min.\nRemark 2. We introduce a baseline motivated by the context-free problem. At round t, let VAR-UCB selects the instance that maximizes the score3\ns′i,t−1 = σ̂2i,t−1 + ∆i,t−1\nki,t−1 . (16)\nThe only difference with the score used by TRACE-UCB is the lack of the trace term in (12). Moreover, the regret of this algorithm has similar rate in terms of n and d as that of TRACE-UCB reported in Theorem 6. However, the simulations of Sect. 4 show that the regret of VAR-UCB is actually much higher than that of TRACE-UCB, specially when dm is close to n. Intuitively, when n is close to dm, balancing contexts becomes critical, and VAR-UCB suffers because its score does not explicitly take them into account.\n3Note that VAR-UCB is similar to both the CH-AS and B-AS algorithms in Carpentier et al. (2011).\nSketch of the proof of Theorem 6. The proof is divided into three parts. 1) We show that the behavior of the ridge loss of TRACE-UCB is similar to that reported in Lemma 2 for algorithms that rely on OLS; see Lemma 19 in Appendix E. The independence of the β̂i,t and σ̂2i,t estimates is again essential (see Remark 1). Although the loss of TRACE-UCB depends on the ridge estimate of the parameters β̂λi,n, the decisions made by the algorithm at each round only depend on the variance estimates σ̂2i,t and observed contexts. 2) We follow the ideas in Carpentier et al. (2011) to lower-bound the total number of pulls ki,n for each i ∈ [m] under a good event (see Theorem 5 and its proof in Appendix D.1). 3) We finally use the ridge regularization to bound the impact of those cases outside the good event, and combine everything in Appendix D.2.\nThe regret bound of Theorem 6 shows that the largest expected loss across the problem instances incurred by TRACE-UCB quickly approaches the loss of the optimal static allocation algorithm (which knows the true noise variances). WhileLn(A) measures the worst expected loss, at any specific realization of the algorithm, there may be one of the instances which is very poorly estimated. As a result, it would also be desirable to obtain guarantees for the (random) maximum loss\nL̃n(A) = max i∈[m] ‖βi − β̂i,n‖2Σ. (17)\nIn particular, we are able to prove the following highprobability bound on L̃n(A) for TRACE-UCB. Theorem 7. Let δ > 0, and assume ‖βi‖2 ≤ Z for all i, for some Z > 0. With probability at least 1− δ,\nL̃n ≤\nm∑ j=1 σ2j\nn\n( d+ 2 log 3m\nδ\n) +O ( 1\nσ2min ( d nλmin ) 3 2 ) . (18)\nNote that the first term in (18) corresponds to the first term of the loss for the optimal static allocation, and the second term is, again, a n−3/2 deviation. However, in this case, the guarantees hold simultaneously for all the instances.\nSketch of the proof of Theorem 7. In the proof we slightly modify the confidence ellipsoids for the β̂i,t’s, based on self-normalized martingales, and derived in (AbbasiYadkori et al., 2011); see Thm. 13 in App. C. By means of the confidence ellipsoids we control the loss in (17). Their radiuses depend on the number of samples per instance, and we rely on a high-probability events to compute a lower bound on the number of samples. In addition, we need to make sure the mean norm of the contexts will not be too large (see Corollary 15 in App. C). Finally, we combine the lower bound on ki,n with the confidence ellipsoids to conclude the desired high-probability guarantees in Thm. 7.\nHigh-Dimensional Setting. High-dimensional linear models are quite common in practice, motivating the study of\nthe n < dm case, where the algorithms discussed so far break down. We propose SPARSE-TRACE-UCB in Appendix F, an extension of TRACE-UCB that assumes and takes advantage of joint sparsity across the linear functions. The algorithm has two-stages: first, an approximate support is recovered, and then, TRACE-UCB is applied to the induced lower dimensional space. We discuss and extend our high-probability guarantees to SPARSE-TRACE-UCB under suitable standard assumptions in Appendix F."

      "text" : "In this section, we provide empirical evidence to support our theoretical results. We consider both synthetic and realworld problems, and compare the performance (in terms of normalized MSE) of TRACE-UCB to uniform sampling, optimal static allocation (which requires the knowledge of noise variances), and the context-free algorithm VAR-UCB (see Remark 2). We do not compare to GFSP-MAX and GAFS-MAX (Antos et al., 2008) since they are outperformed by CH-AS Carpentier et al. (2011) and VAR-UCB is the same as CH-AS, except for the fact that we use the concentration inequality in Prop. 3, since we are estimating the variance from a regression problem using OLS.\nFirst, we use synthetic data to ensure that all the assumptions of our model are satisfied, namely we deal with linear regression models with Gaussian context and noise. We set the number of problem instances to m = 7 and consider two scenarios: one in which all the noise variances are equal to 1 and one where they are not equal, and σ2 = (0.01, 0.02, 0.75, 1, 2, 2, 3). In the latter case, σ2max/σ 2 min = 300. We study the impact of (independently) increasing dimension d and horizon n on the performance, while keeping all other parameters fixed. Second, we consider real-world datasets in which the underlying model is non-linear and the contexts are not Gaussian, to observe how TRACE-UCB behaves (relative to the baselines) in settings where its main underlying assumptions are violated.\nSynthetic Data. In Figures 1(a,b), we display the results for fixed horizon n = 350 and increasing dimension d. For each value of d, we run 10, 000 simulations and report the median of the maximum error across the instances for each simulation. In Fig. 1(a), where σ2i ’s are equal, uniform sampling and optimal static allocation execute the same allocation since there is no difference in the expected losses of different instances. Nonetheless we notice that VARUCB suffers from poor estimation as soon as d increases, while TRACE-UCB is competitive with the optimal performance. This difference in performance can be explained by the fact that VAR-UCB does not control for contextual balance, which becomes a dominant factor in the loss of a learning strategy for problems of high dimensionality. In Fig. 1(b), in which σ2i ’s are different, uniform sampling is\nno longer optimal but even in this case VAR-UCB performs better than uniform sampling only for small d < 23, where it is more important to control for the σ2i ’s. For larger dimensions, balancing uniformly the contexts eventually becomes a better strategy, and uniform sampling outperforms VAR-UCB. In this case too, TRACE-UCB is competitive with the optimal static allocation even for large d, successfully balancing both noise variance and contextual error.\nNext, we study the performance of the algorithms w.r.t. n. We report two different losses, one in expectation (3) and one in high probability (17), corresponding to the results we proved in Theorems 6 and 7, respectively. In order to approximate the loss in (3) (Figures 1(c,d)) we run 30, 000 simulations, compute the average prediction error for each instance i ∈ [m], and finally report the maximum mean error across the instances. On the other hand, we estimate the loss in (17) (Figures 1(e,f)) by running 30, 000 simulations, taking the maximum prediction error across the instances for each simulation, and finally reporting their median.\nIn Figures 1(c, d), we display the loss for fixed dimension d = 10 and horizon from n = 115 to 360. In Figure 1(c),\nTRACE-UCB performs similarly to the optimal static allocation, whereas VAR-UCB performs significantly worse, ranging from 25% to 50% higher errors than TRACE-UCB, due to some catastrophic errors arising from unlucky contextual realizations for an instance. In Fig. 1(d), as the number of contexts grows, uniform sampling’s simple context balancing approach is enough to perform as well as VARUCB that again heavily suffers from large mistakes. In both figures, TRACE-UCB smoothly learns the σ2i ’s and outperforms uniform sampling and VAR-UCB. Its performance is comparable to that of the optimal static allocation, especially in the case of equal variances in Fig. 1(c).\nIn Figure 1(e), TRACE-UCB learns and properly balances observations extremely fast and obtains an almost optimal performance. Similarly to figures 1(a,c), VAR-UCB struggles when variances σ̂2i are almost equal, mainly because it gets confused by random deviations in variance estimates σ̂2i , while overlooking potential and harmful context imbalances. Note that even when n = 360 (rightmost point), its median error is still 25% higher than TRACE-UCB’s. In Fig. 1(f), as expected, uniform sampling performs poorly,\ndue to mismatch in variances, and only outperforms VARUCB for small horizons in which uniform allocation pays off. On the other hand, TRACE-UCB is able to successfully handle the tradeoff between learning and allocating according to variance estimates σ̂2i , while accounting for the contextual trace Σ̂i, even for very low n. We observe that for large n, VAR-UCB eventually reaches the performance of the optimal static allocation and TRACE-UCB.\nIn practice the loss in (17) (figures 1(e,f)) is often more relevant than (3), since it is in high probability and not in expectation, and TRACE-UCB shows excellent performance and robustness, regardless of the underlying variances σ2i .\nReal Data. TRACE-UCB is based on assumptions such as linearity, and Gaussianity of noise and context that may not hold in practice, where data may show complex dependencies. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the algorithm with real-world data to see its robustness to the violation of its assumptions. We consider two collaborative filtering datasets in which users provide ratings for items. We choose a dense subset of k users and p items, where every user has rated every item. Thus, each user is represented by a p-dimensional vector of ratings. We define the user context by d out of her p ratings, and learn to predict her remaining m = p − d ratings (each one is a problem instance). All item ratings are first centered, so each item’s mean is zero. In each simulation, n out of the k users are selected at random to be fed to the algorithm, also in random order. Algorithms can select any instance as the dataset contains the ratings of every instance for all the users. At the end of each simulation, we compute the prediction error for each instance by using the k − n users that did not participate in training for that simulation. Finally, we report the median error across all simulations.\nFig. 2(a) reports the results using the Jester Dataset by (Goldberg et al., 2001) that consists of joke ratings in a continuous scale from −10 to 10. We take d = 40 joke ratings as context and learn the ratings for another 9 jokes. In addition, we add another function that counts the total\nnumber of movies originally rated by the user. The latter is also centered, bounded to the same scale, and has higher variance (without conditioning on X). The number of total users is k = 3811, and m = 10. When the number of observations is limited, the advantage of TRACE-UCB is quite significant (the improvement w.r.t. uniform allocation goes from 45% to almost 20% for large n, while w.r.t. VAR-UCB it goes from almost 30% to roughly 5%), even though the model and context distribution are far from linear and Gaussian, respectively.\nFig. 2(b) shows the results for the MovieLens dataset (Maxwell Harper & Konstan, 2016) that consists of movie ratings between 0 and 5 with 0.5 increments. We select 30 popular movies rated by k = 1363 users, and randomly choose m = 5 of them to learn (so d = 25). In this case, all problems have similar variance (σ̂2max/σ̂ 2 min ≈ 1.3) so uniform allocation seems appropriate. Both TRACE-UCB and VAR-UCB modestly improve uniform allocation, while their performance is similar."

      "text" : "We studied the problem of adaptive allocation of n contextual samples of dimension d to estimate m linear functions equally well, under heterogenous noise levels σ2i that depend on the linear instance and are unknown to the decision-maker. We proposed TRACE-UCB, an optimistic algorithm that successfully solves the explorationexploitation dilemma by simultaneously learning the σ2i ’s, allocating samples accordingly to their estimates, and balancing the contextual information across the instances. We also provide strong theoretical guarantees for two losses of interest: in expectation and high-probability. Simulations were conducted in several settings, with both synthetic and real data. The favorable results suggest that TRACE-UCB is reliable, and remarkably robust even in settings that fall outside its assumptions, thus, a useful and simple tool to implement in practice.\nAcknowledgements.

Given m linear regression problems, each characterized by a parameter βi, Gaussian noise with variance σ2i , and Gaussian contexts with covariance Σ, let n > m(d + 1), then the optimal OLS static allocation algorithm A∗stat selects each instance\nk∗i,n = σ2i∑ j σ 2 j n+ (d+ 1)\n( 1− σ 2 i\nσ2\n) , (19)\ntimes (up to rounding effects), and incurs the global error\nL∗n = Ln(A∗stat) = σ2 md\nn +O\n( σ2 ( md\nn\n)2) . (20)\nProof. For the sake of readability in the following we drop the dependency on n.\nWe first derive the equality in Eq. 2\nLi(β̂i) = EX [ (XTβi −XTβ̂i)2 ] = EX [(β̂i − βi)TXXT(β̂i − βi)]\n= (β̂i − βi)TE[XXT](β̂i − βi)\n= (β̂i − βi)TΣ(β̂i − βi)\n= ‖βi − β̂i‖2Σ.\nAs a result, we can write the global error as\nLn(Astat) = max i∈[m]\nEDi,n [ ‖βi − β̂i‖2Σ ] = max i∈[m] EDi,n [ Tr ( (βi − β̂i)TΣ(βi − β̂i) )]\n= max i∈[m]\nEDi,n [ Tr ( Σ(βi − β̂i)(βi − β̂i)T )]\n= max i∈[m] Tr\n( EDi,n [ Σ(βi − β̂i)(βi − β̂i)T ]) ,\nwhere Di,n is the training set extracted from Dn containing the samples for instance i. Since contexts and noise are independent random variables, we can decompose Di,n into the randomness related to the context matrix Xi ∈ Rki×d and the noise vector i ∈ Rki . We recall that for any fixed realization of Xi ∈ Rki×d, the OLS estimates β̂i is distributed as\nβ̂i | Xi ∼ N (βi, σ2i (XTi Xi)−1), (21)\nwhich means that β̂i conditioned on Xi is unbiased with covariance matrix given by σ2i (X T i Xi) −1. Thus, we can further develop Ln(Astat) as\nLn(Astat) = max i∈[m] Tr\n( EXi [ E i [ Σ(βi − β̂i)(βi − β̂i)T ∣∣Xi]]), (22) = max i∈[m] σ2iTr ( ΣEXi [ (XTi Xi) −1 ])\n= max i∈[m]\nσ2iTr ( EXi [ (X T i Xi) −1 ]) ,\nwhere X = Σ−1/2X is a whitened context and Xi is its corresponding whitened matrix. Since whitened contexts X are distributed as N (0, I), we know that (XTi Xi)−1 is distributed as an inverse Wishart W−1(Id, ki), whose expectation is\nId/(ki − d− 1), and thus,\nLn(Astat) = max i∈[m] σ2iTr\n[ 1\nki − d− 1 Id ] = max i∈[m]\nσ2i d\nki − d− 1 . (23)\nNote that this final expression requires that ki > d+ 1, since it is not possible to compute an OLS estimate with less than d + 1 samples. Therefore, we proceed by minimizing Eq. 23, subject to ki > d + 1. We write ki = k′i + d + 1 for some k′i > 0. Thus, equivalently, we minimize\nLn(Astat) = max i\nσ2i d\nk′i . (24)\nSince ∑ i k ′ i = n−m(d+ 1), we may conclude that the optimal k′i is given by\nk′i = σ2i∑ j σ 2 j\n( n−m(d+ 1) ) ,\nso that all the terms in the RHS of Eq. 24 are equal. This gives us the optimal static allocation\nk∗i = σ2i∑ j σ 2 j (n−m(d+ 1)) + d+ 1\n= σ2i∑ j σ 2 j n+ (d+ 1)\n( 1− σ 2 i\nσ2\n) , (25)\nwhere σ2 = (1/m) ∑ i σ 2 i is the mean variance across the m problem instances.\nThus, for the optimal static allocation, the expected loss is given by\nL∗n = Ln(A∗stat) = dmax i σ2i σ2i∑ j σ 2 j n− (d+ 1)σ 2 i σ̄2\n=\n(∑ j σ 2 j ) d\nn−m(d+ 1)\n=\n(∑ j σ 2 j ) d\nn +\n(∑ j σ 2 j ) md(d+ 1)\nn ( n−m(d+ 1) ) = (∑ j σ 2 j ) d\nn +O\n (∑ j σ 2 j ) md2\nn2  , which concludes the proof.

      "text" : "Unlike in the proof of Proposition 1, when the number of pulls is random and depends on the value of the previous observations (through Dn), then in general, the OLS estimates β̂i,n are no longer distributed as Eq. 21 and the derivation for Astat no longer holds. In fact, for a learning algorithm, the value ki,t itself provides some information about the observations that have been obtained up until time t and were used by the algorithm to determine ki,t. In the following, we show that by ignoring the current context Xt when choosing instance It, we are still able to analyze the loss of TRACEUCB and obtain a result very similar to the static case.\nWe first need two auxiliary lemmas (Lemmas 8 and 9), one on the computation of an empirical estimate of the variance of the noise, and an independence result between the variance estimate and the linear regression estimate.\nLemma 8. In any linear regression problem with noise ∼ N (0, σ2), after t ≥ d + 1 samples, given an OLS estimator β̂t, the noise variance estimator can be computed in a recurrent form as\nσ̂2t+1 = t− d\nt− d+ 1 σ̂2t +\n1 t− d+ 1 (XTt+1β̂t − Yt+1)2\n1 +XTt+1(X T tXt) −1Xt+1 , (26)\nwhere Xt ∈ Rt×d is the sample matrix.\nProof. We first recall the “batch” definition of the variance estimator\nσ̂2t = 1\nt− d t∑ s=1 (Ys −XTs β̂t)2 = 1 t− d ‖Yt −XTt β̂t‖2\nSince Yt = Xtβ + t and β̂t = β + (XTtXt) −1XTt t, we have\nσ̂2t = 1\nt− d ‖(XTtXt)−1XTt t − t‖2 =\n1\nt− d\n( Tt t − TtXt(XTtXt)−1XTt t ) = 1\nt− d (Et+1 − Vt+1).\nWe now devise a recursive formulation for the two terms in the previous expression. We have\nEt+1 = T t+1 t+1 = T t t + 2 t+1 = Et + 2 t+1.\nIn order to analyze the second term we first introduce the design matrix St = XTtXt, which has the simple update rule St+1 = St +Xt+1X T t+1. Then we have\nVt+1 = T t+1Xt+1(X T t+1Xt+1) −1XTt+1 t+1 = ( TtXt + t+1X T t+1 )( St +Xt+1X T t+1 )−1( TtXt + t+1X T t+1 )T = ( TtXt + t+1X T t+1 )( S−1t − S−1t Xt+1X T t+1S −1 t\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n)( TtXt + t+1X T t+1 )T ,\nwhere we used the Sherman-Morrison formula in the last equality. We further develop the previous expression as\nVt+1 = Vt + t+1X T t+1S −1 t Xt+1 t+1 + 2 t+1X T t+1S −1 t X T t t\n− TtXt S−1t Xt+1X T t+1S −1 t\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\nXTt t − t+1XTt+1 S−1t Xt+1X T t+1S −1 t\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\nXt+1 t+1 − 2 TtXt S−1t Xt+1X T t+1S −1 t\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\nXt+1 t+1.\nWe define αt+1 = XTt+1S −1 t X T t t and ψt+1 = X T t+1S −1 t Xt+1, and then obtain\nVt+1 = Vt + 2 t+1ψt+1 + 2αt+1 t+1 − α2t+1 1 + ψt+1 − 2t+1 ψ2t+1 1− ψt+1 − 2 t+1 αt+1ψt+1 1 + ψt+1\n= Vt + 2 t+1 ( ψt+1 +\nψ2t+1 1 + ψt+1\n) + 2 t+1\nαt+1 1 + ψt+1 − α2t+1 1 + ψt+1 .\nBringing everything together we obtain\nEt+1 − Vt+1 = Et − Vt + 2t+1 ( 1− ψt+1 + ψ2t+1\n1 + ψt+1\n) − 2 t+1\nαt+1 1 + ψt+1 + α2t+1 1 + ψt+1\n= Et − Vt + 1\n1 + ψt+1\n( 2t+1 − 2 t+1αt+1 + αt+1 ) = Et − Vt + ( t+1 − αt+1 )2 1 + ψt+1 .\nSince t+1 = Yt+1 −XTt+1β, we may write\nEt+1 − Vt+1 = Et − Vt + ( Yt+1 −XTt+1(β + S−1t XTt t) )2 1 + ψt+1 = Et − Vt + ( Yt+1 −XTt+1β̂t )2 1 + ψt+1 .\nRecalling the definition of the variance estimate, we finally obtain\nσ̂2t+1 = 1\nt− d+ 1 (Et+1 − Vt+1) =\n1\nt− d+ 1 (Et − Vt) +\n1\nt− d+ 1\n( Yt+1 −XTt+1β̂t )2 1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n= t− d\nt− d+ 1 σ̂2t +\n1\nt− d+ 1\n( Yt+1 −XTt+1β̂t )2 1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1 ,\nwhich concludes the proof.\nLemma 9. Let Fj be the σ-algebra generated by X1, . . . , Xn and σ̂21 , . . . , σ̂2j . Then, for any j ≥ d,\nβ̂j | Fj ∼ N (β, σ2 (XT1:jX1:j)−1). (27)\nProof. We prove the lemma by induction. The statement is true for t = d. We want to prove the induction, that is if β̂t | Ft ∼ N (β, σ2 (XTtXt)−1), then\nβ̂t+1 | Ft+1 ∼ N (β, σ2(XTt+1Xt+1)−1). (28)\nLet us first derive a recursive expression for β̂t+1. Let St = XTtXt, then\nβ̂t+1 = β + S −1 t+1X T t+1 t+1 = ( St +Xt+1X T t+1 )−1( XTt t + t+1Xt+1 ) = ( S−1t − S−1t Xt+1X T t+1S −1 t\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n)( XTt t + t+1Xt+1 ) ,\nwhere we used Sherman-Morrison formula. By developing the previous expression we obtain\nβ̂t+1 = ( β + S−1t X T t t ) + t+1S −1 t Xt+1 ( 1− XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n) − S−1t Xt+1X T t+1S −1 t X T t t\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n= β̂t + t+1S\n−1 t Xt+1\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n− S−1t Xt+1X T t+1(β̂t − β)\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n.\nWe can conveniently rewrite the previous expression as\nβ̂t+1 − β = ( I − S−1t Xt+1X T t+1\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n) (β̂t − β) +\nt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n= (I − αt)(β̂t − β) + γt t+1, (29)\nwhere αt ∈ Rd×d and γt ∈ Rd are defined implicitly. By Lemma 8, we notice that the sequence of empirical variances in Ft is equivalent to the sequence of squared deviations up to t. In order to make this equivalence more apparent we define the filtration\nGt = { {Xs}ns=1 ∪ σ̂22 ∪ {(XTs+1β̂s − s+1)2}t−1s=2 } ,\nso that β̂t+1 | Ft+1 ∼ β̂t+1 | Gt+1. We introduce two auxiliary random vectors conditioned on G\nU = t+1 −XTt+1(β̂t − β) | Gt, V = β̂t+1 − β | Gt.\nWe want to show that the random vectors U ∈ R and V ∈ Rd are independent. We first recall that the noise t+1 | Gt ∼ N (0, σ2), and it is independent of 1, . . . , t, and β̂t under Gt. Furthermore, by the induction assumption β̂t | Gt is also Gaussian, so we have that (β̂t, t+1) are jointly Gaussian given Gt. Then we can conveniently rewrite U as\nU = (−Xt+1, 1)T(β̂t, t+1) +XTt+1β,\nwhich shows that it is a Gaussian vector. Using the recursive formulation in Eq. 29 we can also rewrite V as\nV = (Id− αt)(β̂t − β) + γt t+1 = [ I− αt γt ] [β̂t − β t+1 ] ,\nwhich is also Gaussian. Furthermore, we notice that under the induction assumption, EGt [U ] = 0 and EGt [V ] = 0 and thus we need to show that E[UV | Gt] = 0 to prove that U and V are uncorrelated\nE[UV | Gt] = EGt [( t+1 −XTt+1(β̂t − β) )( (Id− αt)(β̂t − β) + γt t+1 )] = γt EGt [ 2t+1 ] − EGt [ XTt+1(β̂t − β)(I− αt)(β̂t − β)\n] = σ2γt − EGt [ (I− αt)(β̂t − β)(β̂t − β)TXt+1\n] = σ2γt − (I− αt) EGt [ (β̂t − β)(β̂t − β)T ] Xt+1\n= σ2γt − σ2(I− αt)(XTtXt)−1Xt+1\n= σ2 S−1t Xt+1\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n− σ2 ( I− S−1t Xt+1X T t+1\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n) S−1t Xt+1\n= σ2 S−1t Xt+1 − (1 +XTt+1S−1t Xt+1)S−1t Xt+1 + S−1t Xt+1XTt+1S−1t Xt+1\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n= 0.\nIt thus follows that, as U and V are uncorrelated, they are also independent. Combining the definition of Gt, U and its independence w.r.t V , we have\nV | Gj+1 = V | U,Gj = V | {X1, . . . , XT , σ̂22 , {(XTs+1β̂s − s+1)2}t−1s=2}\n= [ I− αt γt ] [β̂t − β t+1 ] | Gt.\nBy the induction hypothesis the vector in the previous expression is distributed as[ β̂t − β t+1 ] ∼ N ([ 0 0 ] , σ2 [ S−1t 0 0 1 ]) .\nTherefore, we conclude that V | Gt+1 ∼ N ( 0, σ2 [ I− αt γt ] [S−1t 0 0 1 ] [ I− αt γt ]T) = N (0, σ2 Σ′),\nwhere the covariance matrix Σ′ can be written as\nΣ′ = [ I− αt γt ] [S−1t 0 0 1 ] [ I− αt γt ]T = [ I− αt γt ] [S−1t (I− αt)T γTt\n] = (I− αt)S−1t (I− αt)T + γtγTt .\nRecalling the definitions of αt and γt, and defining ψt+1 = XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\nΣ′ = ( I− S−1t Xt+1X T t+1\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n) S−1t ( I− S−1t Xt+1X T t+1\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n)T\n+\n( S−1t Xt+1\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n)( S−1t Xt+1\n1 +XTt+1S −1 t Xt+1\n)T\n= S−1t − 2 S−1t Xt+1X T t+1S −1 t\n1 + r + ψt+1\nS−1t Xt+1X T t+1S −1 t\n(1 + ψt+1)2 +\nS−1t Xt+1X T t+1S −1 t\n(1 + ψt+1)2\n= S−1t − S−1t Xt+1X T t+1S −1 t\n1 + ψt+1 = S−1t+1 = (X T t+1Xt+1) −1,\nwhere we applied the Woodbury matrix identity in the last step. Finally, it follows that\nβ̂t+1 | Ft+1 ∼ N (β, σ2 (XTt+1Xt+1)−1),\nand the induction is complete.\nNow we can prove Lemma 2:\nLemma. Let A be a learning algorithm that selects instances It as a function of the previous history, that is, Dt−1 = {X1, I1, YI1,1, . . . , Xt−1, It−1, YIt−1,t−1} and computes estimates β̂i,n using OLS. Then, its loss after n steps can be expressed as\nLn(A) = max i∈[m] EDt [ σ2i ki,n Tr ( ΣΣ̂−1i,n )] , (30)\nwhere ki,n = ∑n t=1 I{It = i} and Σ̂i,n = XTi,nXi,n/ki,n.\nProof. For any instance i, we can assume that the following random variables are sampled before TRACE-UCB starts collecting observations (we omit the i index in the table):\nt = 1 t = 2 . . . t = n X1 X2 . . . Xn 1 2 . . . n β̂1 β̂2 . . . β̂n σ̂21 σ̂ 2 2 . . . σ̂ 2 n\nAs a result, we can interpret TRACE-UCB as controlling the stopping time ti = ki,n for each problem i, that is, the total number of samples ki,n, leading to the final estimates β̂ti and σ̂ 2 ti . In the following we introduce the notation X1:j as the sample matrix constructed from exactly j samples, unlike Xi,n which is the sample matrix obtained with ki,n. So we have X1:ki,n = Xi,n. Crucially, when the errors j are Gaussian, then β̂j | X1:j and σ̂2j | X1:j are independent for any fixed j (note these random variables have nothing to do with the algorithm’s decisions).\nLet Fj be the σ-algebra generated by X1, . . . , Xn and σ̂21 , . . . , σ̂2j . We recall that from Lemma 9\nβ̂j |X1:j = β̂j | Fj ∼ N (βj , σ2 (XT1:jX1:j)−1). (31)\nIntuitively, this results says that, given the data X1:n, if we are additionally given all the estimates for the variance {σ̂2s} j s=2 —which obviously depend on 1, . . . , j—, then the updated distribution for β̂j does not change at all. This is a crucial property since TRACE-UCB ignores the current context Xt and it makes decisions only based on previous contexts and the variance estimates {σ̂2s} j s=2, thus allowing us to proceed and do inference on β̂j as in the fixed allocation case.\nWe now need to take into consideration the filtration Fi,j for a specific instance i and the environment filtration E−i containing all the contexts X and noise from all other instances (different from i). Since the environment filtration E−i is independent from the samples from instance i, then we can still apply Lemma 9 and obtain\nβ̂i,j | Fi,j , E−i ∼ β̂i,j | Fi,j . (32)\nNow we can finally study the expected prediction error\nLi,n(β̂i,n) =E[(β̂i − βi)(β̂i − βi)T] = EX1:n,ε−i [ E[(β̂i − βi)(β̂i − βi)T | X1:n, ε−i] ] = EX1:n,ε−i  n∑ j=1 E[(β̂ki − βi)(β̂ki − βi)T | X1:n, ε−i, ki = j] P(ki = j)\n = EX1:n,ε−i  n∑ j=1 E [ EFj [(β̂j − βi)(β̂j − βi)T | Fj ,X1:n, ε−i, ki = j] | X1:n, ε−i, ki = j ] P(ki = j)\n = EX1:n,ε−i  n∑ j=1 E [ EFj [(β̂j − βi)(β̂j − βi)T | Fj ,X1:n] | X1:n, ε−i, ki = j ] P(ki = j)\n (33) = EX1:n,ε−i  n∑ j=1 E [ σ2i (X T 1:jX1:j) −1 | X1:n, ki = j ] P(ki = j)\n = EX1:n,ε−i  n∑ j=1 σ2i (X T 1:jX1:j) −1 P(ki = j)\n = σ2i EX1:n,ε−i [ Eki [(XT1:kiX1:ki) −1] ]\n= σ2i E [ (XT1:kiX1:ki) −1] , where in Eq. 33 we applied Lemma 9. Hence, going back to the definition of loss (see e.g., Eq. 22), we obtain an expression for the loss which applies under TRACE-UCB (while not in general for other algorithms)\nLn(A) = max i\nE [ σ2i Tr(Σ(X T i,nXi,n) −1) ]\n= max i E [ σ2i ki,n Tr ( ΣΣ̂−1i,n )] ."

Then, for all η > 0,\nP(|X| ≥ η) ≤ exp ( −1\n2 min\n{ η2\nτ2 , η b\n}) . (34)\nProof. See Proposition 2.2 in (Wainwright, 2015).\nWe first prove the concentration inequality for one single instance.\nProposition 11. Let t > d, Xt ∈ Rt×d be a random matrix whose entries are independent standard normal random variables, Yt = XTt β + t, where the noise t ∼ N (0, σ2t Id) is independent from Xt, and δ ∈ (0, 3/4]. Then, with probability at least 1− δ, we have\n|σ̂2t − σ2| ≤ σ2 √ 64\nt− d\n( log 1\nδ\n)2 , (35)\nwhere σ̂2t is the unbiased estimate σ̂ 2 t = 1 t−d‖Yt −Xtβ̂t‖ 2 and β̂t is the OLS estimator of β, given Xt and Yt.\nProof. First note that the distribution of σ̂2t conditioned on Xt follows the scaled chi-squared distribution, i.e.,\nσ̂2t | X ∼ σ2\nt− d χ2t−d.\nAlso note that the distribution of the estimate does not depend on Xt and we can integrate out the randomness in Xt. In order to show concentration around the mean, we directly use the sub-exponential properties of σ̂2t . The χ 2 k distribution is sub-exponential with parameters (4k, 4).4 Furthermore, we know that for any constant C > 0, Cχ2k is (4C 2k, 4C)-subexponential. As a result, we have that σ̂2t is subexponential with parameters\n(τ2, b) =\n( 4σ4\nt− d ,\n4σ2\nt− d\n) .\nNow we use Proposition 10 as our concentration bound. In our case, η2/τ2 < η/b, when η < σ2. In such a case, if we denote the RHS of (34) by δ, we conclude that\nη = σ2 √ 8\nt− d log\n1 δ .\nThen, η < σ2 holds when t ≥ d+ 8 log(1/δ). Otherwise, if η2/τ2 > η/b, by Eq. 34, we have\nη = 8σ2\nt− d log\n1 δ .\nIn this case, when t < d+ 8 log(1/δ), we have that\n|σ̂2t − σ2| ≤ σ2 8\nt− d log\n1 δ .\n4See Example 2.5 in (Wainwright, 2015).\nWe would like to derive a bound that is valid in both cases. Let x = 8 log(1/δ)/(t− d), then we have\nP ( |σ̂2t − σ2| ≥ σ2 max(x, √ x) ) ≤ δ. (36)\nSuppose x ≥ √ x, so t < d+ log(1/δ). Then, we would like to find C, such that x ≤ C √ x. As t ≥ d+ 1, we see that\n√ x =\n√ 8 log(1/δ)\nt− d ≤ √ 8 log(1/δ) ∆ = C.\nif C > 1, it does follow that max(x, √ x) < max(C √ x, √ x) < √ 8 log(1/δ)x, which corresponds to δ < 0.88. By (36), we now conclude that\nP |σ̂2t − σ2| ≥ σ2 √ 64\nt− d\n( log 1\nδ )2 ≤ δ, and the proof is complete.\nIn order to prove Proposition 3, we are just left to apply a union bound over steps t ∈ {1, . . . , n} and instances i ∈ {1, . . . ,m}. In order to avoid confusion, let σ̂i,t be the estimate obtained by the algorithm after t steps and σ̂i(j) the estimate obtained using j samples. Let j > d, then\nEi(j) = { |σ̂2i (j)− σ2i | ≥ σ2i √ 64\nj − d\n( log 1\nδ\n)2} ,\nis the high-probability event introduced in Proposition 11, which holds with probability 1− δ. Then we have that the event\nE = m⋂ i=1 n⋂ j=1 Ei(j),\nholds with probability 1 − δ′, with δ′ = mnδ. We complete the proof of Proposition 3 by properly tuning δ and taking R ≥ maxi σ2i . Recall that Proposition 3 is as follows. Proposition. Let the number of pulls ki,t ≥ d + 1 and R ≥ maxi σ2i .

We first derive the concentration inequality for the eigenvalues of the empirical covariance matrix and then we invert it to obtain the guarantee for the inverse matrix. From Corollary 5.35 in (Vershynin, 2010), we have that for any t > 0 (√\nn− √ d− t )2 ≤ λmin(X T X) = smin(X) 2 ≤ smax(X)2 = λmax(X T X) ≤ (√ n+ √ d+ t )2 , (38)\nwith probability at least 1−2 exp(−t2/2).

Combined with Eq. 38 we have\nλmin ( Σ −1) ≥ 1(\n1 + (1 + α) √\nd n )2 = 1\n1 + 2(1 + α) √\nd n + (1 + α) 2 d n\n= 1− 2(1 + α)\n√ d n + (1 + α) 2 d n\n1 + 2(1 + α) √\nd n + (1 + α) 2 d n\n.\nSimilarly, we have that\nλmax ( Σ −1) ≤ 1(\n1− (1 + α) √\nd n )2 = 1\n1− 2(1 + α) √\nd n + (1 + α) 2 d n\n= 1 + 2(1 + α)\n√ d n − (1 + α) 2 d n\n1− 2(1 + α) √\nd n + (1 + α) 2 d n\n.\nUsing the fact that for any matrix A ∈ Rd×d, we may write d λmin(A) ≤ Tr(A) ≤ d λmax(A), we obtain the final statement on the trace of Σ −1 . The first of the two bounds can be further simplified by using 1/(1 + x) ≥ 1 − x for any\nx ≥ 0, thus obtaining\nλmin ( Σ −1) ≥ (1− (1 + α)√ d\nn\n)2 .\nWhile under the assumption that n ≥ 4(1 + α)2d we can use 1/(1− x) ≤ 1 + 2x (for any x ≥ 1/2) and obtain λmax ( Σ −1) ≤ (1 + 2(1 + α)√ d\nn\n)2 .\nThe statement of Proposition 4 (below) is obtained by recalling that ΣΣ̂−1i,n is the empirical covariance matrix of the whitened sample matrix Xi,n and by a union bound over the number of samples ki,n and the number of instances i.\nProposition.

In order to ease the derivation of an explicit lower-bound on kp,n, we further simplify the previous expression by replacing higher order terms with a big-Ω notation. We first recall that L∗n = Θ̃(mdσ 2/n), then the terms of order (1/L∗n) and (1/ √ L∗n) clearly dominate the expression, while all other terms are asymptotically constant or decreasing in n and thus we can rewrite the previous bound as\n1 Bq,n ≥ d L∗n − (C∆ + 4CTr\n√ d)\n√ d\nL∗nσ 6 q\n− Ω(1).\nBy setting C = C∆ + 4CTr √ d we can finally use the upper bound on 1/Ap,n and the lower bound on 1/Bq,n to obtain\n1\nσ2p\n(√ kp,n + 2CTr √ d )2 ≥ d L∗n − C\n√ d\nL∗nσ 6 q\n− Ω(1).\nWe proceed with solving the previous inequality for kp,n and obtain\nkp,n ≥ σ2p ( d L∗n − C √ d L∗nσ 6 q − Ω(1) )1/2 − 2CTr √ d 2 .

With probability at least 1− δ,\nL̃n(A) ≤ ∑m j=1 σ 2 j\nn\n( d+ 2 log 3m\nδ\n) +O ( 1\nσ2min\n( d\nnλmin\n)3/2) , (62)\nwhere λmin = σ2min/ ∑ j σ 2 j .\nProof. We define a set of events that help us control the loss, and then we show that these events simultaneously hold with high probability. In particular, we need the following events:\n1. EG ≡ the good event holds (for all arms i, and all times t), which includes a confidence interval for σ̂2i,t and the trace of the empirical covariance matrix.\nHolds with probability 1− δG. This event is described and controlled in Proposition 3 and Proposition 4.\n2. EM,i ≡ the confidence intervals Ci,t created for arm i at time t contain the true βi at all times t —based on the vector-valued martingale in (Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011).\nHolds with probability 1− δM,i. This event is described and controlled in Theorem 13.\n3. EC,i,t ≡ the empirical covariance Σ̂i,t for arm i at time t is close to Σ. This event is a direct consequence of event EG.\n4. EB,i,t ≡ the first t observations pulled at arm i have norm reasonably bounded. The empirical average norm is not too far from its mean. Holds with probability 1− δB,i,t. This event is described and controlled in Corollary 15.\nLet H be the set of all the previous events. Then, by the union bound\nP (∩ ∈H ) ≥ 1− ∑ ∈H δ . (63)\nOur goal is to show that if ∩ ∈H holds, then the loss L̃n(A) = maxi∈[m] ‖βi − β̂i,n‖2Σ is upper bounded by a quantity that resembles the expected loss of the algorithm that knows the σ2i ’s in advance.\nFix δ > 0. We want δ = ∑ ∈H δ , and we would like to assign equal weight to all the sets of events. First, δG = δ/3.\nAlso, ∑ i δM,i = δ/3, implying δM,i = δ/3m for every arm i ∈ [m]. Finally, to bound observation norms, we set∑\ni ∑ t δB,i,t = δ/3. It follows that we can take δB,i,t = δ/3mT , even though t really ranges from d to n.\nAssume that EG, EM,i and EB,i,t hold for all arms i and times t. Then, by Theorem 5, the final number of pulls for arm i can be lower bounded by\nki ≥ σ2i∑ j σ 2 j n− c (√ σ2i σ2min + 1 )√ σ2i∑ j σ 2 j dn+ o (√ dn ) , (64)\nwhere c = 2 ( 1 + √ 2 log(12mn/δ)/d ) .\nFor notational simplicity, we denote by β̂i,t the estimate after t pulls. Thus, with respect to our previous notation where β̂i,n referred to our final estimate, we have that β̂i,ki,n = β̂i,n as ki,n is the total number of pulls for arm i.\nIf the EM,i events hold, then we know that our β̂i,t estimates are not very far from the true values βi when t is large. In particular, we know that the error is controlled by the radius Ri,t of the confidence ellipsoids. We expect these radiuses to decrease with the number of observations per arm, t. As we have a lower bound on the total number of pulls for arm i, ki,n, if the confidence ellipsoids apply, then we can directly obtain an upper bound on the radius Ri,t at the end of the process.\nWe need to do a bit of work to properly bound ‖β̂i,ki,n − βi‖2Σ.\nFix arm i, and assume EM,i holds. In addition, assume ‖βi‖2 ≤ Z for all i. Let V̄i,t = λI +XTi,tXi,t, where Xi,t contains the first t observations pulled by arm i. We modify the proof of Theorem 2 in (Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011) by taking x = (V̂t/t)(β̂t − β∗) in their equation 5 (we are using their notation in the latter expression). Assume the algorithm pulls arm i a total of t times —ki,n is a stopping time with respect to the σ-algebra that includes the environment (other arms)— then, by Theorem 13\n‖β̂i,t − βi‖V̄i,t/t ≤ σi√ t √√√√2 log(det (V̄i,t)1/2 det (λI)−1/2 δM,i ) + √ λ t Z. (65)\nWe would like to upper bound ‖β̂i,ki,n − βi‖Σ by means of ‖β̂i,ki,n − βi‖V̄i,ki,n/ki,n . Note that when t grows, V̄i,t/t→ Σ as the regularization is washed out. The distance between Σ̂i,t = V̄i,t/t− (λ/t)I and Σ is captured by event C,i,t.\nFormally, as EG holds, we know that the difference between Σ and Σ̂i,t is bounded in operator norm for any i and t by\n‖Σ− Σ̂i,t‖ ≤ 2 ( 1 + √ 2\nd log\n2\nδG\n)√ d\nt ‖Σ‖ = c\n√ d\nt λmax(Σ). (66)\nThen, as a consequence, for all x ∈ Rs\nxT (Σ− Σ̂i,t)x ≤ c λmax(Σ) √ d\nt ‖x‖22. (67)\nIn particular, by taking x = β̂i,t − βi,\nc λmax(Σ)\n√ d\nt ‖β̂i,t − βi‖22 ≥ (β̂i,t − βi)T (Σ− Σ̂i,t)(β̂i,t − βi) (68)\n= ‖β̂i,t − βi‖2Σ − ‖β̂i,t − βi‖2Σ̂i,t . (69)\nIn addition, note that ‖x‖2 Σ̂i,t = ‖x‖2 V̄i,t/t − (λ/t)‖x‖22. We conclude that\n‖β̂i,t − βi‖2Σ ≤ ‖β̂i,t − βi‖2Σ̂i,t + c λmax(Σ) √ d t ‖β̂i,t − βi‖22 (70)\n= ‖β̂i,t − βi‖2V̄i,t/t +\n( c λmax(Σ) √ d\nt − λ t\n) ‖β̂i,t − βi‖22. (71)\nOn the other hand, we know that ‖β̂i,t − βi‖2Σ ≥ λmin(Σ)‖β̂i,t − βi‖22.\nTherefore, by (65)\n‖β̂i,t − βi‖2Σ ≤ 1\n1− 1λmin(Σ)\n( c λmax(Σ) √ d t − λ t )‖β̂i,t − βi‖2V̄i,t/t (72)\n≤ 1 1− γt  σi√ t √√√√2 log(det (V̄i,t)1/2 det (λI)−1/2 δM,i ) + √ λZ√ t 2 (73) ≤ 1\n1− γt 1 t\nσi √√√√2(1\n2 log\n( det ( V̄i,t )\ndet (λI)\n) + log ( 1\nδM,i\n)) + √ λZ 2 (74) ≤ 1\n1− γt 1 t\nσi √√√√√2 1 2 t∑ j=1 ‖Xj‖2V̄ −1i,t + log ( 1 δM,i )+√λZ  2 , (75)\nwhere we defined γt = ( c λmax(Σ) √ d t − λ t ) /λmin(Σ), and we used Lemma 11 in (Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011) which\nshows that\nlog\n( det ( V̄i,t )\ndet (λI)\n) ≤\nt∑ j=1 ‖Xj‖2V̄ −1i,t . (76)\nWe would like to approximate the V̄ −1i,t norm, by means of the inverse covariance norm, Σ −1. The whitened equation that is equivalent to (67) — see Lemma 12 — is given by ‖I − ˆ̄Σi,t‖ ≤ , with = c √ d/t.\nIt implies that for any j = 1, . . . , d, 1− c √ d\nt −O\n( d\nt\n) ≤ λj( ˆ̄Σi,t) ≤ 1 + c √ d\nt +O\n( d\nt\n) . (77)\nThe V̄ −1i,t norm can be bounded as follows\n‖x‖2 V̄ −1i,t\n= xT V̄ −1i,t x = x T ( λI + XTi,tXi,t )−1 x (78)\n= xTΣ−1/2Σ1/2 ( λI + XTi,tXi,t )−1 Σ1/2Σ−1/2x (79)\n= x̄T ( λΣ−1 + X̄Ti,tX̄i,t )−1 x̄ (80)\n= 1 t x̄T ( λ t Σ−1 + ˆ̄Σ−1i,t )−1 x̄, (81)\nwhere x̄ denotes the whitened version of x. We can now apply the matrix inversion lemma to see that\n‖x‖2 V̄ −1i,t\n= 1 t x̄T ( λ t Σ−1 + ˆ̄Σ−1i,t )−1 x̄ (82)\n= 1\nt x̄T\n( ˆ̄Σi,t − ˆ̄Σi,tΣ−1/2 ( t\nλ I + Σ−1/2 ˆ̄Σi,tΣ\n−1/2 )−1\nΣ−1/2 ˆ̄Σi,t ) x̄ (83)\n= 1 t x̄T ( ˆ̄Σi,t − ˆ̄Σi,tΣ−1/2R−1Σ−1/2 ˆ̄Σi,t ) x̄, (84)\nwhere we implicitly defined R = (t/λ)I + Σ−1/2 ˆ̄Σi,tΣ−1/2, a positive definite matrix. We upper bound the previous expression to conclude that\n‖x‖2 V̄ −1i,t\n= 1 t x̄T ( ˆ̄Σi,t − ˆ̄Σi,tΣ−1/2R−1Σ−1/2 ˆ̄Σi,t ) x̄ (85)\n≤ 1 t x̄T ˆ̄Σi,tx̄ ≤\nλmax( ˆ̄Σi,t)\nt ‖x̄‖22 ≤\n1 + c √ d/t+O (d/t)\nt ‖x̄‖22.

Given a linear regression problem with observations Y = XTβ + with Gaussian noise with variance σ2, after n contexts X and the corresponding observations Y, the ridge estimate of parameter λ is obtained as\nβ̂λ = (XTX + λI)−1XTY = WXTY,\nwith W = (XTX + λI)−1, and its distribution conditioned on X is β̂λ | X ∼ N ( β − λWβ, σ2 W(XTX)WT ) . (95)\nProof. Recalling the definition of the OLS estimator β̂ (assuming it exists), we can easily rewrite the RLS estimator as\nβ̂λ = (XTX + λI)−1(XTX)(XTX)−1XTY = (XTX + λI)−1(XTX)β̂.\nThis immediately gives that the conditional distribution of β̂λ is Gaussian as for β̂. We just need to compute the corresponding mean vector and the covariance matrix. We first notice that the RLS estimator is biased as\nE[β̂λ ∣∣X] = (XTX + λI)−1(XTX)β.\nLet S = XTX, then we can further rewrite the bias as E[β̂λ ∣∣X] = (S + λSS−1)−1Sβ = (S(I + λS−1))−1Sβ\n= (I + λS−1)−1β = ( I − λ(S + λI)−1 ) β\n= β − λ(S + λI)−1β = β − λWβ,\nwhere we used the matrix inversion lemma.

Then its loss after n steps can be expressed as\nLn(Astat) = max i∈[m]\nTr ( ΣE [ Wi,n ( σ2iX T i,nXi,n + λ 2βiβ T i ) WTi,n ]) , (96)\nwhere Wi,n = (XTi,nXi,n + λI) −1, and Xni is the matrix with the ki,n contexts from instance i.\nProof.

Assume the noise is Gaussian. Let σ̂2 be the estimate for σ2 computed by using the residuals of the OLS solution β̂. Then, β̂λ and σ̂2 are independent random variable conditionally to X.\nProof. As shown in the proof of Proposition 16, we have β̂λ = (XTX + λI)−1(XTX)β̂ and we know that functions of independent random variables are themselves independent. Since the matrix mapping β̂ to β̂λ is fixed given X, and β̂ and σ̂2 are conditionally independent from Lemma 9, then the statement follows.\nWe can now combine Proposition 18 and Lemma 17 to conclude that a similar expression to Eq. 97 holds for the ridge estimators also when a non-static algorithm such as TRACE-UCB is run.\nLemma 19.

      "text" : "High-dimensional linear regression models are remarkably common in practice. Companies tend to record a large number of features of their customers, and feed them to their prediction models. There are also cases in which the number of problem instances under consideration m is large, e.g., too many courses in the MOOC example described in the introduction. Unless the horizon n is still proportionally large w.r.t. md, these scenarios require special attention. In particular, algorithms like TRACE-UCB that adaptively use contexts in their allocation strategy become more robust than their context-free counterparts.\nA natural assumption in such scenarios is sparsity, i.e., only a small subset of features are relevant to the prediction problem at hand (have non-zero coefficient). In our setting of m problem instances, it is often reasonable to assume that these instances are related to each other, and thus, it makes sense to extend the concept of sparsity to joint sparsity, i.e., a sparsity pattern across the instances. Formally, we assume that there exists a s d such that\n|S| ∆= | ∪i∈[m] supp(βi)| = s, (98)\nwhere supp(βi) = {j ∈ [d] : β(j)i 6= 0} denotes the support of the i’th problem instance. A special case of joint sparsity is when |supp(βi)| ≈ s, for all i, i.e., most of the relevant features are shared across the instances.\nIn this section, we focus on the scenario where dm > n. When we can only allocate a small (relative to d) number of contexts to each problem instance, proper balancing of contexts becomes extremely important, and thus, the algorithms that do not take into account context in their allocation are destined to fail. Although TRACE-UCB has the advantage of using context in its allocation strategy, it still needs to quickly discover the relevant features (those in the support) and only use those in its allocation strategy.\nThis motivates a two-stage algorithm, we call it SPARSE-TRACE-UCB, whose pseudocode is in Algorithm 2. In the first stage, the algorithm allocates contexts uniformly to all the instances, L contexts per instance, and then recovers the support. In the second stage, it relies on the discovered support Ŝ, and applies the standard TRACE-UCB to all the instances, but only takes into account the features in Ŝ. Note that L should be large enough that with high probability, support is exactly discovered, i.e., Ŝ = S.\nThere exists a large literature on how to perform simultaneous support discovery in jointly sparse linear regression problems (Negahban & Wainwright, 2011; Obozinski et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013), which we discuss in detail below.\nMost of these algorithms minimize the regularized empirical loss\nmin M∈Rd×m\n1\nk m∑ i=1 ‖Yi −Xi M[, i]‖2 + λ ‖M‖,\nwhere k is the number of samples per problem, M be the matrix whose i’th column is M[, i] = β̂i, Xi ∈ Rk×d, and Yi = Xiβi + i. In particular, they use la/lb block regularization norm, i.e., ‖M‖la/lb = ‖v‖la , where vi = ‖M[i, ]‖lb and M[i, ] is the i’th row of M. In short, the SPARSE-TRACE-UCB algorithm uses the l1/l2 block regularization Lasso algorithm (Wang et al., 2013), an extension of the algorithm in (Obozinski et al., 2011), for its support discovery stage.\nWe extend the guarantees of Theorem 7 to the high dimensional case with joint sparsity, assuming s is known.\nThe following is the main result of this section: Theorem 20. Let δ1 > 0. Assume ‖βi‖2 ≤ Z for all i, for some Z > 0, and assume the parameters (n, d, s, βi,Σ) satisfy conditions C1 to C5 in (Wang et al., 2013). Let ψ be the sparsity overlap function defined in (Obozinski et al., 2011). If L > 2(1 + v) ψ log(d− s)ρu(Σ(1:m)SCSC |S)/γ\n2 for some constant v > 0, and n−Lm ≥ (s+ 1)m, then, with probability at least 1− δ1 − δ2,\nL̃n(A) ≤ ∑ j σ 2 j\nn− Lm\n( s+ 2 log 3m\nδ1\n) +\n2c√ σ2min\n( s ∑ j σ 2 j\nn− Lm\n)3/2 + o (z) , (99)\nwhere c ≤ 2 ( 1 + √ 2 log(12mn/δ1)/s ) and we defined δ2 = m exp(−c0 log s) + exp(−c1 log(d − s)) for positive\nconstants c0, c1 > 0, and z = (s/(n− Lm))3/2.\nThe exact technical assumptions and the proof are given and discussed in below. We simply combine the high-probability results of Theorem 7, and the high-probability support recovery of Theorem 2 in (Wang et al., 2013).\nIn addition, we provide Corollary 21, where we study the regime of interest where the support overlap is complete (for simplicity), n = C1 ms log d md for C1 > 0, and L = C2 s log d, for C1 − C2 > 0. Corollary 21. Under the assumptions of Theorem 20, let δ1 > 0, assume n = C1 ms log d, the support of all arms are equal, and set L = C2 s log d, for C̄ := C1 − C2 > 0. Then, with probability at least 1− δ1 − δ2,\nL̃n(A) ≤ ∑ j σ 2 j\nC̄ms log d\n( s+ 2 log 3m\nδ1\n) +\n2c√ σ2min\n( ∑ j σ 2 j\nC̄m log d\n)3/2 + o (z) (100)\nwhere c ≤ 2 ( 1 + √ 2 log(12mn/δ1)/s ) and we defined δ2 = m exp(−c0 log s) + exp(−c1 log(d − s)) for constants\nc0, c1 > 0, and z = ( C̄m log d )−3/2 .\nAlgorithm 2 contains the pseudocode of our Sparse-TRACE-UCB algorithm.\nAlgorithm 2 Sparse-TRACE-UCB Algorithm. 1: for i = 1, . . . ,m do 2: Select problem instance i exactly L times 3: end for 4: Run l1/l2 Lasso to recover support S̄ = ∪i supp(β̂i,L) 5: for i = 1, . . . ,m do 6: Select problem instance i exactly s+ 1 times 7: Compute its OLS estimates β̂i,m(L+s+1) and σ̂2i,m(L+s+1) with respect to dimensions in S̄. 8: end for 9: for steps t = m(L+ s+ 1) + 1, . . . , n do 10: for problem instance 1 ≤ i ≤ m do 11: Compute score based on S̄ dimensions only:\nsi,t−1 = σ̂2i,t−1 + ∆i,t−1 ki,t−1 Tr ( ΣΣ̂−1i,t−1 ) 12: end for 13: Select problem instance It = arg maxi∈[m] si,t 14: Observe Xt and YIt,t 15: Update OLS estimators β̂It,t and σ̂ 2 It,t\nbased on S̄ 16: end for 17: Return RLS estimates {β̂λi }mi=1, with β̂λij = 0 if j /∈ S̄\nGiven our pure exploration perspective, it is obviously more efficient to learn the true supports as soon as possible. That way we can adjust our behavior by collecting the right data based on our initial findings. Note that this is not always the case; for example, if the total number of pulls is unknown. Then it is not clear what is the right amount of budget to invest upfront to recover the supports (see tracking algorithms and doubling trick).\nWe briefly describe Algorithm 2 in words. First, in the recovery stage we sequentially pull all arms a number of times, say L times. We do not take into account the context, and just apply a round robin technique to pull each arm exactly L times. In total, there are exactly s components that are non-zero for at least one arm (out of d). After the Lm pulls, we use a block-regularized Lasso algorithm to recover the joint sparsity pattern. We discuss some of the alternatives later. The outcome of this stage is a common support Ŝ := ∪i supp(β̂i). With high probability we recover the true support Ŝ = S. In the second stage, or pure exploration stage, the original TRACE-UCB algorithm is applied. The TRACE-UCB algorithm works by computing an estimate σ̂2i at each step t for each arm i. Then, it pulls the arm maximizing the score\nsi,t−1 = σ̂2i,t−1 + ∆i,t−1 ki,t−1 Tr ( ΣΣ̂−1i,t−1 ) .\nThe key observation is that in the second stage we only consider the components of each context that are in Ŝ. In particular, we start by pulling s+ 1 times each arm so that we can compute the initial OLS estimates β̂OLSi and σ̂ 2 i . We keep updating those estimates when an arm is pulled, and the trace is computed with respect to the components in Ŝ only.\nFinally, we return the Ridge estimates based only on the data collected in the second stage."

Note in this case we can actually set λi as a function of σ2i as required in most Lasso analyses, because σ 2 i is known.\nA common guarantee is as follows (see (Hastie et al., 2015; Raskutti et al., 2010)).

      "text" : "There has been a large amount of research on how to perform simultaneous support recovery in sparse settings for multiple regressions. Let M be the matrix whose i-th column is M(i) = βi.\nA common objective function after k observations per problem is\nmin M̄∈Rd×m\n1\nk m∑ j=1 ‖Yj −XjM̄(j)‖2 + λ ‖M̄‖, (103)\nwhere we assumed Yj = Xjβj + j , and Xj ∈ Rk×d,Yj , j ∈ Rk and βj ∈ Rd.\nThe la/lb block regularization norm is\n‖M̄‖la/lb = ‖v‖a, where vj = ‖M̄j‖b M̄j is the j-th row of M̄. (104)\nThere are a few differences among the most popular pieces of work.\nNegahban and Wainwright (Negahban & Wainwright, 2011) consider random Gaussian designs Xj ∼ N (0,Σj) with random Gaussian noise (and common variance). The regularization norm is l1/l∞. In words, they take the sum of the absolute values of the maximum element per row in M̄. This forces sparsity (via the l1 norm), but once a row is selected there is no penalty in increasing the β̄ components up to the current maximum of the row. They tune λ as in the standard analysis of Lasso, that is, proportionally to σ2, which is unknown in our case. Results are non-asymptotic, and recovery happens with high probability when the number of observations is k > Cs(m+log d). They show that if the overlap is not large enough (2/3 of the support, for m = 2 regression problems), then running independent Lasso estimates has higher statistical efficiency. We can actually directly use the results in (Negahban & Wainwright, 2011) if we assume an upper bound σ2max ≤ R is known.\nObozinski, Wainwright and Jordan (Obozinski et al., 2011) use l1/l2 block regularization (aka Multivariate Group Lasso). Their design is random Gaussian, but it is fixed across regressions: Xj = X. They provide asymptotic guarantees under the scaling k, d, s→∞, d− s→∞, and standard assumptions like bounded Σ-eigenspectrum, the irrepresentable condition, and self-incoherence. The first condition is not only required for support recovery, but also for l2 consistency. The last two conditions are not required for risk consistency, while essential for support recovery. To capture the amount of non-zero pattern overlap among regressions, they define the sparsity overlap function ψ, and their sample requirements are a function of ψ. In particular, one needs k > C ψ log(d − s), where the constant C depends on quantities related to the covariance matrix of the design matrices, and ψ can be equal to s/m, if all the patterns overlap, and at most s if they are disjoint.\nTheir theorems use a sequence of regularization parameters\nλk =\n√ f(d) log d\nk , where f(d)→∞ as d→∞,\nin such a way that λk → 0 as k, d → ∞. Finally, k > 2s is also required. They also provide a two-stage algorithm for efficient estimation of individual supports for each regression problem. All these optimization problems are convex, and can be efficiently solved in general.\nTo overcome the issue of common designs (we do not pull each context several times), we use the results by Wang, Liang, and Xing in (Wang et al., 2013). They extend the guarantees in (Obozinski et al., 2011) to the case where the design matrices are independently sampled for each regression problem. In order to formally present their result, we describe some assumptions. Let Σ(i) be the covariance matrix for the design observations of the i-th regression (in our case, they are all equal to Σ), and S the union of the sparse supports across regressions.\n• C1 There exists γ ∈ (0, 1] such that ‖|A‖|∞ ≤ 1− γ, where\nAjs = max 1≤i≤m ∣∣∣∣ (Σ(i)SCS (Σ(i)SS)−1) js ∣∣∣∣, (105) for j ∈ SC and s ∈ S.\n• C2 There are constants 0 < Cmin ≤ Cmax <∞, such that the eigenvalues of all matrices Σ(i) are in [Cmin, Cmax].\n• C3 There exists a constant Dmax <∞ such that\nmax 1≤i≤m\n|‖ (\nΣ (i) SS )−1 ‖|∞ ≤ Dmax. (106)\n• C4 Define the regularization parameter\nλk =\n√ f(d) log d\nk , where f(d)→∞ as d→∞, (107)\nsuch that λk → 0 as k →∞.\n• C5 Define ρ(k, s, λk) as\nρ(k, s, λk) :=\n√ 8σ2maxs log s\nk Cmin + λk\n( Dmax + 12s\nCmin √ k\n) , (108)\nand assume ρ(k, s, λk)/b∗min = o(1), where b ∗ min = minj∈S ‖Mj‖2.\nWe state the main theorem in (Wang et al., 2013); k is the number of observations per regression.\nTheorem 22. Assume the parameters (k, d, s,M,Σ(1:m)) satisfy conditions C1 to C5. If for some small constant v > 0,\nk > 2(1 + v) ψ log(d− s) ρu(Σ\n(1:m) SCSC |S) γ2 , (109)\nthen the l1/l2 regularized problem given in (103) has a unique solution M̂, the support union supp(M̂) equals the true support S, and ‖M̂−M‖l∞/l2 = o(b∗min), with probability greater than\n1−m exp(−c0 log s)− exp(−c1 log(d− s)), (110)\nwhere c0 and c1 are constants.\nThe following proposition is also derived in (Wang et al., 2013) (Proposition 1): Proposition 23. Assume Σ(1:m) satisfy C2, then ψ is bounded by\ns\nm Cmin ≤ ψ = ψ\n( M,Σ(1:m) ) ≤ s Cmin . (111)\nFor our purposes, there is a single Σ, which implies that we can remove the max expressions in C1 and C3. Corollary 2 in (Wang et al., 2013) establishes that when supports are equal for all arms, the number of samples required per arm is reduced by a factor of m."

Theorem. Let δ1 > 0. Assume ‖βi‖2 ≤ Z for all i, for some Z > 0, and assume the parameters (n, d, s, βi,Σ) satisfy conditions C1 to C5 in (Wang et al., 2013).

We start by assuming the recovered support Ŝ is equal to the true support S. This event, say ES , holds with probability at least 1− δ2 by Theorem 22 when L satisfies (112).\nThen, we fix δ1 > 0, and run the second stage applying the Trace-UCB algorithm in the s-dimensional space given by the components in Ŝ.\nBy Theorem 7, if n− Lm ≥ (s+ 1)m, then, with probability at least 1− δ1, the following holds:\nL̃n(A)S ≤ ∑ j σ 2 j\nn− Lm\n( s+ 2 log 3m\nδ1\n) +\n2c√ σ2min\n( s ∑ j σ 2 j\nn− Lm\n)3/2 + o (( s\nn− Lm\n)3/2) , (114)\nwhere L̃n(A)S denotes the loss restricted to the components in β that are in Ŝ (and ΣS). However, under event ES , we recovered the true support, and our final estimates for βij for each j 6∈ S and arm iwill be equal to zero, which corresponds to their true value. Hence L̃n(A) = L̃n(A)S .\nWe conclude that (114) holds with probability at least 1− δ1 − δ2.\nOne regime of interest is when n = C1 ms log d md. In addition, let us assume complete support overlap across arms, so ψ = s/Cm. Then, we set the number of initial pulls per arm to be L = C2 s log d, with C1 > C2.\nIn this case, we have that Corollary 21 holds."

    "abstractText" : "We explore the sequential decision-making problem where the goal is to estimate a number of linear models uniformly well, given a shared budget of random contexts independently sampled from a known distribution. For each incoming context, the decision-maker selects one of the linear models and receives an observation that is corrupted by the unknown noise level of that model. We present Trace-UCB, an adaptive allocation algorithm that learns the models’ noise levels while balancing contexts accordingly across them, and prove bounds for its simple regret in both expectation and high-probability. We extend the algorithm and its bounds to the high dimensional setting, where the number of linear models times the dimension of the contexts is more than the total budget of samples. Simulations with real data suggest that Trace-UCB is remarkably robust, outperforming a number of baselines even when its assumptions are violated.",
