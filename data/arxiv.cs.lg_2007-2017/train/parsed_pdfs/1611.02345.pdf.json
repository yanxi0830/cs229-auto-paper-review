The key technical tool is the neural Taylor approximation – a straightforward application of Taylor expansions to neural networks – and the associated Taylor loss. Experiments on a range of optimizers, layers, and tasks provide evidence that the analysis accurately captures the dynamics of neural optimization.\nThe second half of the paper applies the Taylor approximation to isolate the main difficulty in training rectifier nets: that gradients are shattered.

      "text" : "Deep learning has achieved impressive performance on a range of tasks (LeCun et al., 2015). The workhorse underlying deep learning is gradient descent or backprop. Gradient descent has convergence guarantees in settings that are smooth, convex or both. However, modern convnets are neither smooth nor convex. Every winner of the ImageNet classification challenge since 2012 has used rectifiers which are not smooth (Krizhevsky et al., 2012; Zeiler\n1Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand 2Disney Research, Zürich, Switzerland. Correspondence to: David Balduzzi <dbalduzzi@gmail.com>.\nFig. 1: Shattered gradients in a PL-function.\n& Fergus, 2014; Simonyan & Zisserman, 2015; Szegedy et al., 2015; He et al., 2015). Even in convex settings, convergence for nonsmooth functions is lower-bounded by 1/ √ N (Bubeck, 2015).\nThe paper’s main contribution is the first convergence result for modern convnets, Theorem 2. The idea is simple: backprop constructs linear snapshots (gradients) of a neural net’s landscape; section 2 introduces neural Taylor approximations which are used to construct Taylor losses as convex snapshots closely related to backprop. We then use the online convex optimization framework (Zinkevich, 2003) to show 1/ √ N convergence to the Taylor optimum, matching the lower bound in (Bubeck, 2015). Section 2.4 investigates the Taylor optimum and regret terms empirically. We observe that convergence to the Taylor optimum occurs at 1/ √ N in practice. The theorem applies to any neural net with a loss convex in the output of the net (for example, the cross-entropy loss is convex in the output but not the parameters of a neural net).\nThe nonsmoothness of rectifier nets is perhaps underappreciated. Fig. 1 shows a piecewise-linear (PL) function and its gradient. The gradient is discontinuous or shattered. Shattering is problematic for accelerated and Hessian-based methods which speed up convergence by exploiting the relationship between gradients at nearby points (Sutskever et al., 2013). The success of these methods on rectifier networks requires explanation since gradients at (nearby) points on different sides of a kink are not related. Further, the number of kinks grows exponentially with network depth (Pascanu et al., 2014; Telgarsky, 2016).\nSection 3 addresses the success of adaptive optimizers\nar X\niv :1\n61 1.\n02 34\n5v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n4 Fe\nb 20\n17\nin rectifier nets.1 Adaptive optimizers normalize gradients by their root-mean-square; e.g. AdaGrad, RMSProp, Adam and RadaGrad (Duchi et al., 2011; Hinton et al., 2012; Kingma & Ba, 2015; Krummenacher et al., 2016). Dauphin et al. (2015) argue that RMSProp is successful because it approximates the equilibriation matrix√\ndiag(H2) which approximates the absolute Hessian |H| (Dauphin et al., 2014). However, the argument is at best part of the story when gradients are shattered.\nThe only way an optimizer can estimate gradients of a shattered function is to compute them directly. Effective optimizers must therefore explore the space of smooth regions – the bound in theorem 2 is only as good as the optimum over the Taylor losses encountered during backprop. Observations 1 and 2 relate smooth regions in rectifier nets and the Taylor losses to configurations of active neurons. We hypothesize that root-mean-square normalization increases exploration through the set of smooth regions in a rectifier net’s landscape. Experiments in section 3.3 confirm the hypothesis."

      "text" : "Researchers have applied convex techniques to neural networks. Bengio et al. (2006) show that choosing the number of hidden units converts neural optimization into a convex problem, see also Bach (2014). A convex multi-layer architectures are developed in Aslan et al. (2014); Zhang et al. (2016). However, these approaches have not achieved the practical success of convnets. In this work, we analyze convnets as they are rather than proposing a more tractable, but potentially less useful, model. A Taylor decomposition for neural networks was proposed in Montavon et al. (2015). They treat inputs as variable instead of weights and study interpretability instead of convergence.\nOur results are closely related to Balduzzi (2016), which uses game-theoretic techniques to prove convergence in rectifier nets. The approach taken here is more direct and holds in greater generality."

      "text" : "Before presenting the main result, we highlight some issues that arise when studying convergence in rectifier nets. Many optimization methods have guarantees that hold in convex or smooth settings. However, none of the guarantees extend to rectifier nets. For example, the literature provides no rigorous account of when or why Adam\n1For simplicity, we restrict to fully connected rectifier (ReLU) nets. The results also apply to convolutions, max-pooling, dropout, dropconnect, maxout, PReLUs and CReLUs (Srivastava et al., 2014; Wan et al., 2013; Goodfellow et al., 2013; He et al., 2015; Shang et al., 2016).\nor Adagrad converges faster on rectifier nets than vanilla gradient descent. Instead, we currently have only intuition, empirics and an analogy with convex or smooth settings.\nGradient-based optimization on neural nets can converge on local optima that are substantially worse than the global optimum. Fortunately, “bad” local optima are rare in practice. A partial explanation for the prevalence of “good enough” local optima is Choromanska et al. (2015). Nevertheless, it is important to acknowledge that neural nets can and do converge to bad local optima. It is therefore impossible to prove (non-stochastic) bounds relative to the global optimum. Such a result may be provable under further assumptions. However, since the result would contradict empirical evidence, the assumptions would necessarily be unrealistic."

      "text" : "The landscape of a rectifier net decomposes into smooth regions separated by kinks (Pascanu et al., 2014; Telgarsky, 2016), see figure 2. Gradients on different sides of a kink are unrelated since the derivative is discontinuous. Gradient-based optimizers cannot “peer around” the kinks in rectifier nets.\nGradient-based optimization on rectifier nets thus factorizes conceptually into two components. The first is steepest descent in a smooth region; the second moves between smooth regions. The first component is vanilla optimization whereas the second involves an element of exploration: what the optimizer encounters when it crosses a kink cannot be predicted.\nThe convergence guarantee in theorem 2 takes both components of the factorization into account in different ways. It is formulated in the adversarial setting of online convex optimization. Intuitively, the adversary is the nonsmooth geometry of the landscape, which generates what may-aswell-be a new loss whenever backprop enters a different smooth region.\nBackprop searches a vast nonconvex landscape with a linear flashlight (the Taylor losses are a more sharply focused convex flashlight, see A4). The adversary is the landscape: from backprop’s perspective its geometry – especially across kinks – is an unpredictable external force.\nThe Taylor losses are a series of convex problems that backprop de facto optimizes – the gradients of the actual and Taylor losses are identical. The Taylor optimum improves when, stepping over a kink, backprop shines its light on a new (better) region of the landscape (fig. 2). Regret quantifies the gap between the Taylor optimal loss and the losses incurred during training."

The expression on the right factorizes the backpropagated error δl = JEL ·JLl into the gradient of the loss JEL and the Jacobian JLl between layers, which describes gradient flow within the network.\nThe first-order Taylor approximation to a differentiable function f : R→ R near a is Ta(x) = f(a)+f ′(a)·(x−a). The neural Taylor approximation for a fully connected network is as follows.\nDefinition 1. The Jacobian tensor of layer l, Gl := JLl ⊗ xl−1, is the gradient of the output of the neural network with respect to the weights of layer l. It is the outer product of a (pL × pl)-matrix with a pl−1-vector, and so is a (pL, pl, pl−1)-tensor.\nGiven Gl and (pl × pl−1)-matrix V, the expression 〈Gl,V〉 := JLl · V · xl−1 is the pL-vector computed via matrix-matrix-vector multiplication. The neural Taylor approximation to f in a neighborhood of Wn, given input xn0 , is the first-order Taylor expansion\nTn(V) := fWn(x n 0 ) +\nL∑\nl=1\n〈 Gl,Vl −Wnl 〉 ≈ fV(xn0 ).\nFinally, the Taylor loss of the network on round n is T n(V) = `(Tn(V), yn).\nThe Taylor approximation to layer l is\nTnl (Vl) := fWn(x n 0 ) + 〈 Gl,Vl −Wnl 〉 .\n2Note: we suppress the dependence of the Jacobians on the round n to simplify notation.\nWe can also construct the Taylor approximation to neuron α in layer l. Let the pL-vector JLα := J L l [ :, α] denote the Jacobian with respect to neuron α and let the (pL × pl−1)matrix Gα := JLα ⊗ xl−1 denote the Jacobian with respect to the weights of neuron α. The Taylor approximation to neuron α is\nTnα(Vα) := fWn(x n 0 ) + 〈 Gα,Vα −Wnα 〉 .\nThe Taylor losses are the simplest non-trivial (i.e. nonaffine) convex functions encoding the information generated by backprop, see section A4.\nThe following theorem provides convergence guarantees at mutiple spatial scales: network-wise, layer-wise and neuronal. See sections A2 for a proof of the theorem. It is not currently clear which scale provides the tightest bound.\nTheorem 2 (no-regret relative to Taylor optimum). Suppose, as in Theorem 1, the Taylor losses have bounded gradients and the weights of the neural network have bounded diameter during training.\nSuppose the neural net is optimized by an algorithm with Regret(N) ≤ O( √ N) such as gradient descent, AdaGrad, Adam or mirror descent.\n• Network guarantee: The running average of the training error of the neural network satisfies\n1\nN\nN∑\nn=1\n` (fWn(x n 0 ), y n)\n︸ ︷︷ ︸ running average of training errors\n≤ min V\n{ 1\nN\nN∑\nn=1\nT n(V) }\n︸ ︷︷ ︸ Taylor optimum\n(3)\n+ O ( 1√ N )\n︸ ︷︷ ︸ Regret(N)/N\n.\n• Layer-wise / Neuron-wise guarantee: The Taylor loss of [layer-l / neuron-α] is T nl/α(Vl/α) := `(Tnl/α(Vl/α), yn).

The global optima of neural nets are not computationally accessible. Theorem 2 sidesteps the problem by providing a guarantee relative to the Taylor optimum. The bound is path-dependent; it depends on the convex snapshots encountered during backprop.\nPath-dependency is a feature not a bug. It is a simple matter to construct a deep fully connected network (> 100 layers) that fails to learn because gradients do not propagate through the network (He et al., 2016). A convergence theorem for neural nets must also be applicable in pathological cases. Theorem 2 still holds because the failure of gradients to propagate through the network results in Taylor losses with poor solutions.\nAlthough the bound in theorem 2 is path-dependent, it is nevertheless meaningful. The right-hand-side is given by the Taylor optimum, which is the optimal solution to the best convex approximations to the actual losses; best in the sense that they have the same value and have the same gradient for the encountered weights. The theorem replaces a seemingly intractable problem – neither smooth nor convex – with a sequence of convex problems.\nEmpirically, see below, we find that the Taylor optimum is a tough target on a range of datasets and settings: MNIST and CIFAR10; supervised and unsupervised learning; convolutional and fully-connected architectures; under a variety of optimizers (Adam, SGD, RMSProp), and for individual neurons as well as entire layers.\nFinally, see section 3, the conceptual factorization into vanilla optimization and exploration components suggests to investigate the exploratory behavior of different optimizers – with the theorem providing concrete tools to do so."

Three convolutional layers with stack size 64 and 5×5 receptive fields, ReLU nonlinearities and 2 × 2 max-pooling. Followed by a 192 unit fully-connected layer with ReLU before a ten-dimensional fully-connected output layer. Trained with cross-entropy loss using minibatches of 128.\nFor both tasks we compare the optimization performance of\nAdam, RMSProp and SGD (figure 6). Learning rates were tuned for optimal performance. Additional parameters for Adam and RMSProp were left at default. For the convnet all three methods perform equally well: achieving a small loss and an accuracy of ≥ 99% on the training set. However, SGD exhibits slightly more variance. For the autoencoder, although it is an extremely simple model, SGD with the best (fixed) learning rate performs significantly worse than the adaptive optimizers.\nThe neuronal and layer-wise regret are evaluated for each model. At every iteration we record the training error – the left-hand-side of eq. (4). To evaluate the Taylor loss, we record the input to the neuron/layer, it’s weights, the output of the network and the gradient tensor Gl. After training, we minimize the Taylor loss with respect to V to find the Taylor optimum at each round. The regret is the difference between the observed training loss and the optimal Taylor loss.\nThe figures show cumulative losses and regret. For illustrative purposes we normalize by 1/ √ N : quantities growing\nat √ N therefore flatten out. Figure 3(a) compares the average regret incurred by neurons in each convolutional layer of the convnet. Shaded regions show one standard deviation. Dashed lines are the regret of individual neurons – importantly the regret behaviour of neurons holds both on average and individually. Figs 3(b) and 3(c) show the regret, cumulative loss incurred by the network, the average loss incurred and the Taylor optimal loss for neurons in layers 1 and 2 respectively.\nFig. 4 compares Adam, RMSProp and SGD. Figure 4(a) shows the layer-wise regret on the convnet. The regret of all of the optimizers scales as √ N for both models, matching the bound in Theorem 2. The additional variance exhibited by SGD explains the difference in regret magnitude. Similar behaviour was observed in the other layers of the\nnetworks and also for convnets trained on MNIST.\nFigure 4(b) shows the same plot for the autoencoder. The regret of all methods scales as √ N (this also holds for the other layers in the network). The gap in performance can be further explained by examining the difference between the observed loss and Taylor optimal loss. Figure 4(c) compares these quantities for each method on the autoencoder. The adaptive optimizers incur lower losses than SGD. Further, the gap between the actually incurred and optimal loss is smaller for adaptive optimizers. This is possibly because adaptive optimizers find better activation configurations of the network, see discussion in section 3.\nRemarkably, figures 3 and 4 confirm that regret scales as√ N for a variety of optimizers, datasets, models, neurons and layers – verifying the multi-scale guarantee of Theorem 2. A possible explanation for why optimizers match the worst-case (1/ √ N ) regret is that the adversary (that is, the landscape) keeps revealing Taylor losses with better solutions. The optimizer struggles to keep up with the hindsight optimum on the constantly changing Taylor losses."

We propose an alternate explanation for the performance of adaptive optimizers in nonconvex nonsmooth settings. Let ∇` := 1D ∑D d=1∇ `d denote the average gradient over a dataset. RProp replaces the average gradient with its coordinatewise sign (Riedmiller & Braun, 1993).

Viewing the signed-gradient as changing weights – or exploring – maximally suggests the following hypothesis:\nHypothesis 1 (RMS-normalization encourages exploration over activation configurations).

We hypothesize that RMSProp finds a better optimum through more extensive exploration through the space of activation configurations. CIFAR is an easier problem and possibly requires less exploration.\nAdam performs targeted exploration. Adam achieves the best performance on the autoencoder. Surprisingly, it explores substantially less than RMSProp according to the Hamming distance and activation-switches, although still more than SGD.

It is also shown, section 3.5, that\nmin 1≤n≤N\n`(wn)− `(w∗) ≥ Ω (\n1√ N\n)\nwhere the weights are in the span of the previously observed gradients: wn ∈ span{∇ `(w1), . . . ,∇ `(wn−1)} for all n ∈ {1, . . . , N}. The gradient of a convex function increases monotonically. That is 〈\n∇ `(w)−∇ `(v),w − v 〉 ≥ 0\nfor all points w,v where the gradient exists. Gradients at one point of a nonsmooth convex function therefore do contain information about other points, although not as much information as in the smooth case. In contrast, the gradients of nonsmooth nonconvex functions can vary wildly as shown in Fig. 1.\nSmooth convex functions. In the smooth setting, gradient descent converges at rate 1N . The lower bound for convergence is even better, 1N2 . The lower bound is achieved by Nesterov’s accelerated gradient descent method."

      "text" : "Proof. We prove the network case; the others are similar. The Taylor loss has three key properties by construction:\nT1. The Taylor loss T n coincides with the loss at Wn: `(fWn(x n 0 ), y\nn) = T n(V)|V=Wn T2. The Taylor loss gradient T n coincides with the\nloss gradient at Wn:\n∇W `(fWn(xn0 ), yn) = ∇V T n(V)|V=Wn T3. The Taylor losses are convex functions of V be-\ncause `(f , y) is convex in its first argument and convexity is invariant under affine maps. If ` is a convex function, then so is g(x) = `(Ax + b), where A ∈ Rm×n and b ∈ Rm.\nBy T1, the training loss, i.e. the left-hand side of (3), exactly coincides with the Taylor losses. By T2, the gradients of the Taylor losses exactly coincide with the errors computed by backpropagation on the training losses. That is, the training loss over n rounds is indistinguishable from the Taylor losses to the first order:\nlosses: 1\nN\nN∑\nn=1\n` (fWn(x n 0 ), y n)\n= 1\nN\nN∑\nn=1\nT n (Wn)\ngradients: ∇W ( 1\nN\nN∑\nn=1\n` (fWn(x n 0 ), y n)\n)\n= ∇W ( 1\nN\nN∑\nn=1\nT n (Wn) )\nWe can therefore substitute the Taylor losses in place of the training loss (fW(x0), y) without altering either the losses incurred during training or the dynamics of backpropagation (or any first-order method).\nSince the Taylor losses are convex, the bound holds for any no-regret optimizer following Zinkevich (2003)."

Kinks in ˆ̀(W) = 1 D ∑D d=1 ` ( fW(x d), yd )\ncan therefore only arise when a rectifier changes its activation for at least one element of the training data.\nProof of observation 2. Note that the rectifier is ρ(a) = max(0, a) with derivative ρ′(a) = 1 if a > 0 and ρ′(a) = 0 if a < 0.\nProof. Recall that the Taylor approximation to layer l is\nTnl (Vl) := fWn(x n 0 ) + 〈 Gl,Vl −Wnl 〉\n= fWn(x n 0 ) + J L l · (Vl −Wnl ) · xnl−1\n= fWn(x n 0 ) +\n( l+1∏\nk=L\nJkk−1 ) · (Vl −Wnl ) · xnl−1\nThe Jacobian of layer k is the function Jk+1k (ak) = Wk+1· diag ( s′(ak) ) which in general varies nonlinearly with ak. The Taylor approximation clamps the Jacobian by setting it as constant.\nFor a layer of rectifiers, s(·) = ρ(·), the Jacobian Jk+1k = Wk+1 · diag ( ρ′(ak) ) is constructed by zeroing out the rows of Wk+1 corresponding to inactive neurons in layer k. It follows that the Taylor loss can be written as\nTnl (Vl) =\n( l+1∏\nk=L\nWnk · diag(1k−1) ) ·(Vl−Wnl )·xnl−1\nFinally, observe that\nxnl−1 =\n( 1∏\nk=l−1 diag(1k) ·Wnk\n) · xn0\nsince diag(1k) ·Wnk ·xnk−1 = diag ( ρ′(ak) ) ·Wnkxnk−1 = ρ(Wnk · xnk−1).\nProof of observation 3.\nProof.

Nevertheless, methods from convex optimization such as gradient descent and Adam are widely used as building blocks for deep learning algorithms. This paper provides the first convergence guarantee applicable to modern convnets. The guarantee matches a lower bound for convex nonsmooth functions. The key technical tool is the neural Taylor approximation – a straightforward application of Taylor expansions to neural networks – and the associated Taylor loss. Experiments on a range of optimizers, layers, and tasks provide evidence that the analysis accurately captures the dynamics of neural optimization. The second half of the paper applies the Taylor approximation to isolate the main difficulty in training rectifier nets: that gradients are shattered. We investigate the hypothesis that, by exploring the space of activation configurations more thoroughly, adaptive optimizers such as RMSProp and Adam are able to converge to better solutions.",
