      "text" : "Partial monitoring can be cast as a sequential game played by a learner and an opponent. In every time step, the learner chooses an action and simultaneously the opponent chooses an outcome. Then, based on the action and the outcome, the learner suffers some loss and receives some feedback. Neither the outcome nor the loss are revealed to the learner. Thus, a partialmonitoring game with N actions and M outcomes is defined with the pair G = (L,H), where L ∈ RN×M is the loss matrix, and H ∈ ΣN×M is the feedback matrix over some arbitrary set of symbols Σ. These matrices are announced to both the learner and the opponent before the game starts. At time step t, if It ∈ N = {1, 2, . . . , N} and Jt ∈ M = {1, 2, . . . ,M} denote the (possibly random) choices of the learner and the opponent, respectively then, the loss suffered by the learner in that time step is L[It, Jt], while the\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nfeedback received is H[It, Jt].\nThe goal of the learner (or player) is to minimize his cumulative loss ∑T t=1 L[It, Jt]. The performance of the learner is measured in terms of the regret, defined as the excess cumulative loss he suffers compared to that of the best fixed action in hindsight:\nRT = T∑ t=1 L[It, Jt]−min i∈N T∑ t=1 L[i, Jt] .\nThe regret usually grows with the time horizon T . What distinguishes between a “successful” and an “unsuccessful” learner is the growth rate of the regret. A regret linear in T means that the learner does not approach the performance of the optimal action. On the other hand, if the growth rate is sublinear, it is said that the learner can learn the game.\nIn this paper we restrict our attention to stochastic games, adding the extra assumption that the opponent generates the outcomes with a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables. This distribution will be called the opponent strategy. As for the player, a player strategy (or algorithm) is a (possibly random) function from the set of feedback sequences (observation histories) to the set of actions.\nIn stochastic games, we use a slightly different notion of regret: we compare the cumulative loss with that of the action with the lowest expected loss.\nRT = T∑ t=1 L[It, Jt]− T min i∈N E[L[i, J1]] .\nThe “hardness” of a game is defined in terms of the minimax expected regret (or minimax regret for short):\nRT (G) = min A max p∈∆M\nE[RT ] ,\nwhere ∆M is the space of opponent strategies, and A is any strategy of the player. In other words, the\nminimax regret is the worst-case expected regret of the best algorithm.\nA question of major importance is how the minimax regret scales with the parameters of the game, such as the time horizon T , the number of actions N , the number of outcomes M . In the stochastic setting, another measure of “hardness” is worth studying, namely the individual or problem-dependent regret, defined as the expected regret given a fixed opponent strategy."

      "text" : "Two special cases of partial monitoring have been extensively studied for a long time: full-information games, where the feedback carries enough information for the learner to infer the outcome for any action-outcome pair, and bandit games, where the learner receives the loss of the chosen action as feedback. Since Vovk (1990) and Littlestone & Warmuth (1994) we know that for full-information games, the minimax regret scales as Θ( √ T logN). For bandit games, the minimax regret has been proven to scale as Θ( √ NT ) (Audibert & Bubeck, 2009).1 The individual regret of these kind of games has also been studied: Auer et al. (2002) showed that given any opponent strategy, the expected regret can be upper bounded by c ∑ i∈N :δi 6=0 1 δi\nlog T , where δi is the expected difference between the loss of action i and an optimal action.\nFinite partial monitoring problems were introduced by Piccolboni & Schindelhauer (2001). They proved that a game is either “hopeless” (that is, its minimax regret scales linearly with T ), or the regret can be upper bounded by O(T 3/4). They also give a characterization of hopeless games. Namely, a game is hopeless if it does not satisfy the global observability condition (see Definition 5 in Section 2). Their upper bound for non-hopeless games was tightened to O(T 2/3) by Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2006), who also showed that there exists a game with a matching lower bound.\nCesa-Bianchi et al. (2006) posted the problem of characterizing partial-monitoring games with minimax regret less than Θ(T 2/3). This problem has been solved since then. The first steps towards classifying partialmonitoring games were made by Bartók et al. (2010), who characterized almost all games with two outcomes. They proved that there are only four categories: games with minimax regret 0, Θ̃( √ T ), Θ(T 2/3), and Θ(T ), and named them trivial, easy, hard, and hopeless, re-\n1The Exp3 algorithm due to Auer et al. (2003) achieves almost the same regret, with an extra logarithmic term.\nspectively.2 They also found that there exist games that are easy, but can not easily be “transformed” to a bandit or full-information game. Later, Bartók et al. (2011) proved the same results for finite stochastic partial monitoring, with any finite number of outcomes. The condition that separates easy games from hard games is the local observability condition (see Definition 6). The algorithm Balaton introduced there works by eliminating actions that are thought to be suboptimal with high confidence. They conjectured in their paper that the same classification holds for nonstochastic games, without changing the condition. Recently, Foster & Rakhlin (2011) designed the algorithm NeighborhoodWatch that proves this conjecture to be true. Foster & Rakhlin prove an upper bound on a stronger notion of regret, called internal regret."

      "text" : "In this paper, we extend the results of Bartók et al. (2011). We introduce a new algorithm, called CBP for “Confidence Bound Partial monitoring”, with various desirable properties. First of all, while Balaton only works on easy games, CBP can be run on any non-hopeless game, and it achieves (up to logarithmic factors) the minimax regret rates both for easy and hard games (see Corollaries 3 and 2). Furthermore, it also achieves logarithmic problem-dependent regret for easy games (see Corollary 1). It is also an “anytime” algorithm, meaning that it does not have to know the time horizon, nor does it have to use the doubling trick, to achieve the desired performance.\nThe final, and potentially most impactful, aspect of our algorithm is that through additional assumptions on the set of opponent strategies, the minimax regret of even hard games can be brought down to Θ̃( √ T )! While this statement may seem to contradict the result of Bartók et al. (2011), in fact it does not. For the precise statement, see Theorem 2. We call this property “adaptiveness” to emphasize that the algorithm does not even have to know that the set of opponent strategies is restricted."

      "text" : "Recall from the introduction that an instance of partial monitoring with N actions and M outcomes is defined by the pair of matrices L ∈ RN×M and H ∈ ΣN×M , where Σ is an arbitrary set of symbols. In each round t, the opponent chooses an outcome Jt ∈M and simultaneously the learner chooses an action It ∈ N . Then,\n2Note that these results do not concern the growth rate in terms of other parameters (like N).\nthe feedback H[It, Jt] is revealed and the learner suffers the loss L[It, Jt]. It is important to note that the loss is not revealed to the learner.\nAs it was previously mentioned, in this paper we deal with stochastic opponents only. In this case, the choice of the opponent is governed by a sequence J1, J2, . . . of i.i.d. random variables. The distribution of these variables p ∈ ∆M is called an opponent strategy, where ∆M , also called the probability simplex, is the set of all distributions over the M outcomes. It is easy to see that, given opponent strategy p, the expected loss of action i can be expressed as `>i p, where `i is defined as the column vector consisting of the ith row of L.\nThe following definitions, taken from Bartók et al. (2011), are essential for understanding how the structure of L and H determines the “hardness” of a game.\nAction i is called optimal under strategy p if its expected loss is not greater than that of any other action i′ ∈ N . That is, `>i p ≤ `>i′ p. Determining which action is optimal under opponent strategies yields the cell decomposition3 of the probability simplex ∆M :\nDefinition 1 (Cell decomposition). For every action i ∈ N , let Ci = {p ∈ ∆M : action i is optimal under p}. The sets C1, . . . , CN constitute the cell decomposition of ∆M .\nNow we can define the following important properties of actions:\nDefinition 2 (Properties of actions). • Action i is called dominated if Ci = ∅. If an action is not dominated then it is called non-dominated.\n• Action i is called degenerate if it is nondominated and there exists an action i′ such that Ci ( Ci′ .\n• If an action is neither dominated nor degenerate then it is called Pareto-optimal. The set of Pareto-optimal actions is denoted by P.\nFrom the definition of cells we see that a cell is either empty or it is a closed polytope. Furthermore, Paretooptimal actions have (M − 1)-dimensional cells. The following definition, important for our algorithm, also uses the dimensionality of polytopes:\nDefinition 3 (Neighbors). Two Pareto-optimal actions i and j are neighbors if Ci ∩ Cj is an (M − 2)- dimensional polytope. Let N be the set of unordered pairs over N that contains neighboring action-pairs. The neighborhood action set of two neighboring actions i, j is defined as N+i,j = {k ∈ N : Ci∩Cj ⊆ Ck}.\n3The concept of cell decomposition also appears in Piccolboni & Schindelhauer (2001).\nNote that the neighborhood action set N+i,j naturally contains i and j. If N+i,j contains some other action k then either Ck = Ci, Ck = Cj , or Ck = Ci ∩ Cj .\nIn general, the elements of the feedback matrix H can be arbitrary symbols. Nevertheless, the nature of the symbols themselves does not matter in terms of the structure of the game. What determines the feedback structure of a game is the occurrence of identical symbols in each row of H. To “standardize” the feedback structure, the signal matrix is defined for each action:\nDefinition 4. Let si be the number of distinct symbols in the ith row of H and let σ1, . . . , σsi ∈ Σ be an enumeration of those symbols. Then the signal matrix Si ∈ {0, 1}si×M of action i is defined as Si[k, l] = I{H[i,l]=σk}.\nThe idea of this definition is that if p ∈ ∆M is the opponent’s strategy then Sip gives the distribution over the symbols underlying action i. In fact, it is also true that observing H[It, Jt] is equivalent to observing the vector SIteJt , where ek is the k\nth unit vector in the standard basis of RM . From now on we assume without loss of generality that the learner’s observation at time step t is the random vector Yt = SIteJt . Note that the dimensionality of this vector depends on the action chosen by the learner, namely Yt ∈ RsIt .\nThe following two definitions play a key role in classifying partial-monitoring games based on their difficulty.\nDefinition 5 (Global observability (Piccolboni & Schindelhauer, 2001)). A partial-monitoring game (L,H) admits the global observability condition, if for all pairs i, j of actions, `i − `j ∈ ⊕k∈N ImS>k . Definition 6 (Local observability (Bartók et al., 2011)). A pair of neighboring actions i, j is said to be locally observable if `i − `j ∈ ⊕k∈N+i,j ImS > k . We denote by L ⊂ N the set of locally observable pairs of actions (the pairs are unordered). A game satisfies the local observability condition if every pair of neighboring actions is locally observable, i.e., if L = N .\nThe main result of Bartók et al. (2011) is that locally observable games have Õ( √ T ) minimax regret. It is easy to see that local observability implies global observability. Also, from Piccolboni & Schindelhauer (2001) we know that if global observability does not hold then the game has linear minimax regret. From now on, we only deal with games that admit the global observability condition.\nA collection of the concepts and symbols introduced in this section is shown in Table 1."

      "heading" : "3. The proposed algorithm",
      "text" : "Our algorithm builds on the core idea underlying algorithm Balaton of Bartók et al. (2011), so we start with a brief review of Balaton. Balaton uses sweeps to successively eliminate suboptimal actions. This is done by estimating the differences between the expected losses of pairs of actions, i.e., δi,j = (`i−`j)>p∗ (i, j ∈ N). In fact, Balaton exploits that it suffices to keep track of δi,j for neighboring pairs of actions (i.e., for action pairs i, j such that {i, j} ∈ N ). This is because if an action i is suboptimal, it will have a neighbor j that has a smaller expected loss and so the action i will get eliminated when δi,j is checked. Now, to estimate δi,j for some {i, j} ∈ N one observes that under the local observability condition, it holds that `i − `j = ∑ k∈N+i,j S>i vi,j,k for some vectors vi,j,k ∈ Rσk . This yields that δi,j = (`i−`j)>p∗ =∑ k∈N+i,j v>i,j,kSkp ∗. Since νk def = Skp ∗ is the vector of the distribution of symbols under action k, which can be estimated by νk(t), the empirical frequencies of the individual symbols observed under k up to time t, Balaton uses ∑ k∈N+i,j v>i,j,kνk(t) to estimate δi,j . Since none of the actions in N+i,j can get eliminated before one of {i, j} gets eliminated, the estimate of δi,j gets refined until one of {i, j} is eliminated.\nThe essence of why Balaton achieves a low regret is as follows: When i is not a neighbor of the optimal action i∗ one can show that it will be eliminated before all neighbors j “between i and i∗” get eliminated. Thus, the contribution of such “far” actions to the re-\ngret is minimal. When i is a neighbor of i∗, it will be eliminated in time proportional to δ−2i,i∗ . Thus the contribution to the regret of such an action is proportional to δ−1i , where δi def = δi,i∗ . It also holds that the contribution to the regret of i cannot be larger than δiT . Thus, the contribution of i to the regret is at most min(δiT, δ −1 i ) ≤ √ T .\nWhen some pairs {i, j} ∈ N are not locally observable, one needs to use actions other than those in N+i,j to construct an estimate of δi,j . Under global observability, `i−`j = ∑ k∈Vi,j S > i vi,j,k for an appropriate subset Vi,j ⊂ N and an appropriate set of vectors vi,j,·. Thus, if the actions in Vi,j are kept in play, one can estimate the difference δi,j as before, using ∑ k∈N+i,j v>i,j,kνk(t). This motivates the following definition:\nDefinition 7 (Observer sets and observer vectors). The observer set Vi,j ⊂ N underlying a pair of neighboring actions {i, j} ∈ N is a set of actions such that\n`i − `j ∈ ⊕k∈Vi,j ImS>k .\nThe observer vectors (vi,j,k)k∈Vi,j are defined to satisfy the equation `i − `j = ∑ k∈Vi,j S > k vi,j,k. In particular, vi,j,k ∈ Rsk . In what follows, the choice of the observer sets and vectors is restricted so that Vi,j = Vj,i and vi,j,k = −vj,i,k. Furthermore, the observer set Vi,j is constrained to be a superset of N + i,j and in particular when a pair {i, j} is locally observable, Vi,j = N + i,j must hold. Finally, for any action\nk ∈ ⋃ {i,j}∈N N + i,j, let Wk = maxi,j:k∈Vi,j ‖vi,j,k‖∞ be the confidence width of action k.\nThe reason of the particular choice Vi,j = N + i,j for lo-\ncally observable pairs {i, j} is that we plan to use Vi,j (and the vectors vi,j,·) in the case of locally observable pairs, too. For not locally observable pairs, the whole action set N is always a valid observer set (thus, Vi,j can be found). However, whenever possible, it is better to use a smaller set. The actual choice of Vi,j (and vi,j,k) is postponed until the effect of this choice on the regret becomes clear.\nWith the observer sets, the basic idea of the algorithm becomes as follows: (i) Eliminate the suboptimal actions in successive sweeps; (ii) In each sweep, enrich the set of remaining actions P(t) by adding the observer actions underlying the remaining neighboring pairs {i, j} ∈ N (t): V(t) = ⋃ {i,j}∈N (t) Vi,j ; (iii) Explore the actions in P(t) ∪ V(t) to update the symbol frequency estimate vectors νk(t). Another refinement is to eliminate the sweeps so as to make the algorithm enjoy an advantageous anytime property. This can be achieved by selecting in each step only one action. We propose the action to be chosen should be the one that maximizes the reduction of the remaining uncertainty. This algorithm could be shown to enjoy √ T regret for locally observable games. However, if we run it on a non-locally observable game and the opponent strategy is on Ci ∩ Cj for {i, j} ∈ N \\ L, it will suffer linear regret! The reason is that if both actions i and j are optimal, and thus never get eliminated, the algorithm will choose actions from Vi,j \\ N+i,j too often. Furthermore, even if the opponent strategy is not on the boundary the regret can be too high: say action i is optimal but δj is small, while {i, j} ∈ N \\ L. Then a third action k ∈ Vi,j with large δk will be chosen proportional to 1/δ2j times, causing high regret. To combat this we restrict the frequency with which an action can be used for “information seeking purposes”. For this, we introduce the set of rarely chosen actions,\nR(t) = {k ∈ N : nk(t) ≤ ηkf(t)} ,\nwhere ηk ∈ R, f : N→ R are tuning parameters to be chosen later. Then, the set of actions available at time t is restricted to P(t) ∪ N+(t) ∪ (V(t) ∩ R(t)), where N+(t) = ⋃ {i,j}∈N (t)N + i,j . We will show that with these modifications, the algorithm achieves O(T 2/3) regret in the general case, while it will also be shown to achieve an O( √ T ) regret when the opponent uses a benign strategy. A pseudocode for the algorithm is given in Algorithm 1.\nIt remains to specify the function getPolytope. It gets the array halfSpace as input. The array halfSpace stores which neighboring action pairs have a confident estimate on the difference of their expected losses, along with the sign of the difference (if confi-\nAlgorithm 1 CBP\nInput: L, H, α, η1, . . . , ηN , f = f(·) Calculate P, N , Vi,j , vi,j,k, Wk for t = 1 to N do\nChoose It = t and observe Yt {Initialization} nIt ← 1 {# times the action is chosen} νIt ← Yt {Cumulative observations}\nend for for t = N + 1, N + 2, . . . do\nfor each {i, j} ∈ N do δ̃i,j ← ∑ k∈Vi,j v > i,j,k νk nk\n{Loss diff. estimate} ci,j ← ∑ k∈Vi,j ‖vi,j,k‖∞ √ α log t nk\n{Confidence} if |δ̃i,j | ≥ ci,j then halfSpace(i, j)← sgn δ̃i,j else halfSpace(i, j)← 0\nend if end for [P(t),N (t)]← getPolytope(P,N , halfSpace) N+(t) = ∪{i,j}∈N (t)N+ij V(t) = ∪{i,j}∈N (t)Vij R(t) = {k ∈ N : nk(t) ≤ ηkf(t)} S(t) = P(t) ∪N+(t) ∪ (V(t) ∩R(t)) Choose It = argmaxi∈S(t) W 2i ni\nand observe Yt νIt ← νIt + Yt nIt ← nIt + 1\nend for\ndent). Each of these confident pairs define an open halfspace, namely\n∆{i,j} = { p ∈ ∆M : halfSpace(i, j)(`i − `j)>p > 0 } .\nThe function getPolytope calculates the open polytope defined as the intersection of the above halfspaces. Then for all i ∈ P it checks if Ci intersects with the open polytope. If so, then i will be an element of P(t). Similarly, for every {i, j} ∈ N , it checks if Ci ∩ Cj intersects with the open polytope and puts the pair in N (t) if it does.\nNote that it is not enough to compute P(t) and then drop from N those pairs {k, l} where one of k or l is excluded from P(t): it is possible that the boundary Ck ∩ Cl between the cells of two actions k, l ∈ P(t) is included in the rejected region. For an illustration of cell decomposition and excluding cells, see Figure 1.\nComputational complexity The computationally heavy parts of the algorithm are the initial calculation of the cell decomposition and the function getPolytope. All of these require linear programming. In the preprocessing phase we need to solve N + N2 linear\nprograms to determine cells and neighboring pairs of cells. Then in every round, at most N2 linear programs are needed. The algorithm can be sped up by “caching” previously solved linear programs."
