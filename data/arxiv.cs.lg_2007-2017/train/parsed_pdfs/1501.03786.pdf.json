INTRODUCTION\nD IFFERENT multivariate performance measures are usedto evaluate different machine learning applications [1]. For example, in problems of text classification, F1-score and precision/recall breakeven point (PRBEP) are used to compare true class labels against predicted class labels of a given test text set. In image retrieval problems, the precision/recall at the top k returned images are used to evaluate the performance of a retrieval system. Recently, the problem of multivariate performance measures optimization are proposed to learn directly to losses based on pre-defined multivariate performance measures. Many algorithms have been proposed to solve this problem, and some examples are listed as follows.\n• Joachims [1] proposed a support vector machine (SVM)based for multivariate nonlinear performance measures optimization problems. The proposed algorithm can train a multivariate SVM in polynomial time for large classes of potentially non-linear performance measures. Moreover, the traditional SAM can be arised as a special case of this method. • Li et al. [2] proposed a two-step approach to optimize multivariate performance measures, by first training a nonlinear classifiers with existing learning methods, and then adapting it to optimize specific performance measures. In the seconde step, the classifier adaptation problem can be solved as a quadratic program problem, in a similar way to linear SVM. • Mao and Tsang [3] proposed a novel feature selection method to optimize multivariate performance measures,\nby formulating the problem or high-dimensional data, and employing a two-layer cutting plane algorithm to solve it. Moreover, this method is also used in multiple-instance learning problems.\nUp to now, all these multivariate methods are limited to learn from data with single view. However, in many realworld machine learning problems, the data can be presented by multiple views. For example, in computer vision problems, we can extract different types of features, such as color features, texture features, and shape features, and each feature can be treated as a view. In scientific article classification problems, we can also learn from the views of article abstract, content, and references. Different views of data may be complemental to each other in a learning problem and using multiple views has been a popular strategy in machine learning community. To learn from multiple views of data, different multi-view learning methods have been proposed [4], [5], [6], [7]. However, none of them are designed to optimized a specific multivariate performance measure.\nTo overcome this problem, in this paper, we propose the problem of learning from multiple view data to optimize the multivariate performance measures. Given a tuple of data points, each of them are presented with multiple views. The problem is to learn a multivariate mapping function to map them to a tuple of class labels, so that the multivariate performance measures can be optimized. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel method for multi-view learning to optimize multivariate performance measures. The contribution of this paper are of two folds:\n1) We propose the problem of multi-view learning for multivariate performance measures. Although there are plenty of multivariate performance measures optimization methods, they are limited to single view data. There are also lots of multi-view learning methods, however, none of them are proposed to optimize multivariate performance measures. 2) We also propose a novel method to solve this problem. We proposed to learn a linear discriminant functions for each view, and combine them to construct a overall multivariate mapping function to predict the class label tuple of a tuple of data points. To learn the linear discriminant functions parameters of different views, we formulate a constrained minimization problem. In this problem, we proposed to minimize the complexity of each linear discriminant functions parameter by minimizing its squared ℓ2 norm, encourage the consistence among different views by minimizing the squared ℓ2 norm distance\n2 among different linear discriminant functions response of differen views, and also minimize the losses based on a specific multivariate performance measures. The minimization problem is optimized by a cutting-plane method in an alterative algorithm [8]. We maintain a active set of constrains, and update it in each iteration by add a most violated class label tuple. We also optimize the multivariate mapping function parameters one by one, and the optimization of a multivariate mapping function parameter can be solve as a quadratic program problem.\nThe rest parts of this paper are organized as follows: in section II, we introduce the proposed method, and in section III, we conclude this paper.\nII. PROPOSED METHOD\nA. Problem formulation\nWe assume we have a training data set of n data points, and each data point has m views. The training set is denoted as {(xji | m j=1, yi)}| n i=1, where x j i ∈ R\ndj is the dj -dimensional feature vector of the j-th view of the i-th data point, and yi ∈ {+1,−1} is the binary class label of the i-th data point. We propose to learn a multivariate mapping function h to map a tuple of n data points of m views, x = (xj\n1 |mj=1, · · · , x j n| m j=1),\nto tuple of n class labels, y = (y1, · · · , yn). To implement this multivariate mapping function, we use a linear discriminant function fj(xj , y′) to predict the response of a view the the data tuple, xj = (xj\n1 , · · · , xjn), against a candidate class label\ntuple y′ = (y′ 1 , · · · , y′n),\nfj(xj , y′) = n ∑\ni=1\nw⊤j Ψ(x j , y′) (1)\nwhere wj ∈ Rdj is a parameter vector for the linear discriminant function of the j-th view, , and Ψ(xj, y) is a function which can returns a vector to describe the match between xj and y′, defined as follows,\nΨ(xj , y′) = n ∑\ni=1\ny′ix j i . (2)\nBased on the linear discriminant functions of different views, we construct the multivariate mapping function as follows,\nh(x) = argmaxy′∈Y\n\n\n\nm ∑\nj=1\nfj(xj , y′) = m ∑\nj=1\nw⊤j Ψ(x j , y′)\n\n\n\n(3) where Y = {+1,−1}n is a set of all admissible label vectors.\nWe propose to optimize a complex multivariate performance measure, ∆, by learning the parameter vectors wj |mj=1 for the m views. To this end, we consider the following three problems,\n1) Reducing the complexity of each linear discriminative function: To prevent over-fitting, we propose to reduce the complexity of the linear discriminative function of each view by minimizing the squared ℓ2 norm of its parameter,\nmin wj |mj=1\n1\n2\nm ∑\nj=1\n‖wj‖22. (4)\n2) Encouraging consistences among different views: To encourage the consistences of different views, we proposed to minimize the squared ℓ2 norm distances of responses of any two linear discriminative functions over one single data point,\nmin wj |mj=1\n1\n2\n∑\nj,j′:j′<j\n(\nn ∑\ni=1\n‖w⊤j x j i − w ⊤ j′x\nj′ i ‖ 2 2\n)\n. (5)\n3) Optimizing multivariate performance measures: To optimize a specific multivariate performance measure, we propose to minimize the upper boundary of a loss function ∆ based on this multivariate performance measure,\nmin wj |mj=1,ξ ξ\ns.t.∀y′ ∈ Y/y : m ∑\nj=1\nw⊤j [ Ψ(xj , y)−Ψ(xj , y′) ] ≥ ∆(y′, y)− ξ,\n(6) where ξ is a slack variable of the upper boundary of the loss function.\nThe overall optimization function are obtained by combining all the problems above,\nmin wj |mj=1,ξ\n\n\n\n1\n2\nm ∑\nj=1\n‖wj‖22 + C1ξ\n+ C2 2 ∑\nj,j′:j′<j\n(\nn ∑\ni=1\n‖w⊤j x j i − w ⊤ j′x\nj′ i ‖ 2 2\n)\n\n\n\ns.t.∀y′ ∈ Y/y : m ∑\nj=1\nw⊤j [ Ψ(xj , y)−Ψ(xj , y′) ] ≥ ∆(y′, y)− ξ.\n(7)\nIn the objective of this problem, the first term is to reduce the complexity of the parameter vector of each view, and second term is a slack variable to represent the upper boundary of the multivariate performance measure, and the third term is to encourage the consistences of the responses of different views. C1 and C2 are tradeoff parameters.\nB. Problem optimization\nTo solve this problem, we employ the cutting-plane algorithm. In an iterative algorithm, we update the parameter vectors wj |mj=1 and an active set of constrains W alternately.\n3 1) Updating wj |mj=1: When we have a given active set of constrain W ⊆ Y/y, and optimize the parameter vectors, we optimize wj one by one, i.e., when wj is optimized, wj′ |j′ 6=j is fixed. The following optimization is obtained in this case,\nmin wj ,ξ\n\n\n\n1 2 ‖wj‖22 + C1ξ\n+ C2 2 ∑\nj′:j′<j\n(\nn ∑\ni=1\n‖w⊤j x j i − w ⊤ j′x\nj′ i ‖ 2 2\n)\n\n\n\ns.t.∀y′ ∈ W :\nw⊤j [ Ψ(xj, y)−Ψ(xj , y′) ]\n≥ ∆(y′, y)− ∑\nj′ :j′ 6=j\nw⊤j′ [ Ψ(xj ′ , y)−Ψ(xj ′ , y′) ] − ξ.\n(8) The Lagrange function of this problem is\nL(wj , ξ, αy′ |y′:y′∈W) = 1\n2 ‖wj‖22 + C1ξ\n+ C2 2 ∑\nj′ :j′<j\n(\nn ∑\ni=1\n‖w⊤j x j i − w ⊤ j′x\nj′ i ‖ 2 2\n)\n− ∑\ny′:y′∈W\nαy′\n\nw⊤j [ Ψ(xj , y)−Ψ(xj , y′) ] −∆(y′, y)\n+ ∑\nj′:j′ 6=j\nw⊤j′ [ Ψ(xj ′ , y)−Ψ(xj ′ , y′) ] + ξ\n\n\n= 1\n2 w⊤j Ωwj + C1ξ − w ⊤ j β + C2 2 ∑\nj′:j′<j\nn ∑\ni=1\nw⊤j′x j′ i x j′ i ⊤ wj′\n− ∑\ny′:y′∈W\nαy′ ( w⊤j γy′ − δy′ + ξ )\n(9) where αy′ ≥ 0 is the Lagrange multiplier for the constrain w⊤j [ Ψ(xj , y)−Ψ(xj , y′) ]\n≥ ∆(y′, y) − ∑\nj′:j′ 6=j w ⊤ j′\n[\nΨ(xj ′ , y)−Ψ(xj ′ , y′) ] − ξ, and\nΩ =\n\nI + C2 ∑\nj′:j′<j\nn ∑\ni=1\nxjix j i\n⊤\n\n ,\nβ = C2 ∑\nj′:j′<j\nn ∑\ni=1\nxjix j′ i ⊤ wj′ ,\nγy′ = [ Ψ(xj , y)−Ψ(xj , y′) ]\nδy′ =\n\n∆(y′, y)− ∑\nj′ :j′ 6=j\nw⊤j′ [ Ψ(xj ′ , y)−Ψ(xj ′ , y′) ]\n\n .\n(10) This optimization problem can be transferred to its dual form,\nmax αy′ |y′:y′∈W min wj ,ξ L(wj , ξ, αy′ |y′:y′∈W)\ns.t. ∀y′, y′ ∈ W : αy′ ≥ 0. (11)\nTo obtain the optimal points of wj and ξ, we set the gradients of Lagrangian function with respect to wj and ξ to zeros, and we have,\n∂L\n∂wj = Ωwj − β −\n∑\ny′:y′∈W\nαy′γy′ = 0\n⇒ wj = Ω−1\n\nβ + ∑\ny′:y′∈W\nαy′γy′\n\n ,\n∂L ∂ξ = C1 − ∑\ny′:y′∈W\nαy′ = 0\n⇒ ∑\ny′:y′∈W\nαy′ = C1.\n(12)\nBy substituting these results back to (11), we obtain the dual problem as\nmax αy′ |y′:y′∈W\n\n \n \n− 1\n2\n\nβ + ∑\ny′:y′∈W\nαy′γy′\n\n\n⊤\nΩ−1\n\nβ + ∑\ny′:y′∈W\nαy′γy′\n\n\n− ∑\ny′:y′∈W\nαy′δy′\n\n\n\ns.t. ∀y′, y′ ∈ W : αy′ ≥ 0, and ∑\ny′:y′∈W\nαy′ = C1.\n(13) We can solve this problem as a quadratic program problem.\n2) Updating W: To update W , we first find the most violated y′ and then add it the W . y′ is obtained as\ny′ = argmaxy′′∈Y/y\n\n\n\n∆(y′′, y) +\nm ∑\nj=1\nw⊤j Ψ(x j , y′′)\n− m ∑\nj=1\nw⊤j Ψ(x j , y)\n\n\n\n.\n(14)\n3) Alterative algorithm: The proposed iterative algorithm is given in Algorithm 1.\nIII. CONCLUSION\nIn this paper, we propose the problem of multi-view learning for multivariate performance measures, and a novel algorithm to solve it. Multivariate performance measures optimization can obtain a predictor which directly optimize a desired performance measure. However, the existing methods are limited to single view data, and cannot utilize multi-view data. We propose to learn from multi-view data to optimize the multivariate performance measures, and it has potential in realworld applications. The proposed method can be implemented easily due to its employment of cutting plane method and quadratic program.\n4 Algorithm 1 Iterative multi-view learning algorithm for multivariate performance measures.\nInput: Multi-view training data set {(xji | m j=1, yi)}| n i=1; Input: Tradeoff parameters C1 and C2; Input: The maximum iteration number T .
