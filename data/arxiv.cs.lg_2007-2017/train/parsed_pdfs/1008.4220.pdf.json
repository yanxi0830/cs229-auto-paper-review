      "text" : "The concept of parsimony is central in many scientific domains. In the context of statistics, signal processing or machine learning, it takes the form of variable or feature selection problems, and is commonly used in two situations: First, to make the model or the prediction more interpretable or cheaper to use, i.e., even if the underlying problem does not admit sparse solutions, one looks for the best sparse approximation. Second, sparsity can also be used given prior knowledge that the model should be sparse. In these two situations, reducing parsimony to finding models with low cardinality turns out to be limiting, and structured parsimony has emerged as a fruitful practical extension, with applications to image processing, text processing or bioinformatics (see, e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] and Section 4). For example, in [4], structured sparsity is used to encode prior knowledge regarding network relationship between genes, while in [6], it is used as an alternative to structured nonparametric Bayesian process based priors for topic models.\nMost of the work based on convex optimization and the design of dedicated sparsity-inducing norms has focused mainly on the specific allowed set of sparsity patterns [1, 2, 4, 6]: if w ∈ Rp denotes the predictor we aim to estimate, and Supp(w) denotes its support, then these norms are designed so that\npenalizing with these norms only leads to supports from a given family of allowed patterns. In this paper, we instead follow the approach of [8, 3] and consider specific penalty functions F (Supp(w)) of the support set, which go beyond the cardinality function, but are not limited or designed to only forbid certain sparsity patterns. As shown in Section 6.2, these may also lead to restricted sets of supports but their interpretation in terms of an explicit penalty on the support leads to additional insights into the behavior of structured sparsity-inducing norms (see, e.g., Section 4.1). While direct greedy approaches (i.e., forward selection) to the problem are considered in [8, 3], we provide convex relaxations to the function w 7→ F (Supp(w)), which extend the traditional link between the ℓ1-norm and the cardinality function.\nThis is done for a particular ensemble of set-functions F , namely nondecreasing submodular functions. Submodular functions may be seen as the set-function equivalent of convex functions, and exhibit many interesting properties that we review in Section 2—see [9] for a tutorial on submodular analysis and [10, 11] for other applications to machine learning. This paper makes the following contributions:\n−We make explicit links between submodularity and sparsity by showing that the convex envelope of the function w 7→ F (Supp(w)) on the ℓ∞-ball may be readily obtained from the Lovász extension of the submodular function (Section 3).\n− We provide generic algorithmic tools, i.e., subgradients and proximal operators (Section 5), as well as theoretical guarantees, i.e., conditions for support recovery or high-dimensional inference (Section 6), that extend classical results for the ℓ1-norm and show that many norms may be tackled by the exact same analysis and algorithms.\n− By selecting specific submodular functions in Section 4, we recover and give a new interpretation to known norms, such as those based on rank-statistics or grouped norms with potentially overlapping groups [1, 2, 7], and we define new norms, in particular ones that can be used as non-factorial priors for supervised learning (Section 4). These are illustrated on simulation experiments in Section 7, where they outperform related greedy approaches [3].\nNotation. For w ∈ Rp, Supp(w) ⊂ V = {1, . . . , p} denotes the support of w, defined as Supp(w) = {j ∈ V, wj 6= 0}. For w ∈ Rp and q ∈ [1,∞], we denote by ‖w‖q the ℓq-norm of w. We denote by |w| ∈ Rp the vector of absolute values of the components of w. Moreover, given a vector w and a matrix Q, wA and QAA are the corresponding subvector and submatrix of w and Q. Finally, for w ∈ Rp and A ⊂ V , w(A) = ∑k∈A wk (this defines a modular set-function)."

      "heading" : "2 Review of submodular function theory",
      "text" : "Throughout this paper, we consider a nondecreasing submodular function F defined on the power set 2V of V = {1, . . . , p}, i.e., such that:\n∀A,B ⊂ V, F (A) + F (B) > F (A ∪B) + F (A ∩B), (submodularity) ∀A,B ⊂ V, A ⊂ B ⇒ F (A) 6 F (B). (monotonicity)\nMoreover, we assume (without loss of generality) that F (∅) = 0. These set-functions are often referred to as polymatroid set-functions [12] or β-functions [13]. Also, without loss of generality, we may assume that F is strictly positive on singletons, i.e., for all k ∈ V , F ({k}) > 0. Indeed, if F ({k}) = 0, then by submodularity and monotonicity, if A ∋ k, F (A) = F (A\\{k}) and thus we can simply consider V \\{k} instead of V . Classical examples are the cardinality function (which will lead to the ℓ1-norm) and, given a partition of V into B1 ∪ · · · ∪ Bk = V , the set function A 7→ F (A) which is equal to the number of groups B1, . . . , Bk with non empty intersection with A (which will lead to the grouped ℓ1/ℓ∞-norm [1, 14]).\nLovász extension. Given any set-function F , one can define its Lovász extension [15] (a.k.a. Choquet integral [16]) f : Rp+ → R, as follows: given w ∈ Rp+, we can order the components of w in decreasing order wj1 > · · · > wjp > 0; the value f(w) is then defined as:\nf(w) =\np ∑\nk=1\nwjk [F ({j1, . . . , jk})− F ({j1, . . . , jk−1})]. (1)\nNote that if some of the components of w are equal, all orderings lead to the same value of f(w). The Lovász extension f is always piecewise-linear, and when F is submodular, it is also convex (see, e.g., [15, 12]). Moreover, for all δ ∈ {0, 1}p, f(δ) = F (Supp(δ)): f is indeed an extension from vectors in {0, 1}p (which can be identified with indicator vectors of sets) to all vectors in Rp+. Moreover, it turns out that minimizing F over subsets, i.e., minimizing f over {0, 1}p is equivalent to minimizing f over [0, 1]p [15, 13].\nSubmodular polyhedron and greedy algorithm. We denote by P the submodular polyhedron [12], defined as the set of s ∈ Rp+ such that for all A ⊂ V , s(A) 6 F (A), i.e., P = {s ∈ R\np +, ∀A ⊂ V, s(A) 6 F (A)}, where we use the notation s(A) = ∑\nk∈A sk. One important result in submodular analysis is that if F is a nondecreasing submodular function, then we have a representation of f as a maximum of linear functions [12, 15], i.e., for all w ∈ Rp+,\nf(w) = max s∈P\nw⊤s. (2)\nInstead of solving a linear program with p + 2p contraints, a solution s may be obtained by the following “greedy algorithm”: order the components of w in decreasing order wj1 > · · · > wjp , and then take for all k ∈ {1, . . . , p}, sjk = F ({j1, . . . , jk})− F ({j1, . . . , jk−1}). Stable sets. A set A is said stable if it cannot be augmented without increasing F , i.e., if for all sets B ⊃ A, B 6= A ⇒ F (B) > F (A). If F is strictly increasing, then all sets are stable. Stable sets are also sometimes referred to as flat or closed [13]. The set of stable sets is closed by intersection [13], and will correspond to the set of allowed sparsity patterns (see Section 6.2). For the cardinality function, all sets are stable.\nSeparable sets. A set A is separable if we can find a partition of A into A = B1 ∪ · · · ∪ Bk such that F (A) = F (B1) + · · · + F (Bk). A set A is inseparable if it is not separable. As shown in [13], the submodular polytope P has full dimension p as soon as F is strictly positive on all singletons, and its faces are exactly the sets {sk = 0} for k ∈ V and {s(A) = F (A)} for stable and inseparable sets. We let denote T the set of such sets. This implies that P = {s ∈ Rp+, ∀A ∈ T , s(A) 6 F (A)}. These stable inseparable sets will play a role when describing extreme points of unit balls of our new norms (Section 3) and for deriving concentration inequalities in Section 6.3. For the cardinality function, stable and inseparable sets are singletons.\nSubmodular function minimization. Submodular functions are particularly interesting because they can be minimized in polynomial time. In this paragraph, we consider a non-monotonic submodular function G (otherwise finding the minimum is trivial). Most algorithms for minimizing submodular functions rely on the following strong duality principle [13, 12]:\nmin A⊂V G(A) = max s∈B(G)\n∑ k∈V min{0, sk}, (3)\nwhere B(G) = {s ∈ Rp, ∀A ⊂ V, s(A) 6 G(A), s(V ) = G(V )} is referred to as the base polyhedron. Moreover, algorithms for minimizing G will usually output A and s such that G(A) = ∑\nk∈V min{0, sk} as a certificate for optimality. The two main types of algorithms are combinatorial algorithms (that explicitly looks for A) and ones based on convex optimization (that explicitly\nlooks for s). The first type of algorithm leads to strongly polynomial algorithms with best known complexity O(p6) [17], while the minimum point algorithm of [12] has no worst-time complexity bounds but is usually much faster in practice [12] and is based on the equivalent problem of finding the minimum-norm point in B(G), i.e., mins∈B(G) ‖s‖22. Note that in this case, the minimum point algorithm also outputs a particular s solution of Eq. (3)—which has several solutions in general."

We have the following properties (see proof in the appendix), which show that we indeed define a norm and that it is the desired convex envelope:\nProposition 1 (Convex envelope, dual norm) Assume that the set-function F is submodular, nondecreasing, and strictly positive for all singletons. Define Ω : w 7→ f(|w|). Then: (i) Ω is a norm on Rp,\n(ii) Ω is the convex envelope of the function g : w 7→ F (Supp(w)) on the unit ℓ∞-ball,\n(iii) the dual norm (see, e.g., [18]) of Ω is equal to Ω∗(s) = maxA⊂V ‖sA‖1 F (A) = maxA∈T ‖sA‖1 F (A) .\nWe provide examples of submodular set-functions and norms in Section 4, where we go from setfunctions to norms, and vice-versa. From the definition of the Lovász extension in Eq. (1), we see that Ω is a polyhedral norm (i.e., its unit ball is a polyhedron). The following proposition gives the set of extreme points of the unit ball (see proof in the appendix and examples in Figure 1):\nProposition 2 (Extreme points of unit ball) The extreme points of the unit ball of Ω are the vectors 1F (A)s, with s ∈ {−1, 0, 1}p, Supp(s) = A and A a stable inseparable set.\nThis proposition shows, that depending on the number and cardinality of the inseparable stable sets, we can go from 2p (only singletons) to 3p − 1 extreme points (all possible sign vectors). We show in Figure 1 examples of balls for p = 2, as well as sets of extreme points. These extreme points will play a role in concentration inequalities derived in Section 6."

Some existing norms are shown to be examples of our frameworks (Section 4.1, Section 4.3), while other novel norms are designed from specific submodular functions (Section 4.2). Other examples of submodular functions, in particular in terms of matroids and entropies, may be found in [12, 10, 11] and could also lead to interesting new norms.

      "heading" : "4.1 Norms defined with non-overlapping or overlapping groups",
      "text" : "We consider grouped norms defined with potentially overlapping groups [1, 2], i.e., Ω(w) = ∑ G⊂V d(G)‖wG‖∞ where d is a nonnegative set-function (with potentially d(G) = 0 when G should not be considered in the norm). It is a norm as soon as ∪G,d(G)>0G = V and it corresponds to the nondecreasing submodular function F (A) = ∑\nG∩A 6=∅ d(G). In the case where ℓ∞-norms are replaced by ℓ2-norms, [2] has shown that the set of allowed sparsity patterns are intersections of complements of groups G with strictly positive weights. These sets happen to be the set of stable sets for the corresponding submodular function; thus the analysis provided in Section 6.2 extends the result of [2] to the new case of ℓ∞-norms. However, in our situation, we can give a reinterpretation through a submodular function that counts the number of times the support A intersects groups G with non zero weights. This goes beyond restricting the set of allowed sparsity patterns to stable sets. We show later in this section some insights gained by this reinterpretation. We now give some examples of norms, with various topologies of groups.\nHierarchical norms. Hierarchical norms defined on directed acyclic graphs [1, 5, 6] correspond to the set-function F (A) which is the cardinality of the union of ancestors of elements in A. These have been applied to bioinformatics [5], computer vision and topic models [6].\nNorms defined on grids. If we assume that the p variables are organized in a 1D, 2D or 3D grid, [2] considers norms based on overlapping groups leading to stable sets equal to rectangular or convex shapes, with applications in computer vision [19]. For example, for the groups defined in the left side of Figure 2 (with unit weights), we have F (A) = p − 2 + range(A) if A 6= ∅ and F (∅) = 0 (the range of A is equal to max(A) −min(A) + 1). From empty sets to non-empty sets, there is a gap of p − 1, which is larger than differences among non-empty sets. This leads to the undesired result, which has been already observed by [2], of adding all variables in one step, rather than gradually, when the regularization parameter decreases in a regularized optimization problem. In order to counterbalance this effect, adding a constant times the cardinality function has the effect of making the first gap relatively smaller. This corresponds to adding a constant times the ℓ1-norm and, as shown in Figure 3, solves the problem of having all variables coming together. All patterns are then allowed, but contiguous ones are encouraged rather than forced.\nAnother interesting new norm may be defined from the groups in the right side of Figure 2. Indeed, it corresponds to the function F (A) equal to |A| plus the number of intervals of A. Note that this also favors contiguous patterns but is not limited to selecting a single interval (like the norm obtained from groups in the left side of Figure 2). Note that it is to be contrasted with the total variation (a.k.a. fused Lasso penalty [20]), which is a relaxation of the number of jumps in a vector w rather than in its support. In 2D or 3D, this extends to the notion of perimeter and area, but we do not pursue such extensions here."

      "text" : "Given a positive semidefinite matrix Q ∈ Rp×p and a real-valued function h from R+ → R, one may define tr[h(Q)] as\n∑p i=1 h(λi) where λ1, . . . , λp are the (nonnegative) eigenvalues of Q [21]. We\ncan thus define the set-function F (A) = trh(QAA) for A ⊂ V . The functions h(λ) = log(λ + t) for t > 0 lead to submodular functions, as they correspond to entropies of Gaussian random variables (see, e.g., [12, 9]). Thus, since for q ∈ (0, 1), λq = q sin qππ ∫∞ 0\nlog(1 + λ/t)tq−1dt (see, e.g., [22]), h(λ) = λq for q ∈ (0, 1] are positive linear combinations of functions that lead to nondecreasing submodular functions. Thus, they are also nondecreasing submodular functions, and, to the best of our knowledge, provide novel examples of such functions.\nIn the context of supervised learning from a design matrix X ∈ Rn×p, we naturally use Q = X⊤X . If h is linear, then F (A) = trX⊤AXA = ∑ k∈A X ⊤ k Xk (where XA denotes the submatrix of X with columns in A) and we obtain a weighted cardinality function and hence and a weighted ℓ1-norm, which is a factorial prior, i.e., it is a sum of terms depending on each variable independently.\nIn a frequentist setting, the Mallows CL penalty [23] depends on the degrees of freedom, of the form trX⊤AXA(X ⊤ AXA + λI)\n−1. This is a non-factorial prior but unfortunately it does not lead to a submodular function. In a Bayesian context however, it is shown by [24] that penalties of the form log det(X⊤AXA + λI) (which lead to submodular functions) correspond to marginal likelihoods associated to the set A and have good behavior when used within a non-convex framework. This highlights the need for non-factorial priors which are sub-linear functions of the eigenvalues ofX⊤AXA, which is exactly what nondecreasing submodular function of submatrices are. We do not pursue the extensive evaluation of non-factorial convex priors in this paper but provide in simulations examples with F (A) = tr(X⊤AXA) 1/2 (which is equal to the trace norm of XA [18])."

Note that since these norms are polyhedral norms with unit balls having potentially an exponential number of vertices or faces, regular linear programming toolboxes may not be used.\nSubgradient. From Ω(w) = maxs∈P s⊤|w| and the greedy algorithm1 presented in Section 2, one can easily get in polynomial time one subgradient as one of the maximizers s. This allows to use subgradient descent, with, as shown in Figure 4, slow convergence compared to proximal methods.\nProximal operator. Given regularized problems of the form minw∈Rp L(w) + λΩ(w), where L is differentiable with Lipschitz-continuous gradient, proximal methods have been shown to be particularly efficient first-order methods (see, e.g., [25]). In this paper, we consider the methods “ISTA” and its accelerated variants “FISTA” [25], which are compared in Figure 4.\nTo apply these methods, it suffices to be able to solve efficiently problems of the form: minw∈Rp 1 2‖w− z‖22 + λΩ(w). In the case of the ℓ1-norm, this reduces to soft thresholding of z, the following proposition (see proof in the appendix) shows that this is equivalent to a particular algorithm for submodular function minimization, namely the minimum-norm-point algorithm, which has no complexity bound but is empirically faster than algorithms with such bounds [12]:\nProposition 3 (Proximal operator) Let z ∈ Rp and λ > 0, minimizing 12‖w − z‖22 + λΩ(w) is equivalent to finding the minimum of the submodular function A 7→ λF (A) − |z|(A) with the minimum-norm-point algorithm.\nIn the proof, it is shown how a solution for one problem may be obtained from a solution to the other problem. Moreover, any algorithm for minimizing submodular functions allows to get directly the support of the unique solution of the proximal problem and that with a sequence of submodular function minimizations, the full solution may also be obtained. Similar links between convex optimization and minimization of submodular functions have been considered (see, e.g., [26]). However, these are dedicated to symmetric submodular functions (such as the ones obtained from graph cuts) and are thus not directly applicable to our situation of non-increasing submodular functions.\nFinally, note that using the minimum-norm-point algorithm leads to a generic algorithm that can be applied to any submodular functions F , and that it may be rather inefficient for simpler subcases (e.g., the ℓ1/ℓ∞-norm, tree-structured groups [6], or general overlapping groups [7])."

We now focus on the predictive performance and compare our new norm with F (A) = tr(X⊤AXA)\n1/2, with greedy approaches [3] and to regularization by ℓ1 or ℓ2 norms. As shown in Table 1, the new norm based on non-factorial priors is more robust than the ℓ1-norm to lower number of observations n and to larger cardinality of support k."

      "text" : "We have presented a family of sparsity-inducing norms dedicated to incorporating prior knowledge or structural constraints on the support of linear predictors. We have provided a set of common algorithms and theoretical results, as well as simulations on synthetic examples illustrating the good behavior of these norms. Several avenues are worth investigating: first, we could follow current practice in sparse methods, e.g., by considering related adapted concave penalties to enhance sparsity-inducing norms, or by extending some of the concepts for norms of matrices, with potential applications in matrix factorization or multi-task learning (see, e.g., [29] for application of submodular functions to dictionary learning). Second, links between submodularity and sparsity could be studied further, in particular by considering submodular relaxations of other combinatorial functions, or studying links with other polyhedral norms such as the total variation, which are known to be similarly associated with symmetric submodular set-functions such as graph cuts [26].\nAcknowledgements.

Note that the exact subdifferential for the non-zero components of w is rather complicated when w has components with equal magnitude. If this is not the case, i.e., |wj1 | > · · · > |wjk | > 0, where k = |J |, then the subdifferential ∂ΩJ(wJ ) is reduced to a point s such that sjk = F ({j1, . . . , jk})−F ({j1, . . . , jk−1}). For more details on the subdifferential for nonzero components, see [12].\nLemma 1 (Decomposition of subdifferential) Let w ∈ Rp, with support J = Supp(w) and with H equal to the smallest stable set containing J . The subdifferential ∂Ω(w) at w, can then be decomposed as follows on RV = RJ×RH\\J×RHc : ∂Ω(w) = ∂ΩJ(wJ )×{0}×{sHc, (ΩH)∗(sHc) 6 1}.\nProof For all sufficient small ∆ ∈ Rp, the components in (w+∆)J have all greater absolute values than the ones in (w + ∆)Jc . Thus, from Proposition 4, Ω(w + ∆) = ΩJ(wJ + ∆J ) + Ω\nJ (∆Jc) = ΩJ(wJ + ∆J ) + Ω\nH(∆Hc ), and thus the subdifferential decomposes as ∂ΩJ(wJ ) × {0} × ∂ΩH(0).

Since z has nonnegative components, the minimum restricted to |s| ∈ P is the same as the minimum restricted to s ∈ P , and also the same as the one restricted to the submodular polyhedron without constraints on positivity, i.e., our problem reduces to min∀A⊂V,s(A)⊂F (A) ‖s− z/λ‖22, which is also equivalent to\nmin ∀A⊂V,t(A)⊂F (A)−λ−1z(A)\n‖t‖22.

We can then follow two approaches: the first one is to apply directly the minimum-norm point algorithm to the problem in Eq. (5), which we have followed in simulations. The second approach is to consider the regular minimum point algorithm; we can then follow [12, Lemma 7.4]: if t is the minimum-norm solution for the submodular function G, then we can obtain s as λ−1z plus the negative part of t. From s we then get w through w = z−λs. If another algorithm is used for submodular function minimization, then, following [12, Lemma 7.4], we know which components of the (unique) optimal value t∗ are negative and which of them are equal to zero (which corresponds to zero components of w∗). Then, following [26], if we add a constant vector with components equal to α to z, we may obtain level sets of w∗. With several values of α, we can then obtain the full solution w∗. However, the minimum norm point algorithm remains the most efficient and allows to obtain directly the solution of the proximal problem."

This occurs with probability zero.\nWhat remains to be shown is the affine representation of ŵJ when the support is given; it is essentially equivalent to showing that the path is piecewise affine, which is not surprising for a polyhedral norm [31]. We use the representation ΩJ (wJ ) = maxz∈B z⊤wJ where B is the finite set of z such that |z| in an extreme point of the submodular polyhedron associated with ΩJ . Necessary optimality conditions [32] for such the problem in Eq.

This combinatorial selection problem is often turned into a convex optimization problem by replacing the cardinality function by its convex envelope (tightest convex lower bound), in this case the l1-norm. In this paper, we investigate more general set-functions than the cardinality, that may incorporate prior knowledge or structural constraints which are common in many applications: namely, we show that for nondecreasing submodular set-functions, the corresponding convex envelope can be obtained from its Lovász extension, a common tool in submodular analysis. This defines a family of polyhedral norms, for which we provide generic algorithmic tools (subgradients and proximal operators) and theoretical results (conditions for support recovery or high-dimensional inference). By selecting specific submodular functions, we can give a new interpretation to known norms, such as those based on rank-statistics or grouped norms with potentially overlapping groups; we also define new norms, in particular ones that can be used as non-factorial priors for supervised learning.",
