      "text" : "The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a popular tool for solving problems of the form,\nmin u∈Rn,v∈Rm f(u) + g(v), subject to Au+Bv = b, (1)\nwhere f : Rn → R and g : Rm → R are convex functions, A ∈ Rp×n, B ∈ Rp×m, and b ∈ Rp. ADMM was first introduced in (Glowinski & Marroco, 1975) and (Gabay & Mercier, 1976), and has found applications in many optimization problems in machine learning, distributed computing and many other areas (Boyd et al., 2011).\nConsensus ADMM (Boyd et al., 2011) solves minimization problems involving a composite objective f(v) =∑ i fi(v), where worker i stores the data needed to compute fi, and so is well suited for distributed model fitting problems (Boyd et al., 2011; Zhang & Kwok, 2014; Song et al., 2016; Chang et al., 2016; Goldstein et al., 2016; Taylor et al., 2016).

Copyright 2017 by the author(s).\neach worker, and then apply ADMM to solve\nmin ui∈Rd,v∈Rd N∑ i=1 fi(ui) + g(v), subject to ui = v, (2)\nwhere v is the “central” copy of the unknowns, and g(v) is a regularizer. The consensus problem (2) coincides with (1) by defining u = (u1; . . . ; uN ) ∈ RdN , A = IdN ∈ RdN×dN , and B = −(Id; . . . ; Id) ∈ RdN×d, where Id represents the d× d identity matrix.\nADMM methods rely on a penalty parameter (stepsize) that is chosen by the user. In theory, ADMM converges for any constant penalty parameter (Eckstein & Bertsekas, 1992; He & Yuan, 2012; Ouyang et al., 2013). In practice, however, the efficiency of ADMM is highly sensitive to this parameter choice (Nishihara et al., 2015; Ghadimi et al., 2015), and can be improved via adaptive penalty selection methods (He et al., 2000; Song et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2017a).\nOne such approach, residual balancing (RB) (He et al., 2000), adapts the penalty parameter so that the residuals (derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to primal and dual variables) have similar magnitudes. When the same penalty parameter is used across nodes, RB is known to converge, although without a known rate guarantee. A more recent approach, AADMM (Xu et al., 2017a), achieves impressive practical convergence speed on many applications, including consensus problems, with adaptive penalty parameters by estimating the local curvature of the dual functions. However, the dimension of the unknown variables in consensus problems grows with the number of distributed nodes, causing the curvature estimation to be inaccurate and unstable. AADMM uses the same convergence analysis as RB. Consensus residual balancing (CRB) (Song et al., 2016) extends residual balancing to consensusbased ADMM for distributed optimization by balancing the local primal and dual residuals on each node. However, convergence guarantees for this method are fairly weak, and adaptive penalties need to be reset after several iterations to guarantee convergence.\nWe study the use of adaptive ADMM in the distributed setting, where different workers use different local algorithm parameters to accelerate convergence. We begin by studying the theory and provide convergence guarantees when\nar X\niv :1\n70 6.\n02 86\n9v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n0 Ju\nn 20\n17\nnode-specific penalty parameters are used. We demonstrate a O(1/k) convergence rate under mild conditions that is applicable for many forms of adaptive ADMM including all the above methods. Our theory is more general than the convergence guarantee in (He et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2017a) that only shows convergence when the scalar penalty parameter is adapted. Next, we propose an adaptive consensus ADMM (ACADMM) method to automate local algorithm parameters selection. Instead of estimating one global penalty parameter for all workers, different local penalty parameters are estimated using the local curvature of subproblems on each node."

      "text" : "ADMM is known to have aO(1/k) convergence rate under mild conditions for convex problems (He & Yuan, 2012; 2015), while a O(1/k2) rate is possible when at least one of the functions is strongly convex or smooth (Goldfarb et al., 2013; Goldstein et al., 2014; Kadkhodaie et al., 2015; Tian & Yuan, 2016). Linear convergence can be achieved with strong convexity assumptions (Davis & Yin, 2014; Nishihara et al., 2015; Giselsson & Boyd, 2016). All of these results assume constant parameters; to the best of our knowledge, no convergence rate has been proven for ADMM with an adaptive penalty: (He et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2017b) proves convergence without providing a rate, and (Lin et al., 2011; Banert et al., 2016; Goldstein et al., 2015) prove convergence for some particular variants of ADMM (“linearized” or “preconditioned”).\nTo improve practical convergence of ADMM, fixed optimal parameters are discussed in (Raghunathan & Di Cairano, 2014; Ghadimi et al., 2015; Nishihara et al., 2015; França & Bento, 2016). These methods make strong assumptions about the objective and require information about the spectrum of A and/or B. Additionally, adaptive methods have been proposed; the most closely related work to our own is (Song et al., 2016), which extends the results of (He et al., 2000) to consensus problems, where communication is controlled by predefined network structure and the regularizer g(v) is absent. In contrast to these methods, the proposed ACADMM extends the spectral penalty in (Xu et al., 2017a) to consensus problems and provides convergence theory that can be applied to a broad range of adaptive ADMM variants."

We also bound changes in the penalty parameter by (1 +Ccg/k2) according to Assumption 1, which was shown in Theorem 1\nAlgorithm 1 Adaptive consensus ADMM (ACADMM)\nInput: initialize v0, λ0i , τ0i , k0 =0, 1: while not converge by (7) and k < maxiter do 2: Locally update uki on each node by (3) 3: Globally update vk on central server by (4) 4: Locally update dual variable λki on each node by (5) 5: if mod(k, Tf ) = 1 then 6: Locally update λ̂ki = λ k−1 i + τ k i (v\nk−1 − uki ) 7: Locally compute spectral stepsizes α̂ki , β̂ k i 8: Locally estimate correlations αkcor,i , β k cor,i\n9: Locally update τk+1i using (54) 10: k0 ← k 11: else 12: τk+1i ← τki 13: end if 14: k ← k + 1 15: end while\nand Theorem 2 to guarantee convergence. The final safeguarded ACADMM rule is\nτ̂k+1i =  √ α̂ki β̂ k i if α k cor,i > cor and βkcor,i > cor α̂ki if α k cor,i > cor and βkcor,i ≤ cor β̂ki if α k cor,i ≤ cor and βkcor,i > cor\nτki otherwise,\nτk+1i = max{min{τ̂ k+1 i , (1 + Ccg k2 )τki } , τki 1 + Ccg/k2 }.\n(54)\nThe complete adaptive consensus ADMM is shown in Algorithm 1. We suggest updating the stepsize every Tf = 2 iterations, fixing the safeguarding threshold cor = 0.2, and choosing a large convergence constant Ccg = 1010."

The minimization sub-step (3) in this case is solved by L-BFGS (Liu & Nocedal, 1989).\nSupport Vector Machines (SVMs) minimize the distributed objective function (Goldstein et al., 2016)\nfi(ui) = C ni∑ j=1 max{1− ci,jDTi,jui, 0}, g(v) = 1 2 ‖v‖22 (57)\nwhere Di,j ∈ Rm is the jth sample on the ith node, and ci,j ∈ {−1, 1} is its label.

Synthetic1 contains samples from a normal distribution, and Synthetic2 contains samples from a\nmixture of 10 random Gaussians. Synthetic2 is heterogeneous because the data block on each individual node is sampled from only 1 of the 10 Gaussians. We also acquire large empirical datasets from the LIBSVM webpage (Liu et al., 2009), as well as MNIST digital images (LeCun et al., 1998), and CIFAR10 object images (Krizhevsky & Hinton, 2009). For binary classification tasks (SVM and logreg), we equally split the 10 category labels of MNIST and CIFAR into “positive” and “negative” groups. We use a graph from the Seventh DIMACS Implementation Challenge on Semidefinite and Related Optimization Problems following (Burer & Monteiro, 2003) for Semidefinite Programming (SDP). The regularization parameter is fixed at ρ = 10 in all experiments.\nConsensus ADMM (CADMM) (Boyd et al., 2011), residual balancing (RB-ADMM) (He et al., 2000), adaptive ADMM (AADMM) (Xu et al., 2017a), and consensus residual balancing (CRB-ADMM) (Song et al., 2016) are implemented and reported for comparison.

CADMM with default penalty τ = 1 (Boyd et al., 2011) is often slow to converge. ACADMM outperforms the other ADMM variants on all the real-world\ndatasets, and is competitive with AADMM on two homogeneous synthetic datasets where the curvature may be globally estimated with a scalar.\nACADMM is more reliable than AADMM since the curvature estimation becomes difficult for high dimensional variables. RB is relatively stable but sometimes has difficulty finding the exact optimal penalty, as the adaptation can stop because the difference of residuals are not significant enough to trigger changes. RB does not change the initial penalty in several experiments such as logistic regression on RCV1. CRB achieves comparable results with RB, which suggests that the relative sizes of local residuals may not always be very informative. ACADMM significantly boosts AADMM and the local curvature estimations are helpful in practice."

      "text" : "Fig. 1a shows that the practical convergence of ADMM is sensitive to the choice of penalty parameter. ACADMM is robust to the selection of the initial penalty parameter and achieves promising results for both homogeneous and heterogeneous data, comparable to ADMM with a fine-tuned penalty parameter.\nWe study scalability of the method by varying the number of workers and training samples (Fig. 1b). ACADMM is fairly robust to the scaling factor. AADMM occasion-\nally performs well when small numbers of nodes are used, while ACADMM is much more stable. RB and CRB are more stable than AADMM, but cannot compete with ACADMM. Fig. 1c (bottom) presents the acceleration in (wall-clock secs) achieved by increasing the number of workers.\nFinally, ACADMM is insensitive to the safeguarding hyper-parameters, correlation threshold cor and convergence constant Ccg. Though tuning these parameters may further improve the performance, the fixed default values generally perform well in our experiments and enable ACADMM to run without user oversight. In further experiments in the supplementary material, we also show that ACADMM is fairly insensitive to the regularization parameter ρ in our classification/regression models."

Numerical experiments on various applications and real-world datasets demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of ACADMM.

By automating the selection of algorithm parameters, adaptive methods make distributed systems more reliable, and more accessible to users that lack expertise in optimization."
