      "text" : "The shortest path distance is the most fundamental distance function between vertices in a graph, and it is widely used in computer science and machine learning. In this paper we want to understand the geometry induced by the shortest path distance in randomly generated geometric graphs like k-nearest neighbor graphs.\nConsider a neighborhood graph G built from an i.i.d. sample X1, ..., Xn drawn according to some density p on X ⊂ Rd (for exact definitions see Section 2). Assume that the sample size n goes to infinity. Two questions arise about the behavior of the shortest path distance between fixed points in this graph:\n1. Weight assignment: Given a distance measure D on X , how can we assign edge weights such that the shortest path distance in the graph converges to D?\n2. Limit distance: Given a function h that assigns weights of the form h(‖Xi−Xj‖) to edges in G, what is the limit of the shortest path distance in this weighted graph as n→∞?\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nThe first question has already been studied in some special cases. Tenenbaum et al. (2000) discuss the case of ε- and kNN graphs when p is uniform and D is the geodesic distance. Sajama & Orlitsky (2005) extend these results to ε-graphs from a general density p by introducing edge weights that depend on an explicit estimate of the underlying density. In a recent preprint, Hwang & Hero (2012) consider completely connected graphs whose vertices come from a general density p and whose edge weights are powers of distances.\nThere is little work regarding the second question. Tenenbaum et al. (2000) answer the question for a very special case with h(x) = x and uniform p. Hwang & Hero (2012) study the case h(x) = xa, a > 1 for arbitrary density p.\nWe have a more general point of view. In Section 4 we show that depending on properties of the function h(x), the shortest path distance operates in different regimes, and we find the limit of the shortest path distance for particular function classes of h(x). Our method also reveals a direct way to answer the first question without explicit density estimation.\nAn interesting special case is the unweighted kNN graph, which corresponds to the constant weight function h(x) = 1. We show that the shortest path distance on unweighted kNN-graphs converges to a limit distance on X that does not conform to the natural intuition and induces a geometry on X that can be detrimental for machine learning applications.\nOur results have implications for many machine learning algorithms, see Section 5 for more discussion. (1) The shortest paths based on unweighted kNN graphs prefer to go through low density regions, and they even accept large detours if this avoids passing through high density regions (see Figure 1 for an illustration). This is exactly the opposite of what we would like to achieve in most applications. (2) For manifold learning algorithms like Isomap, unweighted kNN graphs introduce a fundamental bias that leads to huge distortions in the estimated manifold structure (see Figure 2 for an\nillustration). (3) In the area of semi-supervised learning, a standard approach is to construct a graph on the sample points, then compute a distance between vertices of the graph, and finally use a standard distancebased classifier to label the unlabeled points (e.g., Sajama & Orlitsky, 2005 and Bijral et al., 2011). The crucial property exploited in this approach is that distances between points should be small if they are in the same high-density region. Shortest path distances in unweighted kNN graphs and their limit distances do exactly the opposite, so they can be misleading for this approach."

      "text" : "Consider a closed, connected subset X ⊆ Rd that is endowed with a density function p with respect to the Lebesgue measure. For the ease of presentation we assume for the rest of the paper that the density p is Lipschitz continuous with Lipschitz constant L and bounded away from 0 by pmin > 0. To simplify notation later on, we define the shorthand q(x) := (p(x))1/d.\nWe will consider different metrics on X . A ball with respect to a particular metric d in X will be written as B(x, r, d) := {y ∈ X | d(x, y) ≤ r}. We denote the Euclidean volume of the unit ball in Rd by ηd.\nAssume the finite dataset X1, ..., Xn has been drawn i.i.d according to p. We build a geometric graph G = (V,E) that has the data points as vertices and connects vertices that are close. Specifically, for the kNN graph we connect Xi with Xj if Xi is among the k nearest neighbors of Xj or vice versa. For the ε-graph, we connect Xi and Xj whenever their Euclidean distance\nsatisfies ‖Xi − Xj‖ ≤ ε. In this paper, all graphs are undirected, but might carry edge weights wij ≥ 0. In unweighted graphs, we define the length of a path by its number of edges, in weighted graphs we define the length of a path by the sum of the edge weights along the path. In both cases, the shortest path (SP) distance Dsp(x, y) between two vertices x, y ∈ V is the length of the shortest path connecting them.\nLet f be a positive continuous scalar function defined on X . For a given path γ in X that connects x with y and is parameterized by t, we define the f -length of the path as\nDf,γ = ∫ γ f(γ(t))|γ′(t)|dt.\nThis expression is also known as the line integral along γ with respect to f . The f -geodesic path between x and y is the path with minimum f -length.\nThe f -length of the geodesic path is called the f - distance between x and y. We denote it by df (x, y). If f(x) is a function of the density p at x, then the f - distance is sometimes called a density based distance (Sajama & Orlitsky, 2005).\nThe f -distance on X is a metric, and in particular it satisfies the triangle inequality. Another useful property is that for a point u on the f -geodesic path between x and y we have Df (x, y) = Df (x, u)+Df (u, y).\nThe function f determines the behavior of the f - distance. When f(x) is a monotonically decreasing function of density p(x), passing through a high density region will cost less than passing through a low density region. It works the other way round when f is a monotonically increasing function of density. A constant function does not impose any preference between low and high density regions.\nThe main purpose of this paper is to study the relationship between the SP distance in various geometric graphs and particular f -distances on X . For example, in Section 3 we show that the SP distance in unweighted kNN graphs converges to the f -distance with f(x) = p(x)1/d.\nIn the rest of the paper, all statements refer to points x and y in the interior of X such that their f -geodesic path is bounded away from the boundary of X ."

      "text" : "In this section we study the behavior of the shortest path distance in the family of unweighted kNN graphs. We show that the rescaled graph SP distance converges to the q-distance in the original space X .\nTheorem 1 (SP limit in unweighted kNN graphs) Consider the unweighted kNN graph Gn based on the i.i.d. sample X1, ..., Xn ∈ X from the density p. Choose λ and a such that\nλ ≥ 4L η 1/d d p 1+1/d min\n(k n )1/d , a < 1− logk ( 4d(1 + λ)2 ) .\nFix two points x = Xi and y = Xj. Then there exist e1(λ, k),e2(λ, k, n),e3(λ) (see below for explicit definitions) such that with probability at least 1 − 3e3n exp(−λ2ka/6) we have\ne1Dq(x, y) ≤ e2Dsp(x, y) ≤ Dq(x, y)− e2.\nMoreover if n → ∞, k → ∞, k/n → 0, λ → 0 and λ2ka/ log(n) → ∞, then the probability converges to 1 and (k/(ηdn))\n1/dDsp(x, y) converges to Dq(x, y) in probability.\nThe convergence conditions on n and k are the ones to be expected for random geometric graphs. The condition λ2ka/ log(n) → ∞ is slightly stronger than the usual k/ log(n)→∞ condition. This condition is satisfied as soon as k is of the order a bit larger than log(n). For example k ≈ log(n)1+α with a small α will work. For k smaller than log(n), the graphs are not connected anyway (see e.g. Penrose, 1999) and are unsuitable for machine learning applications.\nBefore proving Theorem 1, we need to state a couple of propositions and lemmas. We start by introducing some ad-hoc notation:\nDefinition 2 (Connectivity parameters) Consider a geometric graph based on a fixed set of points X1, ..., Xn ∈ Rd. Let rlow be a real number such that Df (Xi, Xj) ≤ rlow implies that Xi is connected to Xj in the graph. Analogously, consider rup to be a real number such that Df (Xi, Xj) ≥ rup implies that Xi is not connected to Xj in the graph.\nDefinition 3 (Dense sampling assumption) Consider a graph G with connectivity parameters rlow and rup. We say that it satisfies the dense sampling assumption if there exists an ς < rlow/4 such that for all x ∈ X there exists a vertex y in the graph with Df (x, y) ≤ ς.\nProposition 4 (Bounding Dsp by Df) Consider any unweighted geometric graph based on a fixed set X1, ..., Xn ∈ X ⊂ Rd that satisfies the dense sampling assumption. Fix two vertices x and y of the graph and set\ne1 = (rlow − 2ς)/rup , e2 = rlow − 2ς.\nThen the following statement holds:\ne1Df (x, y) ≤ e2Dsp(x, y) ≤ Df (x, y)− e2.\nProof. Right hand side. Consider the f -geodesic path γ∗x,y connecting x to y. Divide γ ∗ x,y to segments by u0 = x, u1, ..., ut, ut+1 = y such that Df (ui, ui+1) = rlow−2ς for i = 0, ..., t−1 and Df (ut, ut+1) ≤ rlow−2ς (see Figure 3). Because of the dense sampling assumption, for all i = 1, ..., t there exists a vertex vi in the ball B(ui, ς;Df ) and we have\nDf (vi, ui) ≤ ς Df (ui, ui+1) ≤ rlow − 2ς\nDf (ui+1, vi+1) ≤ ς.\nApplying the triangle inequality gives Df (vi, vi+1) ≤ rlow, which shows that vi and vi+1 are connected. By summing up along the path we get\n(rlow − 2ς)(Dsp(x, y)− 1) ≤ (rlow − 2ς)t\n= t−1∑ i=0 Df (ui, ui+1) (a) ≤ Df (x, y).\nIn step (a) we use the simple fact that if u is on the f -geodesic path from x to y, then\nDf (x, y) = Df (x, u) +Df (u, y).\nLeft hand side. Assume that the graph SP between x and y consists of vertices z0 = x, z1, ..., zs = y. By Df (zi, zi+1) ≤ rup we can write\n(rlow − 2ς)Dsp(x, y) ≥ rlow − 2ς rup\n∑s−1 i=0 Df (zi, zi+1)\n≥ rlow − 2ς rup Df (x, y).\n2\nThe next lemma uses the Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of p to show that q(x)‖x − y‖ is a good approximation of Dq(x, y) in small intervals.\nLemma 5 (Approximating Dq in small balls) Consider any given λ < 1. If ‖x− y‖ ≤ pminλ/L then the following statements hold:\n1. We can approximate p(y) by the density at x:\np(y)(1− λ) ≤ p(x) ≤ p(y)(1 + λ).\n2. We can approximate Dq(x, y) by q(x)‖x− y‖:\n(1−λ)1/dq(x)‖x−y‖ ≤ Dq(x, y) ≤ (1+λ)1/dq(x)‖x−y‖.\nProof. Part (1). By the Lipschitz continuity of p for ‖x− y‖ ≤ δ we have\n|p(x)− p(y)| ≤ L‖x− y‖ ≤ Lδ.\nSetting δ = λpmin/L leads to the result.\nPart (2). The previous part can be written as\n(1− λ)1/dq(x) ≤ q(y) ≤ (1 + λ)1/dq(x).\nDenote the q-geodesic path between x and y by γ∗ and the line segment connecting x to y by l. Using the definition of a q-geodesic path, we can write∫\nγ∗ q(γ∗(t))|γ∗(t)′|dt ≤ ∫ l q(l(t))|l(t)′|dt ≤\n(1 + λ)1/d ∫ l q(x)|l(t)′|dt = (1 + λ)1/dq(x)‖x− y‖.\nAlso,∫ γ∗ q(γ∗(t))|γ∗(t)′|dt ≥ (1− λ)1/d ∫ γ∗ q(x)|γ∗(t)′|dt\n≥ (1− λ)1/dq(x)‖x− y‖.\n2\nNow we are going to show how the quantities rlow and rup introduced in Definition 2 can be bounded in random unweighted kNN graphs and how they are related to the metric Dq.\nTo this end, we define the kNN q-radii at vertex x as Rq,k(x) = Dq(x, y) and the approximated kNN q-radii at vertex x as R̂q,k(x) = q(x)‖x − y‖, where y is the k-nearest neighbor of x. The minimum and maximum values of kNN q-radii are defined as\nRminq,k = min u Rq,k(u) , R max q,k = max u Rq,k(u).\nAccordingly we define R̂minq,k and R̂ max p,k for the approximated q-radii.\nThe following proposition is a direct adaptation of Proposition 31 from von Luxburg et al. (2010).\nProposition 6 (Bounding Rminp,k and R max p,k ) Given λ < 1/2 define rlow and rup as\nrlow := ( k\n(1 + λ)nηd\n)1/d , rup := ( k (1− λ)nηd )1/d and radius r̂low and r̂up as\nr̂low = rlow\n(1 + λ)1/d , r̂up = rup (1− λ)1/d .\nAssume that r̂up ≤ λp1+1/dmin /L. Then\nP ( Rminp,k ≤ rlow ) ≤ n exp(−λ2k/6)\nP ( Rmaxp,k ≥ rup ) ≤ n exp(−λ2k/6).\nProof. Consider a ball Bx with radius r̂low/q(x) around x. Note that r̂low/q(x) ≤ pminλ/L , so we can bound the density of points in Bx by (1 + λ)p(x) using Lemma 5. Denote the probability mass of the ball by µ(x), which is bounded by\nµ(x) = ∫ Bx p(s)ds ≤ (1 + λ)p(x) ∫ Bx ds\n= (1 + λ)r̂dlowηd =: µmax.\nObserve that R̂q,k(x) ≤ r̂low if and only if there are at least k data points in Bx. Let Q ∼ Binomial(n, µ(x)) and S ∼ Binomial(n, µmax). By the choice of r̂low we have E(S) = k/(1 + λ). It follows that\nP ( R̂q,k(x) ≤ r̂low ) = P ( Q ≥ k ) ≤ P ( S ≥ k ) = P ( S ≥ (1 + λ)E(S) ) .\nNow we apply a concentration inequality for binomial random variables (see Prop. 28 in von Luxburg et al., 2010) and a union bound to get\nP ( R̂minq,k ≤ r̂low ) ≤ P ( ∃i : R̂q,k(Xi) ≤ r̂low ) ≤ n exp ( −λ2k 3(1 + λ)\n) ≤ n exp(−λ2k/6).\nBy a similar argument we can prove the analogous statement for Rmaxp,k . Finally, Lemma 5 gives\nR̂minq,k ≥ Rminq,k\n(1 + λ)1/d , R̂maxq,k ≤ Rmaxq,k (1− λ)1/d .\n2\nThe following proposition shows how the sampling parameter ς can be chosen to satisfy the dense sampling\nassumption. Note that we decided to choose ς in a form that keeps the statements in Theorem 1 simple, rather than optimizing over the parameter ς to maximize the probability of success.\nLemma 7 (Sampling lemma) Assume X1, ..., Xn are sampled i.i.d. from a probability distribution p and a constant a < 1 is given. Set λ as in Theorem 1,\nς := (1 + λ)1/d ( ka ηdn )1/d ,\nand e3(λ) := 2 d/(1 − λ)2. Then with probability at least 1 − e3n exp(−ka/6), for every x ∈ X exists a y ∈ X1, ..., Xn such that Dq(x, y) ≤ ς.\nProof. Define ς0 = (1 + λ) −1/dς. We prove that for every x ∈ X , there exist a vertex y such that q(x)‖x− y‖ ≤ ς0. Then using Lemma 5 will give the result.\nThe proof idea is a generalization of the covering argument in the proof of the sampling lemma in Tenenbaum et al. (2000). We first construct a covering of X that consists of balls with approximately the same probability mass. The centers of the balls are chosen by an iterative procedure that ensures that no center is contained in any of the balls we have so far. We choose the radius ς0/q(x) for the ball at point x and call it Bq(x, ς0). The probability mass of this ball can be bounded by\nV(Bq(x, ς0)) ≥ (1− λ)ςd0ηd\nNote that smaller balls Bq(u, (1 − λ)1/dς0/2) are all disjoint. To see this, consider two balls Bq(x, (1 − λ)1/dς0/2), Bq(y, (1− λ)1/dς0/2). Observe that\n(1− λ)1/dς0 2q(x) + (1− λ)1/dς0 2q(y) ≤ ς0 q(x) .\nWe can bound the total number of balls by\nS ≤ 1 V(Bq(x, (1− λ)1/dς0/2)) ≤ 2 d ηd(1− λ)2ςd0 .\nNow we sample points from the underlying space and apply the same concentration inequality as above. We bound the probability that a ball Bq(u, ς0) does not contain any sample point (“is empty”) by\nPr(Ball i is empty) ≤ exp(−nςd0ηd/6).\nRewriting and Substituting the value of ς0 gives Pr(no ball is empty) ≥ 1− ∑ iPr(Bi is empty)\n≥ 1− S · e−nς d 0 ηd/6 ≥ 1− 2\ndne−k a/6 (1− λ)2ka\n≥ 1− 2 dne−k a/6\n(1− λ)2 = 1− e3ne−k a/6.\n2\nProof of Theorem 1. Set rlow and rup as in Proposition 6. The assumption on λ ensures that r̂up ≤ λp1+1/dmin /L. It follows from Proposition 6 that the statements about rlow and rup in Definition 2 both hold for Gn with probability at least µ1 = 1 − 2n exp(−λ2k/6). Set ς as in Lemma 7 and define the constant a < 1− logk ( 4d(1 + λ)2 ) . By this choice we have rlow > 4ς. Lemma 7 shows that the sampling assumption holds in Gn for the selected ς with probability at least µ2 = 1−e3n exp(−ka/6). Together, all these statements about Gn hold with probability at least µ := 1− 3e3n exp(−λ2ka/6).\nUsing Proposition 4 completes the first part of the theorem. For the convergence we have\ne1 = rlow − 2ς rup\n= (1− λ\n1 + λ )1/d − 2 (1− λ2 k1−a )1/d .\nThis shows that e1 → 1 as λ → 0 and k → ∞. For λ → 0 and k → ∞ we can set a to any constant smaller than 1. Finally it is easy to check that e2 → 0 and ς/rlow → 0. 2"

For a subadditive h, the SP in the graph will satisfy the triangle inequality and it will prefer jumping along distant vertices. Based on this intuition, we come up with the following guess for vertices along the SP: For ε-graphs we have the approximation ‖Xi − Xj‖ ≈ ε and f(x) = h(ε)/ε. For kNN-graphs we have ‖Xi −Xj‖ ≈ r/q(Xi) with r = (k/(nηd))1/d and\nf(x) = h( r q(x) ) q(x) r , f̃(x) = h( r x1/d ) x1/d r .\nWe formally prove this statement for kNN graphs in the next theorem.

The essence of the proof is similar to the one in Theorem 1, we present a sketch only. The main step is to adapt Proposition 4 to weighted graphs with weight function h. Adapting Lemma 5 for general f is straightforward. The lemma states that Df (x, y) ≈λ f(x)‖x − y‖ for nearby points. We set rlow and ς as in the sampling lemma and Proposition 6 (these are properties of kNN graphs and hold for any f). Proposition 6 says that in kNN graphs, x is connected to y with high probability iff ‖x−y‖ 4λ r/q(x). The probabilistic argument and the criteria on choosing λ are similar to Theorem 1.\nFirst we show that Dsp(x, y) 4λ Df (x, y). Consider the f -geodesic path γ∗x,y connecting x to y. Divide γ∗x,y into segments u0 = x, u1, ..., ut, ut+1 = y such that Dq(ui, ui+1) = rlow − 2ς for i = 0, ..., t − 1\nand Dq(ut, ut+1) ≤ rlow − 2ς (see Figure 3). There exists a vertex vi near to ui such that vi and vi+1 are connected. We show that the length of the path x, v1, ..., vt, y is approximately smaller than Df (x, y). From the path construction we have\n‖vi − vi+1‖ ≈λ ‖ui − ui+1‖ ≈λ r/q(ui).\nBy summing up along the path we get Dsp(x, y) ≤ ∑ i h(‖vi − vi+1‖)\n≈λ ∑ i h(‖ui − ui+1‖) ≈λ ∑ i h( r q(ui) )\n= ∑ i f(ui) r q(ui) ≈λ ∑ i f(ui)‖ui − ui+1‖\nFrom the adaptation of Lemma 5 we have Df (ui, ui+1) ≈λ f(ui)‖ui − ui+1‖, which gives∑\ni f(ui)‖ui − ui+1‖ ≈λ ∑ iDf (ui, ui+1) = Df (x, y).\nThis shows that Dsp(x, y) 4λ Df (x, y).\nFor the other way round, we use a technique different from Proposition 4. Denote the graph shortest path between x and y by π : z0 = x, z1, ..., zs, zs+1 = y. Consider π′ as a continuous path in X corresponding to π. As in the previous part, divide π′ into segments u0 = x, u1, ..., ut, ut+1 = y (see Figure 3). From Dq(zi, zi+1) 4λ r and Dq(ui, ui+1) ≈λ r we have s <λ t. Using this and the subadditivity of h we get\nDsp(x, y) = ∑ i h(‖zi − zi+1‖) <λ ∑ i h(‖ui − ui+1‖).\nTo prove Dsp(x, y) <λ Df (x, y), we can write∑ i h(‖ui − ui+1‖) ≈λ ∑ i h( r q(ui) ) = ∑ i f(ui)r q(ui)\n≈λ ∑ i f(ui)‖ui − ui+1‖\n≈λ ∑ iDf (ui, ui+1) ≥ Df (x, y).\n2 The proof of Theorem 8 is a direct consequence of this theorem.

For this reason, we do not expect a big difference between superadditive weighted kNN graphs and ε-graphs: the long edges in the kNN graph will not be used anyway. However, due to technical problems we did not manage to prove a formal theorem to this effect.\nThe special case of the superadditive family h(x) = xa, a > 1 is treated in Hwang & Hero (2012) by completely different methods. Although their results are presented for complete graphs, we believe that it can be extended to ε and kNN graphs. We are not aware of any other result for the limit of SP distance in the superadditive regime."

(2) If the intrinsic dimensionality of our data d is high. The latter is because in the q-distance, the underlying density arises in the form of p(x)1/d, where the exponent flattens the distribution for large d."

      "text" : "Isomap is a widely used method for low dimensional manifold embedding (Tenenbaum et al., 2000). The main idea is to use metric multidimensional scaling on the matrix of pairwise geodesic distances. Using the Euclidean length of edges as their weights will lead to the convergence of the SP distance to the geodesic distance. But what would be the effect of applying Isomap to unweighted graphs?\nOur results of the last section already hint that there is no big difference between unweighted and weighted ε-graphs for Isomap. However, the case of kNN graphs is different because weighted and unweighted shortest paths measure different quantities. The effect of applying Isomap to unweighted kNN graphs can easily be demonstrated by the following simulation. We sample 2000 points in R2 from a distribution that has two uniform high-density squares, surrounded by a uniform low density region. An unweighted kNN graph is constructed with k = 10, and we apply Isomap with target dimension 2. The result is depicted in Figure 2. We can see that the Isomap embedding heavily distorts the original data: it stretches high density regions and compacts low density regions to make the vertex distribution close to uniform."

      "heading" : "5.2. Semi-supervised learning",
      "text" : "Our work has close relationship to some of the literature on semi-supervised learning (SSL). In regularization based approaches, the underlying density is either exploited implicitly as attempted in Laplacian regularization (Zhu et al., 2003 but see Nadler et al., 2009; Alamgir & von Luxburg, 2011 and Zhou & Belkin, 2011), or more explicitly as in measure based regularization (Bousquet et al., 2004). Alternatively, one defines new distance functions on the data that take the density of the unlabeled points into account. Here, the papers by Sajama & Orlitsky (2005) and Bijral et al. (2011) are most related to our paper. Both papers suggest different ways to approximate the density based distance from the data. In Sajama & Orlitsky (2005) it is achieved by estimating the underlying density while in Bijral et al. (2011), the authors omit the density estimation and use an approximation.\nOur work shows a simpler way to converge to a similar distance function for a specific family of f -distances, namely constructing a kNN graph and assigning edge weights as in Equation 1."

      "heading" : "6. Conclusions and outlook",
      "text" : "We have seen in this paper that the shortest path distance on unweighted kNN graphs has a very funny limit behavior: it prefers to go through regions of low density and even takes large detours in order to avoid the high density regions. In hindsight, this result seems obvious, but most people are surprised when they first hear about it. In particular, we believe that it is important to spread this insight among machine learning practitioners, who routinely use unweighted kNN-graphs as a simple, robust alternative to ε-graphs.\nIn some sense, unweighted ε-graphs and unweighted kNN graphs behave as “duals” of each other: while degrees in ε-graphs reflect the underlying density, they are independent of the density in kNN graphs. While the shortest path in ε-graphs is independent of the underlying density and converges to the Euclidean distance, the shortest paths in kNN graphs take the density into account.\nCurrent practice is to use ε and kNN graphs more or less interchangeably in many applications, and the decision for one or the other graph is largely driven by robustness or convenience considerations. However, as our results show it is important to be aware of the implicit consequences of this choice. Each graph carries different information about the underlying density, and depending on how a particular machine learning\nalgorithms makes use of the graph structures, it might either miss out or benefit from this information."
