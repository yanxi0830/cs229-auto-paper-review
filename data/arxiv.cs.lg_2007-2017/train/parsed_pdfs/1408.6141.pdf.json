The proposed algorithm, called DCDRTLS, outperforms the previously-proposed RTLS algorithms, which are based on the line search method, with reduced computational complexity. We perform a comprehensive analysis of the DCD-RTLS algorithm and show that it is asymptotically unbiased as well as being stable in the mean. We also find a lower bound for the forgetting factor that ensures mean-square stability of the algorithm and calculate the theoretical steadystate mean-square deviation (MSD).

INTRODUCTION\nost linear systems in signal processing, control, or econometrics applications can be described using the\nerrors-in-variables (EIV) models. In the EIV models, both input and output data of a linear system are assumed to be contaminated with additive noise [1], [2]. The total leastsquares (TLS) method is well suited for identification of the EIV models [3], [4]. Unlike the least-squares (LS) method that minimizes the sum of squared estimation errors without accounting for the noise in the input data, TLS is devised to minimize the perturbation in both input and output data that makes the input-output data fit through a linear system. Therefore, TLS is expected to have superior performance to LS when the input data as well as the output data is noisy.\nIt has been shown that the TLS estimate of a linear system is in fact the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue of its augmented and weighted data covariance matrix that has the smallest absolute value [5]. A popular methodology to\nThis work was supported in part by the Academy of Finland. R. Arablouei and K.

Werner is with the Department of Signal Processing and Acoustics, School of Electrical Engineering, Aalto University, Espoo, Finland (email: stefan.werner@aalto.fi).\ncompute this eigenvector, also known as the minor component, is to minimize a Rayleigh quotient (RQ) cost function [6] using any optimization technique such as gradient descent [7], [8] or line search [9], [10]. Another common practice is to utilize the inverse power method (inverse iteration) [11]-[13].\nThe recursive TLS (RTLS) algorithms proposed in [9], [10], and [12] for adaptive finite-impulse-response (FIR) filtering have computational complexities of order \uD835\uDC42(\uD835\uDC3F), where \uD835\uDC3F is the system order, when the input data is shift-structured. All three algorithms essentially accomplish the same task of computing the adaptive FIR filter weights by recursively estimating the minor component from the data available up to the current time. As a result, they perform very similarly at the steady state.\nIn [12], it is shown that the RTLS algorithm proposed therein, which is based on the inverse power method and a line search strategy, is asymptotically consistent, i.e., converges to the optimal solution with probability one, when the perfect statistical knowledge of the input signal and noise is available or alternatively the forgetting factor is set to unity.\nIn this paper, we propose an RTLS algorithm for estimating the parameters of an EIV model for adaptive FIR filtering by employing the inverse power method together with the dichotomous coordinate-descent (DCD) iterations. We utilize the DCD iterations to solve two systems of linear equations associated with the calculation of two auxiliary vector variables. The DCD algorithm is a shift-and-add algorithm and can solve a system of linear equation using only additions and bit shifts with no multiplication [22]. As a result, the proposed algorithm, called DCD-RTLS, has a computational complexity of \uD835\uDC42(\uD835\uDC3F) when there is a shift structure in the input vectors. It requires 10\uD835\uDC3F + 2 multiplications as opposed to 15\uD835\uDC3F + 11, 16\uD835\uDC3F + 19, and 22\uD835\uDC3F + 69 multiplications required by the algorithms of [9], [10], and [12], respectively. In addition, simulation results show that the DCD-RTLS algorithm outperforms these algorithms in terms of convergence speed.\nWe examine the mean and mean-square performance of the DCD-RTLS algorithm. We show that it is convergent in the mean and asymptotically unbiased. We calculate a lower bound for the forgetting factor that guarantees mean-square stability of the DCD-RTLS algorithm. We show that, at the steady state, the DCD-RTLS algorithm performs akin to a\nM\nbias-compensated recursive LS (BCRLS) algorithm. We also calculate the theoretical steady-state mean-square deviation (MSD) of the DCD-RTLS algorithm and corroborate its accuracy through numerical examples."

Thus, \uD835\uDC41 defines the maximum number of entries in \uD835\uDC261,\uD835\uDC5B and \uD835\uDC262,\uD835\uDC5B that are updated at each time instant. Consequently, when \uD835\uDC41 < \uD835\uDC3F, the DCD iterations implements a form of selective partial updates [25], [26]."

Moreover, by selecting the forgetting factor as \uD835\uDF06 = 1 − 2−\uD835\uDC43 where \uD835\uDC43 is a positive integer, we can replace multiplications by \uD835\uDF06 with additions and bit-shifts [23]. When there is shift structure in the input data, i.e., the input vector has the following form:\n\uD835̃\uDC31\uD835\uDC5B = [\uD835̃\uDC65\uD835\uDC5B , \uD835̃\uDC65\uD835\uDC5B−1, … , \uD835̃\uDC65\uD835\uDC5B−\uD835\uDC3F+1] \uD835\uDC47\nwhere \uD835̃\uDC65\uD835\uDC5B ∈ ℝ is the noisy input signal, updating \uD835\uDEBD\uD835\uDC5B is significantly simplified. In this case, the upper-left (\uD835\uDC3F − 1) × (\uD835\uDC3F − 1) block of \uD835\uDEBD\uD835\uDC5B−1 can be copied to the lower-right (\uD835\uDC3F − 1) × (\uD835\uDC3F − 1) block of \uD835\uDEBD\uD835\uDC5B. Thus, only the first row and the first column of \uD835\uDEBD\uD835\uDC5B are directly updated. Due to the symmetry of \uD835\uDEBD\uD835\uDC5B, it is sufficient to update only the first column.\nIn Table III, we present the number of required multiplication, division, and square-root operations per iteration by the DCD-RTLS algorithm and the algorithms of [9], [10], and [12], which are called kRTLS, xRTLS, and AIP, respectively. We consider both cases of shift-structured and non-shift-structured input data."

The input and output noises are also zeromean i.i.d. multivariate Gaussian, i.e., \uD835\uDC2E\uD835\uDC5B~\uD835\uDCA9(\uD835\uDFCE, \uD835\uDF02\uD835\uDC08) and \uD835\uDF08\uD835\uDC5B~\uD835\uDCA9(0, \uD835\uDF09). To obtain the experimental results, we evaluate\nthe expectations by taking the ensemble-average over 103 independent simulation runs and compute the steady-state values by averaging over 103 steady-state instances. In Fig. 1, we plot the simulated time evolution of the MSD, i.e., \uD835\uDC38[‖\uD835̌\uDC30\uD835\uDC5B‖ 2], for the recursion of (12) and the DCD-RTLS, kRTLS, xRTLS, and AIP algorithms. The curves are for different values of \uD835\uDF02 and \uD835\uDEFE when \uD835\uDC43 = 10 (\uD835\uDF06 = 0.999), \uD835\uDC40 = 16, \uD835\uDC3B = 1, and \uD835\uDC41 = 1. Fig. 1 shows that the learning curve of the DCD-RTLS algorithm and the recursion of (12) overlay. This means that, even when exercising only a single iteration of the DCD algorithm at each time instant, the solutions provided by the DCD algorithm are sufficiently accurate and the assumption made at the beginning of Section V is realistic. We also observe from Fig. 1 that the DCD-RTLS algorithm converges faster than its contenders, the kRTLS, xRTLS, and AIP algorithms. Moreover, all the considered algorithms perform similarly at the steady state. Therefore, the calculated theoretical steady-state MSD, (50), can be used to predict the steady-state MSD of all the considered algorithms.\nIn Fig. 2, we plot the lower bound on \uD835\uDF06 given in (44) versus \uD835\uDF02 for the considered scenario where tr{\uD835\uDC11−1} = 12.82, \uD835\uDF01min{\uD835\uDC11} = 0.2, and \uD835\uDF01max{\uD835\uDC11} = 1.8. Notice that, to make the DCD-RTLS algorithm mean-square-stable in the presence of high input noise, \uD835\uDF06 should be chosen close to one. However, in the presence of low input noise, mean-square stability is ensured with any \uD835\uDF06 larger than about 0.92. In Fig. 3, we compare the theoretical and experimental steady-state MSDs of the DCD-RTLS algorithm by plotting them against \uD835\uDF02 for different values of \uD835\uDF06 and \uD835\uDEFE when \uD835\uDC40 = 16, \uD835\uDC3B = 1, and \uD835\uDC41 = 1. Fig. 3 shows a good match between theory and experiment."

      "text" : "We proposed a reduced-complexity recursive total leastsquares (RTLS) algorithm in the context of adaptive FIR filtering employing the inverse power method and the dichotomous coordinate-descent (DCD) iterations. We utilized the DCD algorithm to solve two systems of linear equations associated with the calculation of two auxiliary vector variables. Simulation results confirmed that the proposed DCD-RTLS algorithm outperforms the other existing RTLS algorithms while being computationally more efficient. We studied the performance of the DCD-RTLS algorithm and established its convergence and stability in both mean and mean-square senses. We also calculated the theoretical steadystate mean-square deviation (MSD) of the DCD-RTLS algorithm and verified via simulations that the theoretically predicted values of the steady-state MSD are in good agreement with the experimental results."

We perform a comprehensive analysis of the DCD-RTLS algorithm and show that it is asymptotically unbiased as well as being stable in the mean. We also find a lower bound for the forgetting factor that ensures mean-square stability of the algorithm and calculate the theoretical steadystate mean-square deviation (MSD). We verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and the accuracy of the predicted steady-state MSD via simulations.",
