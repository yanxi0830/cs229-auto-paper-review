      "text" : "The structured perceptron ((Collins, 2002), henceforth denoted CSP) is a prominent training algorithm for structured prediction models in NLP, due to its effective parameter estimation and simple implementation. It has been utilized in numerous NLP applications including word segmentation and POS tagging (Zhang and Clark, 2008), dependency parsing (Koo and Collins, 2010; Goldberg and Elhadad, 2010; Martins et al., 2013), semantic parsing (Zettlemoyer and Collins, 2007) and information extraction (Hoffmann et al., 2011; Reichart and Barzilay, 2012), if to name just a few.\nLike some training algorithms in structured prediction (e.g. structured SVM (Taskar et al., 2004; Tsochantaridis et al., 2005), MIRA (Crammer and Singer, 2003) and LaSo (Daumé III and Marcu,\n2005)), CSP considers in its update rule the difference between complete predicted and gold standard labels (Sec. 2). Unlike others (e.g. factored MIRA (McDonald et al., 2005b; McDonald et al., 2005a) and dual-loss based methods (Meshi et al., 2010)) it does not exploit the structure of the predicted label. This may result in valuable information being lost.\nConsider, for example, the gold and predicted dependency trees of Figure 3.1. The substantial difference between the trees may be mostly due to the difference in roots (are and worse, respectively). Parameter update w.r.t this mistake may thus be more useful than an update w.r.t the complete trees.\nIn this work we present a new perceptron algorithm with an update rule that exploits the structure of a predicted label when it differs from the gold label (Section 3). Our algorithm is called The Structured Weighted Violations Perceptron (SWVP) as its update rule is based on a weighted sum of updates w.r.t violating assignments and non-violating assignments: assignments to the input example, derived from the predicted label, that score higher (for violations) and lower (for non-violations) than the gold standard label according to the current model.\nOur concept of violating assignment is based on Huang et al. (2012) that presented a variant of the CSP algorithm where the argmax inference problem is replaced with a violation finding function. Their update rule, however, is identical to that of the CSP algorithm. Importantly, although CSP and the above variant do not exploit the internal structure of the predicted label, they are special cases of SWVP.\nIn Section 4 we prove that for a linearly separable training set, SWVP converges to a linear separator of\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n03 04\n0v 3\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n4 Se\np 20\nthe data under certain conditions on the parameters of the algorithm, that are respected by the CSP special case. We further prove mistake and generalization bounds for SWVP, and show that in the general case the SWVP bounds are tighter than the CSP’s.\nIn Section 5 we show that SWVP allows aggressive updates, that exploit only violating assignments derived from the predicted label, and more balanced updates, that exploit both violating and non-violating assignments. In experiments with synthetic data generated by an HMM, we demonstrate that various SWVP variants substantially outperform CSP training. We also provide initial encouraging dependency parsing results, indicating the potential of SWVP for real world NLP applications."

      "text" : "In structured prediction the task is to find a mapping f : X → Y , where y ∈ Y is a structured object rather than a scalar, and a feature mapping φ(x, y) : X × Y(x) → Rd is given. In this work we denote Y(x) = {y′|y′ ∈ DY Lx}, where Lx, a scalar, is the size of the allowed output sequence for an input x andDY is the domain of y′i for every i ∈ {1, . . . Lx}. 1 Our results, however, hold for the general case of an output space with variable size vectors as well.\nThe CSP algorithm (Algorithm 1) aims to learn a parameter (or weight) vector w ∈ Rd, that separates the training data, i.e. for each training example (x, y) it holds that: y = arg maxy′∈Y(x) w ·φ(x, y′). To find such a vector the algorithm iterates over the training set examples and solves the above inference (argmax) problem. If the inferred label y∗ differs from the gold label y the update w = w + ∆φ(x, y, y∗) is performed. For linearly separable training data (see definition 4), CSP is proved to converge to a vector w separating the training data.\nCollins and Roark (2004) and Huang et al. (2012) expanded the CSP algorithm by proposing various alternatives to the argmax inference problem which is often intractable in structured prediction problems (e.g. in high-order graph-based dependency parsing (McDonald and Pereira, 2006)). The basic idea is replacing the argmax problem with the search for a violation: an output label that the model scores higher\n1In the general case Lx is a set of output sizes, which may be finite or infinite (as in constituency parsing (Collins, 1997)).\nAlgorithm 1 The Structured Perceptron (CSP) Input: data D = {xi, yi}ni=1, feature mapping φ Output: parameter vector w ∈ Rd Define: ∆φ(x, y, z) , φ(x, y)− φ(x, z)\n1: Initialize w = 0. 2: repeat 3: for each (xi, yi) ∈ D do 4: y∗ = arg max\ny′∈Y(xi) w · φ(xi, y′)\n5: if y∗ 6= yi then 6: w = w + ∆φ(xi, yi, y∗) 7: end if 8: end for 9: until Convergence\nthan the gold standard label. The update rule in these CSP variants is, however, identical to the CSP’s. We, in contrast, propose a novel update rule that exploits the internal structure of the model’s prediction regardless of the way this prediction is generated."

      "text" : "Sub-structure Sets We start with two fundamental definitions: (1) An individual sub-structure of a structured object (or label) y ∈ DY Lx , denoted with J , is defined to be a subset of indexes J ⊆ [Lx];2 and (2) A set of substructures for a training example (x, y), denoted with JJx, is defined as JJx ⊆ 2[Lx].\nMixed Assignment We next define the concept of a mixed assignment: Definition 1. For a training pair (x, y) and a predicted label y∗ ∈ Y(x), y∗ 6= y, a mixed assignment (MA) vector denoted as mJ(y∗, y) is defined with respect to J ∈ JJx as follows:\nmJk (y ∗, y) = { y∗k k ∈ J yk else\nThat is, a mixed assignment is a new label, derived from the predicted label y∗, that is identical to y∗ in all indexes in J and to y otherwise. For simplicity we denote mJ(y∗, y) = mJ when the reference y∗ and y labels are clear from the context.\n2We use the notation [n] = {1, 2, . . . n}.\nConsider, for example, the trees of Figure 3.1, assuming that the top tree is y, the middle tree is y∗ and J = [2, 5].3 In the mJ(y∗, y) (bottom) tree the heads of all the words are identical to those of the top tree, except for the heads of mistakes and of then.\nViolation The next central concept is that of a violation, originally presented by Huang et al. (2012):\nDefinition 2. A triple (x, y, y∗) is said to be a violation with respect to a training example (x, y) and a parameter vector w if for y∗ ∈ Y(x) it holds that y∗ 6= y and w ·∆φ(x, y, y∗) ≤ 0.\nThe SWVP algorithm distinguishes between MAs that are violations, and ones that are not. For a triplet (x, y, y∗) and a set of substructures JJx ⊆ 2[Lx] we provide the following notations:\nI(y∗, y, JJx) v = {J ∈ JJx|mJ 6= y,w·∆φ(x, y,mJ) ≤ 0}\nI(y∗, y, JJx) nv = {J ∈ JJx|mJ 6= y,w·∆φ(x, y,mJ) > 0}\nThis notation divides the set of substructures into two subsets, one consisting of the substructures that yield violating MAs and one consisting of the substructures that yield non-violating MAs. Here again when the reference label y∗ and the set JJx are known we denote: I(y∗, y, JJx)v = Iv, I(y∗, y, JJx)nv = Inv and I = Iv ∪ Inv.\nWeighted Violations The key idea of SWVP is the exploitation of the internal structure of the predicted label in the update rule. For this aim at each iteration we define the set of substructures, JJx, and then, for each J ∈ JJx, update the parameter vector, w, with respect to the mixed assignments, MAJ ’s. This is a more flexible setup compared to CSP, as we can update with respect to the predicted output (if it is a violation, as is promised if inference is performed via argmax), if we wish to do so, as well as with respect to other mixed assignments.\nNaturally, not all mixed assignments are equally important for the update rule. Hence, we weigh the different updates using a weight vector γ. This paper therefore extends the observation of Huang et al. (2012) that perceptron parameter update can be performed w.r.t violations (Section 2), by showing that w can actually be updated w.r.t linear combinations of mixed assignments, under certain conditions on the selected weights.\n3We index the dependency tree words from 1 onwards."

      "text" : "With these definitions we can present the SWVP algorithm (Algorithm 2). SWVP is in fact a family of algorithms differing with respect to two decisions that can be made at each pass over each training example (x, y): the choice of the set JJx and the implementation of the SETGAMMA function.\nSWVP is very similar to CSP except for in the update rule. Like in CSP, the algorithm iterates over the training data examples and for each example it first predicts a label according to the current parameter vector w (inference is discussed in Section 4.2, property 2). The main difference from CSP is in the update rule (lines 6-12). Here, for each substructure in the substructure set, J ∈ JJx, the algorithm generates a mixed assignment mJ (lines 7-9). Then, w is updated with a weighted sum of the mixed assignments (line 11), unlike in CSP where the update is held w.r.t the predicted assignment only.\nThe γ(mJ) weights assigned to each of the ∆φ(x, y,mJ) updates are defined by a SETGAMMA function (line 10). Intuitively, a γ(mJ) weight should be higher the more the mixed assignment is assumed to convey useful information that can guide the update of w in the right direction. In Section 4 we detail the conditions on SETGAMMA under which SWVP converges, and in Section 5 we describe various SETGAMMA implementations.\nGoing back to the example of Figure 3.1, one would assume (Sec. 1) that the head word prediction for worse is pivotal to the substantial difference between the two top trees (UAS of 0.2). CSP does not directly exploit this observation as it only updates its parameter vector with respect to the differences between complete assignments: w = w + ∆φ(x, y, z).\nIn contrast, SWVP can exploit this observation in various ways. For example, it can generate a mixed\nassignment for each of the erroneous arcs where all other words are assigned their correct arc (according to the gold tree) except for that specific arc which is kept as in the bottom tree. Then, higher weights can be assigned to errors that seem more central than others. We elaborate on this in the next two sections.\nAlgorithm 2 The Structured Weighted Violations Perceptron Input: data D = {xi, yi}ni=1, feature mapping φ Output: parameter vector w ∈ Rd Define: ∆φ(x, y, z) , φ(x, y)− φ(x, z)\n1: Initialize w = 0. 2: repeat 3: for each (xi, yi) ∈ D do 4: y∗ = arg max\ny′∈Y(xi) w · φ(xi, y′)\n5: if y∗ 6= yi then 6: Define: JJxi ⊆ 2[Lxi ] 7: for J ∈ JJxi do\n8: Define: mJ s.t. mJk = { y∗k k ∈ J yik else\n9: end for 10: γ = SETGAMMA() 11: w = w + ∑ J∈Iv∪Inv γ(mJ )∆φ(xi, yi,mJ ) 12: end if 13: end for 14: until Convergence"

Then, using these conditions, we describe the relation between the SWVP and the CSP algorithms. After that, we prove the convergence of SWVP and analyse the derived properties of the algorithm.\nγ Selection Conditions Our main observation in this section is that SWVP converges under two conditions: (a) the training set D is linearly separable; and (b) for any parameter vector w achievable by the algorithm, there exists (x, y) ∈ D with JJx ⊆ 2[Lx], such that for the predicted output y∗ 6= y, SETGAMMA returns a γ weight vector that respects the γ selection conditions defined as follows: Definition 3.

A data set D = {xi, yi}ni=1 is linearly separable with margin δ > 0 if there exists some vector u with ‖u‖2 = 1 such that for all i:\nu ·∆φ(xi, yi, z) ≥ δ,∀z ∈ Y(xi).\nDefinition 5. The radius of a data set D = {xi, yi}ni=1 is the minimal scalar R s.t for all i:\n‖∆φ(xi, yi, z)‖ ≤ R, ∀z ∈ Y(xi).\nWe next extend these definitions:\nDefinition 6.

For linearly separable data D and a set JJ , every unit vector u that separates the data with margin δ, also separates the data with respect to mixed assignments with JJ , with margin δJJ ≥ δ. Likewise, it holds that RJJ ≤ R.\nWe can now state our convergence theorem. While the proof of this theorem resembles that of the CSP (Collins, 2002), unlike the CSP proof the SWVP proof relies on the γ selection conditions presented above and on the Jensen inequality.\nTheorem 1. For any dataset D, linearly separable with respect to JJ with margin δJJ > 0, the SWVP algorithm terminates after t ≤ (R JJ )2\n(δJJ )2 steps, where\nRJJ is the mixed assignment radius of D w.r.t. JJ .\nProof. Let wt be the weight vector before the tth update, thus w1 = 0. Suppose the tth update occurs on example (x, y), i.e. for the predicted output y∗ it holds that y∗ 6= y. We will bound ‖wt+1‖2 from both sides. First, it follows from the update rule of the algorithm that: wt+1 = wt +\n∑ J∈Iv∪Inv γ(mJ)∆φ(x, y,mJ).\nFor simplicity, in this proof we will use the notation Iv ∪ Inv = I . Hence, multiplying each side of the equation by u yields:\nu · wt+1 = u · wt + u · ∑ J∈I γ(mJ)∆φ(x, y,mJ)\n= u · wt + ∑ J∈I γ(mJ)u ·∆φ(x, y,mJ)\n≥ u · wt + ∑ J∈I γ(mJ)δJJ (margin property) ≥ u · wt + δJJ ≥ . . . ≥ tδJJ .\nThe last inequality holds because ∑\nJ∈I γ(m J) =\n1. From this we get that ‖wt+1‖2 ≥ (δJJ)2t2 since ‖u‖=1. Second,\n‖wt+1‖2 = ‖wt + ∑ J∈I γ(mJ)∆φ(x, y,mJ)‖2\n= ‖wt‖2 + ‖ ∑ J∈I γ(mJ)∆Φ(x, y,mJ)‖2\n+ 2wt · ∑ J∈I γ(mJ)∆Φ(x, y,mJ).\nFrom γ selection condition (2) we get that: ‖wt+1‖2 ≤ ‖wt‖2 + ‖ ∑ J∈I γ(mJ)∆Φ(x, y,mJ)‖2\n≤ ‖wt‖2 + ∑ J∈I γ(mJ)‖∆Φ(x, y,mJ)‖2 ≤ ‖wt‖2 + (RJJ)2. (radius property)\nThe inequality one before the last results from the Jensen inequality which holds due to (a) γ selection condition (1); and (b) the squared norm function being convex. From this we finally get:\n‖wt+1‖2 ≤ ‖wt‖2 + (RJJ)2 ≤ . . . ≤ t(RJJ)2.\nCombining the two steps we get: (δJJ)2t2 ≤ ‖wt+1‖2 ≤ t(RJJ)2.\nFrom this it is easy to derive the upper bound in the theorem: t ≤ (R JJ )2\n(δJJ )2 ."

      "text" : "We next point on three properties of the SWVP algorithm, derived from its convergence proof:\nProperty 1 (tighter iterations bound) The convergence proof of CSP (Collins, 2002) is given for a vector u that linearly separates the data, with margin δ and for a data radius R. Following observation 1, it holds that in our case, u also linearly separates the data with respect to mixed assignments with a set JJ and with margin δJJ ≥ δ. Together with the definition of RJJ ≤ R we get that: (R JJ )2\n(δJJ )2 ≤ R2 δ2 .\nThis means that the bound on the number of updates made by SWVP is tighter than the bound of CSP.\nProperty 2 (inference) From the γ selection conditions it holds that any label from which at least one violating MA can be derived through JJx is suitable for an update. This is because in such a case we can choose, for example, a SETGAMMA function that assigns the weight of 1 to that MA, and the weight of 0 to all other MAs.\nAlgorithm 2 employs the argmax inference function, following the basic reasoning that it is a good choice to base the parameter update on. Importantly, if the inference function is argmax and the algorithm performs an update (y∗ 6= y), this means that y∗, the output of the argmax function, is a violating MA by definition. However, it is obvious that solving the inference problem and the optimal γ assignment problems jointly may result in more informed parameter (w) updates. We leave a deeper investigation of this issue to future research.\nProperty 3 (dynamic updates) The γ selection conditions paragraph states two conditions ((a) and (b)) under which the convergence proof holds. While it is trivial for SETGAMMA to generate a γ vector that respects condition (a), if there is a parameter vector w’ achievable by the algorithm for which SETGAMMA cannot generate γ that respects condition (b), SWVP gets stuck when reaching w’.\nThis problem can be solved with dynamic updates. A deep look into the convergence proof reveals that the set JJx and the SETGAMMA function can actually differ between iterations. While this will change the bound on the number of iterations, it will not change the fact that the algorithm converges if the data is linearly separable. This makes SWVP highly flexible as it can always\nback off to the CSP setup of JJx = {[Lx]}, and ∀(x, y) ∈ D : γ(m[Lx]) = 1, update its parameters and continue with its original JJ and SETGAMMA when this option becomes feasible. If this does not happen, the algorithm can continue till convergence with the CSP setup."

      "heading" : "5 Passive Aggressive SWVP",
      "text" : "Here we present types of update rules that can be implemented within SWVP. Such rule types are defined by: (a) the selection of γ, which should respect the γ selection conditions (see Definition 3) and (b) the selection of JJ = {JJx ⊆ 2[Lx]|(x, y) ∈ D}, the substructure sets for the training examples.\nγ Selection A first approach we consider is the aggressive approach4 where only mixed assignments that are violations {mJ : J ∈ Iv} are exploited (i.e. for all J ∈ Inv, γ(mJ) = 0). Note, that in this case condition (2) of the γ selection conditions trivially holds as: w ·\n∑ J∈Iv γ(mJ)∆φ(x, y,mJ) ≤ 0.\nThe only remaining requirement is that condition (1) also holds, i.e. that ∑ J∈Iv γ(m J) = 1.\nThe opposite, passive approach, exploits only non-violating MA’s {mJ : J ∈ Inv}. However, such γ assignments do not respect γ selection condition (2), as they yield: w ·∑\nJ∈Inv γ(m J)∆φ(x, y,mJ) ≤ 0 which holds if and only if for every J ∈ Inv, γ(mJ) = 0 that in turn contradicts condition (1).\nFinally, we can take a balanced approach which gives a positive γ coefficient for at least one violating MA and at least one positive γ coefficient for a non-violating MA. This approach is allowed by SWVP as long as both γ selection conditions hold.\n4We borrow the term passive-aggressive from (Crammer et al., 2006), despite the substantial difference between the works.\nWe implemented two weighting methods, both based on the concept of margin: (1) Weighted Margin (WM): γ(mJ) = |w·∆φ(x,y,mJ )|β∑ J′∈JJx |w·∆φ(x,y,mJ′ )|β (2) Weighted Margin Rank (WMR):\nγ(mJ) = ( |JJx|−r |JJx| )β . where r is the rank of |w · ∆φ(x, y,mJ(y∗, y))| among the |w ·∆φ(x, y,mJ ′(y∗, y))| values for J ′ ∈ JJx.\nBoth schemes were implemented twice, within a balanced approach (denoted as B) and an aggressive approach (denoted as A).5 The aggressive schemes respect both γ selection conditions. The balanced schemes, however, respect the first condition but not necessarily the second. Since all models that employ the balanced weighting schemes converged after at most 10 iterations, we did not impose this condition (which we could do by, e.g., excluding terms for J ∈ Inv till condition (2) holds).\nJJ Selection Another choice that strongly affects the updates made by SWVP is that of JJ . A choice of JJx = 2[Lx], for every (x, y) ∈ D results in an update rule which considers all possible mixing assignments derived from the predicted label y∗ and the gold label y. Such an update rule, however, requires computing a sum over an exponential number of terms (2Lx) and is therefore highly inefficient.\nAmong the wide range of alternative approaches, in this paper we exploit single difference mixed assignments. In this approach we define: JJ = {JJx = {{1}, {2}, . . . {Lx}}|(x, y) ∈ D}. For a training pair (x, y) ∈ D, a predicted label y∗ and J = {j} ∈ JJx, we will have:\nmJk (y ∗, y) = { yk k 6= j y∗k k = j\nUnder this approach for the pair (x, y) ∈ D only Lx terms are summed in the SWVP update rule.

We report averaged accuracy (fraction of observed states for which the model successfully predicts the hidden state value) across the test sets, together with the standard deviation.\nDependency Parsing We also report initial dependency parsing results. We implemented our algorithms within the TurboParser (Martins et al., 2013).\n6 Denoting Dx = [Cx], Dy = [Cy], and a permutation of a vector v with perm(v), the parameters of the different setups are: (1) simple(++), learnable(+++): Cx = 5, Cy = 3, P (y′|y) = perm(0.7, 0.2, 0.1), P (x|y) = perm(0.75, 0.1, 0.05, 0.05, 0.05).

We followed the standard train/test split of these dataset. For SWVP, we randomly sampled 1000 sentences from each training set to serve as development sets and tuned the parameters as in the synthetic data experiments. CSP is trained on the training set and applied to the test set without any development set involved. We report the Unlabeled Attachment Score (UAS) for each language and model."

Of the 120 comparisons reported in the table (4 SWVP models, 3 setups, 10 comparisons per model/setup combination) this happened once (A-MV, (simple(++), learnable(+++)).\nSecond, we count the number of times the best development set value of the β hyper-parameter is also the best value on the test set, or the test set accuracy with the best development set β is at most 0.5% lower than that with the best test set β. The Gener-\nalization column of the table shows that this has not happened in all of the 120 runs of SWVP.\nDependency Parsing Results are given in Table 2. For the SWVP trained models we report three numbers: (a) B-WM is the standard setup where the β hyper parameter is tuned on the development data; (b) For Top B-WM we first selected the models with a UAS score within 0.1% of the best development data result, and of these we report the UAS of the model that performs best on the test set; and (c) Test B-WM reports results when β is tuned on the test set. This measure provides an upper bound on SWVP with our simplistic JJ (Section 5).\nOur results indicate the potential of SWVP. Despite our simple JJ set, Top B-WM and Test B-WM improve over CSP in 5/9 and 6/9 cases in first order parsing, respectively, and in 7/9 cases in second order parsing. In the latter case, Test B-WM improves the UAS over CSP in 0.22% on average across languages. Unfortunately, SWVP still does not generalize well from train to test data as indicated, e.g., by the modest improvements B-WM achieves over CSP in only 5 of 9 languages in second order parsing."

      "heading" : "8 Conclusions",
      "text" : "We presented the Structured Weighted Violations Perceptron (SWVP) algorithm, a generalization of the Structured Perceptron (CSP) algorithm that explicitly exploits the internal structure of the predicted label in its update rule. We proved the convergence of the algorithm for linearly separable training sets under certain conditions on its parameters, and provided generalization and mistake bounds.\nIn experiments we explored only very simple configurations of the SWVP parameters - γ and JJ . Nevertheless, several of our SWVP variants outperformed the CSP special case in synthetic data experiments. In dependency parsing experiments, SWVP demonstrated some improvements over CSP, but these do not generalize well. While we find these results somewhat encouraging, they emphasize the need to explore the much more flexible γ and JJ selection strategies allowed by SWVP (Sec. 4.2). In future work we will hence develop γ and JJ selection algorithms, where selection is ideally performed jointly with inference (property 2, Sec. 4.2), to make SWVP practically useful in NLP applications."

      "text" : "Observation 1. For linearly separable data D and a set JJ , every unit vector u that separates the data with margin δ, also separates the data with respect to mixed assignments with JJ , with margin δJJ ≥ δ. Likewise, it holds that RJJ ≤ R.\nProof. For every training example (x, y) ∈ D, it holds that: ∪z∈Y(x)mJ(z, y) ⊆ Y(x). As u separates the data with margin δ, it holds that:\nu ·∆φ(x, y,mJ(z, y)) ≥ δJJx , ∀z ∈ Y(x), J ∈ JJx. u ·∆φ(x, y, z) ≥ δ, ∀z ∈ Y(x).\nTherefore also δJJx ≥ δ. As the last inequality holds for every (x, y) ∈ D we get that δJJ = min(x,y)∈D δJJx ≥ δ. From the same considerations it holds that RJJ ≤ R. This is because RJJ is the radius of a subset of the dataset with radius R (proper subset if ∃(x, y) ∈ D, [Lx] /∈ JJx, non-proper subset otherwise)."

      "heading" : "B Mistake and Generalization Bounds - Non Separable Case",
      "text" : "Mistake Bound Here we provide a mistake bound for the algorithm in the non-separable case. We start with the following definition and observation:\nDefinition 8. Given an example (xi, yi) ∈ D, for a u, δ pair define:\nri = u · φ(xi, yi)− max z∈Y(xi) u · φ(xi, z)\ni = max{0, δ − ri}\nri JJ = u · φ(xi, yi)− max\nz∈Y(xi),J∈JJxi u · φ(xi,mJ(z, yi))\nFinally define: Du,δ = √ n∑ i=1 2i\nObservation 2. For all i: ri ≤ riJJ . Observation 2 easily follows from Definition 8. Following this observation we denote: rdiff = mini{ri\nJJ − ri} ≥ 0 and present the next theorem: Theorem 2. For any training sequence D, for the first pass over the training set of the CSP and the\nSWVP algorithms respectively, it holds that:\n#mistakes− CSP ≤ min u:‖u‖=1,δ>0\n(R+Du,δ) 2\nδ2 .\n#mistakes− SWV P ≤ min u:‖u‖=1,δ>0\n(RJJ +Du,δ) 2\n(δ + rdiff )2 .\nAs RJJ ≤ R (Observation 1) and rdiff ≥ 0, we get a tighter bound for SWVP. The proof for #mistakes-CSP is given at (Collins, 2002). The proof for #mistakes-SWVP is given below.\nProof. We transform the representation φ(x, y) ∈ Rd into a new representation ψ(x, y) ∈ Rd+n as follows: for i = 1, ..., d : ψi(x, y) = φi(x, y), for j = 1, ..., n : ψd+j(x, y) = ∆ if (x, y) = (xj , yj) and 0 otherwise, where ∆ > 0 is a parameter. Given a u, δ pair define v ∈ Rd+n as follows: for i = 1, ..., d : vi = ui, for j = 1, ..., n : vd+j = j ∆ . Under these definitions we have:\nv · ψ(xi, yi)− v · ψ(xi, z) ≥ δ, ∀i, z ∈ Y(xi).\nFor every i, z ∈ Y(xi), J ∈ JJxi :\nv · ψ(xi, yi)− v · ψ(xi,mJ(z, yi)) ≥ δ + rdiff .\n‖ψ(xi, yi)− ψ(xi,mJ(z, yi))‖2 ≤ (RJJ)2 + ∆2.\nLast, we have,\n‖v‖2 = ‖u‖2 + n∑ i=1 2i ∆2 = 1 + D2u,δ ∆2 .\nWe get that the vector v‖v‖ linearly separates the data with respect to single decision assignments with margin δ√\n1+ D2 U,δ\n∆2\n. Likewise, v‖v‖ linearly separates\nthe data with respect to mixed assignments with JJ , with margin δ+r\ndiff√ 1+\nDu,δ ∆2\n. Notice that the first pass\nof SWVP with representation Ψ is identical to the first pass with representation Φ because the parameter weight for the additional features affects only a single example of the training data and do not affect the classification of test examples. By theorem 1 this means that the first pass of SWVP with representation Ψ makes at most ((R\nJJ )2+∆2) (δ+rdiff )2\n· ( 1 +\nD2u,δ ∆2\n) .\nWe minimize this w.r.t ∆, which gives: ∆ =√ RJJDu,δ, and obtain the result guaranteed in the theorem.\nWe have bounded the number of mistakes SWVP is making in an on-line setup. We next provide guarantees as to how well the algorithm generalizes to a new example.\nGeneralization Bound Let us consider the training set D as an ordered sequence: D = {(x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn)}, and let us run the SWVP online algorithm on this sequence. At each round t = 1, . . . , n, the algorithm may update the weight vector w, so we get a sequence of weight vectors w1, . . . ,wn, from which we can create an hypotheses sequence of the form ht(x) = arg maxy′∈Y(x) wt · φ(x, y′).\nTo check the algorithm success in generalizing to a new test example (xn+1, yn+1), we need to decide which hypothesis to use from the above sequence, under the assumption that both the training examples and the new test example are drawn i.i.d from an (unknown) distribution P (x, y).\nFreund and Schapire (1999) presented the voted perceptron, a batch variant of the perceptron algorithm, and (Collins, 2002) presented an approximation for this variant called the averaged parameters perceptron that holds the same generalization guarantees. We adapt the averaged parameters setting to our algorithm. The resulting adaptation of (Freund and Schapire, 1999) then states:\nTheorem 3 (Freund & Schapire 99). Assume all examples are generated i.i.d. at random. Let (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn) be a sequence of training examples and let (xn+1, yn+1) be a test example. For a pair u, δ such that ‖u‖ = 1 and δ > 0 define Du,δ as before. Then the probability (over the choice of n+1 examples) that the voted SWVP algorithm does not predict yn+1 on test instance xn+1 is at most\n2\nn+ 1 En+1\n( inf\nu:‖u‖=1,δ>0 (RJJ +DU,δ) 2 (δ + rdiff )2\n)\nwhere En+1 is an expected value taken over n + 1 examples.\nNote that the adaptation of (Freund and Schapire, 1999) to the original CSP algorithm provided by (Collins, 2002) gives the generalization bound\nof 2n+1En+1 (\ninf u:‖u‖=1,δ>0\n(R+DU,δ) 2\nδ2\n) . This means\nthat the generalization bound of SWVP is upper\nbounded by the generalization bound of CSP (convergence property 1 and theorem 2)."

    "abstractText" : "We present the Structured Weighted Violations Perceptron (SWVP) algorithm, a new structured prediction algorithm that generalizes the Collins Structured Perceptron (CSP, (Collins, 2002)). Unlike CSP, the update rule of SWVP explicitly exploits the internal structure of the predicted labels. We prove the convergence of SWVP for linearly separable training sets, provide mistake and generalization bounds, and show that in the general case these bounds are tighter than those of the CSP special case. In synthetic data experiments with data drawn from an HMM, various variants of SWVP substantially outperform its CSP special case. SWVP also provides encouraging initial dependency parsing results.",
