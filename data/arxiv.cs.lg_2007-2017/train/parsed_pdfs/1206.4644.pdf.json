      "text" : "Subspace clustering aims to group the given samples into clusters according to the criterion that samples in the same cluster are drawn from the same linear subspace. In the last decade, a number of subspace clustering methods have been proposed with successful applications in the areas including motion segmentation (Kanatani, 2001; Vidal & Hartley, 2004; Elhamifar & Vidal, 2009), image clustering under different illuminations (Ho et al., 2003), etc. Generally speaking, existing approaches to subspace clustering can be classified into the following categories: matrix factorization\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nbased, algebraic based, statistically modelling, and reconstruction based, among which the reconstruction based approach has been proved most effective and has drawn much attention recently (Elhamifar & Vidal, 2009; Liu et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011). In this paper, we focus on the reconstruction based approach.\nThe objective of the reconstruction based subspace clustering is to approximate the dataset X ∈ RD×N (N is the number of samples andD denotes the sample dimensionality) with the reconstruction XW , where W ∈ RN×N is the reconstruction matrix which can be further used to build the affinity matrix |W |+\n∣∣W>∣∣ for spectral clustering. The intuition behind the reconstruction is to make the value of wij small or even vanish if samples xi and xj are not in the same subspace, such that the subspaces/clusters can be easily identified by the subsequent spectral clustering.\nAll the existing reconstruction based methods come with proofs claiming that the desired W could be obtained under the subspace independence assumption, i.e., the underlying subspaces S1,S2, · · · ,SK are linearly independent, or mathematically,\ndim( K∑ k=1 ⊕Sk) = K∑ k=1 dim(Sk) (1)\nUnfortunately, this assumption will be violated if there exist bases shared among the subspaces. For example, given three orthogonal bases, b1, b2, b3, and two subspaces, S1 = b1 ⊕ b2 and S2 = b3 ⊕ b2 (b2 is shared in S1 and S2), the l.h.s. of Eq.(1) is 3, which is smaller than the r.h.s. being 4. In real-world scenarios, the subspace independence assumption does not always hold. For example, in human face clustering, as the number of clusters (persons) increases, the r.h.s. of Eq.(1) will exceed the l.h.s., which is upper bounded by the dimensionality of “human faces”, so the subspace independence assumption will be violated eventually. Figure 1 illustrates this phenomenon based on the Extended Yale Database B (Georghiades et al.,\n2001). Once the subspace independence assumption is violated, there is no guarantee that the existing reconstruction based methods are able to obtain the desired W . In practice, we observe that the subspace independence assumption is critical to the success of the existing reconstruction based methods. Once the subspace independence assumption is violated, the performance of these existing reconstruction based methods become far from decent, even though the dimensionality of the underlying subspaces is low (shown in Section 4.1.1).\nTo tackle the subspace clustering problem, we propose a Groupwise Constrained Reconstruction (GCR) model, with the advantage that GCR no longer relies on the subspace independence assumption. In GCR, the sample cluster indicators are introduced as latent variables, conditioned on which the Slab-and-Spikelike priors are used as groupwise constraints to suppress the magnitude of certain entries in W . Thanks to these constraints, the requirement of the subspace independence assumption is no longer needed to obtain the desired W . Our method significantly differs from the existing methods in that, the reconstruction in GCR incorporates the information that “the samples can be grouped into clusters”; whereas in the existing methods, this information is ignored and the reconstruction depends solely on the data.\nAnother advantage of GCR is that, the affinity matrix needed for spectral clustering can be built from the cluster indicators rather than W . In our model, the reconstruction matrixW can be analytically marginalized out. We first use Gibbs Sampler to collect samples from the posterior of the cluster indicators, then use the collected samples to build the “probabilistic affinity matrix”, which is finally input to the spectral clustering algorithm to obtain the final clustering result. Compared with |W | + ∣∣W>∣∣, which is used as\nthe affinity matrix in the existing methods, the probabilistic affinity matrix built from the cluster indicators is more sophisticated, because it is naturally positive, symmetric and of clear interpretation. The experimental results on synthetic dataset, motion segmentation dataset and human face dataset show that GCR can outperform the state-of-the-art."

      "text" : "Matrix factorization based methods Costeira & Kanade (1998); Kanatani (2001) approximate the data matrix with the product of two matrices, one containing the bases and the other containing the factors. The final clustering result is obtained by exploiting the factor matrix. These methods are not robust to noise and outliers and will fail if the subspaces are dependent.\nThe algebraic based General Principle Component Analysis (GPCA) (Vidal et al., 2005) fits the samples with a polynomial, with the gradient of a point orthogonal to the subspace containing it. This approach makes fewer assumptions on the subspaces, and the success is guaranteed when certain conditions are met. The major problem of the algebraic based approach is that the computational complexity is high (exponential to the number of subspaces and their dimensions), which restricts its application scenarios. In (Rao et al., 2010), Robust Algebraic Segmentation (RAS) is proposed to handle the data with outliers, but the complexity issue still remains.\nStatistical models assume that the samples in each subspace are drawn from a certain distribution such as Gaussian, and take different objectives to find the optimal clustering result. For example, Mixture of Probabilistic PCA (Tipping & Bishop, 1999) uses the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to find the maximum likelihood over all the samples, k-subspaces method (Ho et al., 2003) alternates between assigning the cluster to each sample and updating the subspaces, Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) (Fischler & Bolles, 1981) keeps looking for the samples in the same subspace until the number of samples in the subspace is sufficient, then continues searching another subspace after removing these samples. Agglomerative Lossy Compression (ALC) (Ma et al., 2007) searches the latent subspaces by minimizing an objective containing certain information criteria with an agglomerative strategy."

Usually, |W |+ |W |> is treated as the affinity matrix input to the spectral clustering methods.\nThe methods of this class distinguish from each other in employing different regularization terms, i.e., Ω(W ) in Eq.(2). In Sparse Subspace Clustering (SSC) (Elhamifar & Vidal, 2009), the authors propose to use the l1 norm ‖W ‖1 to enforce the sparseness in W , in the hope that the sparse coding process could shrink wji to zero if xi and xj are not in the same subspace. In Low-Rank Representation (LRR) (Liu et al., 2010), nuclear norm ‖W ‖∗ is used to encourage W to have a low rank structure1, and l2,1 norm is used as the `(·) term in Eq.(2) to make the method more robust to outliers. In SSQP (Wang et al., 2011), the authors choose Ω(W ) = ∥∥W>W∥∥ 1 , meanwhile force W to be non-negative. As a consequence, the optimization problem in Eq.(2) turns out to be a quadratic programming problem, for which the projected gradient descend method can be used to find a solution."

      "text" : "Following the idea of the reconstruction based approach to subspace clustering, the Groupwise Constrained Reconstruction (GCR) model uses p(X|W ) in Eq.(3) to quantify the reconstruction,\np(X|W ,σ) = N∏ i=1 N (xi| ∑ j 6=i wjixj , σ 2 i ) (3)\nwhere N (·|µ,Σ) denotes the Gaussian distribution with mean µ and variance Σ, wji is the element at the j-th row, i-th column of matrixW ∈ RN×N , σ2i > 0 is a random variable measuring the reconstruction error for the i-th sample, and σ = [σ1;σ2; · · · ;σN ] ∈ RN . We place an inverse Gamma prior on all the σi’s:\np(σ2i ) = IG(σ 2 i | ν 2 , νλ 2 ) (4)\nwhere IG denotes the inverse Gamma distribution, and ν > 0 and λ > 0 are given hyperparameters.\nWhat makes the GCR model different is that, GCR explicitly requires every sample to be reconstructed mainly by the samples in the same cluster. In other words, the magnitudes of weights for the samples in different clusters should be small. Intuitively, W should be nearly block-wise diagonal if the samples are rearranged in a proper order (see Figure 2(b) for an illustration). To enforce such property of W , we treat the cluster indicators z as latent random variables, and introduce a prior for W conditioned on z and σ as follows,\np(W |z,σ) = N∏ i=1 N∏ j=1 N (wji|0, σ2i αji) (5)\nαji = αij = { αL zj 6= zi αH zj = zi\nwhere αH > αL ≥ 0 are hyperparameters and αLαH is small. This prior is quite similar to the Slab and Spike prior used for variable selection (George & Mcculloch, 1997), with αH corresponding to the slab and αL corresponding to the spike. As the effects of Eq.(5), to generate W given the latent cluster indicators, if xi and xj are not in the same cluster/subspace, wji and wij are restricted to be small or close to the mean value 0 of the corresponding Gaussian distribution; if xj and\nxi come from the same cluster/subspace, the values of wji and wij could be either small or big. We makeW dependent on σ as well, so that both σ and W can be further marginalized out by combining Eqs.(3), (4) and (5), which will be discussed later.\nFurthermore, we introduce a discrete prior\np(z|θ) = N∏ i=1 Cate(zi|θ)\nfor the cluster indicators z conditioned on θ = [θ1; θ2; · · · ; θK ] ∈ RK , where Cate(zi|θ) = θzi denotes the categorical distribution, and θk ∈ [0, 1] can be viewed as the prior knowledge about the proportion of samples in the k-th cluster. Since it is difficult to set θ beforehand, we use a Dirichlet distribution\np(θ) = Dir(θ|β0 K 1K)\nas a prior for θ, where Dir(·) denotes the Dirichlet distribution, and 1K = [1, 1, · · · , 1] ∈ RK .\nThe hierarchical representation for GCR model is shown in Figure 2(a), and the full probability can be written as follows,\np(X,W , z,θ,σ)\n= [p(θ)p(z|θ)] [p(W |z,σ)p(X|W ,σ)p(σ)] (6)\nObserving thatW ,σ and θ in Eq.(6) can be marginalized out analytically, we can write down p(z|X), de-\nnoted as q(z) for short, as follows,\nq(z) ∝ f0 N∏ i=1 fi (7)\nf0 = K∏ k=1 Γ ( β0 K + nk(z) ) fi = det(Ci) − 12 ( x>i C −1 i xi + νλ\n)−D+ν2 Ci = Hzi − αHxix>i Hk =\n∑ j|zj=k αHxjx > j + ∑ j|zj 6=k αLxjx > j + ID\nwhere f0 and fi comes from the first and the second brackets in Eq.(6), respectively; nk(z) is the number of samples in the k-th cluster; Γ(·) denotes the Gamma function; and ID ∈ RD×D denotes the identity matrix."

      "text" : "We use the Gibbs Sampling algorithm (MacKay, 2003) to approximate the posterior distribution q(z). In each epoch, for i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , N}, the Gibbs sampler iteratively updates zi to a sample drawn from p(zi|z∼i,X) = p(z|X)p(z∼i|X) ∝ q(z), where z∼i = {zj |j 6= i}. A direct implementation will lead to the time complexity of O(N2D3) for each epoch. Fortunately, the complexity can be reduced to O(N2D + KD2) using rank-1 update. At the end of each epoch, we collect the values of all the cluster indicators as a sample of z. Finally, we save the samples of z from the last M epochs, denoted as s1, s2, · · · , sM , and discard the samples left. We can use the following two approaches to obtain the final clustering result.\nMAP approach. Use the last collected sample sM as an initialization, then maximize the posterior q(z) in Eq.(7) by alternating among z1, z2, · · · , zN . The local maximum is directly used as the clustering result.\nBayesian approach. With the collected samples, we first compute an affinity matrix Gm ∈ RN×N over the N samples, where\n(Gm)ij =\n{ 1 (sm)i = (sm)j\n0 (sm)i 6= (sm)j (8)\nthen compute the “probabilistic affinity matrix” G = 1 M ∑ mGm; and finally put G into a classical clustering method to obtain the final clustering result.\nHere, Gij can be treated as an approximation to the posterior distribution p(zi = zj |X). Compared with existing reconstruction based methods which use |W |+ |W |> as the affinity matrix input into the spec-\ntral clustering algorithm, our probabilistic affinity matrix G is more sophisticated since Gij can be clearly interpreted as the the possibility that sample i and j share the same cluster label. What is more, our affinity matrixG is naturally positive and symmetric, whereas |W |+ |W |> is somehow like an ad-hoc way to “force” W to be an affinity matrix."

      "text" : "From Eq.(8) we see that, to obtain the probabilistic affinity matrix G, it is not mandatory to set K to be the exact number of subspaces. In fact, the probabilistic affinity matrix can be obtained with any positive integer K. Particularly, we are interested in the GCR model when K goes to positive infinity, in which case, the number of non-empty clusters remains a finite number (at most N when each sample forms its own cluster). This strategy is in analogy with the Infinite Gaussian Mixture Model with Dirichlet Process (Rasmussen, 1999). For this reason, we refer to the GCR model with K → +∞ as GCR-DP. As the limit of GCR, the posterior of z for GCR-DP is\nq̂(z) ∝ f̂0 N∏ i=1 fi, f̂0 = β K̂−1 0 K̂∏ k=1 Γ(nk(z)) (9)\nwhere fi remains the same as in Eq.(7), and K̂ is the number of non-empty clusters 2. The Gibbs sampling procedure is similar to that of the original GCR, and the difference is described as follows. Suppose for now there are K ′ non-empty clusters, to update zi, besides computing K ′ values for the non-empty clusters by plugging zi ← {1, 2, , · · · , K̂} into the r.h.s. of Eq.(9), we need to compute an extra value for a new empty cluster by plugging K̂ ← K ′ + 1 and zi = K ′ + 1 into Eq.(9). Then the Categorical sampler picks a cluster indicator for zi according to these K ′ + 1 values. If the indicator for the new cluster (K ′+ 1) is picked, we create a new empty cluster and put the i-th sample into it. The variables for the empty clusters can be removed to save the computational resource.\nIn the case of K → ∞, Eq.(6) shows that there exists a trade-off among the reconstruction quality, prior for the cluster indicators and p(W |z,σ). p(W |z,σ) prefers more clusters, in which case more spikes in Eq.(5) could be introduced into the model, resulting in high p.d.f. of p(W |z,σ). On the contrary, the Dirichlet process prior favors fewer number of clusters. In the premise of good reconstruction quality (p(X|W ,σ) is high), the competition between the Dirichlet process\n2To use Eq.(9), z should be reorganized so that the first K̂ clusters are non-empty.\nprior p(z) and p(W |z,σ) provides a way to circumvent the trivial solutions to the model (all the samples in one cluster or each sample in it’s own cluster).\nDue to the allowance to create more clusters, the outliers, which cannot be well reconstructed by the inliers, have the chance to “stand alone”. As a result, the influence of the outliers can be reduced."

After integrating out σ, we can rewrite the prior for W as p(W |z) =∏N i=1 ∏N j=1 T (wji|ν, 0, λαji), where T (·|u, v, w) denotes the student t distribution with degree of freedom u, mean v and variance w.

However, their performance decreases significantly as the violation degree increases, even though their parameters are tuned for different K. In contrast, GCR and GCR-DP are able to retain high performance even though the violation degree keeps increasing.\nIn the case of K = 8, we compare the affinity matrices produced by these reconstruction based methods, as shown in Figure 4. Obviously, the affinity matrix produced by GCR-DP has stronger discrimination power on the clusters than those of the others. The affinity matrix produced by SSQP looks promising.

Compared with other reconstruction based methods, our models no longer rely on the subspace independence assumption, which usually gets violated in the applications in which the number of subspaces keeps increasing. On the synthetic datasets, we show that existing reconstruction based methods suffer from the violation of the subspace independence assumption, while the affinity matrix produced by our model, which is built from the posterior of the latent cluster indicators, is more sophisticated and of stronger discrimination power on discovering the latent clusters. On the three real-world datasets, our methods show promising results.\nBesides the subspace clustering problem, the idea of groupwise constraints can be further applied to other problems involving graph construction. For example, in semi-supervised learning (SSL), the constraints can be modified such that a sample is only allowed to be reconstructed by its neighbors in the Euclidean space. In this way, the cluster assumption and manifold assumption, which are two fundamental SSL assumptions, can be neatly unified within our framework. For dimension reduction methods such as LLE (Roweis & Saul, 2000), it is also interesting to design new models to use the posterior of the reconstruction matrix for embedding, such that the local and global structure of the data could be preserved simultaneously."

Their success largely relies on the assumption that the underlying subspaces are independent, which, however, does not always hold in the applications with increasing number of subspaces. In this paper, we propose a novel reconstruction based subspace clustering model without making the subspace independence assumption. In our model, certain properties of the reconstruction matrix are explicitly characterized using the latent cluster indicators, and the affinity matrix used for spectral clustering can be directly built from the posterior of the latent cluster indicators instead of the reconstruction matrix. Experimental results on both synthetic and realworld datasets show that the proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art methods.",
