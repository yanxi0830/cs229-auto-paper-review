      "text" : "Deep neural networks achieve near-human accuracy on many perception tasks (He et al., 2016; Amodei et al., 2015). However, they lack robustness to small alterations of the inputs at test time (Szegedy et al., 2014). Indeed when presented with a corrupted image that is barely distinguishable from a legitimate one by a human, they can predict incorrect labels, with high-confidence. An adversary can design such so-called adversarial examples, by adding a small perturbation to a legitimate input to maximize the likelihood of an incorrect class under constraints on the magnitude of the perturbation (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2015; Pa-\n1Facebook AI Research.

Copyright 2017 by the author(s).\npernot et al., 2016a). In practice, for a significant portion of inputs, a single step in the direction of the gradient sign is sufficient to generate an adversarial example (Goodfellow et al., 2015) that is even transferable from one network to another one trained for the same problem but with a different architecture (Liu et al., 2016; Kurakin et al., 2016).\nThe existence of transferable adversarial examples has two undesirable corollaries. First, it creates a security threat for production systems by enabling black-box attacks (Papernot et al., 2016a). Second, it underlines the lack of robustness of neural networks and questions their ability to generalize in settings where the train and test distributions can be (slightly) different as is the case for the distributions of legitimate and adversarial examples.\nWhereas the earliest works on adversarial examples already suggested that their existence was related to the magnitude of the hidden activations gradient with respect to their inputs (Szegedy et al., 2014), they also empirically assessed that standard regularization schemes such as weight decay or training with random noise do not solve the problem (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Fawzi et al., 2016). The current mainstream approach to improving the robustness of deep networks is adversarial training. It consists in generating adversarial examples on-line using the current network’s parameters (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Miyato et al., 2015; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2015; Szegedy et al., 2014; Kurakin et al., 2016) and adding them to the training data. This data augmentation method can be interpreted as a robust optimization procedure (Shaham et al., 2015).\nIn this paper, we introduce Parseval networks, a layerwise regularization method for reducing the network’s sensitivity to small perturbations by carefully controlling its global Lipschitz constant. Since the network is a composition of functions represented by its layers, we achieve increased robustness by maintaining a small Lipschitz constant (e.g., 1) at every hidden layer; be it fully-connected, convolutional or residual. In particular, a critical quantity governing the local Lipschitz constant in both fully connected and convolutional layers is the spectral norm of the weight matrix. Our main idea is to control this norm by parameterizing the network with parseval tight frames (Kovačević & Chebira, 2008), a generalization of orthogonal matrices.\nThe idea that regularizing the spectral norm of each weight\nar X\niv :1\n70 4.\n08 84\n7v 2\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n2 M\nay 2\n01 7\nmatrix could help in the context of robustness appeared as early as (Szegedy et al., 2014), but no experiment nor algorithm was proposed, and no clear conclusion was drawn on how to deal with convolutional layers. Previous work, such as double backpropagation (Drucker & Le Cun, 1992) has also explored jacobian normalization as a way to improve generalization. Our contribution is twofold. First, we provide a deeper analysis which applies to fully connected networks, convolutional networks, as well as Residual networks (He et al., 2016). Second, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm and validate its effectiveness on standard benchmark datasets. We report results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and Street View House Numbers (SVHN), in which fully connected and wide residual networks were trained (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) with Parseval regularization. The accuracy of Parseval networks on legitimate test examples matches the state-of-the-art, while the results show notable improvements on adversarial examples. Besides, Parseval networks train significantly faster than their vanilla counterpart.\nIn the remainder of the paper, we first discuss the previous work on adversarial examples. Next, we give formal definitions of the adversarial examples and provide an analysis of the robustness of deep neural networks. Then, we introduce Parseval networks and its efficient training algorithm. Section 5 presents experimental results validating the model and providing several insights."

      "text" : "Early papers on adversarial examples attributed the vulnerability of deep networks to high local variations (Szegedy et al., 2014; Goodfellow et al., 2015). Some authors argued that this sensitivity of deep networks to small changes in their inputs is because neural networks only learn the discriminative information sufficient to obtain good accuracy rather than capturing the true concepts defining the classes (Fawzi et al., 2015; Nguyen et al., 2015).\nStrategies to improve the robustness of deep networks include defensive distillation (Papernot et al., 2016b), as well as various regularization procedures such as contractive networks (Gu & Rigazio, 2015). However, the bulk of recent proposals relies on data augmentation (Goodfellow et al., 2015; Miyato et al., 2015; Moosavi-Dezfooli et al., 2015; Shaham et al., 2015; Szegedy et al., 2014; Kurakin et al., 2016). It uses adversarial examples generated online during training. As we shall see in the experimental section, regularization can be complemented with data augmentation; in particular, Parseval networks with data augmentation appear more robust than either data augmentation or Parseval networks considered in isolation."

In the robustness framework of (Xu & Mannor, 2012), the Lipschitz constant also controls the difference between the average loss on the training set and the generalization performance. More precisely, let us denote by Cp(X , γ) the covering number of X using γ-balls for ‖.‖p. Using M = supx,W,y `(g(x,W ), y), Theorem 3 of (Xu & Mannor, 2012) implies that for every δ ∈ (0, 1), with probability 1− δ over the i.i.d. sample ((xi, yi)mi=1, we have:\nL(W ) ≤ 1 m m∑ i=1 `(g(xi,W ), yi)\n+ λpΛpγ +M\n√ 2Y Cp(X , γ2 ) ln(2)− 2 ln(δ)\nm .\nSince covering numbers of a p-norm ball in RD increases exponentially with RD, the bound above suggests that it is critical to control the Lipschitz constant of g, for both good generalization and robustness to adversarial examples."

We now give the Lipschitz constants of standard layers as a function of their parameters:\nLinear layers: For layer n(x) = W (n)n′(x) where n′ is the unique child of n in the graph, the Lipschitz constant for ‖.‖p is, by definition, the matrix norm of W (n) induced by ‖.‖p, which is usually denoted ‖W (n)‖p and defined by\n‖W (n)‖p = sup z:‖z‖p=1 ‖W (n)z‖p .\nThen Λ(n)2 = ‖W (n)‖2Λ (n′) 2 , where ‖W (n)‖2, called the spectral norm of W (n), is the maximum singular value of W (n). We also have Λ(n)∞ = ‖W (n)‖∞Λ(n ′) ∞ , where\n‖W (n)‖∞ = maxi ∑ j |W (n) ij | is the maximum 1-norm of the rows. W (n).\nConvolutional layers: To simplify notation, let us consider convolutions on 1D inputs without striding, and we take the width of the convolution to be 2k + 1 for k ∈ N. To write convolutional layers in the same way as linear layers, we first define an unfolding operator U , which prepares the input z, denoted by U(z). If the input has length T with din inputs channels, the unfolding operator maps z For a convolution of the unfolding of z considered as a T × (2k + 1)din matrix, its j-th column is:\nUj(z) = [zj−k; ...; zj+k] ,\nwhere “;” is the concatenation along the vertical axis (each zi is seen as a column din-dimensional vector), and zi = 0 if i is out of bounds (0-padding). A convolutional layer with dout output channels is then defined as\nn(x) = W (n) ∗ n′(x) = W (n)U(n′(x)) ,\nwhere W (n) is a dout × (2k + 1)din matrix. We thus have Λ\n(n) 2 ≤ ‖W‖2‖U(n′(x))‖2. Since U is a linear operator that essentially repeats its input (2k + 1) times, we have ‖U(n′(x)) − U(n′(x̃))‖22 ≤ (2k + 1)‖n′(x) − n′(x̃)‖22, so that Λ(n)2 ≤ √ 2k + 1‖W‖2Λ(n ′) 2 . Also, ‖U(n′(x)) − U(n′(x̃))‖∞ = ‖n′(x) − n′(x̃)‖∞, and so for a convolutional layer, Λ(n)∞ ≤ ‖W (n)‖∞Λ(n ′) ∞ .\nAggregation layers/transfer functions: Layers that perform the sum of their inputs, as in Residual Netowrks (He et al., 2016), fall in the case where the values Λ(n,n ′) p in (5) come into play. For a node n that sums its inputs, we have Λ (n,n′) p = 1, and thus Λ (n) p ≤ ∑ n′:(n,n′)∈E Λ (n′) p . If n is a tranfer function layer (e.g., an element-wise application of ReLU) we can check that Λ(n)p ≤ Λ(n ′) p , where n′ is the input node, as soon as the Lipschitz constant of the transfer function (as a function R→ R) is ≤ 1."

      "text" : "Parseval regularization, which we introduce in this section, is a regularization scheme to make deep neural networks robust, by constraining the Lipschitz constant (5) of each hidden layer to be smaller than one, assuming the Lipschitz constant of children nodes is smaller than one. That way, we avoid the exponential growth of the Lipschitz constant, and a usual regularization scheme (i.e., weight decay) at the last layer then controls the overall Lipschitz constant of the network. To enforce these constraints in practice, Parseval networks use two ideas: maintaining orthonormal rows in linear/convolutional layers, and performing convex combinations in aggregation layers. Below, we first explain the rationale of these constraints and then describe our approach to efficiently enforce the constraints during training."

      "text" : "Orthonormality of weight matrices: For linear layers, we need to maintain the spectral norm of the weight matrix at 1. Computing the largest singular value of weight matrices is not practical in an SGD setting unless the rows of the matrix are kept orthogonal. For a weight matrix W ∈ Rdout×din with dout ≤ din, Parseval regularization maintains WTW ≈ Idout×dout , where I refers to the identity matrix. W is then approximately a Parseval tight frame (Kovačević & Chebira, 2008), hence the name of Parseval networks. For convolutional layers, the matrix W ∈ Rdout×(2k+1)din is constrained to be a Parseval tight frame (with the notations of the previous section), and the output is rescaled by a factor (2k + 1)−1/2. This maintains all singular values of W to (2k+ 1)−1/2, so that Λ\n(n) 2 ≤ Λ (n′) 2 where n\n′ is the input node. More generally, keeping the rows of weight matrices orthogonal makes it possible to control both the spectral norm and the ‖.‖∞ of a weight matrix through the norm of its individual rows. Robustness for ‖.‖∞ is achieved by rescaling the rows so that their 1-norm is smaller than 1. For now, we only experimented with constraints on the 2-norm of the rows, so we aim for robustness in the sense of ‖.‖2.\nRemark 1 (Orthogonality is required). Without orthogonality, constraints on the 2-norm of the rows of weight ma-\ntrices are not sufficient to control the spectral norm. Parseval networks are thus fundamentally different from weight normalization (Salimans & Kingma, 2016).\nAggregation Layers: In parseval networks, aggregation layers do not make the sum of their inputs, but rather take a convex combination of them:\nn(x) = ∑\nn′:(n,n′)∈E\nα(n,n ′)n′(x)\nwith ∑ n′:(n,n′)∈E α (n,n′) = 1 and α(n,n ′) ≥ 0.

      "text" : "Orthonormality constraints: The first significant difference between Parseval networks and its vanilla counterpart is the orthogonality constraint on the weight matrices. This requirement calls for an optimization algorithm on the manifold of orthogonal matrices, namely the Stiefel manifold. Optimization on matrix manifolds is a well-studied topic (see (Absil et al., 2009) for a comprehensive survey). The simplest first-order geometry approaches consist in optimizing the unconstrained function of interest by moving in the direction of steepest descent (given by the gradient of the function) while at the same time staying on the manifold. To guarantee that we remain in the manifold after every parameter update, we need to define a retraction operator. There exist several pullback operators for embedded submanifolds such as the Stiefel manifold based for example on Cayley transforms (Absil et al., 2009). However, when learning the parameters of neural networks, these methods are computationally prohibitive. To overcome this difficulty, we use an approximate operator derived from the following layer-wise regularizer of weight matrices to ensure their parseval tightness (Kovačević & Chebira, 2008):\nRβ(Wk) = β\n2 ‖W>k Wk − I‖22.\nOptimizing Rβ(Wk) to convergence after every gradient descent step (w.r.t the main objective) guarantees us to stay on the desired manifold but this is an expensive procedure. Moreover, it may result in parameters that are far from the ones obtained after the main gradient update. We use two approximations to make the algorithm more efficient: First, we only do one step of descent on the function Rα(Wk). The gradient of this regularization term is∇WkRβ(Wk) = β(WkW > k − I)Wk. Consequently, after every main update we perform the following secondary update:\nWk ← (1 + β)Wk − βWkW>k Wk.\nAlgorithm 1: Parseval Training Θ = {Wk,αk}Kk=1, e← 0 while e ≤ E do\nSample a minibatch {(xi, yi)}Bi=1. for k ∈ {1, . . . ,K} do\nCompute the gradient: GWk ← ∇Wk`(Θ, {(xi, yi)}), Gαk ← ∇αk`(Θ, {(xi, yi)}). Update the parameters: Wk ←Wk − ·GWk αk ← αk − ·Gαk . if hidden layer then\nSample a subset S of rows of Wk. Projection: WS ← (1 + β)WS − βWSW>S WS . αk ← argminγ∈∆K−1‖αK − γ‖22\ne← e+ 1.\nOptionally, instead of updating the whole matrix, one can randomly select a subset S of rows and perform the update from Eq. (4.2) on the submatrix composed of rows indexed by S. This sampling based approach reduces the overall complexity to O(|S|2d). Provided the rows are carefully sampled, the procedure is an accurate Monte Carlo approximation of the regularizer loss function (Drineas et al., 2006). The optimal sampling probabilities, also called statistical leverages are approximately equal if we start from an orthogonal matrix and (approximately) stay on the manifold throughout the optimization since they are proportional to the eigenvalues of W (Mahoney et al., 2011). Therefore, we can sample a subset of columns uniformly at random when applying this projection step.\nWhile the full update does not result in an increased overhead for convolutional layers, the picture can be very different for large fully connected layers making the sampling approach computationally more appealing for such layers. We show in the experiments that the weight matrices resulting from this procedure are (quasi)-orthogonal. Also, note that quasi-orthogonalization procedures similar to the one described here have been successfully used previously in the context of learning overcomplete representations with independent component analysis (Hyvärinen & Oja, 2000).\nConvexity constraints in aggregation layers: In Parseval networks, aggregation layers output a convex combination of their inputs instead of e.g., their sum as in Residual networks (He et al., 2016). For an aggregation node n of the network, let us denote by α = (α(n,n\n′))n′:(n,n′)∈E the K-size vector of coefficients used for the convex combination output by the layer. To ensure that the Lipschitz constant at the node n is such that Λ(n)p ≤ 1, the constraints of 4.1 call for a euclidean projection of α onto the positive\nsimplex after a gradient update:\nα∗ = argmin γ∈∆K−1 ‖α− γ‖22 ,\nwhere ∆K−1 = {γ ∈ RK |1>γ = 1,γ ≥ 0}. This is a well studied problem (Michelot, 1986; Pardalos & Kovoor, 1990; Duchi et al., 2008; Condat, 2016). Its solution is of the form: α∗i = max(0, αi − τ(α)), with τ : RK → R the unique function satisfying ∑ i(xi − τ(α)) = 1 for every x ∈ RK . Therefore, the solution essentially boils down to a soft thresholding operation. If we denote α1 ≥ α2 ≥ . . . αK the sorted coefficients and k(α) = max{k ∈ (1, . . . ,K)|1+kαk > ∑ j≤k αj}, the optimal thresholding is given by (Duchi et al., 2008):\nτ(α) = ( ∑ j≤k(α) αj)− 1 k(α)\nConsequently, the complexity of the projection is O(K log(K)) since it is only dominated by the sorting of the coefficients and is typically cheap because aggregation nodes will only have few children in practice (e.g. 2). If the number of children is large, there exist efficient linear time algorithms for finding the optimal thresholding τ(α) (Michelot, 1986; Pardalos & Kovoor, 1990; Condat, 2016). In this work, we use the method detailed above (Duchi et al., 2008) to perform the projection of the coefficient α after every gradient update step."

Using a subset S of 30% of all the rows of each of weight matrix for the retraction step worked well in practice."

To do so, we analyze the spectrum of the weight matrices of the different models by plotting the histograms of their singular values, and compare these histograms for Parseval networks to networks trained using standard SGD with and without weight decay (SGD-wd and SGD).\nThe histograms representing the distribution of singular values at layers 1 and 4 for the fully connected network (using S = 30%) trained on the dataset CIFAR-10 are shown in Fig. 2 (the figures for convolutional networks are similar). The singular values obtained with our method are tightly concentrated around 1. This experiment confirms that the weight matrices produced by the proposed optimization procedure are (almost) orthonormal. The distribution of the singular values of the weight matrices obtained with SGD has a lot more variance, with nearly as many small values as large ones. Adding weight decay to standard SGD leads to a sparse spectrum for the weight matrices, especially in the higher layers of the network suggesting a low-rank structure. This observation has motivated recent work on compressing deep neural networks (Denton et al., 2014)."

      "heading" : "5.3.2. ROBUSTNESS TO ADVERSARIAL NOISE.",
      "text" : "We evaluate the robustness of the models to adversarial noise by generating adversarial examples from the test set, for various magnitudes of the noise vector. Following common practice (Kurakin et al., 2016), we use the fast gradient sign method to generate the adversarial examples (using ‖.‖∞, see Section 3.1). Since these adversarial examples transfer from one network to the other, the fast gradient sign method allows to benchmark the network for reasonable settings where the opponent does not know the network. We report the accuracy of each model as a function of the magnitude of the noise. To make the results easier to interpret, we compute the corresponding Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). For an input x and perturbation δx, the SNR is defined as SNR(x, δx) = 20 log10 ‖x‖2 ‖δx‖2 . We show some adversarial examples in Fig. 1.\nFully Connected Nets. Figure 3 depicts a comparison of Parseval and vanilla networks with and without adversarial training at various noise levels. On both MNIST and CIFAR-10, Parseval networks consistently outperforms weight decay regularization. In addition, it is as robust as adversarial training (SGD-wd-da) on CIFAR-10. Combining Parseval Networks and adversarial training results in the most robust method on MNIST.\nResNets. Table 1 summarizes the results of our experiments with wide residual Parseval and vanilla networks on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and SVHN. In the table, we denote Parseval(OC) the Parseval network with orthogonality constraint and without using a convex combination in aggregation layers. Parseval indicates the configuration where both of the orthogonality and convexity constraints are used. We first observe that Parseval networks outperform vanilla ones on all datasets on the clean examples and match the state of the art performances on CIFAR-10 (96.28%) and SVHN (98.44%). On CIFAR-100, when we use Parseval wide Resnet of depth 40 instead of 28, we achieve an accuracy of 81.76%. In comparison, the best performance achieved by a vanilla wide resnet (Zagoruyko & Komodakis, 2016) and a pre-activation resnet (He et al., 2016) are respectively 81.12% and 77.29%. Therefore, our proposal is a useful regularizer for legitimate examples. Also note that in most cases, Parseval networks combining both\nthe orthogonality constraint and the convexity constraint is superior to use the orthogonality constraint solely.\nThe results presented in the table validate our most important claim: Parseval networks significantly improve the robustness of vanilla models to adversarial examples. When no adversarial training is used, the gap in accuracy between the two methods is significant (particularly in the high noise scenario). For an SNR value of 40, the best Parseval network achieves 55.41% accuracy while the best vanilla model is at 44.62%. When the models are adversarially trained, Parseval networks remain superior to vanilla models in most cases. Interestingly, adversarial training only slightly improves the robustness of Parseval networks in low noise setting (e.g. SNR values of 45-50) and sometimes even deteriorates it (e.g. on CIFAR-10). In contrast, combining adversarial training and Parseval networks is an effective approach in the high noise setting. This result suggests that thanks to the particular form of regularizer (controlling the Lipschitz constant of the network), Parseval networks achieves robustness to adversarial examples located in the immediate vicinity of each data point. Therefore, adversarial training only helps for adversarial examples found further away from the legitimate patterns. This observation holds consistently across the datasets considered in this study."

      "heading" : "5.3.3. BETTER USE OF CAPACITY",
      "text" : "Given the distribution of singular values observed in Figure 2, we want to analyze the intrinsic dimensionality of the representation learned by the different networks at every layer. To that end, we use the local covariance dimension (Dasgupta & Freund, 2008) which can be measured from the covariance matrix of the data. For each layer k of the fully connected network, we compute the activation’s empirical covariance matrix 1n ∑n i=1 φk(x)φk(x)\n> and obtain its sorted eigenvalues σ1 ≥ · · · ≥ σd. For each method and each layer, we select the smallest integer p such that∑p i=1 σi ≥ 0.99 ∑d i=1 σi. This gives us the number of dimensions that we need to explain 99% of the covariance. We can also compute the same quantity for the examples of each class, by only considering in the empirical estimation of the covariance of the examples xi such that yi = c. We report these numbers both on all examples and the per-class\naverage on CIFAR-10 in Table 2.\nTable 2 shows that the local covariance dimension of all the data is consistently higher for Parseval networks than all the other approaches at any layer of the network. SGDwd-da contracts all the data in very low dimensional spaces at the upper levels of the network by using only 0.4% of the total dimension (layer 3 and 4) while Parseval networks use about 81% and 56% at of the whole dimension respectively in the same layers. This is intriguing given that SGD-wd-da also increases the robustness of the network, apparently not in the same way as Parseval networks. For the average local covariance dimension of the classes, SGD-wd-da contracts each class into the same dimensionality as it contracts all the data at the upper layers of the network. For Parseval, the data of each class is contracted in about 30% and 19% of the overall dimension. These results suggest that Parseval contracts the data of each class in a lower dimensional manifold (compared to the intrinsic dimensionality of the whole data) hence making classification easier."

Thanks to the orthogonalization step following each gradient update, the weight matrices are well conditioned at each step during the optimization. We hypothesize this is the main explanation of this phenomenon. For convolutional networks (resnets), the faster convergence is not obtained at the expense of larger walltime since the cost of the projection step is negligible compared to the total cost of the forward pass on modern GPU architecture thanks to the small size of the filters."

Parseval networks are empirically and theoretically motivated by an analysis of the robustness of the predictions made by deep neural networks when their input is subject to an adversarial perturbation. The most important feature of Parseval networks is to maintain weight matrices of linear and convolutional layers to be (approximately) Parseval tight frames, which are extensions of orthogonal matrices to non-square matrices. We describe how these constraints can be maintained efficiently during SGD. We show that Parseval networks match the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy on CIFAR-10/100 and Street View House Numbers (SVHN), while being more robust than their vanilla counterpart against adversarial examples. Incidentally, Parseval networks also tend to train faster and make a better usage of the full capacity of the networks.",
