      "text" : "Active learning is an increasingly popular setting in machine learning that makes use of both labeled and unlabeled data [1, 6, 8]. In this paper we consider the pool-based active learning setting, under which algorithms have access to a pool of unlabeled examples drawn i.i.d. from the underlying distribution and have the capacity to request labels of specific examples. The hope is that by directing label queries to the most informative examples in a feedback-driven way, we might be able to achieve significant improvements in terms of sample complexity over passive learning algorithms. For instance, in the problem of learning linear separators, an exponential improvement in sample complexity could be achieved under the realizable case, where the labels are consistent with the underlying linear classifier [2, 3].\nAlthough there are significant improvements under the realizable case, in practice it is often the case that data labels are corrupted by noise. A popular assumption that characterizes the noise in the underlying label distribution is the Tsybakov noise condition (TNC), which says that the label noise decreases polynomially away from the optimal classification hyperplane. Unlike the realizable case, it is known that for most cases of the TNC condition only a polynomial achievement in sample complexity could be achieved [5, 13].\nRecently there has been substantial development of active learning algorithms for the non-realizable case with the TNC condition [5, 2, 3]. However, most of these algorithms require knowledge of the noise level, which is usually unknown in practice. Although there exist some general-purpose agnostic active learning algorithms that can adapt to some level of noise [1, 12, 9], such algorithms are often quite complicated, requiring computing some estimated bounds on classification error. Furthermore, because these methods are general purpose and are based on disagreement coefficient instead of the concept of margin, their convergence rate is not optimal in data dimension d.\nIn this paper, we present and analyze an adaptive margin-based algorithm that actively learns a linear separator for multi-dimensional data. The algorithm is inspired by recent work of adaptive algorithms for stochastic convex optimization [14] and one-dimensional active threshold learning [15]. The proposed method enjoys the following advantages:\nar X\niv :1\n40 6.\n53 83\nv1 [\nst at\n.M L\n] 2\n0 Ju\nn 20\n- The algorithm adapts to unknown levels of label noise as characterized by the TNC condition. Building on previous work [14, 15], we extend the method to multi-dimensional data and relax the constraint imposed on the TNC noise level parameter α (earlier required to be ≥ 2). Given the connection between convex optimization and active learning described in [15, 16], we conjecture that our techniques could also lead to a stochastic convex optimization algorithm that adapts to a broader class of objective functions.\n- The proposed algorithm is margin-based and is much simpler than prior attempts at agnostic active learning. In fact, it can be viewed as a modification of the non-adaptive margin-based algorithm introduced in [2] and does not require computing complex quantities such as upper and lower classification error bounds. Furthermore, our algorithm achieves optimal convergence rate in query budget T and data dimension d if logarithm factors are ignored. The algorithm also works for general loss functions other than 0/1 loss (e.g., hinge loss and logistic loss), which extends its applicability in practice.\n- Our proposed method provides insights into the model selection problem in active learning. Unlike the passive learning case, model selection under the active learning setting is much harder and there are no established ways to address this problem. Our algorithm partly solves the model selection problem because it does not require knowledge of the level of label noise of the underlying distribution, which is usually unknown in practice."

      "text" : "In the pool-based active learning setting, an algorithm is given a pool of training data with their labels unrevealed. The algorithm then actively selects data points in the training pool to request their labels. Such selection is feedback-driven and could be based on previously observed labeled and/or unlabeled data points. In many problems, the active learning framework can substantially reduce the number of labels needed compared to passive learning methods [1, 6, 8, 5, 12].\nWe assume the data points (x, y) are drawn from an unknown underlying distribution PX×Y , where X is the instance space and Y is the label space. Furthermore, the instances x are drawn in an i.i.d. manner. In this paper we assume that X ⊆ Rd is the unit ball in Rd and Y = {+1,−1}. We also assume that the underlying distribution PX is a uniform distribution over the unit ball in Rd, which is a setting commonly studied in the active learning literature [7, 8, 10].\nThe goal of active learning is to find a classifier f : X → Y such that the generalization error err(f) = E(x,y)∼P [l(f(x), y)] is minimized, where l(f(x), y) is a loss function between the prediction f(x) and the label y. Under the binary classification setting with Y = {+1,−1}, the 0/1 classification loss is of interest, where l(f(x), y) = I[yf(x) > 0] with I[·] the indicator function. In this paper we consider the case where the optimal classifier f∗ minimizing the 0/1 generalization error is linear, that is, f∗(x) = sgn(w∗ · x) where w∗ ∈ Rd. Given the optimal classifier f∗, we define the excess risk of a classifier f under 0/1 loss as err0/1(f)− err0/1(f∗). Without loss of generality, we assume all linear classifiers f(x) = sgn(w · x) have ‖w‖2 = 1. We also use Bθ(w, β) to denote the model class {f(x) = w′ · x|θ(w′, w) ≤ β, ‖w′‖2 = 1} consisting of all linear classifiers that are close to w with an angle at most β. (θ(w′, w) = arccos(w′ ·w) is the angle between w′ and w.)\nIn this paper we focus on non-realizable (noisy) cases, where labels are not assumed to be consistent with the optimal classifier (i.e. Pr[yw∗ ·x ≤ 0] > 0). We consider here a noisy model characterized by the Tsybakov noise condition (TNC) along the optimal hyperplane. Various forms of the TNC condition for the one-dimensional and multi-dimensional active learning are explored in [5, 15, 2] and have been increasingly popular in the active learning literature. In this paper, we use the\nfollowing version of the TNC condition: there exists constants 0 < µ ≤ M < ∞ such that for all linear classifier 1 w ∈ Rd, ‖w‖2 = 1, we have\nµ · θ(w,w∗)1/(1−α) ≤ err0/1(w)− err0/1(w∗) ≤M · θ(w,w∗)1/(1−α), (1) with α ∈ [0, 1) a parameter characterizing the noise level in the underlying distribution."

      "text" : "In this section we present a margin-based active learning algorithm that adapts to different noise level parameters α in the TNC condition in Eq. (1). The pseudocode of the proposed algorithm is shown in Algorithm 2. Algorithm 2 admits 4 parameters: d is the dimension of the instance space X; T is the sampling budget (i.e., the maximum number of label requests allowed); δ is a confidence parameter; r ∈ (0, 1/2) is the shinkage rate for every iteration in the algorithm, and smaller r allows us to adapt to smaller α values. The basic idea of the algorithm is to split T label requests into E iterations, using the optimal passive learning procedure within each iteration and reducing the scope of search for the best classifier after each iteration.\nThe key difference between our proposed algorithm and the one presented in Algorithm 1 is that in Algorithm 2 the number of iterations E as well as other parameters (e.g., mk, rk, bk, k) are either not needed or do not depend on the noise level α, and the number of label queries is divided evenly at each iteration. Another difference is that in our algorithm the sample budget T is fixed while in Algorithm 1 the error rate is known. It remains an open problem whether there exists a tuning-free active learning algorithm when a target error rate instead of query budget T is given [15]. Finally, instead of optimizing an approximate empirical 0/1 error in Algorithm 1, our proposed algorithm works for any surrogate loss functions with properties (A1) and (A2).\nAlgorithm 2 An adaptive active learning algorithm for multi-dimensional data 1: function ADAPTIVEACTIVELEARNING(d, δ, T , r) 2: Initialize: E = 12 log T , n = T/E, β0 = π, random ŵ0 with ‖ŵ0‖ = 1. 3: for k = 1 to E do 4: Clear the working set W .

      "text" : "In this section we give the proof of Theorem 2. We first present a convergence rate analysis for the optimal passive learning procedure in Lemma 1 and corollary 1. Both Lemma 1 and corollary 1 have the convergence rate Õ( √ d/n), which is well-known to be the optimal convergence rate when no assumption about the label noise is made. Their proofs are partly inspired by the analysis in [2].\nLemma 1 (Optimal passive learning). Fix k. Let ŵk−1 be a linear classifier and bk−1 be a margin parameter. Suppose Dk = {(xi, yi)}ni=1 is a training data set of size n that satisfies |ŵk−1 · xi| ≤ bk−1 for every data point xi.

(3)\nProof. Define S1 := {x||ŵk−1 · x| ≤ bk−1} and S2 := {x||ŵk−1 · x| > bk−1}. Clearly Dk ⊆ S1. Since θ(ŵk−1, ŵk), θ(ŵk−1, w∗k) ≤ βk−1, by Lemma 7 in [2], we have\nPr[(ŵk−1 · x)(ŵk · x) < 0, x ∈ S2] ≤ sinβk−1 C cosβk−1 ,\nPr[(ŵk−1 · x)(w∗k · x) < 0, x ∈ S2] ≤ sinβk−1 C cosβk−1 .\nAdding the two inequalities we get\nPr[(ŵk · x)(w∗k · x) < 0, x ∈ S2] ≤ 2 sinβk−1 C cosβk−1 .\nSubsequently, using (A2), we have\nerr0/1(ŵk)− err0/1(w∗k) ≤ (err0/1(ŵk|S1)− err0/1(w∗k|S1)) Pr[x ∈ S1] + 2 sinβk−1 C cosβk−1\n≤ (err(ŵk|S1)− err(w̃∗k|S1)) Pr[x ∈ S1] + 2 sinβk−1 C cosβk−1\nLemma 4 in [2] tells us that Pr[x ∈ S1] ≤ bk−1 √ d\n2 √ π . And using (A1) completes the proof.\nCorollary 1. Fix k. Let T be the number of samples obtained and E be the number of epoches. Suppose d ≥ 4, T ≥ 4, E = 12 log T , n = T/E. Assume also that βk = r\nkπ and bk−1 = 2βk−1√\nd\n√ E(1 + log(1/r)) for some constant r ∈ (0, 1/2).

(4) is trivially true for k = 1 because β0 = π > 1,√ E(1 + log(1/r)) ≥ 1 and err0/1(ŵ1) − err0/1(w∗1) ≤ err(ŵ1) − err(w̃∗1) ≤ ′ due to properties (A1) and (A2). In the remaining part of the proof we will assume that k ≥ 2, and hence βk−1 ∈ (0, π/2). Before continuing the proof, we first give a list of elementary inequalities that will be used in this proof (assuming β < π/2):\nln(1 + x) ≤ x; sinβ ≤ β; cotβ ≤ 1/β; tanβ ≤ √ 2β.\nPut C = 2E = √ T .

The proof contains three parts: first, we do a case analysis on the TNC constant µ in Eq. (1) and show that there exists an iteration k∗ such that err0/1(ŵk∗)− err0/1(w∗k∗) has the desired convergence rate; second, we prove that w∗k is exactly the same as w\n∗ in all iterations prior to k∗; finally, we prove that after iteration k∗ the empirical estimate does not deviate from the optimal classifier much.\nWe first analyze the upper bound of the TNC constant µ. By the TNC condition in Eq. (1) and the fact that α < 1, we know that µ ≤ π−1/(1−α) ≤ π−α/(1−α). Since α ≥ 1/(1 + log(1/r)), we have the following upper bound for µ:\nµ ≤ 2 (log(1/r)· α1−α−1)E · r−1\nπ α\n1−α =\n2−Er−1\n(rEπ)α/(1−α) =\n2−Er−1\nβ α/(1−α) E\n≤ r −1\nβ α/(1−α) E\n.\nThe last step holds since ≥ 1/ √ T = 2−E by definition.\nGiven the upper bound above, we can do a case analysis on µ. When µ is sufficiently small, that is,\nµ ≤ r −1\nβ α/(1−α) 1\n, (5)\nwe are done after the first iteration because by (A1), err0/1(ŵ1)− err0/1(w∗1) ≤ β0 ≤ r−1β1 ≤ r−1 (\nrµ\n)(1−α)/α =\n1/α\nr1/αµ(1−α)/α\nand with probability ≥ 1 − δE we have w∗1 = w∗ and using arguments akin to Lemma 4 (given below), we have\nerr0/1(ŵE)− err0/1(ŵ1) ≤ r\n1− r π .\nIf Eq. (5) does not hold, then by the upper bound of µ there must exist an iteration k∗ ∈ {1, 2, · · · , E − 1} such that\nr−1\nβ α/(1−α) k∗\n≤ µ ≤ r −1\nβ α/(1−α) k∗+1\n. (6)\nWe now present Lemma 2 that completes the first step of the framework of our proof. We show that for the iteration k∗ defined in Eq. (6), the excess risk err0/1(ŵk∗) − err0/1(w∗k∗) has the desired convergence rate of 1/α. Lemma 2. Suppose r ∈ (0, 1/2) and 1/(1 + log(1/r)) ≤ α < 1. With probability at least 1 − δ, under property (A1)\nerr0/1(ŵk∗)− err0/1(w∗k∗) ≤ βk∗−1 ≤ 1/α\nr 1+α α µ 1−α α\n. (7)\nProof. We know that βk∗−1 = r−2βk∗+1 ≤ r−2 ( rµ ) 1−α α . Using (A1), we get\nerr0/1(ŵk∗)− err0/1(w∗k∗) ≤ βk∗−1 ≤ r−2 (\nrµ\n) 1−α α\n= 1/α\nr 1+α α µ 1−α α\nThe next observation shows that the optimal classifier w∗k at iteration k (which is the optimal classifier within Bθ(ŵk−1, βk−1)) is identical to w∗ for all iterations prior to k∗. This means that at least at iteration k∗, the left-hand side of Eq. (7) is what we want to bound. Lemma 3. With probability at least 1 − δE, under properties (A1) and (A2), for all k ≤ k∗, w∗k = w ∗.\nProof. We use induction to prove this lemma. When k = 0 the claim is true because β0 = π. Now assume the claim is true for k, that is, θ(ŵk−1, w∗) ≤ βk−1. We want to prove θ(ŵk, w∗) ≤ βk. To see this, we apply the TNC condition in Eq. (1) to get\nθ(ŵk, w ∗) ≤\n( err0/1(ŵk)− err0/1(w∗)\nµ )1−α Therefore, we only need to prove µ ≥ (err0/1(ŵk)− err0/1(w∗))/β 1/(1−α) k .\nBecause of the induction assumption θ(ŵk−1, w∗) ≤ βk−1, w∗ is exactly w∗k. Applying Corollary 1 and taking a union bound over all k ≤ k∗ ≤ E, we know that with probability at least 1 − δE, for all k ≤ k∗,\nerr0/1(ŵk)− err0/1(w∗) β 1/(1−α) k ≤ βk−1 β 1/(1−α) k = r−1 β α/(1−α) k ≤ r −1 β α/(1−α) k∗ .\nThe last expression is ≤ µ by applying Eq. (6), and hence the proof is complete.\nFinally, we complete the last step of our proof by observing that for iterations after k∗, ŵk cannot deviate too much from ŵk∗ . This assertion is formulated and proved in Lemma 4. Lemma 4. Suppose r ∈ (0, 1/2). With probability at least 1− δE, we have\nerr0/1(ŵE)− err0/1(ŵk∗) ≤ r\n1− r βk∗−1 . (8)\nProof. With probability at least 1− δE, err0/1(ŵE)− err0/1(ŵk∗) = E∑\nk=k∗+1\nerr0/1(ŵk)− err0/1(ŵk−1) ≤ E∑\nk=k∗+1\nerr0/1(ŵk)− err0/1(w∗k)\n≤ E∑\nk=k∗+1\nβk−1 = βk∗−1 E∑ k=k∗+1 βk−1 βk∗−1\n= βk∗−1 E∑ k=k∗+1 rk−k ∗ ≤ βk∗−1 (r + r2 + · · · ) ≤ r 1− r βk∗−1\nCombining Lemmas 2,3,4, we get: err0/1(ŵE)− err0/1(w∗) = err0/1(ŵE)− err0/1(ŵk∗) + err0/1(ŵk∗)− err0/1(w∗)\n= err0/1(ŵE)− err0/1(ŵk∗) + err0/1(ŵk∗)− err0/1(w∗k∗) ≤ r 1− r βk∗−1 + βk∗−1\n= 1\n1− r βk∗−1 ≤\n1/α\nr 1+α α (1− r)µ 1−αα\nThus, completing proof of the main theorem."

Furthermore, note that our proposed algorithm adapts to all noisy level parameters α ∈ (0, 1), which corresponds to convexity parameters ρ > 1. 2 Therefore, we conjecture the existence of similar stochastic optimization algorithms that can adapt to a notion of degree of convexity ρ < 2."

It is an interesting problem whether there exist adaptive active learning algorithms when the target error rate instead of query budget T is given. In addition, Algorithm 2 fails to handle the case when α = 0. Therefore, another possible direction of future work would be to design active learning algorithms that adapts to α = 0 while still retaining the exponential improvement on convergence rate for this case, which is observed in previous active learning research [2, 3].\n2The relationship between α and ρ can be made explicitly by noting α = 1− 1/ρ."
