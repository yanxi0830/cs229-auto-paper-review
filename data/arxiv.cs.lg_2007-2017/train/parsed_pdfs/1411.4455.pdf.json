      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Relation Extraction (RE) is the process of generating structured relation knowledge from unstructured natural language texts. Traditional supervised methods (Zhou et al., 2005; Bach and Badaskar, 2007) on small hand-labeled corpora, such as MUC1 and ACE2, can achieve high precision and recall. However, as producing handlabeled corpora is laborius and expensive, the supervised approach can not satisfy the increasing\n1http://www.itl.nist.gov/iaui/894.02/related projects/muc/ 2http://www.itl.nist.gov/iad/mig/tests/ace/\ndemand of building large-scale knowledge repositories with the explosion of Web texts. To address the lacking training data issue, we consider the distant (Mintz et al., 2009) or weak (Hoffmann et al., 2011) supervision paradigm attractive, and we improve the effectiveness of the paradigm in this paper.\nThe intuition of the paradigm is that one can take advantage of several knowledge bases, such as WordNet3, Freebase4 and YAGO5, to automatically label free texts, like Wikipedia6 and New York Times corpora7, based on some heuristic alignment assumptions. An example accounting for the basic but practical assumption is illustrated in Figure 1, in which we know that the two entities (<Barack Obama, U.S.>) are not only involved in the relation instances8 coming from knowledge bases (President-of(Barack Obama, U.S.) and Born-in(Barack Obama, U.S.)),\n3http://wordnet.princeton.edu 4http://www.freebase.com 5http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/yago-naga/yago 6http://www.wikipedia.org 7http://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC2008T19 8According to convention, we regard a structured triple r(ei, ej) as a relation instance which is composed of a pair of entities <ei, ej>and a relation name r with respect to them.\nbut also co-occur in several relation mentions9 appearing in free texts (Barack Obama is the 44th and current President of the U.S. and Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, U.S., etc.). We extract diverse textual features from all those relation mentions and combine them into a rich feature vector labeled by the relation names (President-of and Born-in) to produce a weak training corpus for relation classification.\nThis paradigm is promising to generate largescale training corpora automatically. However, it comes up against three technical challeges:\n• Sparse features. As we cannot tell what kinds of features are effective in advance, we have to use NLP toolkits, such as Stanford CoreNLP10, to extract a variety of textual features, e.g., named entity tags, part-of-speech tags and lexicalized dependency paths. Unfortunately, most of them appear only once in the training corpus, and hence leading to very sparse features.\n• Noisy features. Not all relation mentions express the corresponding relation instances. For example, the second relation mention in Figure 1 does not explicitly describe any relation instance, so features extracted from this sentence can be noisy. Such analogous cases commonly exist in feature extraction.\n• Incomplete labels. Similar to noisy fea9The sentences that contain the given entity pair are called\nrelation mentions. 10http://nlp.stanford.edu/downloads/corenlp.shtml\ntures, the generated labels can be incomplete. For example, the fourth relation mention in Figure 1 should have been labeled by the relation Senate-of. However, the incomplete knowledge base does not contain the corresponding relation instance (Senate-of(Barack Obama, U.S.)). Therefore, the distant supervision paradigm may generate incomplete labeling corpora.\nIn essence, distantly supervised relation extraction is an incomplete multi-label classification task with sparse and noisy features.\nIn this paper, we formulate the relationextraction task from a novel perspective of using matrix completion with low rank criterion. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply this technique on relation extraction with distant supervision. More specifically, as shown in Figure 2, we model the task with a sparse matrix whose rows present items (entity pairs) and columns contain noisy textual features and incomplete relation labels. In such a way, relation classification is transformed into a problem of completing the unknown labels for testing items in the sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features with training labels, based on the assumption that the item-by-feature and item-by-label joint matrix is of low rank. The rationale of this assumption is that noisy features and incomplete labels are semantically correlated. The low-rank factorization of the sparse feature-label matrix delivers the low-dimensional representation of de-correlation for features and labels.\nWe contribute two optimization models, DRMC11-b and DRMC-1, aiming at exploiting the sparsity to recover the underlying low-rank matrix and to complete the unknown testing labels simultaneously. Moreover, the logistic cost function is integrated in our models to reduce the influence of noisy features and incomplete labels, due to that it is suitable for binary variables. We also modify the fixed point continuation (FPC) algorithm (Ma et al., 2011) to find the global optimum.\nExperiments on two widely used datasets demonstrate that our noise-tolerant approaches outperform the baseline and the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we discuss the influence of feature sparsity, and our approaches consistently achieve better performance than compared methods under different sparsity degrees."

      "text" : "The idea of distant supervision was firstly proposed in the field of bioinformatics (Craven and Kumlien, 1999). Snow et al. (2004) used WordNet as the knowledge base to discover more hpyernym/hyponym relations between entities from news articles. However, either bioinformatic database or WordNet is maintained by a few experts, thus hardly kept up-to-date.\nAs we are stepping into the big data era, the explosion of unstructured Web texts simulates us to build more powerful models that can automatically extract relation instances from large-scale online natural language corpora without handlabeled annotation. Mintz et al. (2009) adopted Freebase (Bollacker et al., 2008; Bollacker et al., 2007), a large-scale crowdsourcing knowledge base online which contains billions of relation instances and thousands of relation names, to distantly supervise Wikipedia corpus. The basic alignment assumption of this work is that if a pair of entities participate in a relation, all sentences that mention these entities are labeled by that relation name. Then we can extract a variety of textual features and learn a multi-class logistic regression classifier. Inspired by multi-instance learning (Maron and Lozano-Pérez, 1998), Riedel et al. (2010) relaxed the strong assumption and replaced all sentences with at least one sentence. Hoffmann et al. (2011) pointed out that many entity\n11It is the abbreviation for Distant supervision for Relation extraction with Matrix Completion\npairs have more than one relation. They extended the multi-instance learning framework (Riedel et al., 2010) to the multi-label circumstance. Surdeanu et al. (2012) proposed a novel approach to multi-instance multi-label learning for relation extraction, which jointly modeled all the sentences in texts and all labels in knowledge bases for a given entity pair. Other literatures (Takamatsu et al., 2012; Min et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013) addressed more specific issues, like how to construct the negative class in learning or how to adopt more information, such as name entity tags, to improve the performance.\nOur work is more relevant to Riedel et al.’s (2013) which considered the task as a matrix factorization problem. Their approach is composed of several models, such as PCA (Collins et al., 2001) and collaborative filtering (Koren, 2008). However, they did not concern about the data noise brought by the basic assumption of distant supervision."

      "text" : "We apply a new technique in the field of applied mathematics, i.e., low-rank matrix completion with convex optimization. The breakthrough work on this topic was made by Candès and Recht (2009) who proved that most low-rank matrices can be perfectly recovered from an incomplete set of entries. This promising theory has been successfully applied on many active research areas, such as computer vision (Cabral et al., 2011), recommender system (Rennie and Srebro, 2005) and system controlling (Fazel et al., 2001). Our models for relation extraction are based on the theoretic framework proposed by Goldberg et al. (2010), which formulated the multi-label transductive learning as a matrix completion problem. The new framework for classification enhances the robustness to data noise by penalizing different cost functions for features and labels."

      "text" : "Suppose that we have built a training corpus for relation classification with n items (entity pairs), d-dimensional textual features, and t labels (relations), based on the basic alignment assumption proposed by Mintz et al. (2009). Let Xtrain ∈ Rn×d and Ytrain ∈ Rn×t denote the feature matrix and the label matrix for training, respectively. The linear classifier we adopt aims to explicitly learn\nthe weight matrix W ∈ Rd×t and the bias column vector b ∈ Rt×1 with the constraint of minimizing the loss function l,\narg min W,b\nl(Ytrain, [ 1 Xtrain ] [ bT\nW\n] ), (1)\nwhere 1 is the all-one column vector. Then we can predict the label matrix Ytest ∈ Rm×t of m testing items with respect to the feature matrix Xtest ∈ Rm×d. Let\nZ = [ Xtrain Ytrain Xtest Ytest ] .\nThis linear classification problem can be transformed into completing the unobservable entries in Ytest by means of the observable entries in Xtrain, Ytrain and Xtest, based on the assumption that the rank of matrix Z ∈ R(n+m)×(d+t) is low. The model can be written as,\narg min Z∈R(n+m)×(d+t) rank(Z)\ns.t. ∀(i, j) ∈ ΩX , zij = xij , (1 ≤ i ≤ n+m, 1 ≤ j ≤ d), ∀(i, j) ∈ ΩY , zi(j+d) = yij , (1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ t),\n(2)\nwhere we use ΩX to represent the index set of observable feature entries in Xtrain and Xtest, and ΩY to denote the index set of observable label entries in Ytrain.\nFormula (2) is usually impractical for real problems as the entries in the matrix Z are corrupted by noise. We thus define\nZ = Z∗ + E,\nwhere Z∗ as the underlying low-rank matrix\nZ∗ = [ X∗ Y ∗ ] = [ X∗train Y ∗ train\nX∗test Y ∗ test\n] ,\nand E is the error matrix\nE = [ EXtrain EYtrain EXtest 0 ] .\nThe rank function in Formula (2) is a non-convex function that is difficult to be optimized. The surrogate of the function can be the convex nuclear norm ||Z||∗ = ∑ σk(Z) (Candès and Recht, 2009), where σk is the k-th largest singular value of Z. To tolerate the noise entries in the error matrix E, we minimize the cost functions Cx and Cy for features and labels respectively, rather than using the hard constraints in Formula (2).\nAccording to Formula (1), Z∗ ∈ R(n+m)×(d+t) can be represented as [X∗,WX∗] instead of [X∗, Y ∗], by explicitly modeling the bias vector b. Therefore, this convex optimization model is called DRMC-b,\narg min Z,b\nµ||Z||∗ + 1 |ΩX | ∑\n(i,j)∈ΩX\nCx(zij , xij)\n+ λ |ΩY | ∑\n(i,j)∈ΩY\nCy(zi(j+d) + bj , yij),\n(3)\nwhere µ and λ are the positive trade-off weights. More specifically, we minimize the nuclear norm ||Z||∗ via employing the regularization terms, i.e., the cost functions Cx and Cy for features and labels.\nIf we implicitly model the bias vector b, Z∗ ∈ R(n+m)×(1+d+t) can be denoted by [1, X∗,W ′ X∗] instead of [X∗, Y ∗], in which W ′ takes the role of [bT ; W] in DRMC-b. Then we derive another optimization model called DRMC1,\narg min Z\nµ||Z||∗ + 1 |ΩX | ∑\n(i,j)∈ΩX\nCx(zi(j+1), xij)\n+ λ |ΩY | ∑\n(i,j)∈ΩY\nCy(zi(j+d+1), yij)\ns.t. Z(:, 1) = 1, (4)\nwhere Z(:, 1) denotes the first column of Z. For our relation classification task, both features and labels are binary. We assume that the actual entry u belonging to the underlying matrix Z∗ is randomly generated via a sigmoid function (Jordan, 1995): Pr(u|v) = 1/(1 + e−uv), given the observed binary entry v from the observed sparse matrix Z. Then, we can apply the log-likelihood cost function to measure the conditional probability and derive the logistic cost function for Cx and Cy,\nC(u, v) = − logPr(u|v) = log(1 + e−uv),\nAfter completing the entries in Ytest, we adopt the sigmoid function to calculate the conditional probability of relation rj , given entity pair pi pertaining to yij in Ytest,\nPr(rj |pi) = 1\n1 + e−yij , yij ∈ Ytest.\nFinally, we can achieve Top-N predicted relation instances via ranking the values of Pr(rj |pi)."

At each round of iteration, we gain a recovered matrix and average the F114 scores from Top-5 to Top-all predicted relation instances to measure the performance. Figure 3 illustrates the curves of average F1 scores. After recording the rank associated with the highest F1 score on each fold, we compute the mean and the standard deviation to estimate the range of optimal rank for testing.

      "heading" : "6 Discussion",
      "text" : "We have mentioned that the basic alignment assumption of distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009) tends to generate noisy (noisy features and incomplete labels) and sparse (sparse features) data. In this section, we discuss how our approaches tackle these natural flaws.\nDue to the noisy features and incomplete labels, the underlying low-rank data matrix with truly effective information tends to be corrupted and the rank of observed data matrix can be extremely high. Figure 5 demonstrates that the ranks of data matrices are approximately 2,000 for the initial optimization of DRMC-b and DRMC-1. However, those high ranks result in poor performance. As the ranks decline before approaching the optimum, the performance gradually improves, implying that our approaches filter the noise in data\nand keep the principal information for classification via recovering the underlying low-rank data matrix.\nFurthermore, we discuss the influence of the feature sparsity for our approaches and the stateof-the-art methods. We relax the feature filtering threshold (θ = 4, 3, 2) in Surdeanu et al.’s (2012) open source program to generate more sparse features from NYT’10 dataset. Figure 6 shows that our approaches consistently outperform the baseline and the state-of-the-art methods with diverse feature sparsity degrees. Table 2 also lists the range of optimal rank for DRMC-b and DRMC1 with different θ. We observe that for each approach, the optimal range is relatively stable. In other words, for each approach, the amount of truly effective information about underlying semantic correlation keeps constant for the same dataset, which, to some extent, explains the reason why our approaches are robust to sparse features."

    "abstractText" : "The essence of distantly supervised relation extraction is that it is an incomplete multi-label classification problem with sparse and noisy features. To tackle the sparsity and noise challenges, we propose solving the classification problem using matrix completion on factorized matrix of minimized rank. We formulate relation classification as completing the unknown labels of testing items (entity pairs) in a sparse matrix that concatenates training and testing textual features with training labels. Our algorithmic framework is based on the assumption that the rank of item-by-feature and item-by-label joint matrix is low. We apply two optimization models to recover the underlying low-rank matrix leveraging the sparsity of featurelabel matrix. The matrix completion problem is then solved by the fixed point continuation (FPC) algorithm, which can find the global optimum. Experiments on two widely used datasets with different dimensions of textual features demonstrate that our low-rank matrix completion approach significantly outperforms the baseline and the state-of-the-art methods.",
