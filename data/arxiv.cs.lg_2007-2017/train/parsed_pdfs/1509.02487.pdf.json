A monitoring application can probe a small number of nodes at each step, and our goal is to compute a probing schedule that minimizes the expected number of undiscovered items at the system, or equivalently, minimizes the expected time to discover a new item in the system. We study the Schedule Optimization problem both for deterministic and randomized memoryless algorithms.

      "text" : "We introduce and study a fundamental stochastic search and detection problem, Schedule Optimization, that captures a variety of practical applications, ranging from monitoring content changes on the web, social networks, and user activities to detecting failure on large systems with many individual machines.\nOur optimization problem consists of a large set of units, or nodes, that generate events, or items, according to a random process with known or unknown parameters. A detection algorithm can discover new items in the system by probing a small number of nodes in each step. This setting defines a discrete, infinite time process, and the goal of the stochastic optimization problem is to construct a probing schedule that minimizes the long term expected number of undiscovered items in the system, or equivalently, minimizes the expected time to discover a new item in the system.\nWe outline several important applications of this schedule optimization problem:\nNews and Feed Aggregators. To provide up to date summary of the news, news aggregator sites need to constantly browse the Web, and often also the blogosphere and social networks, for new items. Scanning a site for new items requires significant communication and computation resources, thus the news aggregator can scan only a few sites simultaneously. The frequency of visiting a site has to depend on the likelihood of finding new items in that site. [9,21,1]\nAlgorithmic Trading on Data. An emerging trend in algorithmic stock trading is the use of automatic search through the Web, the blogosphere, and social networks for relevant information that can be used in fast trading, before it appears in the more popular news sites [4,14,5,17,11,8,16]. The critical issue in this application is the speed of discovering new events, but again there is a resource limit on the number of sites that the search algorithm can scan simultaneously.\nDetecting Anomaly and Machine Malfunction. In large server farm or any other large collection of semi-autonomous machines a central controller needs to identify and contain anomalies and malefactions as soon as possible, before they spread in the system. To minimize interference with the system’s operation the controller must probe only a small number of machines in each step."

      "text" : "We consider an infinite, discrete time process in which n nodes generate new items according to a stochastic process which is governed by a generating vector π (see Section 3 for details). An algorithm can probe up to c nodes per step to discover all new items in these nodes. The goal is to minimize the cost of the algorithm (or the probing schedule), which we define as the long term (steady state) expected number of undiscovered items in the system.\nWe first show that the obvious approach of probing at each step the nodes with maximum expected number of undiscovered items at that step is not optimal. In fact, the cost of such a schedule can be arbitrary far from the optimal.\nOur first result toward the study of efficient schedules is a lower bound on the cost of any deterministic or random schedule as a function of the generating vector π.\nNext we assume that the generating vector π is known and study explicit constructions of deterministic and random schedules. We construct a deterministic schedule whose cost is within a factor of (3 + (c− 1)/c) of the optimal cost, and a very simple, memoryless random schedule with cost that is within a factor of (2 + (c− 1)/c) from optimal, where c is the maximum number of probes at each step.\nFinally, we address the more realistic scenario in which the generating vector, π, is not known to the algorithm and may change in time. We construct an adaptive scheduling algorithm that learns from probing the nodes and converges to the optimal memoryless random schedule."

      "text" : "The News and Feed Aggregation problem is a very well-studied topic, in which the general goal is to obtain the updates of news websites (e.g. by RSS feeds). Among many introduced objectives [19,9,1] in studying this problem, the most similar one to our cost function is the delay function presented by [21]. In [21] it is assumed that the rates of the news publication does not change, where in our setting these rates may change and our algorithm (Adaptive) can adapt itself to the new setting. Also, we assume at any given time the number of probes is fixed (or bounded) regarding the limited computational power for simultaneous probes, but [21] uses a relaxed assumption by fixing the number of probes over a time window of a fixed length which may result in high number of probes at a single time step. Finally, [21] introduces a deterministic algorithm in which the number of probes to each feed is obtained by applying the Lagrange multipliers method (very similar result to Theorem 3), but they loose the guarantee on optimality of their solution, by rounding the estimated number of probes to integers. In contrast, our solution provides theoretical guarantee on optimality of our output schedule.\nWeb-crawling is another related topic, where a web-crawler aims to obtain the most recent snapshots of the web. However, it differs from our model substantially: in web-crawling algorithm data get updated, so missing some intermediate snapshot would not affect the quality of the algorithm, where in our model data are generated and they all need to be processed [3,22].\nThere has been an extensive work on Outbreak Detection (motivated in part by the “Battle of Water Sensors Network” challenge [20]) using statistic or mobile sensor in physical domains, and regarding a variety of objectives [13,10,7]. Our model deviates from the Outbreak Detection problem as it is geared to detection in virtual networks such as the Web or social networks embedded in the Internet, where a monitor can reach (almost) any node at about the same cost.\nAnother related problem is the Emerging Topic Detection problem, where the goal is to identify emergent topics in a social network, assuming full access to the stream of all postings. Besides having different objectives, our model differs mainly in this accessibility assumption: the social network providers have an immediate access to all tweets or postings as they are submitted to their servers, whereas in our model we consider an outside observer who needs an efficient mechanism to monitor changes, without having such full access privilege [2,15].\nIn the next section, we formally define our model and the Schedule Optimization problem."

      "text" : "We study an infinite, discrete time process in which a set of n nodes, indexed by 1, . . . , n, generate new items according to a random generating process. The generating process at a given time step is characterized by a generating vector π = (π1, . . . , πn), where πi is the expected number of new items generated at\nnode i at that step (by either a Bernoulli or a Poisson process). The generation processes in different nodes are independent.\nWe focus first on a static generating process in which the generating vector does not change in time. We then extend our results to adapt to generating vectors that change in time.\nOur goal is to detect new events as fast as possible by probing in each step a small number of nodes. In particular, we consider probing schedules that can probe up to c nodes per step.\nDefinition 1 (Schedule). A c-schedule is a function S : N → {1, . . . , n}c specifying a set of c nodes to be probed at any time t ∈ N. A deterministic function S defines a deterministic schedule, otherwise the schedule is random.\nDefinition 2 (Memoryless Schedule). A random schedule is memoryless if it is defined by a vector p = (p1, . . . , pn) such that at any step the schedule probes a set C of c items with probability ∏\nj∈C pi independent of any other event. In that case we use the notation S = p.\nDefinition 3 (Cyclic Schedule). A schedule, S, is ℓ-cyclic if there is a finite time t0 such that from time t0 on, the schedule repeats itself every period of ℓ steps. A schedule is cyclic if it is ℓ-cyclic for some positive integer ℓ.\nThe quality of a probing schedule is measured by the speed in which it discovers new items in the system. When a schedule probes a node i at a time t, all items that were generated at that node by time t− 1 are discovered (thus, each item is not discovered in at least one step). We define the cost of a probing schedule as the long term expected number of undiscovered items in the system.\nDefinition 4 (Cost). The cost of schedule S in a system of n nodes with generating vector π is\ncost (S, π) = lim t→∞\n1\nt\nt ∑\nt′=1\nE [ QS(t) ]\n= lim t→∞\n1\nt\nt ∑\nt′=1\nn ∑\ni=1\nE [ QSi (t) ] ,\nwhere QSi (t) is the number of undiscovered items at node i and at time t, and QS(t) =\n∑n i=1 Q S i (t). The expectation is taken over the distribution of the gen-\nerating system and the probing schedule.\nWhile the cost can be unbounded for some schedules, the cost of the optimal schedule is always bounded. To see that, consider a round-robin schedule, S, that probes each node every n steps. Clearly no item is undiscovered in this schedule for more than n steps, and the expected number of items generated in an interval of n steps is n\n∑n i=1 πi. Thus, Q S(t) ≤ n∑ni=1 πi, which implies cost (S, π) ≤ n ∑n\ni=1 πi. Therefore, without loss of generality we can restrict our discussion to bounded cost schedules. Also, note that when the sequence { E [ QS(t) ]} t∈N converges we have cost (S, π) = lim\nt→∞ E [ QS(t) ] (Cesaro Means [6]).\nOne can equivalently define the cost of a schedule in terms of the expected time that an item is in the system until it is discovered.\nLemma 1. Let ωSi be the expected waiting time of an item generated at node i until node i is probed by schedule S. Then\ncost (S, π) = n ∑\ni=1\nπiω S i .\nProof. Following the definition of the cost function we have\ncost (S, π) = lim t→∞\n1\nt\nt ∑\nt′=1\nn ∑\ni=1\nE [ QSi (t ′) ] =\nn ∑\ni=1\n[\nlim t→∞\n∑t t′=1 E\n[ QSi (t ′) ]\nt\n]\n=\nn ∑\ni=1\nπiω S i ,\nwhere the last eqaulity is obtained by applying Little’s Law [12]. ⊓⊔\nCorollary 1. A schedule that minimizes the expected number of undiscovered items in the system simultaneously minimizes the expected time that an item is\nundiscovered.\nCorollary 2. For any schedule S, cost (S, π) ≥ ∑n\ni=1 πi.\nProof. As mentioned above, when we probe a node i at time t we discover only the items that have been generated by time t − 1. Therefore, ωSi ≥ 1, and by Lemma 1 the proof is complete. ⊓⊔\nNow, our main problem is defined as the following:\nDefinition 5 (Schedule Optimization). Given a generating vector π and a positive integer c, find a c-schedule with minimum cost.\nWhen the generating vector is not known a priori to the algorithm the goal is to design a schedule that converges to an optimal one. For that we need the following definition:\nDefinition 6 (Convergence). We say schedule S converges to schedule S ′, if for any generating vector π, lim\nt→∞\n∣ ∣ ∣E [ QS(t) ] − E [ QS ′ (t) ]∣ ∣ ∣ = 0."

For each i let ri be a nonnegative integer such that 2ri ≥ ni > 2ri−1, and let ρ = maxi ri. Lemma 2. There is a 2ρ-cyclic 1-schedule D such that node i is probed exactly every 2ri steps.\nProof. Without loss of generality assume ∑n i=1 2 −ri = 1, otherwise we can add auxiliary nodes to complete the sum to 1, with the powers (ri’s) associated with the auxiliary nodes all bounded by ρ.\nWe prove the lemma by induction on ρ. If ρ = 0, then there is only one node, and the schedule is 1-cyclic. Now, assume the statement holds for all ρ′ < ρ. Since the smallest frequency is 2−ρ, and the sum of the frequencies is 1, there must be two nodes, v and u, with same frequency 2−ρ. Join the two nodes to a new node w with frequency 2−ρ+1. Repeat this process for all nodes with frequency 2−ρ. We are left with a collection of nodes all with frequencies > 2−ρ. By the inductive hypothesis there is a ( 2ρ−1 )\n-cyclic schedule D′ such that each node i is probed exactly each 2ri steps. In particular a node w that replaced u and v is probed exactly each 2−ρ+1 steps.\nNow, we create an 2ρ-schedule, D, whose cycle is obtained by repeating the cycle of D′ two times. For each probe to w that replaced a pair u, v, in the first cycle we probe u and in the second cycle we probe v. Thus, u and v are probed exactly every 2ρ steps, and the new schedule does not change the frequency of probing nodes with frequency larger than 2−ρ. ⊓⊔ Theorem 2.

By Lemma 3, the probability of not probing i during the time interval [t/2, t) is at most\nt−1 ∏\nt′=t/2\n(1− pi(t′)) ≤ ( 1− 1 n √ t\n)t/2\n≤ e− t 2n √ t ≤ 2 exp ( −π∗t 1/3\n6\n)\n= δ(t)\n2n .\nA union bound over all the nodes completes the proof. ⊓⊔\nLemma 5. Suppose node i is probed at a time t′ > t/2. Then,\nPr [ |π̃i(t′)− πi| > t− 1 3πi ] < δ(t)\n2n .\nProof. We estimate π from t′ > t/2 steps, each with πi expected number of new items. Applying a Chernoff bound [18] for the sum of t′ independent random variables with either Bernulli or Poisson distribution we have\nPr [ |π̃i(t′)− πi| > t− 1 3 πi ] < 2 exp\n(\n− t − 2 3πit ′\n3\n) ≤ 2 exp ( − t − 2 3π∗t\n6\n)\n= δ(t)\n2n . ⊓⊔\nNote that by union bound, Lemma 5 holds, with probability at least 1−δ(t)/2, for all the nodes that are probed after t/2.\nLemma 6. Suppose t ≥ N0. With probability at least 1 − δ(t) we have for all i ∈ [n],\n(\n1− 1 t1/3 + 1\n)\np∗i ≤\n√\n1− t−1/3 1 + t−1/3 p∗i ≤ pi(t) ≤\n√\n1 + t−1/3 1− t−1/3 p ∗ i ≤ ( 1 + 1 t1/3 − 1 ) p∗i\nProof. Applying Lemma 4, Lemma 5 and a union bound, with probability 1−δ(t) all the nodes are probed during the time [t/2, t) and |π̃i(t) − πi| ≤ t−1/3πi for all i ∈ [n]. Since pi(t) = √ π̃i(t)\n∑ j √ π̃j(t) , we obtain\npi(t) ≥ √ (1− t−1/3)πi ∑\nj\n√ (1 + t−1/3)πj =\n√\n1− t−1/3 1 + t−1/3\n√ πi\n∑\nj\n√ πj =\n√\n1− t−1/3 1 + t−1/3 p∗i ≥ (1− 1 t1/3 + 1 )p∗i\nwhere the last inequality uses the Taylor series of √ 1 + x. The upper bound is obtained by a similar argument. ⊓⊔\nCorollary 6. The variation distance between the distribution p(t) = (p1(t), . . . , pn(t)) used by algorithm Adaptive at time t ≥ N0, and the distribution p∗ = (p∗i , . . . , p∗n) used by the optimal memoryless algorithm satisfy\n‖ p(t)− p∗ ‖= 1 2\nn ∑\ni=1\n|pi(t)− p∗i | ≤ n t1/3 − 1 + δ(t) t→∞−→ 0.\nFinally, we present our proof for Theorem 4.\nProof of Theorem 4. Recall that we defined τSi (t) as the number of steps from the last time that node i was probed until time t in an execution of an schedule S, and E [\nQSi ] = πiE [ τSi (t) ] .\nLet F (t) indicate the event that the inequalities in Lemma 6 are held for ∀t′ ∈ [t/2, t). Therefore, Pr [F (t)] < 1 − δ(t/2)·t2 by applying union bound over all t′ ∈ [t/2, t), and using the fact that δ(t′) ≤ δ(t/2). Therefore,\n|E [ QA(t) ] − E [ QR(t) ] | = ∣ ∣ ∣\n∣ ∣\nn ∑\ni=1\nπiE [ τAi (t) ]\n− n ∑\ni=1\nπiE [ τRi (t) ]\n∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣\n≤ n ∑\ni=1\nπi ∣ ∣E [ τAi (t) ] − E [ τRi (t) ]∣ ∣\n≤ n ∑\ni=1\nπi ∣ ∣E [ τAi (t) ] − E [ τAi (t) | F (t) ]∣ ∣\n+\nn ∑\ni=1\nπi ∣ ∣E [ τAi (t) | F (t) ] − E [ τRi (t) ]∣ ∣ ,\nwhere we used the triangle inequality for both inequalities. So, it suffices to show that for every i,\nlim t→∞\n∣ ∣E [ τAi (t) ] − E [ τAi (t) | F (t) ]∣\n∣ = lim t→∞\n∣ ∣E [ τAi (t) | F (t) ] − E [ τRi (t) ]∣ ∣ = 0.\nObviously, τAi (t) ≤ t. Now by letting t ≥ 2N0 we have,\nE [ τAi (t) ] = Pr [F (t)]E [ τAi (t) | F (t) ] + Pr [¬F (t)]E [ τAi (t) | ¬F (t) ]\n≤ E [ τAi (t) | F (t) ]\n+ δ(t/2)t\n2 t = E\n[ τAi (t) | F (t) ]\n+ δ(t/2)t2\n2 . (4)\nWe also get\nE [ τAi (t) ]\n≥ ( 1− δ(t/2)t 2 ) E [ τAi (t) | F (t) ]\n(5)\n= E [ τAi (t) | F (t) ] − δ(t/2)t 2 E [ τAi (t) | F (t) ] ≥ E [ τAi (t) | X ] − δ(t)t 2 2 .\nNote that lim t→∞\nδ(t/2)t2\n2 = limt→∞ 4ne\n−π∗t 1/3\n6 3√ 2 t2 = 0, and thus by (4) and (5) we have\nlim t→∞\nE [ τAi (t) ] − E [ τAi (t) | F (t) ] = 0 ⇒ lim t→∞ ∣ ∣E [ τAi (t) ] − E [ τAi (i) | F (t) ]∣ ∣ = 0.\n(6)\nNow, we show that lim t→∞\n∣ ∣E [ τAi (t) | F (t) ] − E [ τRi (t) ]∣ ∣ = 0. So here, we as-\nsume F (t) holds. So for every i ∈ [n], node i is probed in [t/2, t), and for all t′ ∈ [t/2, t) we have\n(i) pi(t ′) ≥\n(\n1− 1 t′1/3+1\n) p∗i ≥ ( 1− 1 (t/2)1/3+1 ) p∗i . So,\nE [ τAi (t) | F (t) ]\n≤ ( 1− 1 (t/2)1/3 + 1\n)−1 1\np∗i =\n( 1 + (t/2)−1/3 ) 1\np∗i .\n(ii) pi(t ′) ≤\n(\n1 + 1 t′1/3−1\n) p∗i ≤ ( 1 + 1 (t/2)1/3−1 ) p∗i . Hence,\nE [ τAi (t) | F (t) ]\n≥ ( 1 + 1\n(t/2)1/3 − 1\n)−1 1\np∗i =\n( 1− (t/2)−1/3 ) 1\np∗i .\nObviously E [ τRi (t) ] = 1p∗i , since probing node i by R can be viewed as a geometric distribution with parameter p∗i , and since δ(t) → 0 as t → ∞ we have\nE [ τRi (t) ]\n= 1\np∗i = lim t→∞\n( 1− (t/2)−1/3 ) 1\np∗i ≤ lim t→∞ E [ τAi (t) | F (t) ]\n≤ lim t→∞\n( 1 + (t/2)−1/3 ) 1\np∗i =\n1\np∗i = E\n[ τRi (t) ] .\nTherefore,\nlim t→∞\n|E [ τAi (t) | F (t) ] − E [ τRi (t) ] | = 0. (7)\nThus, by (6) and (7) we have lim t→∞\n|E [ QA(t) ] −E [ QR(t) ] | = 0, and A converges to S, and since lim\nt→∞ E [ QS(t) ] = ( ∑n i=1\n√ πi )2 , it implies that lim\nt→∞ E [ QA(t) ]\n= ( ∑n\ni=1\n√ πi )2\n= cost (A, π) (by Cesaro Mean [6]). ⊓⊔ Note that one can obtain an adaptive schedule Ac by choosing c probes in each step, at each round of Adaptive, and using similar argument as in Section 4.4 (and similar to Corollary 3), it is easy to see that Ac converges to Rc.\nFinally, if π changes, the Adaptive algorithm converges to the new optimal memoryless algorithm, as the change in the rate of generating new items is observed by Adaptive."

    "abstractText" : "We formulate and study a fundamental search and detection problem, Schedule Optimization, motivated by a variety of real-world applications, ranging from monitoring content changes on the web, social networks, and user activities to detecting failure on large systems with many individual machines. We consider a large system consists of many nodes, where each node has its own rate of generating new events, or items. A monitoring application can probe a small number of nodes at each step, and our goal is to compute a probing schedule that minimizes the expected number of undiscovered items at the system, or equivalently, minimizes the expected time to discover a new item in the system. We study the Schedule Optimization problem both for deterministic and randomized memoryless algorithms. We provide lower bounds on the cost of an optimal schedule and construct close to optimal schedules with rigorous mathematical guarantees. Finally, we present an adaptive algorithm that starts with no prior information on the system and converges to the optimal memoryless algorithms by adapting to observed data.",
