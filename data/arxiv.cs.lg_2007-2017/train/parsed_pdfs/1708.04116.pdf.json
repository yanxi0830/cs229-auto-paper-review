      "text" : "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been successfully applied to a diverse array of tasks, such as speech recognition [1], language modeling [2], machine translation [3], music generation [4], image description [5], video description [6]. In these tasks, the non-linear transition of the internal state in the RNNs represented the temporal dynamic behavior of the sequence. This paper investigates the effectiveness of elastically varying the intermediate recurrence depth of the RNN in modeling the time-varying temporal dynamics of the sequential input data. The intermediate recurrence depth at each time interval will depend on the input and hidden state at a corresponding time interval.\nWhile deeper networks have been known to be more efficient in representing the input-output relationship compared to shallow networks, they require more data to train and are far more susceptible to the vanishing and exploding gradient problem. As a measure to safeguard against such problem when constructing a very deep network, ResNet [7] and Highway Networks [8] were proposed. Residual units in these models provide learning stability in building a very deep model. In creating temporally deep RNNs, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM, [9]), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU, [3]), and Recurrent Highway Network (RHN, [10]) were introduced to both find learning stability and model long-range temporal dependency.\nar X\niv :1\n70 8.\n04 11\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n4 A\nug 2\n01 7\nOne factor that affects the computational time is the depth (or the number of layers) of the network. Given a training dataset, to get good performance, various models with different depth are empirically compared, and this can be a very time-consuming procedure if the dataset is large.\nRecently, two studies on determining appropriate depth of a network have been considered. A general concept of time-dependent adaptive computation time (ACT) is introduced into RNN in [11]. The algorithm learns the number of computational steps to take between receiving an input and emitting an output. Here, a sigmoidal halting unit determines the probability for continuing the computation. In Spatially Adaptive Computation Time [12], the number of executed layers for the regions of the image is dynamically adjusted.\nTo model time-varying nonlinear temporal dynamics in sequential data, a recurrent network capable of varying and adjusting the recurrence depth between input intervals is examined. The recurrence depth is extended by several intermediate hidden state units, and the weight parameters involved in determining these units are dynamically calculated. The motivation behind the paper lies on overcoming a deficiency in Recurrent Highway Networks and improving their performances which are currently at the forefront of RNNs: 1) Determining the appropriate number of recurrent depth in RHN for different tasks is a huge burden and just setting it to a large number is computationally wasteful with possible repercussion in terms of performance degradation and high latency. Expanding on the idea recently proposed in ACT [11], with the use of an elastic gate in the form of a rectified exponentially decreasing function taking on as arguments as previous hidden state and input, the proposed model is able to evaluate the appropriate recurrent depth for each input. The rectified gating function enables the most significant intermediate hidden state updates to come early such that significant performance gain is achieved early. 2) Updating the weights from that of previous intermediate layer offers a richer representation than the use of shared weights across all intermediate recurrence layers. The weight update procedure is just an expansion of the idea underlying hypernetworks [13]. This structure is referred to as Early Improving Recurrent Elastic Highway Network (EI-REHN).\nThis paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes background information for the proposed method. Section 3 presents the proposed method of EI-REHN. Section 4 shows the experimental results, and finally, Section 5 concludes the paper."

The intermediate state transition from the (r − 1)-th intermediate recurrence layer to the r-th layer is given as\nhrt = g r t ⊗ srt + (1− grt )⊗ hr−1t , (9)\nwhere git and s r t are a gating function for adaptive recurrence depth and residual component, respectively. The gating function is designed to exponentially decrease as the intermediate recurrence layer increases. Consequently, intermediate recurrence state transition halts when the gating function reaches zero. The exponentially decreasing gating function enables the most significant intermediate hidden state updates to come early such that significant performance gain is achieved early. In order to reduce the number of parameters, a recurrence relationship is formulated between parameters of adjacent layers such that only the significant parameters are updated. And the weight parameters for all the intermediate recurrence layers are calculated based on a hypernetwork [13] that is a sub-network to generate the weights for another network."

It makes the model to have adaptive recurrence depth at every time step.\nAt time t, adaptive recurrence depth Rt is determined as the maximum depth that satisfies ||grt ||1 > 0. This means that the recurrence layer repeats until all hidden units have zero gating activations. Based on α and β, upper-bound to Rt for all the time steps is\nRt = max ||grt ||1>0 r ≤ max i\n⌊ 1\nαi log(βi + e\nαi) ⌋ .

      "text" : "At each intermediate recurrence layer, the residual component is calculated as follows,\nsrt = tanh(WxxtIr=1 + Wrsh r−1 t + b r s), (16)\nwhere Wx ∈ RDh×Dx , Wrs ∈ RDh×Dh , and brs ∈ RDh are input-to-residual weight matrix, hiddento-residual weight matrix, and residual bias, respectively. The residual gating ĝrt is also calculated in similar manner by replacing ’tanh’ with ’sigm’. Here, Wrs and b\nr are dependent on the recurrence layer r. In the proposed model, the recurrence depth is time-varying and can be very deep. Learning all weight matrices for all possible depth is impractical. One solution is to use a shared weight matrix. However, this constraint reduces the ability of feature representation. To solve this problem, we propose a dynamic weight matrix utilizing the concept of hypernetworks [13].\nAt t time step and r intermediate recurrence layer, for the calculations of the residual component and residual gating, we use a dynamic weight matrix that is different for each calculation and defined as follows.\nWrt = W r−1 t + ∆W r t , (17)\nwhere, ∆Wrt is obtained by hypernetwork that is a simple RNN with small number of hidden units compared with the number of main hidden units. The hypernetwork takes input as the previous residual component sr−1t and residual gating ĝ r−1 t and calculates the hidden hypernetwork state zrt ∈ RDz ,\nzrt = tanh(Wzhs r−1 t + Wzgĝ r−1 t + Wzz r−1 t + bz), (18)\nwhere Wzh ∈ RDz×Dh , Wzg ∈ RDz×Dh , Wz ∈ RDz×Dz , and bz ∈ RDz are model parameters of the hypernetwork.

(22)\nWe tried various ways of updating the parameters (e.g. weight scaling of hypernetworks in [13], weight matrix decomposition proposed by Jurgen Schmidhuber in [14], etc.) and found diagonal update to be the most effective.\nFinally, the procedure of the state transition with adaptive recurrence depth is described in Algorithm 1.

To this end, we first constructed a synthetic dataset for sequential regression task.\nThe considered task is defined as predicting two-dimensional real vector of next step after observing real vector sequence up to the current step. The synthetic dataset is generated as described in Algorithm 2. The inputs, N,T,Rmax, θ, are the number of samples, sequence length, maximum recurrence depth, and affine transform parameter, respectively. We set the inputs as (N,T,Rmax, θ) = (10000, 21, 10, π/6). The synthetic dataset is divided into the training set, validation set, and test set with the size of 8000, 1000, and 1000, respectively. For all the experiments in this paper, Tensorflow toolkit [15] was used. For training the network, Adam optimizer [16] was adopted with 20 mini-batch size, 100 epochs, and 0.01 learning rate.

The hidden dimension was set to 20. SREHN showed 0.54 MSE, Now, performances by varying the recurrent depth of SRHN from 1 to 6 produced 0.81, 0.63, 0.58, 0.55, 0.55, and 0.54 MSE. From the results, we can say that the elastic gate helps in finding a recurrent depth that performs comparable to the best RHN with fixed recurrent depth. And the proposed model EI-REHN which is a model that the dynamic weight matrix is added to SREHN showed 0.47 MSE. From this result, we can say that the dynamic weight matrix gives rise to performance gain from 0.54 to 0.47.\nWe compare the proposed model with RNN, LSTM and RHN on the synthetic dataset by varying model structure parameters such as hidden dimension Dh and recurrence depth R. Table 1 shows the MSE results with the number of parameters corresponding to each model. As shown in Table 1, RNN shows the worst performance. The proposed model shows better MSE performance with a smaller size model than other models."

The dataset is divided into 7352 training sequences and 2947 test sequences.\nFor the human activity recognition on the HAR dataset, the input sequence is modeled by RNN, LSTM, RHN, and EI-REHN. Two-layer recurrent networks are used for this experiments. Six-class softmax layer is added to the last hidden units in the top hidden sequence for classification. To train the models, cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer with 200 mini-batch size, 100 epochs, and 0.0025 learning rate are used.\nTable 2 shows the sequence classification results. In sequence classification, it is important that the last hidden units in recurrent neural networks have to contain information about the whole sequence. In the RHN case, as the recurrence depth increases, the performance decreases. We believe that the performance degradation of the RHNs from shallow recurrence depth occurs since the intermediate state transitions vanish the early information of sequence contained in the hidden units in spite of the short-cut path in the RHNs. Nonetheless, the proposed model shows better performance than other models in terms of classification accuracy."

The recurrence depth is extended by several intermediate hidden state units, and the weight parameters involved in determining these units are dynamically calculated. The motivation behind the paper lies on overcoming a deficiency in Recurrent Highway Networks and improving their performances which are currently at the forefront of RNNs: 1) Determining the appropriate number of recurrent depth in RHN for different tasks is a huge burden and just setting it to a large number is computationally wasteful with possible repercussion in terms of performance degradation and high latency. Expanding on the idea of adaptive computation time (ACT), with the use of an elastic gate in the form of a rectified exponentially decreasing function taking on as arguments as previous hidden state and input, the proposed model is able to evaluate the appropriate recurrent depth for each input. The rectified gating function enables the most significant intermediate hidden state updates to come early such that significant performance gain is achieved early. 2) Updating the weights from that of previous intermediate layer offers a richer representation than the use of shared weights across all intermediate recurrence layers. The weight update procedure is just an expansion of the idea underlying hypernetworks. To substantiate the effectiveness of the proposed network, we conducted three experiments: regression on synthetic data, human activity recognition, and language modeling on the Penn Treebank dataset. The proposed networks showed better performance than other state-of-theart recurrent networks in all three experiments.",
