      "text" : "Two powerful techniques to define such a kernel are “symmetric” spectral methods and Personalized Page Rank (PPR). With spectral methods, labels can be scalably learned using Jacobi iterations, but an inherent limiting issue is that they are applicable to symmetric (undirected) graphs, whereas often, such as with like, follow, or hyperlinks, relations between entities are inherently asymmetric. PPR naturally works with directed graphs but even with state of the art techniques does not scale when we want to learn billions of labels.\nAiming at both high scalability and handling of directed relations, we propose here Reach Diffusion and Distance Diffusion kernels. Our design is inspired by models for influence diffusion in social networks, formalized and spawned from the seminal work of [Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos 2003]. These models apply with directed interactions and are naturally suited for asymmetry. We tailor these models to define a natural asymmetric “kernel” and design highly scalable algorithms for parameter setting and label learning."

      "heading" : "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "Semi-supervised learning [7, 55, 10] is a fundamental tool in machine learning, geared for applications when there are few labeled (seed) examples (xj , yj) j ≤ n` and many nu n` unlabeled examples xi for i ∈ (n`, n` + nu]. Semi-supervised learning algorithms utilize some auxiliary structure, for example a metric embedding or interaction graph on the space of examples, from which pairwise affinity scores are implied. The goal is to learn soft labels fi for the unlabeled examples that are as consistent as possible with seed labels yj and affinities – so that a learned label of an example is more similar to seed examples that are more strongly related to it.\nThe use of appropriate affinities is critical to the quality of the learned labels, but we momentarily defer this discussion and consider learning labels with respect to provided affinities κij . A classic method is density estimation, where the learned labels minimize the cost function ∑\ni>n` ∑ j≤n` κij ||fi − yj ||22 . (1)\nThe solution, which can be computed in isolation for each example\nand each coordinate, is a weighted average of the seed labels:\nfi =\n∑ j≤n`\nκijyj∑ j≤n` κij . (2)\nThis expression is also known as the Watson Nadaraya estimator [53, 40] which builds on kernel or Parzen-window density estimation [45, 43, 48]. With this estimator, two points with similar affinity relations to the seed points get similar learned labels.\nThis estimator is most often used when the affinities are a Gram matrix or another positive semi definite matrix, but here we view it more generally. In particular, the expression (2) is a solution of the optimization (1) also when κ is asymmetric [48]."

      "text" : "We now return to discussing derivations of good kernels. Density estimates are more effective for semi-supervised learning when the kernel meaningfully captures also the weak relations. This is because labeled examples are a small fraction of all examples, and relations of most points to seed points are weak. The raw data, however, typically only includes accurate strong relations wij . At the core of the semi-supervised learning techniques is the specification of a quality “all-range” kernel that is computed from the strong relations.\nA typical raw data is provided as a set of pairwise interactions between entities: Friendships in a social network, word co-occurrence relations, product purchases, movie views by users, or features in images or documents. The interactions can have associated strengths determined by frequency, recency, confidence, or importance. The included interactions generally correspond to strong relations. A common approach to enhance such data is to embed the entities in a lower dimensional Euclidean space so that larger inner products, or closer distances, between the embeddings fit the provided interactions [30, 36]. Such embeddings are hugely successful in revealing other likely strong interactions that were not explicit in the data (and thus are useful for recommendations). They do define a dense kernel of pairwise similarities, but the weak relations do not seem to be captured accurately with this approach. A common technique in semi supervised learning is to sparsify this relation (often without explicitly computing the dense representation) by only retaining the strong relations – This is done by only including edges for pairs where one is the k nearest neighbor of another (i, j, if wij is one of the top k values in the ith row or wji is one of the top k in the jth row) or by using r-neighborhoods [52, 25, 54, 55]. The end product is an enhancement of the strong affinities we started with, but other techniques are still needed for capturing weak relations.\nTo visualize a kernel that is accurate for strong relations but not for weak ones, consider points that (approximately) form a dense manifold that lies in a higher dimensional space [46, 52, 55, 47, 5].\nar X\niv :1\n60 3.\n09 06\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 3\n0 M\nar 2\n01 6\nSemantically, we seek κ that is with respect to distances over the manifold but our starting w corresponds to distances in the higher dimensional space and is therefore accurate only for strong relations."

      "text" : "Consider a graph representation where entities are nodes and weighted edges correspond to the strong affinities. The all-range relations κij we seek can be viewed as depending on the ensemble of paths from i to j. The affinities should satisfy some intuitive desirable properties: Increase with the strength of edges, for shorter paths, and when there are more independent paths between entities. In addition, we often want to discount connections through high degree nodes, and be able to tune, via hyper parameters, the effect of each property. We now provide a brief survey of existing methods which specify an all-range kernel from such a graph.\nThe most popular methods for label learning are spectral. In perhaps the most familiar form, the learned labels are expressed as the solution of an optimization problem which has smoothness terms, which encourage learned labels of points with high wij to be more similar. To ensure a feasible solution, the objective also includes learned labels to the labeled points, and terms that encourages these labels to be close to the seed labels. These learned labels of labeled points serve only for the optimization and are eventually ignored. One such objective was proposed in an influential label propagation work by Zhu et al [54, 55]. Related objectives, adsorption and modified adsorption were studied for YouTube recommendations and named-entity recognition [4, 50, 51]. The cost function has the form\n1\n2 ∑ i,j wij ||fi − fj ||2 + λ ∑ i≤n` ||fi − yi||2 . (3)\nThe solution can be expressed as a set of linear equations of a particular diagonally dominant form and computed by inverting a corresponding matrix. We can view this inverted matrix as an all-range kernel κ (which does not depend on the labels of the seed nodes). The learned labels can then be expressed as density estimates with respect to κ. Other interpretations of the solution are as a fixed point of a stochastic sharing process or the landing probability of a random walk [11, 29].\nIn practice, the explicit storage of the dense all-range κ or performing a matrix inversion is too costly. Instead, the solution that is specific to the seed labels is approximated using the Jacobi method to approach the fixed point. The computation of each gradient update is linear in the number of edges, but typically, hundreds of iterations are needed even with various optimizations [22]. A further optimization sparsifies the set of unlabeled points using a smaller set of anchors that is large enough to preserve the short-range structure but is much smaller than the full set [19, 33]. Anchors are selected as samples or cluster representatives. Other unlabeled points are expressed as weighted combinations of anchors, removed from the “spectral” computation, and eventually inherit as their learned label, an appropriate linear combination, in essence a density estimate, of the learned labels of the anchors.\nWhile scalable, an inherent issue with these spectral techniques is that they assume symmetric (undirected) relations. Symmetry is needed for positive semi definiteness, which in turn, is needed for convergence and to ensure existence of a solution.\nA related and hugely successful set of techniques, which work with directed relations, are Personalized PageRank (PPR) and derivatives [11, 41, 27]. PPR is “personalized” to a node i or a distribution over subset of nodes. In a nutshell, PPR measures the frequency of visiting other nodes j when using short random walks\nfrom i. The PPR vectors naturally define an “all-range” kernel, where κij corresponds to the probability of visiting j from i. This PPR kernel has the desired qualitative properties we seek. To apply it to our context, however, we need to estimate visiting probabilities from all unlabeled i to sufficiently many seeds, and scalability is a game stopper even with state of the art techniques [34]. This is because, again, even the fastest designs aim to identify the nodes with largest visiting probabilities, whereas our density estimates would need the seed nodes with largest visiting probabilities. As mentioned, the seed set is a small fraction of all nodes and therefore the total visiting probability of the seed set is small. This means that any algorithm from basic Monte Carlo generation of walks to the bidirectional approach of [34] would spend most of its “work” traversing non-seed nodes. Another more scalable use of PPR is performed on the “transposed” graph [32]: All seeds with the same label are grouped and PPR is then personalized to each label, and applied to obtain similarities from labels to nodes. This method scales well when the label dimension is small (the number of optimization problems is the number of labels), but random walks are inherently not reversible and this transposed kernel has a very different semantics than “forward” PPR that is personalized to each unlabeled node."

      "heading" : "1.3 Contributions",
      "text" : "We propose a novel approach to semi-supervised learning based on what we call reach diffusion and distance diffusion kernels. Our kernels share the intuitive desirable properties of the spectral and PPR kernels but they have the advantages of suitability for asymmetric relations, like PPR, and highly scalable algorithms, as with the symmetric spectral kernels. We present algorithms for setting parameters and computing approximate learned labels using computation that is near-linear in the size of the input, and can be parallelized efficiently. We establish statistical guarantees on the estimate quality of the approximate labels with respect to the exact ones as defined in the model. We also perform a preliminary experimental study that demonstrates the application and potential of our proposed models.\n1.3.1 Reach diffusion Our reach diffusion model is inspired by popular information\ndiffusion models [20, 28] and by reliability or survival analysis [37, 31] that is extensively used to analyze engineered and biological systems.\nInfluence diffusion, as motivated by Richardson and Domingos [20] and formalized by Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos [28], is defined for a network of directed pairwise interactions between entities. A probability distribution on the subset of active edges is constructed, and the influence of a node i is then measured as the expected number of nodes i it can reach through active edges. Independent Cascade (IC) [28], which uses independent activation probabilities pe to edges, is the simplest and most studied model. The influence of a node, when defined this way, satisfies the desirable properties of increasing when paths to other nodes are shorter and when there are more independent paths. The models also apply with asymmetric connections.\nTo apply this approach for semi supervised learning, we need to first define an appropriate kernel κij that provides corresponding pairwise “influence” values. The straightforward attempt is working directly with the probability that i reaches j. But this will not scale up, for similar reasons to PPR not scaling up. Instead, we propose a refinement of the model that would both scale and satisfy natural desirable properties.\nWe borrow from reliability analysis, treating edges as a com-\nponent of a system connecting entities. We associate with edges continuous random variables µe that correspond to their lifetime (which can be thought of as inversely related to activation probabilities). Edges that correspond to more significant interactions have higher expected lifetimes. From this, we can define for each ordered pair of nodes (i, j) its survival time threshold random variable tij , which is the minimum τ such that j is reachable from i via edges with lifetime µe ≥ τ .\nNote that we can express the IC model of [28] in terms of this reliability formulation by choosing independent lifetime variables that are exponential random variables with parameter 1/pe µe ∼ Exp[1/pe]. The influence of a node i in the IC model is then the expected number of nodes reachable from i via edges with µe ≥ 1.\nIn a Monte Carlo simulation of the model we obtain a set of lifetime values µe for edges which imply corresponding survival times tij for the connectivity from i to j. For a node i, we can consider an ordering of nodes j according to decreasing values of tij . Accordingly, we define κij as inversely related to Nij , which is the position of j in this order. When j is not reachable from i we define κij = 0. Note that our kernel κ here is also a random variable, which assumes values in each simulation of the model. Our learned labels will be the expectation of the density estimates over the distribution of κ.\nThe survival time tij depends on the ensemble of directed paths from i to j. To illustrate its properties, we can consider simpler structures. A directed path in isolation, where the survivability is the minimum lifetime of a path edge. We can also consider the set of out edges from a node, and the survivability of “at least one out connection,” which is the maximum lifetime of an out edge.\nThe position Nij does not only depend on the connectivity ensembles but also on how the ensemble relates to the corresponding ensembles of other nodes. For example, suppose i connects to j via a path of length 3 and to h via a path of length 2 with independent iid µe. Then we always have Pr[tij < tih] > Pr[tij > tih], that is, the shorter path has higher survival time. When the paths are independent, we can have, however, simulations with tij > tih. But when the 2-path is the prefix of the 3-path we always have tij < tih.\nWe can verify that the qualitative desiderata we seek are satisfied: Higher significance edges, shorter paths, and more independent paths would translate to a higher expected survival times tij and lower Nij .\nA typical choice for lifetime variables in reliability models is the Weibull distribution. If we use Weibull distributed µe, with shape parameter β and scale parameter λ equal to the significance of e, we obtain some compelling properties. Note that the Weibull family includes the exponential distribution which is Weibull with shape parameter β = 1 and corresponds to “memoryless” remaining lifetime. Parameters β < 1 model higher probability of “early failures” and β > 1 to bell shaped lifetimes concentrated around the expectation. For two edges with iid lifetimes, the probability of one having a higher lifetime than the other is proportional to the ratio of their significances to the power of β. From the closure under minimum property of the Weibull distribution, the survival time of a directed path with independent Weibull lifetimes is also Weibull distributed with the same shape parameter β and scale parameter equal to an inverse of the β-norm of the vector of inverted edge significances. For exponential distributions, the expected lifetime of each edge is the inverse of its significance, and the survival threshold of the path has parameter (which is the inverse of the Weibull parameter) equal to the sum of significances, which yields expected survival that is the inverse of that sum. The shape parameter β allows us to tune the emphasis of lower significance edges\non the survival of the path.\n1.3.2 Distance diffusion Our distance diffusion kernels are inspired by a generalization,\nfirst proposed by Gomez-Rodriguez et al [24, 21, 17] of the influence model of Kempe et al [28] to a distance-based setting. They are also inspired by models of distance-based utility in networks [18, 6, 26] where the relevance of a node to another node decreases with the distance between them. In these influence models, edges have length random variables, which can be interpreted as propagation times. The influence of a node v is then defined as a function of elapsed “time” T , as the expected number of nodes that are activated within a time T (the shortest-path distance from v is at most T ). Note that the “time” here refers to propagation and activation times rather than “survival” time, so shorter times correspond to stronger connections. To prevent confusion, we will use the terms edge lengths in the context of distance diffusion here and use time only in the context of reach diffusion.\nMore precisely, we associate length random variables `e with edges with expectation that decreases with the edge significance (shorter lengths when edges are more significant). In a Monte Carlo simulation of the model we obtain a set of lengths `e ≥ 0 for edges which induces a set of shortest paths distances dij between ordered pairs. Again, the random variable dij depends on the ensemble of directed graphs from i to j. A choice of Weibull distributed lengths with scale parameter equal to the inverse significance seems particularly natural [1, 21, 15]: The closest out connection from a node corresponds to the minimum length of an out edge. When edge lengths are Weibull, the minimum is also Weibull distributed with the same shape parameter and a scale parameter equal to the inverted β-norm of the edge significances.\nTo define a kernel κij , we similarly consider the order on nodes j by increasing shortest-path distance dij from i. As we did with reach diffusion, we defineNij as the position of j in this order, and accordingly define κij as inversely related to Nij . When j is not reachable from i we define κij = 0.\n1.3.3 Scalable computation Our learned labels fi are the expectation, over simulations of\nthe model, of the density estimates (2). Exact computation of the learned labels fi is not feasible in the probabilistic model. We therefore use Monte Carlo simulations and average the learned labels we obtain from each simulation. A small number of simulations suffices to obtain a small error on the entries of fi.\nThe main algorithmic challenge is obtaining a scalable approximation of each simulation. Even per simulation, exact computation is prohibitive: The computation of Nij for all seed nodes j and unlabeled nodes i uses nu graph searches, which is O(|E|nu) operations and quadratic even for sparse graphs. We design highly scalable algorithm which approximates the entries of fi to within additive errors of with good concentration. Note that dominant entries would be approximated well.\nOur scalable approximation relies on a sketching technique of reachability sets and of neighborhoods of directed graphs [12, 13]. We will use these sketches, computed with respect to different base sets of nodes, for two different purposes. The first is to obtain estimates with small relative error on Nij from the survival threshold tij with reach diffusion and from the shortest-path distance dij with distance diffusion. These estimates replace the expensive exact computation of kernel entries κij . The second is to obtain, for each node i, a small tailored weighted sample of seed nodes according to the kernel entries κij . Since the sample is weighted, we can use only the sampled entries with inverse probability weights\nto approximate the density estimates and yet obtain a good approximation of the full sums.\nThe distance-sketching technique can be applied almost out of the box for distance diffusion. For reach diffusion, however, we need to sketch survival times and not distances. For the first part, we need to obtain sketches that will allow us to estimate the set sizes Rτ (i) for all i and τ . For the second part, we need to obtain a weighted sample with respect to the reach diffusion kernel.\nTo do so, we design a threshold sketching algorithm which builds on the basic distance-sketching design [12, 13] but replaces the shortest-path searches by “survival threshold” graph searches as a basic component. In a nutshell, the summation operation used for shortest paths length can be replaced (carefully) with a min operation for tracking survival thresholds instead of distances. We show that total computation of these threshold searches is near-linear and establish its correctness.\n1.3.4 Parameter setting The last component of our framework is a methodology for pa-\nrameter setting. There are multiple hyper parameters in our models including the significance weights and the lifetime or length random variables we associate with the graph components. Our sketches support leave-one-out cross validation on the seed nodes with the same cost of computing the sketches. Therefore the seed set itself can be used to set the hyper parameters."

We can also associate weights wv with a node v that reflect the inverse cost of connecting through the entity.

      "text" : "We build a probabilistic model from this input by associating lifetime random variables with edges and nodes. A natural choice is to use for each component x, a Weibull or an exponentially distributed random variables tx ∼ Exp[1/wx] with parameter equal to its weight wx. Some components that are “fixed” have tx = +∞. Note that the expected lifetime is E[tx] = wx, so stronger interactions have longer lifetimes. In each Monte Carlo simulation of the model we obtain a set of lifetimes tx for the components of the graph (edges and nodes).\nFor a threshold parameter τ , the set of active components are the edges and nodes {x ∈ E ∪ V | tx ≥ τ}. For a pair of nodes (i, j), we define the survival time tij of the connection from i to j tij as the maximum τ such that j is reachable from i using components\nwith tx ≥ τ . To simplify notation, we overloaded t: When the subscript as the edge we refer to the lifetime. When the subscript is a pair we refer to the survival time. For an edge e = (i, j) we have tij ≥ µe.\nWe use the notation\nRτ (i) = {j | tij ≥ τ}\nfor the set of nodes reachable from i via active components. Note that the Rτ (i) is a random variables. Note that for a fixed simulation, the set of active components and the reachability sets Rτ (i) are non increasing with τ .\nThe survival thresholds tij induce an order over nodes j. Intuitively, more related nodes to i, those with higher tij , would be earlier in this order. We capture this order with the random variable\nNij = |Rtij (i)| = |{h | tih ≥ tij}| .\nFinally, we accordingly define the reach diffusion kernel\nκij = α(Nij) ,\nwhere α ≥ 0 is non-increasing. A natural default choice is α(x) = 1/x, where the affinity of j to i is inversely proportional to the number of nodes that precede it in the influence order. When j is not reachable from i, we define κij = 0.\nIn the simplest scheme, the lifetimes tx of different components can be independent. Semantically, this achieves the effect of rewarding multiple edge-disjoint paths, even when they traverse the same nodes. (Nodes are not considered failure points). In general, however, we can also capture correlations between edges by correlating accordingly the lifetime random variables. For example, we can consider all edges with the same head entity as related and share the same lifetime t, or correlated lifetimes.\nA natural extension is to associate massmi ≥ 0 with nodes, that is interpreted as proportional to the importance of the example. For the case when entities correspond to consumers and goods and we are only interested in labeling goods, this flexibility allows us to assign positive mass only to “goods” nodes and mi = 0 to “consumer” nodes. The relevance of an example j to another i is then proportional to its mass, but inversely depends on the mass that is reached before j. To model this, we refine the definition to be\nNij = ∑\nh|tih≥tij\nmh\nas the mass that is reached at the survival threshold of the connection (i, j). Our derivations and algorithms can be adapted to incorporate mass but for simplicity of presentation, we focus on the basic setting where mi ∈ {0, 1}."

We can now consider shortest-paths distances dij with respect to the lengths `. The length of a path is defined as the sum of the lengths of path edges and the lengths of middle nodes of the path. The distance dij is the length of the shortest path. For convenience here, we overload the notation we used for reach diffusion: For τ ≥ 0 and node i, we denote by Rτ (i) = {j | dij ≤ τ} the set of nodes j within distance at most τ from i. For nodes i, j, we denote by Nij the number (or mass) of nodes h with dih ≤ dij .

We present our approach for computing the labels approximately, using Monte Carlo simulations and a novel use of sample-based sketches [12, 13] to approximate the results of each simulation.

(5)\nBefore we address the computation of f ′i , however, we consider the loss in quality due to the use of simulations versus the exact expectation (4). That is, the statistical guarantees we obtain for the average of T independent (exact) random variables f ′i as an estimate of fi.\nLEMMA 3.1. With T = −2, the average estimate of each component of fi has absolute error bound that is well concentrated around (probability of absolute error that exceeds c is at most 2 exp(−2c2)).\nPROOF. This is an immediate consequence of Hoeffding’s inequality, noting that entries of our label vectors are in [0, 1].\nWe next consider computing (5) for a single simulation. An exact computation requires the values of the positions Nij for all i > n` and j ≤ n`. With distances, it is widely believed that there is no subquadratic algorithm and even the representation alone is quadratic. With reach diffusion, on undirected (symmetric) graphs, all pairs tij can be represented efficiently using a single minimum weight spanning tree (MST) computation on a graph with edge weights 1/µe. The computation is near-linear in the number of edges. The graph cuts defined by the MST compactly specify tij for all pairs. Our interest here, however, is directed graphs, where the problem does not seem much easier than shortest paths computations: The computation of tij and Nij for one source node i and all j can be performed by a graph search from i, but it is seems that separate searches are needed for different source nodes, similarly to the corresponding problem with distances. Moreover, while n` searches suffices to compute tij , we seem to need nu n` searches to also compute Nij .\nWe approach this (for both reach and distance diffusions) by using instead estimates f̂ ′i of f ′ i , which can be scalably computed for all i > n`. We then estimate fi by averaging the T estimates f̂ ′i .\nOur estimates f̂ ′i are obtained by computing two sets of sketches for all nodes i:\n• The first set of sketches is with respect to the full set of nodes, or more precisely, all nodes h with mh > 0. These sketches are used to estimate the mass m(Rτ (i)) for all i and for all τ .\n• The second set of sketches is with respect to seed nodes. They provide us, for each node i, a small tailored weighted sample of seed nodes S(i) ⊂ [n`]. The sampling is such that the inclusion probability of j is proportional to m(j) and inversely proportional to its position in the seed set when ordered by tij (dij for distances). For each j ∈ S(i), the sketch also provides us with the exact value of tij (dij for distances) and a conditional inclusion probability pij .\nUsing these sketches, we compute our per-simulation label estimate f̂ ′i as follows. For each i and j ∈ S(i), we have tij (dij for distances), and use the first set of sketches to compute the estimates\nN̂ij ≡ m̂(Rtij (i)) .\nFor each i, we use the sample S(i) obtained in the second set of sketches to compute\nf̂ ′i =\n∑ j∈S(i)\n1 pij mj κ̂ijyj∑\nj∈S(i) 1 pij mj κ̂ij\n, (6)\nwhere κ̂ij = α(N̂ij)."

Reach diffusion sketches are defined for survival times tij , which are stronger for higher values, whereas with distances we use dij , which are stronger for lower values. To reduce redundancy, we will focus the presentation on reach diffusion. To obtain the corresponding algorithms and sketches for distances, we need to reverse the inequality signs.\nFor each entry j in the sketch S(i), we also compute the conditional inclusion probabilities pij of j ∈ S(i).

Otherwise, it will be included only if it has one of the lowest k permutation positions among the nodes U , which means that it has a strictly lower permutation position than the kth position in Aij .\nNote that the set Aij is usually contained in S(i), except for sometimes, when there are multiple elements h with same tih. In this case it is possible for pij to be defined by an element not in S(i). We refer to such elements that are not included in S(i) but are used to compute inclusion probabilities for other nodes as Z(i) nodes.\nWe now explain how the sketches are used for the two tasks. For a node i, the sketch S(i) can be viewed as a list of tuples of the form (j, tij , p(tij)). When U is the seed of seed nodes. The second set of sketches is computed with U being the set of seed nodes. In this case, the tuples S(i) are the sample we use to compute the approximate density estimates. The first set of sketches is computed with U being the set of all nodes with mi = 1. We use this sketch to obtain neighborhood estimation lists which we use to obtain the estimates m̂(Rτ (i)). The neighborhood estimation list includes, for each represented t value, the entry\n(t, ∑\nh∈S(i)|tih≤t\n1\nptih ) ,\nin sorted decreasing t order. This list can be computed by a linear pass over tuples (j, t, p) in decreasing t order. To query the list with value τ we look for the last tuple in the list that has t ≥ τ and return the associated estimate."

For a sketch parameter k:\n• The expected size of the samples is bounded by\nE[|S(i) ∪ Z(i)|] ≤ k lnn`\nand the sizes are well concentrated.\n• If κ̂ij are nonincreasing in tij , then each component of the vector f (κ̂)i is estimated by (6) with mean square error (MSE) at most 1/k and good concentration.\nFor the second source of error we obtain:\nLEMMA 3.2.

Our estimates κ̂ij have a small relative error with good concentration, but for α(κij) to have this property we need it not to decay faster than polynomially.

      "text" : "We now consider the computation of the bottom-k all-distances sketches. These sketches were originally developed to be used with shortest-paths distances dij and there are several algorithms and large scale implementations that can be used out of the box. They compute the sketches or the more restricted application of neighborhood size estimates [12, 42, 8, 9, 13]. The different algorithms are designed for distributed node-centric, multi-core, and other settings. Most of these approaches can be easily adapted to estimate m(Rτ (i)), when mi ∈ {0, 1} (see discussion in [13]) and there is a variation [13] that is suitable for general m. The component of obtaining the sample and probabilities is more subtle, but uses the same computation (See [13, 14]).\nFor reach diffusion, we do not work with distances but with the survival thresholds tij . As said, the sketches have the same definitions and form but we need to redesign the algorithms to compute the sketches with respect to thresholds.\nThe sketching algorithm we present here for survival thresholds builds on a sequential algorithm for ADS computation which is based on performing pruned Dijkstra searches [12, 13]. The algorithm for distance sketching performs O(|E|k ln |U |) edge traversals and the total computation bound is\nO(n logn+ (|E|+ n log k) ln |U |) ,\nwhere n is the total number of nodes. The algorithm has a parallel version designed to run on multi-core architectures [9].\nOur redesigned sketching algorithm for survival thresholds has the same bounds. Moreover, our redesign can be parallelized in the same way for multi-core architectures, but we do not provide the details here.\nA high level pseudocode of our sketching algorithm for survival thresholds is provided as Algorithm 1. We first initialize empty sketch structures S(i) for all nodes i. The algorithm builds the node sketches by processing nodes j in increasing permutation rank πj . A pruned graph search is then performed from the node j. This search has the property that it visits all nodes i where j ∈ S(i) ∪ Z(i). The search updates the sketch for such nodes i and proceeds through them. The search is pruned when j 6∈ S(i) ∪ Z(i).\nWe now provide more details. The first component of this algorithm is building the sketches S(i). The pseudocode provided as Algorithm 2 builds on a state of the art design for computing universal monotone multi-objective samples [14]. The pseudocode includes the initialization, updates, and finalizing components of building the sketch for a single node i. The structure is initially empty and then tracks the set of pairs (j, tij) for the nodes j processed so far that are members of the sketch S(i). To build the sketch efficiently, the structure includes a min heap H of size k which contains the k largest tij values for processed j ∈ S(i). The structure is presented with updates of the form (j, tij), which are in increasing πj order. A node j is inserted to S(i) when tij is one of the k largest tih values of nodes h already selected for the sketch. This is determined using the minimum priority in the heap H . If the node is inserted, the heap is updated by popping its min element and inserting tij . The update can also result in modifying the sketch in some cases when the node j is not included in S(i), but is in Z(i), meaning that some inclusion probability of other node(s) is set to p(tij). To facilitate the computation of inclusion probabilities, we define\nuj = πj − 1 |U | . (11)\nThis is the probability for node with πh < πj to have permutation rank smaller than πj , when fixing the permutation order of all nodes except for j and computing the probability conditioned on that. We say that the update procedure for (j, tij) modified the sketch if and only if j ∈ S(i) ∪ Z(i).\nThe sketch of i is computed correctly when the updates include all nodes j for which the sketch was modified: The computation of the sketch will not change if we do not process entries j that do not result in modifying the sketch.\nWe now describe the next component of the algorithm which is the pruned graph search from a node j. The searches are performed on the transposed graph, which has all edges reversed. Similar to the corresponding property of Dijkstra and distances, the search visits nodes i in order of non-increasing tji. The search is pruned at nodes where there were no updates to the sketch. A pseudocode for the pruned search is provided as Algorithm 3. The algorithm maintains a max heap that contains nodes i that are prioritized by lower bounds on tij . The heap maintains the property that the maximum priority i has the exact tij . The heap is initialized with the\nAlgorithm 2 Maintain sketch S(i), updates by increasing π // Initialize: S(i)←⊥; p←⊥ H ←⊥ ; // min heap of size k, holding k largest (tij ,−πij) values processed so far (lex order) prevt←⊥ ; // tij of most recent j popped from H // Process updates: for Update (j, tij , πj), given by increasing πj order do\nif |H| < k then S(i)← S(i) ∪ {j}; Insert j to H; Continue\ny ← arg minz∈H(tiz , πz) ; // node with max (tiy , πy) if tij > tiy then\nS(i)← S(i) ∪ {j} ; // Add j to sample prevt← tiy if p(prevt) =⊥ then\np(prevt)← uj ; // As defined in Eq. (11) Delete y from H Insert j to H\nelse// Z node check if tij = tiy and tiy > prevt then\np(tij)← uj prevt← tiy\n// Finalize: for x ∈ H do // keys with largest weights\nif p(tix) =⊥ then p(tix)← 1\nnode j and priority +∞. The algorithm then repeats the following until the heap is empty. It removes the maximum priority i from the heap. It then updates the sketch of i with (j, tij). If the sketch was updated, all out edges e = (i, h) are processed as follows. If h is not on the heap, it is placed there with priority min{tij , te}. If h is in the heap, its priority is increased to the maximum of its current priority and min{tij , te}. If the sketch of i was not updated, the search is pruned at i and out edges are not processed. For correctness, note that min{tij , te} is trivially a lower bound on tih.\nWe now need to establish that the sketches are still constructed correctly with the pruning:\nLEMMA 4.1. The search from j reaches and processes all nodes i for such that j ∈ S(i) ∪ Z(i). When the node i is processed, the update (j, tij) is with the correct survival threshold tij .\nPROOF. We show the claim by induction on permutation order. Suppose the sketches are correctly populated until just before j. Consider now a search from j and a node i such that j ∈ S(i). There must exist a path P from i to j such that for any suffix P ′ of the path from some h to j, mine∈P ′ µe = thj .\nWe will show that the reverse search from j can not be pruned in any of the nodes in P . Therefore, i must be inserted into the search heap and subsequently be processed. Assume to the contrary that the search is pruned at h ∈ P . For the pruning to occur, there must be a set of nodes Y ⊂ S(h) of size |Y | ≥ k such that πy < πj and tyj ≥ thj . Let P ′′ = P \\ P ′ be the prefix of the path P from i to h and let T ′′ = mine∈P ′′ µe. Then by definition, for all y ∈ Y ,\ntiy ≥ min{T ′′, tyj} ≥ min{T ′′, thj} = tij .\nSince there are at least |Y | ≥ k nodes with πy < πj and tiy ≥ tij , this implies that j 6∈ S(i), and we obtain a contradiction. A similar argument applies when j ∈ Z(i).\nLastly, we need to argue that when node i is removed from the heap and processed, its priority is equal to tij . It is easy to verify that the heap maintains the property that the priorities are lower\nbounds on survival thresholds. This is because for any heap priority, there must be path to j with minimum µe equal to that priority.\nWe need to show that equality holds when i is processed. The nodes h ∈ P on the path are in non-increasing order of tih. Let 0 = τ1 > τ2 > · · · be the different survival threshold values on the path. We prove this by induction on τi. are processed not necessarily in path order, but in non-increasing order of tih. Initially the heap contains only (j,∞), which is the correct threshold. Assume now it holds for all nodes with survival thresholds ≥ τi. Consider now the path edge e from a node h with thj = τi to a node h′ with th′j = τi+1. This edge must have lifetime µe = τi+1. When the node h is processed, h′ is placed on the heap with priority min{τi, µe} = τi+1, which is equal to th′j . If it was already on the heap, its priority is increased to th′j . Consider now other path nodes h′′ with th′′j = τi+1. This nodes must be placed on the heap with the correct threshold when the previous path node is processed (it is possible for them to be placed with the correct priority also before that). Therefore, all path nodes with thj = τi+1 will be processed with the correct priority.\nAlgorithm 3 Pruned single-source survival threshold search Input: Source node j // Initialization: H ←⊥ ; // Empty max heap of nodes i. Priority is a lower bound on tij Put (j,+∞) in H ; // j with priority tjj = +∞ // Main loop: while Heap H not empty do\nPop maximum priority (i, tij) from H Update the sketch S(i) with (j, tij) ; // Algorithm 2 if update modified sketch then\nforeach out edge e = (i, h) do if h 6∈ H then\nInsert (h,max{µe, tij}) to H else\nUpdate priority of h in H to the maximum of current priority and min{µe, tij}\nWe can now bound the computation performed by the algorithm.\nLEMMA 4.2. The sketching algorithm performs in expectation at most |E|k ln |U | edge traversals. The total computation is\nO(n logn+ (|E|+ n log k)k ln |U |)\nwhere n is the total number of nodes.\nPROOF. The number of times a node is processed by a pruned search (meaning that its out edges are processed) is equal to the number of times its sketch is modified, which is the size of the sketch. From the analysis of distance sketches, we have a bound on the number of visits. We obtain a bound of |E|k ln |U | on the number of edge traversals performed by the algorithm. The other summand is due to heap operations when updating the sketches and in the pruned searches."

Each movie is a member of one or more of the 18 genres: Action, Adventure, Animation, Children’s, Comedy, Crime, Documentary, Drama, Fantasy, Film-Noir, Horror, Musical, Mystery, Romance, Sci-Fi, Thriller, War, Western\nAbout 3.7K movies had both listed genres and ratings. This is our set M of examples. We represented the “true” label ym of a movie m with c listed genres as an L = 18 dimensional vector with weight 1/c on each listed genre and weight 0 otherwise. Note that the provided labels and also our learned labels have the form of probability vectors over genres. We use the notation Γ(m) for the set of users that rated movie m and by Γ(u) the set of movies rated by u.\nWe build a graph with a node for each movie and each user. For each user u and movie m ∈ Γ(u), we place two directed edges, (m,u) and (u,m) (We do not use the numeric ratings provided in the data set, and only consider presence or a rating).\nWe next specify our choices of length or lifetime random variables we associate with nodes and edges. In this preliminary evaluation, we used a small limited set of length/lifetime schemes, without attempting to optimize a choice of such a scheme.\nDistance diffusion lengths. Our randomized length schemes are specified by non-increasing functions g1, g2 ≥ 0 and an offset value δ ≥ 0. We associate with each user to movie edge e = (u,m) an independent exponential random variable `e ∼ Exp[g1(|Γ(u)|)]. Each movie to user edge e = (m,u) has length `e = 0. Finally, with each movie m, we associate a pass-through length that is `m ∼ δ + Exp[g2(|Γ(m)|)].\nThe functions gi allows us to tune the amount in which paths through higher degree nodes are discounted. With g(x) = 1/x, we have the property that the shortest out edge from a node v has\nlength distribution Exp[1] regardless of |Γ(v)|. Functions with a slower decrease give more significance to higher degree nodes.\nThese length variables have a compelling interpretation when we consider, for a particular m ∈ M , the order of 2-hop movies by increasing distance from m. This order is equivalent to the order of weighted sampling without replacement of movies according to the similarity of their users, when similarity is defined as:\nsim(m,m′) = ∑\nu∈Γ(m)∩Γ(m′)\ng1(|Γ(u)|) .\nWith g(x) = 1/ log(x) we obtain the Adamic-Adar similarity [2] popular in social network analysis. Note that our model captures these pairwise movie-movie relations while working with the original user-movie interactions, without explicit computation or approximation of these similarities.\nNote that our use of pass-through lengths with movie nodes and 0 lengths for (m,u) edges is equivalent to using pass-through lengths of 0 and using for all e = (m,u) edges identical lengths `m. We briefly explain the semantics of randomized edge versus node lengths. When edge lengths are independent, we reward multiple edge-disjoint paths even when they traverse the same node. When we randomize only node pass-throughs, we reward multiple paths only when they are node-disjoint.\nThe purpose of the offset parameter δ is to control the “cost” of additional hops: With a very high offset, a movie m′ with a 4 hop path to m would always be farther than a movie m′′ 2 hop away. With low offset, when the path ensemble from m to m′′ contains many independent paths through low degree nodes, and the ensemble from m to m′ is sparse and involves one or few very high degree users, then m′′ would likely to be closer than m′.\nThe specific lengths schemes we evaluated are listed in Table 1: (i) Randomized schemes with g1 ≡ g2 ≡ g and different offsets. (ii) A randomized scheme that sets the lengths of (m,u) edges independently as Exp[g(|Γ(m)|)]+δ instead of using the same passthrough length for m. (iii) Fixed lengths schemes where the length of an edge (v, w) is a fixed non-decreasing function of |Γ(v)|.\nReach diffusion lifetimes. We associate with each user to movie edge e = (u,m) an independent exponential random variables µe ∼ Exp[g1(|Γ(u)|)]. For each movie m, we set all out edges e = (m,u) to a fixed +∞ lifetime. We also use lifetime random variables for “passing through” a movie node that are µmm ∼ Exp[g2(|Γ(m)|)]. We used g1(x) = g2(x) ≡ g as listed in Table 1. Note that with reach diffusion we use non-decreasing g.\nSeed sets. Our seed sets S are subsets of M selected uniformly at random. We use seed sets of sizes\ns ∈ {20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000}\nwhich roughly correspond to 0.5% to 50% of all movies in M . We selected 5 random permutations of the examples M and sets of seeds that correspond to prefixes of the same permutation.\nQuality evaluation. We perform Monte Carlo simulations of the model. In each simulation, a fresh set of edge lengths is drawn and fresh sketches are computed with respect to the new lengths. In each simulation we obtain a set of labels, one for each movie in m ∈ M . Our final learned labels fm are the average of the output of the different simulations. Our approximation quality improves on average with a larger sketch parameter (which controls the quality of the estimates obtained from the sketches) and the number of simulations. In our experiments we used i = {1, 2, 5, 10, 20} simulations and a sketch parameter of k = 16. With this smaller value of k we can only obtain very course estimates of the neighborhood sizes, but the computation is more efficient.\nNote that we also compute learned labels for seed movies, based only on the labels of other seed movies. As explained in Section 5, the sketches allow us to perform this computation very efficiently.\nWe measure the quality of our learned labels fm with respect to the true labels ym using the 2-norm of the difference\n||fm − ym||2 = √∑ i∈[L] (fmi − ymi)2 .\nWe compare the error of fi to that of a simple prior: The average label of the seed set\ny(S) ≡ 1|S| ∑ i∈S yi (12)\nand define success to be the event where the learned label is better than the average seed label:\n||fm − ym||2 < ||y(S)− ym||2 . (13)\nTo obtain precision recall (PR) tradeoffs, we consider the margin, which we define as the 2-norm of the difference between the learned label and the average label ∆i = ||y(S) − fi||2. We then sweep a threshold value τ . The recall for τ is the fraction of examples (movies) i for which ∆i ≥ τ . The precision is the fraction of these examples with success.\n6.1.1 Movielens1M results Results were fairly consistent for the different seed sets selec-\ntions, with more variance as expected for the small seed sets. We discuss the trends and show some representative results.\nComparing schemes. Figure 1 illustrated the PR plots for different edge lengths schemes for 10 iterations (Monte Carlo simulations).\nThe schemes with fixed edge lengths (see bottom right plot for seed set of size 200) gave no or very weak signal for small seed sets s = 20, 50 but “catch up” with the randomized schemes for larger seed sets. The worst performer by far throughout was fixed edge lengths of g(x) = 1. All schemes with increasing g(x) performed better on large seed sets with g(x) = √ x being the best performer. This shows that discounting the value of paths by the degree of the nodes they traverse is critical.\nThe first 5 plots show some of the randomized schemes in Table 1 and the fixed lengths scheme with g(x) = √ x, for seed\nset sizes between 20 and 500. Note that the randomized scheme provide a meaningful signal even for very small seed sets. The better performers were the randomized schemes with g(x) = 1/x and mid range δ. The remaining schemes in the table, the randomized scheme with g(x) = 1/ log2(1 + x) and for randomized scheme with independent `mu lengths were outperformed by the other schemes and are not shown.\nOur results for reach diffusion showed the same patterns as distance diffusion, but where somewhat weaker.\nThe relative improvement of the fixed length schemes for larger seed sets can be explained by these schemes (which are not able to capture as well the full path ensembles) providing accurate “short range” affinities, which is enough when many of the examples closest to them are in the seed set. These schemes are very inaccurate on the “long range” affinities, which are critical for sparse seed sets and are better captured by randomized schemes.\nNumber of simulations. We study quality as a function of the number of simulations. From the theory, we expect quality to increase for two reasons. First, with randomized edge lengths, the average over more simulation provides a closer estimate of the true expectation (4). Second, and this applies also for fixed-length schemes, more simulations mitigate the error of using sketch-based approximation and not the exact density estimate (5).\nSome representative plots of quality as a function of the number of simulations are presented in Figure 2. We observe that the improvement in quality with the number of simulations was significant for the randomized schemes, and in particular with the smaller seed sets. There was little or no improvement for the fixed lengths schemes.\nThe more significant improvement for the randomized schemes on smaller seed sets might be explained by the randomized model being able to better capture the deeper path ensembles between nodes and seeds.\nThe stronger improvement with the number of simulations for randomized versus deterministic schemes suggests that the main source of improvement is obtaining a better approximation of the true expectation. Therefore, it is more beneficial to increase the number of simulations than to increasing the sketch parameter k.\nSize of the seed set. Note that our measure of quality is relative to the average seed label. Therefore, the quality of this prior also improves for larger seed sets. We do observe, however, a consistent increase in quality for larger seed sets across schemes even with respect to this improving prior. Some representative results are provided in Figure 4 for the randomized scheme with g(x) = 1/x and δ = 50 and for the fixed-length scheme with g(x) = 1/ √ x."

The blogs are labeled as liberal or conservative, with half the blogs in each category. About 62% of the blogs form a single strongly connected component, 21% can reach the component via links, and 16% can only be reached from the component.\nThe label dimension here is L = 2, as the provided label yi of a blog i is (1, 0) for liberal and (0, 1) for conservative. We used 10 sets of experiments. In each set, we select a different uniform random permutation of the blogs. We then take seed sets S of size s ∈ [10, 1000] as prefixes of the same permutation. Note that our seed set sizes range from less than 0.1% to about 83% of all blogs. We then apply our algorithms to compute learned labels fj for all nodes j.\nTo make a prediction, we consider the average label of the seed set y(S) (defined in (12)) and the learned label fj . The prediction is then liberal if fj1 > y(S)1 and conservative if fj1 < y(S)1. If the prediction is equal to the true label, we count it as a success. We define the margin of our prediction as the 2-norm ||y(S)− yj ||2 of the difference between the average seed label and the learned label. When the margin is 0, which happens when our model provides no information (no reachable seed nodes), we take the success to be 0.5. We consider the precision (fraction of successful predictions) and recall (number of predictions as fraction of total), as a function of the margin.\nNote that hyperlinks are directed, and the direction has a concrete semantics. In our experiments, we separately worked with three sets of edges: forward (an edges with the same direction is generated for each hyperlink), reversed (a reversed edge is generated for each hyperlink), and undirected (two directed edges are generated for each hyperlink). We then consider distance and reach diffusion on these directed graphs. As we did with the Movielens1M dataset, we used a limited selection of fixed-length and randomized length (distance diffusion) and lifetime (reach diffusion) schemes, as outlined in Table 2. The function |Γ(u)| is the outdegree of u, which is the number of hyperlinks to other blogs with forward, the number of hyperlinks to the blog with reversed, and the sum with undirected. We used a sketch parameter k = 32 and up to 40 Monte Carlo simulations.\nOn this data set, randomization of lengths did not provide an advantage. The fixed length schemes performed very well, with g(x) = x and g(x) = log2(1 + x) being more consistent and slightly better than g(x) = 1. For these schemes, there was no observable improvement with the number of simulations. The prediction success was typically over 90% even with the smallest seed sets (s = 10). This is explained by the two sets of blogs forming two distinct clusters, detectable by most clustering algorithms.\nThe best randomized distance scheme was g(x) = 1/x and δ = 5. The best randomized reach scheme was g(x) = x. Overall, the reach diffusion schemes gave much weaker predictions than the distance diffusion schemes and both were outperformed by the fixed-length schemes.\nThe randomized distance and reach diffusion schemes did show drastic improvement with the number of simulations (see Figure 6 (right)). All schemes were more accurate with larger seed sets (see Figure 6 (left and middle)). Performace did strongly depend on direction (see Figure 5 for representative results): Reversed was clearly inferior to forward. Undirected and forward were comparable and consistently best, with the former providing a higher recall. We also evaluated combined predictions (combo), which go with the prediction with the largest margin among forward and reversed. Prediction quality of combo was more consistent than reversed but was dominated by undirected and forward."

      "text" : "We proposed a new approach for graph-based semi-supervised learning through reach diffusion and distance diffusion kernels. Our models are inspired by well studied models of influence diffusion and address applications with asymmetric relations that require a highly scalable computation of the learned labels. We designed scalable algorithms and established correctness of the computation and of the statistical guarantees provided by our approximations. We conducted a promising preliminary experimental evaluation."

    "abstractText" : "Semi-supervised learning algorithms are an indispensable tool when labeled examples are scarce and there are many unlabeled examples [Blum and Chawla 2001, Zhu et. al. 2003]. With graph-based methods, entities (examples) correspond to nodes in a graph and edges correspond to related entities. The graph structure is used to infer implicit pairwise affinity values (kernel) which are used to compute the learned labels. Two powerful techniques to define such a kernel are “symmetric” spectral methods and Personalized Page Rank (PPR). With spectral methods, labels can be scalably learned using Jacobi iterations, but an inherent limiting issue is that they are applicable to symmetric (undirected) graphs, whereas often, such as with like, follow, or hyperlinks, relations between entities are inherently asymmetric. PPR naturally works with directed graphs but even with state of the art techniques does not scale when we want to learn billions of labels. Aiming at both high scalability and handling of directed relations, we propose here Reach Diffusion and Distance Diffusion kernels. Our design is inspired by models for influence diffusion in social networks, formalized and spawned from the seminal work of [Kempe, Kleinberg, and Tardos 2003]. These models apply with directed interactions and are naturally suited for asymmetry. We tailor these models to define a natural asymmetric “kernel” and design highly scalable algorithms for parameter setting and label learning.",
