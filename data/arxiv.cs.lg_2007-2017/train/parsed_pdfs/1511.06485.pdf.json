      "text" : "Deep learning has enjoyed enormous success in recent years in applications like image recognition (Krizhevsky et al., 2012), speech recognition (Hinton et al., 2012a), natural language processing (Bengio et al., 2003) and reinforcement learning (Mnih et al., 2015). The fact that similar architectures and concepts are sweepingly applicable to such vastly different problems is both surprising and profound. Consequently, a number of recent papers have focused on different aspects of this problem such as hierarchical structure (Patel et al., 2015; Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009; Damianou and Lawrence, 2012), robustness of representations (Chatfield et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2014), large scale optimization on distributed platforms (Seide et al., 2014; Dean et al., 2012; Vasilache et al., 2014) etc. This paper is in the spirit of results that analyze algorithms for training deep networks using knowledge of the landscape of the cost function, e.g., Dauphin et al. (2014); Haeffele and Vidal (2015); Janzamin et al. (2015); Choromanska et al. (2014).\nWe derive motivation from the theory of spin glasses which are some of the oldest models for neural networks (Hopfield, 1982). In recent years, the connections of spin glasses to combinatorial optimization, random k-SAT, LDPC codes etc. have become popular (Mezard and Montanari, 2009) and an understanding of the energy landscape and thermodynamics of such systems has led to a number of efficient algorithms (Krzakala et al., 2011; Braunstein et al., 2005). Spin glasses are particularly attractive models for large-scale problems such as deep networks because although their energy landscape is a high-dimensional, non-convex Gaussian surface, using results from probability theory and statistical physics, we can explicitly compute various quantities of interest such as the number of stationary points (Auffinger et al., 2013; Fyodorov, 2013), low temperature topology and the structure of the Gibbs distribution (Talagrand, 2003; Mezard et al., 1987).\nIn this work, we consider a model for deep networks with random, sparse weights and connect its loss function to the Hamiltonian of a spherical spin glass in order to analyze and modify its energy\n∗Computer Science, UCLA. pratikac@ucla.edu †Computer Science, UCLA. soatto@cs.ucla.edu\nar X\niv :1\n51 1.\n06 48\n5v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n0 N\nov 2\n01 5\nlandscape. Existing results drawn from statistical physics have shown that there are exponentially many local minima and saddle points of the Hamiltonian and gradient descent algorithms cannot make progress due to such a landscape. An effective way of changing this topology is to add an external perturbation. We show that there exists a critical threshold of the perturbation below which the exponentially many stationary points persist and above which the landscape becomes “trivial”, i.e., there is only one local minimum. This phase transition is however not sharp, i.e., there exists a small band around the perturbation threshold that interpolates between the two extremes resulting in polynomially many stationary points. This polynomial regime gives a good trade-off between a complex landscape with exponentially many local minima and a completely degenerate loss function due to large perturbations.\nWe interpret topology trivialization as a regularization of the original loss function of a deep network, for instance, additive noise is immediately seen as a random perturbation of the Hamiltonian. The analysis in this paper gives the right magnitude of noise to achieve polynomially many stationary points. We extend the idea to other types of regularization, e.g, weight decay, dropout, multiplicative noise and compute the appropriate magnitude of the regularization parameters in the presence of perturbations. The analysis also motivates a very natural annealing scheme for the perturbations. The magnitude of the perturbation is gradually changed to transition from the trivialized landscape in the beginning to recover the original landscape as the training progresses."

      "text" : "Our work is closely related to Choromanska et al. (2014) where the authors use spin glasses to analyze the energy landscape of deep networks. They show in their experiments that although there are exponentially many saddle points in the energy landscape, the Hessian at the optima recovered by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has very few negative eigenvalues. Choromanska et al. (2014) and Sagun et al. (2014) also show that SGD fails to progress beyond a very specific energy barrier, one that can be seen in spin glass computations as the onset of high-order saddle points and local minima. We build upon these results and demonstrate a way to use topology trivialization to modify this energy landscape so as to make it more amenable to gradient descent.\nThe random, sparse model discussed in Sec. 2.1 is motivated from recent results like Arora et al. (2014) and Neyshabur and Panigrahy (2013). Empirically, a number of works such as Denil et al. (2013); Chen et al. (2015) have reported that as much as 95% connections in a typical deep network have almost zero weights. Such considerations have also resulted in state-of-the-art architectures, for instance, the “inception network” (Szegedy et al., 2014) maintains a high-dimensional and sparse feature map at each layer and compresses it when convolutions of these feature maps become expensive. While a random, sparse network is unlikely to be a good model for convolutions, it allows us to make necessary approximations to get a good analytical handle on its properties.\nAs we train deep networks on increasingly large and complex problems, hyper-parameter search is fast becoming essential (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012; Snoek et al., 2012). Parameters such as kernel sizes, mini-batch size, data augmentation etc. are primarily driven by hardware while others such as regularization parameters, learning rates, gradient descent hyper-parameters (Sutskever et al., 2013; Bengio, 2012) are based on either experience or a grid-based search. Our analysis suggests the magnitude of regularization parameters in terms of the average number of neurons on each layer and the total number of layers."

      "text" : "Let us consider a deep networks with p hidden layers and n neurons on each layer. Denote by X ∈ {0,1}n the observed layer at the bottom which is generated by h ∈ {0,1}n at the top. More\nprecisely, X can be written as: X = g ( J(1) > g ( J(2) > . . . g ( J(p) > h ) . . . )) ; (1)\nwhere J(k) ∈ [−1,1]n×n for k ≤ p are the connectivity matrices and g are threshold non-linearities defined by g(x)= 1{x≥0}. 1A denotes the indicator function of the set A. The output of the intermediate\nlayers is thus given by h(k−1) = g ( J(k) > g ( J(k+1) > . . . g ( J(p) > h ) . . . ))\n∈ {0,1}n; for k ≤ p. Note that we have X = h(0) and h = h(p). To make this model analytically tractable, we make the following assumptions: (i) h has at most ρ non-zero entries, and (ii) for d = n1/p, every entry J(k)i j is a\nzero-mean random variable with P ( J(k)i j > 0 ) = P ( J(k)i j < 0 ) = d2n and zero otherwise. This results on an average d non-zero entries in every row and column. These assumptions make our model a random, sparse neural network and help us analyze it using techniques from probability. The first assumption implies that each data sample Xi is generated from a hidden feature vector hi which has at most a constant number of non-zeros, i.e., if we interpret every entry of hi as an indicator of some class, at most ρ classes are present in every data sample Xi. The Chernoff bound then implies that with high probability, each Xi has a constant ρ ( d 2 )p fraction non-zero entries. The above model enjoys a number of useful properties by virtue of it being random and sparsely connected (Arora et al., 2014). For instance, for low sparsity p > 5, the network acts as a denoising auto-encoder using the same weights (“weight tying”), i.e., h = g ( J(p)g ( J(p−1) . . .g′ ( J(1)X̃− d31n ) − d31n ) . . . ) where\n1n denotes a vector of 1s of length n and X̃ = X +δ for some small noise δ . Or equivalently, the feature vector h can be obtained from X by running the same network in reverse with a different thresholding function g′(x) = 1{x≥ d3}. Arora et al. (2014) also devise a community detection style algorithm to provably learn such a network. Our objective in this paper will be to use this model as an analytical tool to enable computations that connect deep networks to spin glasses. With a slightly different set of assumptions, there are other ways of achieving this, e.g., the model in Choromanska et al. (2014) assumes that paths from each Xi to the loss layer are independent, while we show that the contribution of correlations of Xi is small due to our assumption of sparsity.\nClassification model: In a typical classification scenario, one uses a support vector machine (SVM) or a soft-max layer on the feature vector h to obtain an output Y ∈ {0,1}. We model this as:\nY = g′ ( J(p+1)g′ ( J(p) . . .g′ ( J(1)X ) . . . )) ; (2)\nwhere g′(x) = 1{x≥ d3} is a thresholding function and J (p+1) ∈ [−1,1]n is a d-sparse row vector. The data sample X ∈ {0,1}n is denoted as the “input” while the output is Y ∈ {0,1}. We will henceforth consider (2) as the canonical model of a deep neural network."

      "text" : "Spin glasses are models in statistical physics used to analyze properties of magnetic alloys and show a number of fascinating properties due to presence of both ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic interactions. There is a wealth of literature from both physicists (Mezard et al., 1987; Mezard and Montanari, 2009) and mathematicians (Talagrand, 2003) that analyzes the energy landscape of spin glasses as well as their applications to optimization problems. A p-spin glass for an integer p≥ 1 with n “spins” is given by an energy function (usually called the Hamiltonian)\n−Hn,p(σ) = 1\nn(p−1)/2\nn\n∑ i1,i2,...,ip=1 Ji1,...,ipσi1 . . .σip ; (3)\nwhere σ = (σ1, . . . ,σn) is a configuration of the spins and Ji1,...,ip are iid zero-mean standard Gaussian random variables. Note that Hn,p is zero-mean and Gaussian as well. The constant n−(p−1)/2 is present to ensure that the Hamiltonian is extensive, i.e., it scales as O(n). For the purpose of analysis, we will assume a spherically constrained spin glass, i.e., n−1 ∑i σ2i = 1, or equivalently σ ∈ Sn−1( √ n)⊂ Rn.\nWe will also use a mean-field model wherein we assume that the disorder Ji1,...,ip is independent standard Gaussian random variables. We can now show that the loss function for the model for deepnets introduced in Sec. 2.1 can be written as the Hamiltonian of a p-spin glass. Please see Appendix C for the proofs. Lemma 1.

      "heading" : "3 PERTURBATIONS OF THE HAMILTONIAN",
      "text" : "In this section, we present results wherein a perturbation term is added to a general isotropic Hamiltonian and depending upon the magnitude of the perturbation, one can radically change the number of local minima of the Hamiltonian. If the magnitude of the perturbations is large, the energy landscape is dominated by the perturbation term, while if the magnitude is small, the Hamiltonian retains its original landscape. This section uses some basic terminology of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) which is reviewed in Appendix B.\nLet us define the total number of stationary points of the normalized Hamiltonian in the set (−∞,u] is given by crt(u) = ∑σ :∇H(σ)=0 1 { n−1 H(σ)≤ u }\n. The index of a stationary point is the number of negative eigenvalues of the Hessian at that point σ and we denote stationary points of index k in this interval by crtk(u). In this notation, local minima are therefore given by crt0(u). Note that crtk and crt are random variables but as Auffinger et al. (2013) shows, we can explicitly compute their limiting values. For any k ≥ 0 and p≥ 2 we have\nlim n→∞ 1 n logE crtk(u) = Θk(u), (5)\nlim n→∞ 1 n logE crt(u) = Θ(u); (6)\nwhere Θk(u) and Θ(u) are large deviation rate functions that can be computed analytically and are shown in Fig. 1 for p = 3 (also see Appendix A). The functions Θk and Θ are also known as the complexity of a spin glass — if Θk(u) < 0 in some interval u, (5) roughly shows that there are a vanishing number of critical points (with the logarithmic scaling). The following theorem is a similar computation as (5) and (6), we use it to introduce topology trivialization. With minor abuse of notation denote crt(∞) = crt(H).\nTheorem 3 (Fyodorov (2013)). Consider a Hamiltonian H(σ) where σ ∈ Sn−1(√n) and the covariance E H(σ)H(σ ′) = F(σ>σ ′) is invariant under the transformations σ 7→ Oσ , σ ′ 7→ Oσ ′ for any n×n orthogonal matrix O. The expected number of stationary points of H is given by\nE crt(H) = 4n (\n1+B 1−B\n)n/2√ 1−B G(B);\nwhere\nB = F ′′(n)−F ′(n)/n F ′′(n)+F ′(n)/n\n, G(B) = ∫ ∞\n0 e−nBt 2/2 ρn(t) dt,\nand ρn(t) is the density of the eigenvalues of GOE.\nNow consider a “perturbed” version of the p-spin glass Hamiltonian in (4) given by\n− H̃(σ) = n\n∑ i1,i2,...,ip=1\nJi1,...,ip σi1 . . .σip + n\n∑ i=1 hi σi; (7)\nwhere (as before) Ji1,...,ip is a zero-mean Gaussian random coupling with variance J2\nnp−1 but we have added an external magnetic field given by ∑i hiσi. This is a random external field, i.e., hi are iid zero-mean Gaussian random variables with variance E h2i = ν2. An application of Thm. 3 now shows that the parameter ν results in three distinct regimes for the expected number of critical points. First note that H̃(σ) satisfies the covariance structure of Thm. 3 with\nE H̃(σ) H̃(σ ′) = n f ( σ>σ ′\nn\n) , f (u) = J2 up +ν2u;\nand B can be calculated to be\nB = J2 p(p−2)−ν2 J2 p2 +ν2 ∈ ( −1, p−2 p ] . (8)\nTheorem 4 (Fyodorov (2013)). For p > 2, there exists a critical value νc = J √\np(p−2), such that if B > 0 there exist exponentially many critical points, if B =−O(n−1) there exist polynomially many critical points while if B =−Ω(n−1) the number of critical points of H̃ is exactly two. More precisely,\nlim n→∞ E crt(H̃) =  2 if ν > νc, 4n1/2 √ 1+B πB exp ( n 2 log 1+B 1−B ) if ν < νc, 2n√\nπ τ −3/2 if B =− τn , τ 1.\n(9)\nThe first phase in the above theorem demonstrates total trivialization of the energy landscape, indeed as any smooth function on the sphere Sn−1( √ n) has at least one minimum and at least one maximum, there is in fact exactly one minimum if the perturbations to the Hamiltonian are larger than the critical value J √ p(p−2). If the perturbations are smaller than this, we are back to the regime of exponentially many critical points in (6). There is also an interesting “edge-scaling” regime where if B =−O(n−1) the spin glass has polynomially many critical points. This is the regime where we would typically like to choose our regularization parameters to be, to not only avoid exponentially many critical points, but also avoid total trivialization. Finally, let us remark that the number of local minima is at most the number of critical points. Note that these cases are computed in Fyodorov (2013) using asymptotics of the eigenvalue distribution and for large n and are hence only approximate. Also, Thm. 4 only describes the behavior of the expected number of critical points, however as the authors in Subag (2015) show, for any interval of the real line u we have limn→∞ crt(u) E crt(u) = 1 in L 2 and thus the number of critical points converges to the expected number of critical points in probability.\nCorollary 5. For p 2, as n→ ∞, we need ν = O (Jp(1+2τ/n)) to be in the polynomial regime. In particular, for the deep network model considered in Sec. 2.1 where p = logd n, we require ν = O(J logd n (1+2τ/n)) to be in the polynomial regime.\nThe above corollary follows from (8) and Thm. 4 and we use it to decide the order of magnitude for different types of regularization in deep learning literature in the next section. It can be further shown that the parameter τ lets us smoothly interpolate between the two regimes, i.e., for large n, when τ −1, the number of critical points is of constant order, while when τ 1, we have exponentially many critical points (Fyodorov, 2013). Let us now consider the scaling of local minima. The following theorem shows that quite surprisingly one can simply replace the GOE eigenvalue density in Thm. 3 by the density of the largest eigenvalue to get the expected number of local minima. This translates to the following equivalent version of Thm. 4.\nTheorem 6 (Fyodorov (2013)). Given the Hamiltonian as described in Thm. 3, for large n, the expected number of local minima for ν < νc is given by\nE crt0(H) =C(n,B) exp { n (\n1 2 log 1+B 1−B −B\n)} . (10)\nIn the transitional regime around B = 0, with the scaling B =−κ2 n−1/3 and C > 0, we have\nE crt0(H) =  1 as κ → ∞, 2 at κ = 0, C exp ( κ2 24 + 4 √ 2 |κ|3/2 3 ) as κ →−∞.\n(11)\nThe parameter κ interpolates between the two extremes, exponentially many local minima as given by (10) for B > 0 and constant number of local minima as B 0. Note that since κ = 2Bn1/3 we can obtain our desired “polynomially many” local minima by setting the appropriate value of κ .\nCorollary 7. If B=O ( n−1/3 logn ) , the expected number of local minima scales as O ( exp(logn)2 ) .\nIn particular, for the spin glass Hamiltonian in (7) and B given by (8), for p 2 we require ν = O ( Jp(1+n−1/3) ) .\nNote that for the spin glass model, the number of critical points and local minima is of the same order in all regimes. Moreover, just as we replaced the eigenvalue density by the density of the largest eigenvalue λmax, we can replace it instead by the probability density of the kth largest eigenvalue of GOE to get critical points with index k−1. A short analysis then shows that there are exponentially many critical points of all indices k; note that we also saw this in (5)."

The decay term can be obtained using an additive of the form p α2√n ∑ n i=1 σ2i .

      "text" : "Drop-Out (Hinton et al., 2012b) is a form of regularization typically used for fully connected layers where each output is forwarded with a fixed probability q and set to zero otherwise. Numerous experiments have shown that dropout leads to a better generalization error for deep networks by forcing each layer to explain the layer above using as few features as possible. Drop-Connect (Wan et al., 2013) is very similar to Drop-Out except that one sets the individual weights to zero with probability 1−q. This induces sparsity in the weight matrix at each layer. We model drop-connect by introducing a Bernoulli random variable δi1 . . .δip that multiplies the disorder Ji1,...,ip to give\n− H̃drop-connect(σ) = ∑ i1,i2,...,ip δi1 . . .δip Ji1,...,ipσi1 . . .σip +∑ i hiσi (15)\nwhere as before Ji1,...,ip is zero-mean Gaussian with variance J 2n−(p−1). Such a Hamiltonian is known as a “diluted” spin glass. Since δi1 . . .δip = 0 is like setting the entire path (i1, . . . , ip) to zero, we set δi1 . . .δip ∼ Ber(qp). Similar to the proof of Lem. 1, we now replace δi1 . . .δipJi1,...,ip by a Gaussian random variable to put it into the framework of Sec. 3. If we denote c , qp, this amounts to scaling the constant J by √ c(1− c) which gives var Ji1,...,ip = n−(p−1) c(1− c)J2. For the perturbation term to result in polynomially many critical points, we now require\nν = J p √ c(1− c) (\n1+ 2τ n\n)1/2 . (16)\nQuite intuitively, since c(1− c)< 1/2, drop-connect requires that the magnitude of the perturbation term be reduced by an appropriate factor. As a minor aside, following the idea that drop-connect sets entire “paths” from the data layer to loss layer to zero we should pick the dropout probability such that qp is a constant, i.e., q = c1/p.\nTo model dropout, we multiply each spin in (7) by δi ∼ Ber(q) to get\n− H̃drop-out(σ) = ∑ i1,i2,...,ip\nJi1,...,ip p\n∏ k=1 δik σik +∑ i hiσi (17)\nFor our model, the connectivity matrices Ji1,...,ip are such that each neuron ik is connected to ik+1 in the next layer uniformly randomly.

Fig. 1) is high, which is seen by the positive skew of the density.\nIn order to visualize the energy landscape, we perform a t-SNE (Van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008) of the local minima obtained by starting gradient descent from N = 20,000 uniformly sampled points of Sn−1( √ n) for n = 100; denote this set by Σ∗. t-SNE minimizes the crossentropy between the original high-dimensional data and its projection, and thus separates clusters in the data. Also note that normalizing an isotropic Gaussian vector makes it uniform on the unit sphere and hence we can sample Sn−1( √ n) easily. Figs. 4a, 4b show the results of this simulation for the exponential and polynomial regime while Fig. 3 shows the local min-\nima in the completely trivialized landscape. The effect in the latter case is quite drastic, all executions of gradient descent converge at the same local minimum. This is seen by the fact that the radius of the data computed as stddev Σ∗ is 0.02 for Fig. 3 while it is 1.16 in Fig. 4a; note that ‖σ‖2 = 10."

      "text" : "We employed results from spin glass theory to introduce a novel topology trivialization phenomenon for interpreting regularization techniques in deep learning. While the original energy landscape is complex with exponentially many local minima and saddle points, we showed that it undergoes dramatic changes in structure upon adding small perturbations. We can compute the threshold for the magnitude of perturbations below which the landscape is qualitatively unchanged and above which it becomes trivial. There also exists a critical band for the perturbation which results in polynomially many stationary points of the Hamiltonian and thus interpolates between these regimes. Our analysis provides order estimates of the magnitude of a number of different regularization methods in the deep learning literature. We also motivate an annealing scheme for these perturbations wherein the loss function can be gradually modified from the polynomial regime to the original exponential regime during the course of training. As future work, we aim to evaluate such annealing strategies for training of convolutional neural networks."

(2013) prove, the energy landscape shows a very intricate structure. For σ ∈ Sn−1(√n), if we define the lower bound of the Hamiltonian as limn→∞ n−1 H(σ) =−E0, as one progresses from the global minimum at energy level −nE0, saddle points of increasing indices start appearing, in particular, between energy levels (−nE0,−nEk), only critical points of indices less than k exist (in the limit as n→ ∞). Most importantly, note that there are exponentially many local minima in any non-zero measure interval between (−nE0,−nE∞). This fact is crucial to construct algorithms that rely on gradient descent, for instance, stochastic gradient descent can get stuck in any one of these exponentially many local minima and indeed, as experiments in Choromanska et al. (2014); Sagun et al. (2014) show, the minima obtained by SGD are always low order critical points, i.e., they are either local minima which could be very close to the energy barrier or they are saddle points very deep in the energy landscape. Empirically, SGD cannot penetrate the energy barrier −nE∞ below which the layered structure presents itself. The main motivation of this paper is to add perturbations to the Hamiltonian to reduce the number of local minima and saddle points."

We thus have Ns(D) = ∫ D ρs(σ)dσ . The Kac-Rice formula (Adler and Taylor, 2009) then gives\nEρs(σ) = E {∣∣det(∂ 2k1,k2V)∣∣ n∏ k=1 δ (∂kH) } . (19)\nSimilarly, if one is interested only in the number of local minima, we have\nEρs(σ) = E { det ( ∂ 2k1,k2H ) θ ( ∂ 2k1,k2H ) n ∏ k=1 δ (∂kH) } .\nwhere θ ( ∂ 2k1,k2H )\nis the Heavyside step function. We consider isotropic Hamiltonians with a covariance given by\nE H(σ)H(σ ′) = F(σ>σ ′)\nfor some functions F . Note that the covariance is invariant to changes σ 7→ Oσ for any unitary, orthogonal matrix O. We also impose a spherical constraint ‖σ‖2 = √ n to match with the model in Sec. 2.1.\nUsing the Kac-Rice formula, we can completely characterize the expected number of critical points and local minima of isotropic Hamiltonians. The Hamiltonians we consider are high-dimensional zero-mean Gaussian surfaces and hence such an analysis is tied to the properties of random matrices with Gaussian entries which we describe briefly. (see e.g., Mehta (2004) for an elaborate exposition). A real symmetric matrix G ∈ Rn×n is said to belong to the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) if every entry Gi j for i≤ j is an iid zero-mean Gaussian random variable with E G2i j = 1+δi j n . The density\nof GOE matrix is proportional to exp ( − n4 tr G2 ) and is hence invariant to orthogonal conjugation. The joint eigenvalue distribution of such matrices is a well-studied object, it is usually characterized as the density ρn(t) = n−1 E ∑ni=1 δ (t−λi) for eigenvalues λi. We see in Thm. 3 that the expression for the expected number of critical points is given as a function of the eigenvalue density. On the other hand, the expected number of local minima is a function of the density of the largest eigenvalue of GOE matrices (cf. Thm. 6)."

      "text" : "Proof of Lem. 1. We can write the expression (2) in terms of the number of “active paths” to get rid of the nonlinearities g′(·), i.e., all paths with non-zero weight from an input Xi to the output Y . We then have\nY = n\n∑ i=1 ∑ γ∈Γi Xi Jγ ; (20)\nwhere Γi is the set of all active paths connecting the ith input neuron to the output Y . Let Jγ be the weight along each path γ . Now define γi,i1,...,ip to be an indicator random variable that is 1 iff the path i→ i1→ . . .→ ip→ Y , i.e., the one that connects the ith1 neuron in the first hidden layer, ith2 neuron in the second hidden layer and so on, is active. With some abuse of notation, we will use the variable γ to denote both the path and the tuple (i, i1, i2, . . . , ip). We now work towards removing the dependency of the input X in (20). First split the path into two parts, the first edge on layer 1 and the rest of the path as: γi,i1,i2,...,ip = γi,i1 γi1,...,ip (conditional upon γi,i1 = 1, the sub-paths are independent). This gives\nY = n\n∑ i,i1,i2,...,ip=1 γi,i1 γi1 . . .γip Xi Ji,i1 Ji1,...,ip .\nThis expression has correlations between different paths that are introduced by the sum over inputs Xi; we approximate these correlations to obtain an expression that resembles the Hamiltonian in (3). Define the net coupling due to the sum over the inputs as\nZi := Xi γi,i1 Ji,i1 , Z := n\n∑ i=1 Zi.\nSince Xi ∈ {0,1}, we have var(Xi)≤ 1/4 from Popoviciu’s inequality (for a bounded random variable m≤ X ≤M, the variance is bounded as var X ≤ 14 (M−m)2), and Ji,i+1 is positive or negative with equal probability d/2n while γi,i1 = 1 with probability d/n for a fixed i1. Note that EZi = 0 while EZ2i ≤ d2/(4n2). We now use Bernstein’s inequality to see that:\nP (∣∣∣∣∣ n∑i=1 Zi ∣∣∣∣∣> t ) ≤ exp ( − t 2/2 var(Z)+ t/3 ) ⇒ |Z| ≤ n− 1 2+ 1 p+ε ≤ n−1/5;\nwith high probability for any small ε > 0 (we picked ε = 1/10 above). We have thus shown that the net coupling due to inputs in our model is bounded. Now note that γi1 . . .γip is a Bernoulli random variable with\nP ( γi1,...,ip = 1 ) = dρ n ( ρ d 2 1 n ) . . . ( ρ ( d 2 )p−1 1 n ) = O(n−(p−1)/2).\nSince the entries of weight matrices J(k) are iid, the weights along each path γ ∈ Γi, i.e., Ji1,...,ip are independent and identically distributed, in particular, each Jik,ik+1 only depends upon ik. We therefore write them as a product of “spins” σi1 . . .σip ∈ [−1,1]p to get Y law = ∑ni1,i2,...,ip=1 Z γi1,i2,...,ip σi1 . . .σip . We now approximate the Bernoulli random variable γi1 . . .γip with a Gaussian of variance n 1−p and define the scaled output Ŷ = Y n1/5 to get\nŶ law= 1\nn(p−1)/2\nn\n∑ i1,i2,...,ip=1 Ji1,...,ip σi1 . . .σip . (21)\nwhere Ji1,...,ip is standard Gaussian.\nProof of Lem. 2. The zero-one loss L for Y t ∼ Ber(q) can be written as L = EY t ∣∣∣Ŷ (X t)−Y t ∣∣∣\n= q(1− Ŷ )+(1−q) Ŷ = q+(1−2q) Ŷ .\nNow define Hn,p = (q−L)/(1−2q) to see that −Hn,p has the same distribution as Ŷ ."

Existing results motivated from statistical physics show that deep networks have a highly non-convex energy landscape with exponentially many local minima and energy barriers beyond which gradient descent algorithms cannot make progress. We leverage a technique known as topology trivialization where, upon perturbation by an external magnetic field, the energy landscape of the spin glass Hamiltonian changes dramatically from exponentially many local minima to “total trivialization”, i.e., a constant number of local minima. There also exists a transitional regime with polynomially many local minima which interpolates between these extremes. We show that a number of regularization schemes in deep learning can benefit from this phenomenon. As a consequence, our analysis provides order heuristics to choose regularization parameters and motivates annealing schemes for these perturbations.",
