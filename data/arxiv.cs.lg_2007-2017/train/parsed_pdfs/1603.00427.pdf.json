INTRODUCTION\nTHE collective of nonlinear signal processing techniquescome into play whenever nonlinear effects, such as harmonic distortion, saturation and general polynomial behavior, start to become noticeable enough to degrade the performance of conventional linear techniques. A common problem with nonlinear filters is the computational complexity they demand. Some of the most complex filters are based on the Volterra and Wiener models [1]–[3]. It is common to restrict these models in order to reduce their complexity [4]–[6]. We follow this approach.\nWe start by proposing a polynomial technique that could be thought of as a subclass of the Volterra model. It is based on representing the input regressor as an iterated Kronecker product, an idea that has already been used for the estimation of higher order statistics of the regressor [7]—a related problem—and other Volterra approaches [4]–[6], but we also embed this Kronecker structure within the filter itself. This formalism allows us to promptly derive a cost function in explicit form. We also compute its gradient and use it in the derivation of a nonlinear, low-complexity, LMS-like algorithm with good mean-square performance."

One would take O(MK) operations per iteration. This can be slightly reduced should the symmetry in the kernel be explored, but this approach could at most decrease the number of operations to something proportional to ( M−K+1\nK\n) , which still increases\nrapidly. It is necessary to suppose some extra structure in the kernel itself if one wants a significant reduction in complexity.\nThe structure we propose is kernel separability. Explicitly, we suppose that there exists functions hs(is), 1 ≤ s ≤ K, such that\nh(i1, . . . , iK) = h1(i1)h2(i2) · · ·hK(iK). (2)\nWhen we use (2) in (1), we get y(i) = ∑\n0≤i1,...,iK<M\nh1(i1) · · ·hK(iK)u(i− i1) · · ·u(i− iK)\n= M−1∑ i1=0 h1(i1)u(i− i1) · · · M−1∑ iK=0 hK(iK)u(i− iK). (3)\nEach factor yos(i) , ∑M\nis=0 hs(ij)u(i − is) could be seen\nas the output of a linear FIR filter. As such, we can represent them in vector form. We collect the input signals in a 1×M row vector1 ui = [u(i)u(i− 1) · · ·u(i−M +1)] and a set of K vectors of size M × 1 represented by {w1, . . . , wK}. We also say that, for each s, we have\nws = [hs(0)hs(1) · · ·hs(M − 1)]T . (4)\nNow, we have yos(i) = uiws for every s, so that\ny(i) = (uiw1)(uiw2) · · · (uiwK). (5)\nThis can be represented by Fig. 1. Granted, this implies a loss of generality from the original Volterra model. Not every kernel is separable. But this simplification allows us to compute the output of the system in O(KM) operations per iteration—a exponential reduction in complexity. Moreover, this separable kernel allows a convenient formalism for the derivation of the cost function that also gives us algebraic insight on the model.\n1This notation is due to [8].

As such, to better manipulate and have access to their elements, one can even index them as\n(ui ⊗ · · · ⊗ ui)j1,...,jK = u(i− j1 + 1) · · ·u(i− jK + 1) (7)\nand\n(w1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ wK)i1,...,iK = h1(i1) · · ·hK(iK).

One could think of substituting w1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ wK for a general tensor and produce much more diverse nonlinearities. However, such procedure would lead back to the full Volterra model. This fact sheds algebraical reasoning on what can be represented by the a product of FIR systems.\nAdditionally, one can think of the “w” tensor as a K-linear form [11]—or functional—acting on K copies of the vector ui. In this case, they are rank one multilinear functionals, also called simple multilinear functionals, from which we take the name of our model: the simple multilinear model (SML)."

      "heading" : "III. THE MEAN SQUARE ERROR OVER THE SML",
      "text" : "As it is usual in most adaptive schemes, we pose a problem related to optimization—in particular, the minimization of a certain metric, the most common being the mean-square error.\nGiven a desired random signal d, a random 1×M vector u and a set of M × 1 column vectors {w1, . . . , wK}, the output estimation error is defined as e , d − u⊗Kw. Under our notation, w , w1⊗· · ·⊗wK (KM×1), and u⊗K , u⊗· · ·⊗u\n2This fact is used in Appendix A.\n(1 ×KM ), the Kronecker product of u with itself K times. The mean-square error (MSE) is defined as\nMSE , E|e|2 = E [ [d− u⊗Kw]∗[d− u⊗Kw] ] = E|d|2 − w∗E[du⊗K∗]− E[d∗u⊗K ]w (10) + w∗E[u⊗K∗u⊗K ]w.\nUnder the hypothesis of stationarity on both u and d, we can define the following constants:\nRuK = E[u⊗K∗u⊗K ], RuKd = E[u⊗Kd∗] = R∗duK (11) Rd = E|d|2. (12)\nThen, the mean square error takes the familiar form in (13).\nMSE(w1, . . . , wK) = Rd − w∗R∗uKd −RuKdw + w ∗RuKw. (13)\nAlthough the form is familiar, our notation embeds some aspects of this function. For example, it does not describe a quadratic surface. Instead, it has degree 2K, when we look at the individual vectors w1, . . . , wK .\nNote that (13) could be seen as a function of a vector wC built from the stacking of the individual w1, . . . , wK vectors. We now introduce ∇ws , the gradient with respect to the coordinates of the vector ws. The complete gradient vector, ∇MSE, over wC , would be the stacking of these gradients. It is possible to show that (see Appendix A)\n∇wsMSE = [−RuKd + w∗RuK ](w1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ŵs ⊗ · · · ⊗ wK), (14)\nwhere ŵs implies that ws has been substituted for the identity matrix IM of order M in the product.\nIn addition, the critical MSE is reached when the gradient is 0. This implies the trivial solution wp = wq = 0, for some p 6= q—which makes w1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ ŵs ⊗ · · · ⊗ wK = 0 for each s—or the equation RuKwo = RduK . Usually we are not interested in the first, therefore we will focus on the second. This equation is reminiscent of the normal equations in linear estimation. As such, we can reorganize it in the form\nE[u⊗Ku⊗K∗]wo = E[u⊗K∗d] E[u⊗K∗(d− u⊗Kwo)] = 0\nE[u⊗K∗eo] = 0, (15)\nthat is, a form of the orthogonality principle, with the optimal output error eo being orthogonal to u⊗K . One can interpret this as eo being uncorrelated to all of the “degree K” products of the input.\nDue to the structure of RuK (repeated rows), it will always be singular for K > 1, but under certain conditions we can guarantee the existence of the non trivial solution. Assume for d the model in (16),\nd = u⊗Kho + n, (16)\nwhere n is some zero-mean noise uncorrelated with u⊗K (serving as a model for eo), and ho = ho1 ⊗ · · · ⊗ hoK , for\n3 some set of vectors {ho1, . . . , hoK}. Then, one can verify that ho is a solution to the equation RuKwo = RduK in wo:\nRduK = E[u ⊗K∗d] = E[u⊗K∗u⊗K ]ho + E[u ⊗K∗n]\n= RuKho. (17)"

In spite of these problems, we have empirically found one satisfactory initial condition for use in high numeric precision environments. And that is: using w1[0] = [1 0 · · · 0 0]T , w2[0] = [2−1 0 · · · 0 0]T , or generally wj [0] = [21−j 0 · · · 0 1]T until j = K − 1 and then wK [0] = 0.

      "text" : "Cases I and II clearly show the system converging to an EMSE of approximately −40 dB and −70 dB, respectively. On both Figs. 2a and 2b, we can see the SML-LMS running slower through the first 500 iterations, then it speeds up and catches up with—and eventually overtake—the others. Both the Volterra and Wiener models assume O (( M+K−1\nK )) operations per iteration, while the SML only O(KM +K2). Although it is natural that the SML algorithm is better at identifying SML plants, it does it faster and with far fewer arithmetic operations.\nNote that the SML algorithm presents richer dynamics compared to the other algorithms—something that will be studied in following publications. Case III, in Fig. 2c, for example, shows that its behavior does not depend only on statistics of the regressor ui—in fact, it is also influenced by the plant to be identified. A source of these effects can be hypothesised as due to the ys(i) factors in (21).\nCase IV, in Fig. 2d, shows that the algorithm also converges for K = 3 and that it has the aforementioned initial irregular convergence rate, here appearing in a more evident way.\nCase V shows that the algorithm is competitive, even in a non-SML plant—as long as this plant is correlated enough. The PF used 21 coefficients, the SV used 66, the IV used 60, Volterra used 231 and SML 42. This is another result that shows the computational simplicity of the SML.\nCase VI shows two similar filters, in the sense that they are formed through the product of others. SML is a product of three linear filters, with a total of 30 coefficients, and CF\nis a product of a linear filter with a second order Volterra filter, with 66 coefficients. In the task of identifying an SML plant, they show similar behavior, with the SML being slightly better—at half the complexity."

Through the use of the Kronecker product and some basic facts of tensor algebra, we propose a simple model of nonlinearity, one that can be interpreted as a product of the outputs of K FIR linear filters, and compute its cost function together with its gradient, which allows for some analysis of the optimization problem. We use these results it in a stochastic gradient framework, from which we derive an LMS-like algorithm and investigate the problems of multi-modality in the mean-square error surface and the choice of adequate initial conditions. Its computational complexity is calculated. The new algorithm is tested in a system identification setup and is compared with other polynomial algorithms from the literature, presenting favorable convergence and/or computational complexity.",
