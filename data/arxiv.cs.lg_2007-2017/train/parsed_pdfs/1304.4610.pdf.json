A partial list includes medical imaging (Lustig et al., 2007), radar systems (Potter et al., 2010), seismic imaging (Borcea et al., 2002), microscopy (Schermelleh et al., 2010), etc. The data acquisition devices, however, are often limited by physical and hardware constraints, precluding sampling with the desired resolution. It is thus of paramount interest to reduce the sensing complexity while retaining recovery resolution.\nFortunately, in many instances, it is possible to recover an object even when the number of samples is far below the ambient dimension, provided that the object has a parsimonious representation in the transform domain. In particular, recent advances in compressed sensing (CS) (Candes et al., 2006) popularize the nonparametric methods based on convex surrogates. Such tractable methods do not require prior information on the model order, and are often robust against noise.\nNevertheless, the success of CS relies on sparse representation or approximation of the object of interest in a finite discrete dictionary, while the true parameters in many application are actually specified in a continuous dictionary. For concreteness, consider an object x (t) that is a weighted sum of K-dimensional sinusoids at r distinct frequencies {fi ∈ [0, 1]K : 1 ≤ i ≤ r}. Conventional CS paradigms operate under the assumptions that these frequencies lie on a pre-determined grid on the unit disk. However, cautions need to be taken when imposing a discrete dictionary on continuous frequencies, since nature never poses the frequencies on the pre-determined grid, no matter how fine the grid is (Chi et al., 2011; Duarte & Baraniuk, 2012). This issue, known as basis mismatch between the true frequencies and the discretized grid, results in loss of sparsity due to spectral leakage along the Dirichlet kernel, and hence degeneration in the performance of CS algorithms. While one might impose finer gridding to mitigate this weakness, this approach often leads\nto numerical instability and high correlation between dictionary elements, which significantly weakens the advantage of these CS approaches (Tang et al., 2012).\nIn this paper, we explore the above spectral compressed sensing problem, which aims to recover a spectrally sparse object from a small set of time-domain samples. The underlying (possibly multi-dimensional) frequencies can assume any value in the unit disk, and need to be recovered with infinite precision. To address this problem, we develop a nonparametric algorithm, called enhanced matrix completion (EMaC), based on structured matrix completion. Specifically, EMaC starts by converting the data samples into an enhanced matrix with (K-fold) Hankel structures, and then solves a nuclear-norm minimization program to complete the enhanced matrix. We show that, under mild incoherence conditions, EMaC admits exact recovery from O(r log2 n) random samples, where r and n denote respectively the spectral sparsity and the ambient dimension. Additionally, we provide theoretical guarantee for the low-rank Hankel matrix completion problem, which is of great importance in control, natural language processing, computer vision, etc. To the best of our knowledge, our results provide the first theoretical bounds that are close to the information theoretic limit. Furthermore, numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithm is robust against noise and is applicable to the problem of super resolution."

      "heading" : "2. Connection to Prior Art",
      "text" : "The spectral compressed sensing problem is closely related to harmonic retrieval, which seeks to extract the underlying frequencies of an object from a collection of its time-domain samples. This spans many signal processing applications including radar localization systems (Nion & Sidiropoulos, 2010), array imaging systems (Borcea et al., 2002), wireless channel sensing (Sayeed & Aazhang, 1999; Gedalyahui et al., 2011), etc. In fact, if the time-domain representation of an object can be estimated accurately, then its underlying frequencies can be identified using harmonic super-resolution methods.\nConventional approaches for these problems, such as ESPRIT (Roy & Kailath, 1989) and the matrix pencil method (Hua, 1992), are based on the eigenvalue decomposition of covariance matrices constructed from equi-spaced samples, which can accommodate infinite frequency precision. One weakness of these techniques lies in that they require prior information on the model order, that is, the number of underlying frequency spikes or, at least, an estimate of it. Besides, their performance largely depends on the knowledge of noise spectra; some of them are unstable in the presence of\nnoise and outliers (Dragotti et al., 2007).\nNonparametric algorithms based on convex optimization differ from the above parametric techniques in that the model order does not need to be specified a priori. Recently, Candès and Fernandez-Granda (2013) proposed a total-variation minimization algorithm to super-resolve a sparse object from frequency samples at the low end of its spectrum. This algorithm allows accurate super-resolution when the point sources are appropriately separated, and is stable against noise (Candes & Fernandez-Granda, 2012). Inspired by this approach, Tang et. al. (2012) developed an atomic norm minimization algorithm for line spectral estimation from O(r log r logn) time domain samples. This work is limited to 1-D frequency models and assumes randomness in the data model.\nIn contrast, our approach can accommodate multidimensional frequencies, and only assumes randomness in the observation basis. The algorithm is inspired by the recent advances of matrix completion (MC) problem, which aims at recovering a low-rank matrix from partial entries. It has been shown (Candes & Recht, 2009; Gross, 2011) that exact recovery is possible via nuclear norm minimization, as soon as the number of observed entries is on the order of the information theoretic limit. Encouragingly, this line of algorithms is also robust against noise and outliers (Negahban & Wainwright, 2012). Nevertheless, the theoretical guarantees of these algorithms do not apply to the more structured observation models associated with Hankel structure. Consequently, direct application of existing MC results yields pessimistic bounds on the number of samples, which is far beyond the degrees of freedom underlying the sparse object.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 3 describes the data model and the EMaC algorithm. Section 4 presents the theoretical guarantee of EMaC, with a proof outlined in the Appendix. Numerical validation of EMaC is given in Section 5. We then discuss the extension to low-rank Hankel matrix completion in Section 6, and conclude the paper in Section 7."

Specifically, this corresponds to the following optimization program\nminimize M∈Cn1×n2\n‖M‖∗ (5)\nsubject to PΩ (M) = PΩ (X) ,\nwhich is the convex relaxation of the rank minimization problem. However, generic matrix completion algorithms (Gross, 2011) require at least the order of rmax (n1, n2) samples, which far exceeds the degrees of freedom (which is O (r logn) due to a coupon collector’s effect) in our problem. What is worse, when r > min (n1, n2) (which is possible since r can be as large as n1n2), X is no longer low-rank. This motivates us to construct other forms (e.g. Hua (1992)) that better capture the harmonic structure.\nSpecifically, we adopt an effective enhanced form of X based on 2-fold Hankel structure as follows. The enhanced matrix Xe with respect to X is defined as a k1 × (n1 − k1 + 1) block Hankel matrix\nXe :=\n\n    X0 X1 · · · Xn1−k1 X1 X2 · · · Xn1−k1+1 ... ... ...\n...

The effectiveness of the enhanced form relies on the shift-invariance of harmonic structures (any k consecutive samples lies in the same subspace), which promotes the use of Hankel matrices.\nOne can now see that Xe is low-rank or, rank (Xe) ≤ r. We then attempt recovery via the following Enhanced Matrix Completion (EMaC) algorithm:\n(EMaC) : minimize M∈Cn1×n2\n‖Me‖∗ (8)\nsubject to PΩ (M) = PΩ (X) ,\nwhich minimizes the nuclear norm of the enhanced form over the constraint set.

The frequency pairs can be spread out (e.g. when their locations are generated in some random fashion), or minimally separated (e.g. when they are small perturbation of a fine grid).\nCondition (11) can be satisfied when the total energy of each skew diagonal of UV ∗ is proportional to the dimension of this skew diagonal. This is indeed a weaker condition than the one introduced in (Candes & Recht, 2009) for matrix completion, which requires uniform energy distribution over all entries of UV ∗. For instance, an ideal µ2 can often be obtained when the complex phase of all frequencies are generated in some random fashion.\nCondition (12) is an incoherence measure based on the (K-fold) Hankel structures. For example, one can reason that a desired µ3 can be obtained if the magnitude of all entries of UU∗AaV V ∗ is mostly even. Condition (10) and (12) depend only on the frequency pairs. In fact, one can verify that UU∗ = EL (E∗LEL) −1 E∗ L and V V ∗ = E∗ R (ERE ∗ R )−1 ER, which depend only on the locations of the frequency pairs. Condition (11), however, might also rely on the amplitudes D.\nFinally, the incoherence measures (µ1, µ2, µ3) are mutually correlated, which is supplied as follows.\nLemma 1 The incoherence measures (µ1, µ2, µ3) of Xe satisfy\nµ2 ≤ µ21c2sr, and µ3 ≤ µ21c2sr.

Define cs := max (\nn1n2 k1k2 , n1n2(n1−k1+1)(n2−k2+1)\n)\n.

Theorem 1 states the following: (1) under strong incoherence condition (i.e. given that (µ1, µ2, µ3) are all constants), prefect recovery is possible as soon as the number of measurements exceeds the order of r log2 (n1n2); (2) under weak incoherence condition (i.e. given only that µ1 is a constant), perfect recovery is possible from O ( r2 log (n1n2) ) samples. Since there are at least Θ(r) degrees of freedom in total, this establishes the near optimality of EMaC under strong incoherence condition.\nWe would like to note that while we assume random observation models, the conditions imposed on the data model are deterministic. This is different from (Tang et al., 2012), where randomness are assumed for both the observation model and the data model.\nOn the other hand, our method enables stable recovery even when the time-domain samples are noisy copies of the true data. Here, we say the recovery is stable if the solution of EMaC-Noisy is “close” to the ground truth. To this end, we establish the following theorem, which is a counterpart of Theorem 1 in the noisy setting.\nTheorem 2 Suppose Xo is a noisy copy of X that satisfies ‖PΩ(X−Xo)‖F ≤ δ. Under the conditions of Theorem 1, the solution to EMaC-Noisy in (9) satisfies\n‖X̂e −Xe‖F ≤ { 2 √ n1n2 + 8n1n2 + 8 √ 2n21n 2 2\nm\n}\nδ\nwith probability exceeding 1− (n1n2)−2.\nTheorem 2 basically implies that the recovered enhanced matrix (which contains O(n21n22) entries) is close to the true enhanced matrix at high signal-tonoise ratio. In particular, the average entry inaccuracy is bounded above by O(n1n2m δ). We note that in practice, EMaC-Noisy usually yields better estimate, possibly by a polynomial factor. The practical applicability will be illustrated in Section 5 through numerical examples."

Consequently, at each iteration, a pair (Qt,Mt) is produced by first performing singular value shrinkage and then projecting the outcome onto the space of K-fold Hankel matrices that are consistent with observed entries.\nFig. 2 illustrates the performance of Algorithm 1. We generated a 101× 101 data matrix X with a superposition of 30 random complex sinusoids, and revealed 5.8% of the total entries (i.e. m = 600) uniformly at random. The noise was i.i.d.

We provide here a sketch of the proof, with detailed derivation deferred to (Chen & Chi, 2013) and the supplemental material.\nDenote by T the tangent space with respect to U and V . Let PT be the orthogonal projection onto T , with PT⊥ := I − PT denoting its orthogonal complement. Denote by A(i,l) the orthogonal projection onto the subspace spanned by A(i,l). The projection onto the space spanned by all A(i,l)’s and its complement are defined as\nA := ∑\n(i,l)∈[n1]×[n2] A(i,l), and A⊥ = I − A. (17)\nSuppose that Ω is obtained by sampling with replacement, i.e. Ω contains m indices {zi}mi=1 that are i.i.d.\ngenerated from [n1] × [n2]. We define the associated projection operators as AΩ := ∑m i=1 Azi , and introduce another projection operator A′Ω similar to AΩ but with the summation only over distinct samples.\nTo prove exact recovery of EMaC, it is sufficient to produce a dual certificate as follows.\nLemma 2 For a location set Ω of size m, suppose that the sampling operator PΩ obeys\n∥ ∥ ∥PTAPT − n1n2 m PTAΩPT ∥ ∥ ∥ ≤ 1 2 . (18)\nIf there exists a matrix W that obeys \n\n\n(A−A′Ω) (UV ∗ +W ) = 0, ‖PT (W )‖F ≤ 12n2\n1 n2 2\n, ‖PT⊥ (W )‖ ≤ 12 , (19)\nthen Xe is the unique optimizer of EMaC.\nThe dual certificate is constructed via the golfing scheme introduced in (Gross, 2011). Specifically, we generate j0 independent random location sets Ωj ∼ Bernoulli(q), which is sampled with replacement. Set q such that 1 − ρ = (1− q)j0 , where ρ := mn1n2 , then the distribution of Ω is the same as Ω1∪Ω2∪· · ·∪Ωj0 . For small ρ, we have q = O (ρ/j0) through the Taylor expansion. Consider a small constant ǫ < 13 . The construction of a dual certificate W proceeds as follows:\n1. Set B0 = 0, and j0 := 3 log1/ǫ(n1n2).\n2. For 1 ≤ i ≤ j0, let\nBi = Bi−1 + ( q−1AΩi +A⊥ ) PT (UV ∗ −Bi−1) .\n3. Set W := − (UV ∗ −Bj0).\nWe will verify that W is a valid dual certificate satisfying the conditions (19) in Lemma 2. Our construction immediately yields ( A′Ω +A⊥ ) (Bi) = Bi for 1 ≤ i ≤ j0, which gives (A−A′Ω) (UV ∗ +W ) = 0. Define Fi := UV ∗ −Bi, and hence W = Fj0 , one has\nPT (Fi) = ( PTAPT − q−1PTAΩiPT ) (Fi−1) .\nTo proceed, we present Lemma 3 which shows that AΩ is sufficiently incoherent with respect to T .\nLemma 3 There exists a constant c1 > 0 such that if m > c1µ1csr log (n1n2), then\n∥ ∥ ∥ n1n2 m PTAΩPT − PTAPT ∥ ∥ ∥ ≤ ǫ (20)\nwith probability exceeding 1− (n1n2)−4.\nUnder the assumptions of Lemma 3, we have\n‖PT (W )‖F = ‖PT (Fj0)‖F ≤ ǫj0 √ r < n−21 n −2 2 .\nIt remains to show ‖PT⊥ (W )‖ ≤ 12 as follows.\nLemma 4 There exist constants c8, c9 > 0 such that if m > c9 max (µ1cs, µ2, µ3) r log 2 (n1n2), then ∀1 ≤ i ≤ j0 : ∥ ∥PT⊥ ( q−1AΩi +A⊥ ) PT (Fi) ∥ ∥ < 2−i−2 with probability at least 1− c8(n1n2)−3.\nUnder the assumptions of Lemma 4, we have\n‖PT⊥ (W )‖ ≤ j0∑\ni=0\n∥ ∥PT⊥ ( q−1AΩ +A⊥ ) PT (Fi) ∥ ∥ < 1/2.\nSo far, we have successfully shown that W is a valid dual certificate with high probability, and hence EMaC allows exact recovery with high probability."

Specifically, the object of interest with ambient dimension n is assumed to be a mixture of r complex multi-dimensional sinusoids, while the underlying frequencies can assume any value in the unit disk. Conventional compressed sensing paradigms suffer from the basis mismatch issue when imposing a discrete dictionary on the Fourier representation. To address this problem, we develop a novel nonparametric algorithm, called enhanced matrix completion (EMaC), based on structured matrix completion. The algorithm starts by arranging the data into a low-rank enhanced form with multi-fold Hankel structure, then attempts recovery via nuclear norm minimization. Under mild incoherence conditions, EMaC allows perfect recovery as soon as the number of samples exceeds the order of O(r log n). We also show that, in many instances, accurate completion of a low-rank multi-fold Hankel matrix is possible when the number of observed entries is proportional to the information theoretical limits (except for a logarithmic gap). The robustness of EMaC against bounded noise and its applicability to super resolution are further demonstrated by numerical experiments.",
