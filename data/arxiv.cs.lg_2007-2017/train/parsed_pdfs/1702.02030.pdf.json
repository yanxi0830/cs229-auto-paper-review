Third, we stress that the above results are established in a unified framework, which allows us to derive new risk bounds under weaker conditions, e.g., without convexity of the random function and Lipschitz continuity of the expected function. Finally, we demonstrate that to achieve an O(1/[λn2] + κF∗/n) risk bound for supervised learning, the Ω̃(κd) requirement on n can be replaced with Ω(κ2), which is dimensionality-independent.\nKeywords: Empirical Risk Minimization, Stochastic Convex Optimization, Excess Risk"

      "text" : "Stochastic optimization occurs in almost all areas of science and engineering, such as machine learning, statistics and operations research (Shapiro et al., 2014). In this problem, the goal is to optimize the value of an expected objective function F (·) over some set W, i.e.,\nmin w∈W F (w) = Ef∼P [f(w)] , (1)\nwhere f(·) : W 7→ R is a random function sampled from a (possibly unknown) distribution P. A well-known special case is the risk minimization problem in supervised learning (Vapnik,\n1998, 2000), which takes the following form\nmin h∈H F (h) = E(x,y)∼D [ℓ(h(x), y)] , (2)\nwhere H = {h : X 7→ R} is a hypothesis class, (x, y) ∈ X × R is an instance-label pair sampled from a distribution D, and ℓ(·, ·) : R × R 7→ R is certain loss. In this paper, we mainly focus on the convex version of (1), namely stochastic convex optimization (SCO), where both the domain W and the expected function F (·) are convex.\nTwo classical approaches for solving stochastic optimization are stochastic approximation (SA) (Kushner and Yin, 2003) and the sample average approximation (SAA), the latter of which is also referred to as empirical risk minimization (ERM) in the machine learning community (Vapnik, 1998). While both SA and ERM have been extensively studied in recent years (Bartlett and Mendelson, 2002; Bartlett et al., 2005; Koltchinskii, 2011; Nemirovski et al., 2009; Moulines and Bach, 2011), most theoretical guarantees of ERM are restricted to the supervised learning problem in (2). As pointed out in a seminal work of Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009), the success of ERM for supervised learning cannot be directly extended to stochastic optimization. Actually, Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009) have constructed an instance of SCO that is learnable by SA but cannot be solved by ERM. Literatures about ERM for stochastic optimization (including SCO) are quite limited, and we still lack a full understanding of the theory.\nIn ERM, we are given n i.i.d. functions f1, . . . , fn sampled from P, and minimize an empirical objective function:\nmin w∈W\nF̂ (w) = 1\nn\nn∑\ni=1\nfi(w). (3)\nLet ŵ ∈ argmin w∈W F̂ (w) be the empirical minimizer. The performance of ERM is measured in terms of the excess risk defined as\nF (ŵ)− min w∈W F (w).\nState-of-the-art risk bounds of ERM include: an Õ( √\nd/n) bound when the random function f(·) is Lipschitz continuous,1 where d is the dimensionality of w; an O(1/λn) bound when f(·) is λ-strongly convex (Shalev-Shwartz et al., 2009); and an Õ(d/ηn) bound when f(·) is η-exponentially concave (η-exp-concave) (Mehta, 2016). From existing studies of ERM for supervised learning (Srebro et al., 2010), we know that smoothness can be utilized to boost the risk bound. Thus, it is natural to ask whether smoothness can also be exploited to improve the performance of ERM for SCO. This paper provides an affirmative answer to this question. Indeed, we propose a general approach for analyzing the excess risk bound of ERM, which brings several improved risk bounds and new risk bounds as well.\nTo state our results, we first introduce some notations. Let F∗ = minw∈W F (w) be the minimal risk, λ be the modulus of strong convexity of F (·) and L be the modulus of smoothness of f(·). Denote by κ = L/λ the condition number of the problem. Our and previous results of ERM for SCO are summarized in Table 1, where we make explicit the\n1. We use the Õ and Ω̃ notations to hide constant factors as well as polylogarithmic factors in d and n.\nassumptions on the random function f(·), the empirical function F̂ (w) and the expected function F (·). For our results of ERM for SCO, we assume the domain is bounded, and the random function is nonnegative. We highlight the significance of this work as follows:\n• When f(·) is both convex and smooth and F (·) is Lipschitz continuous, we establish an Õ(d/n + √ F∗/n) risk bound (c.f. Theorem 1). In the optimistic case that F∗ is\nsmall, i.e., F∗ = O(d 2/n), we obtain an Õ(d/n) risk bound, which is analogous to the Õ(1/n) optimistic rate of ERM for supervised learning (Srebro et al., 2010) and also matches a recent lower bound of ERM for SCO (Feldman, 2016, Theorem 3.10). • If F (·) is also λ-strongly convex, we prove an Õ (d/n + κF∗/n) risk bound, and improve it to O(1/[λn2]+κF∗/n) when n = Ω̃(κd) (c.f. Theorem 3). Thus, if n is large and F∗ is small, i.e., F∗ = O(1/n), we get an O(κ/n\n2) risk bound, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first O(1/n2)-type of risk bound of ERM. • When neither convexity is present in f(·) nor Lipschitz continuity is present in F (·), as long as f(·) is smooth, F̂ (·) is convex and F (·) is strongly convex, we still obtain an improved risk bound of O(1/[λn2] + κF∗/n) when n = Ω̃(κ\n2d), which will further implies an O(κ/n2) risk bound if F∗ = O(1/n) (c.f. Theorem 5). • If strong convexity is also absent in F (·), assuming f(·) is smooth and both F̂ (·) and F (·) are convex, we obtain an Õ( √ d/n) risk bound (c.f. Theorem 7). This result\nbreaks the barrier of non-learnability of bounded convex functions (Feldman, 2016, Theorem 5.2) by exploiting the smoothness of random functions. • Finally, we extend the O(1/[λn2] + κF∗/n) risk bound to supervised learning with a generalized linear form. Our analysis shows that in this case, the lower bound of n can be replaced with Ω(κ2), which is dimensionality-independent (c.f. Theorem 8). Thus, this result can be applied to infinite dimensional cases, e.g., learning with kernels."

      "text" : "As we mentioned earlier, there are few works devoted to ERM for stochastic optimization. When W ⊂ Rd is bounded and f(·) is Lipschitz continuous, Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009) demonstrate that F̂ (w) converges to F (w) uniformly over W with an Õ( √ d/n) error bound that holds with high probability, implying an Õ( √\nd/n) risk bound of ERM. They further establish an O(1/λn) risk bound of ERM that holds in expectation when f(·) is λ-strongly convex and Lipschitz continuous. Stochastic optimization with exp-concave functions is studied recently (Koren and Levy, 2015),2 and Mehta (2016) proves an Õ(d/ηn) bound of ERM that holds with high probability when f(·) is η-exp-concave, Lipschitz continuous, and bounded. Lower bounds of ERM for stochastic optimization is investigated by Feldman (2016), who exhibits (i) a lower bound of Ω(d/ǫ2) sample complexity for uniform convergence that nearly matches the upper bound of Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009); and (ii) a lower bound of Ω(d/ǫ) sample complexity of ERM, which is matched by our Õ(d/n + √ F∗/n) bound when F∗ is small. It is worth mentioning the difference among proof techniques in these works. The uniform convergence result of Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009) leverages the covering number to bound |F̂ (w) − F (w)| for any w ∈ W. The analysis for strongly convex functions by Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009) and exp-concave functions by Koren and Levy (2015) utilize the tool of stability, which only produces risk bounds that hold in expectation. A simple way to achieve a high probability bound is to use ERM combined with a generic or specific boosting-the-confidence method (Mehta, 2016; Haussler et al., 1991), but the guarantee is not directly on the empirical minimizer as noted by Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009). The convergence of ERM given by Mehta (2016) relies on a central condition or “stochastic mixability” of the exp-concave function. In this paper, we present a general approach for analyzing ERM for SCO of smooth functions. In particular, our analysis is based on a uniform convergence of ∇F̂ (w) − ∇F̂ (w∗) to ∇F (w) − ∇F (w∗) for any w ∈ W, and a concentration inequality of ‖∇F̂ (w∗)−∇F (w∗)‖, where w∗ is the optimal solution to (1)."

      "text" : "We note that there are extensive studies on ERM for supervised learning, and hence the review here is non-exhaustive. In the context of supervised learning, the performance of ERM is closely related to the uniform convergence of F̂ (·) to F (·) over the hypothesis 2. Their excess risk bound is for a regularized empirical risk minimizer.\nclass H (Koltchinskii, 2011). In fact, uniform convergence is a sufficient condition for learnability (Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David, 2014), and in some special cases such as binary classification, it is also a necessary condition (Vapnik, 1998). The accuracy of uniform convergence, as well as the quality of the empirical minimizer, can be upper bounded in terms of the complexity of the hypothesis classH, including data-independent measures such as the VC-dimension and data-dependent measures such as the Rademacher complexity.\nGenerally speaking, when H has finite VC-dimension, the excess risk can be upper bounded by O( √ VC(H)/n), where VC(H) is the VC-dimension of H. If the loss ℓ(·, ·) is Lipschitz continuous with respect to its first argument, we have a risk bound of O(1/ √ n+ Rn(H)), where Rn(H) is the Rademacher complexity of H. The Rademacher complexity typically scales as Rn(H) = O(1/ √ n), e.g., H contains linear functions with low-norm,\nimplying an O(1/ √ n) risk bound (Bartlett and Mendelson, 2002). There have been intensive efforts to derive rates faster than O(1/ √ n) under various conditions (Lee et al., 1996; Panchenko, 2002; Bartlett et al., 2005; Gonen and Shalev-Shwartz, 2016), such as low-noise (Tsybakov, 2004), smoothness (Srebro et al., 2010), strong convexity (Sridharan et al., 2009), to name a few amongst many. Specifically, when the random function f(·) is nonnegative and smooth, Srebro et al. (2010) have established a risk bound of Õ(R2n(H) + Rn(H) √ F∗), reducing to an Õ(1/n) bound if Rn(H) = O(1/ √ n) and F∗ = O(1/n). A generalized linear form of (2) is studied by Sridharan et al. (2009), and a risk bound of O(1/λn) is proved if the expected function F (·) is λ-strongly convex."

For brevity, we only discuss first-order methods for SCO, and in this case, n is the number of stochastic gradients consumed by the algorithm. For Lipschitz continuous convex functions, stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits the optimal O(1/ √ n) risk bound (Nemirovski and Yudin, 1983). When the random function f(·) is nonnegative and smooth, SGD (with a suitable step size) has a risk bound of O(1/n + √ F∗/n), becoming O(1/n) if F∗ = O(1/n) (Srebro et al., 2010, Corollary 4). If F (·) is λ-strongly convex, some variants of SGD (Hazan and Kale, 2011; Rakhlin et al., 2012) achieve an O(1/λn) rate which is known to be minimax optimal (Agarwal et al., 2012). For the square loss and the logistic loss, an O(1/n) rate is attainable without any strong convexity assumptions (Bach and Moulines, 2013). When the random function f(·) is η-exp-concave, the online Newton step (ONS) is equipped with an Õ(d/ηn) risk bound (Hazan et al., 2007; Mahdavi et al., 2015)."

In the literature, the most comparable result is the O(1/λn) risk bound proved by Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009) but with striking differences highlighted in Table 1. Since the risk bound of Shalev-Shwartz et al. (2009) is independent of the dimensionality d, it is natural to ask whether it is possible to prove a dimensionality-independent Õ(κ/n) bound that holds with high probability. The second part of Corollary 4 indeed provides such a bound, but under an additional condition n = Ω̃(κd).\nRemark 4 The second part implies that when n is large enough, i.e., n = Ω̃(κd), the risk bound can be tightened to O(1/[λn2] + κF∗/n). In particular, when the minimal risk is small, i.e., F∗ = O(1/n), we obtain an O(κ/n\n2) bound. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first O(1/n2)-type of risk bound of ERM, and even in the studies of stochastic approximation, we have not found similar theoretical guarantees. Finally, it is worth to point out the following two features of the second part:\n• Although the lower bound of n depends on d, the risk bound is independent of d. • The domain size R only appears in the lower bound of n, and the dependence is\nlogarithmic. Our next result shows that the individual convexity assumption, i.e., Assumption 4(d), and the Lipschitz continuity assumption, i.e., Assumptions 3, in Theorem 3 can be relaxed. To be specific, Assumptions 4(d) and 3 can be replaced with Assumption 4(c).\nTheorem 5 Under Assumptions 1, 2, 4(b), and 4(c), with probability at least 1 − 2δ, we have\nF (ŵ)− F (w∗) ≤ 4R2LC(ε)\nn +\n4R2L2C(ε)\nλn +\n4RM log(2/δ)\nn +\n8LF∗ log(2/δ)\nλn\n+ ( 4RL+ 2RL √ C(ε)\nn +\n2RLC(ε)\nn\n) ε.\n(14)\nFurthermore, if\nn ≥ 25L 2C(ε)\nλ2 = 25κ2C(ε), (15)\nwe also have\nF (ŵ)− F (w∗) ≤ 8M2 log2(2/δ)\nλn2 +\n32LF∗ log(2/δ)\nλn +\n( 32L2\nλ +\n416λ\n625\n) ε2.

It is interesting to mention that a similar phenomenon also happens in stochastic approximation. Recently, a variance reduction technique named SVRG (Johnson and Zhang, 2013) or EMGD (Zhang et al., 2013) was proposed for stochastic optimization when both full gradients and stochastic gradients are available. In the analysis, SVRG assumes the stochastic function is convex, while EMGD does not. From their theoretical results, we observe that the individual convexity leads to a difference of κ factor in the sample complexity of stochastic gradients.\nFinally, we want to mention that even when the strong convexity assumption in Theorem 5 is missing, a risk bound of Õ( √ d/n) is still attainable.\nTheorem 7 Under Assumptions 1, 2, 4(a), and 4(c), with probability at least 1 − 2δ, we have\nF (ŵ)− F (w∗) ≤ 4R2LC(ε)\nn +\n4RM log(2/δ)\nn + 4R2L\n√ C(ε)\nn + 2R\n√ 8LF∗ log(2/δ)\nn\n+ ( 4RL+ 2RL √ C(ε)\nn +\n2RLC(ε)\nn\n) ε.\nRemark 7 In a recent work, Feldman (2016) shows that SCO without the Lipschitz condition cannot be solved by ERM. Theorem 7 exhibits that as long as the random function is smooth, SCO is learnable by ERM."

(27)\nRemark 9 The first part of Theorem 8 presents an O(κ/n) risk bound,3 similar to the O(1/λn) risk bound of Sridharan et al. (2009). The second part is an O(1/[λn2] + κH∗/n) risk bound, and in this case, the lower bound of n is Ω(κ2), which is dimensionalityindependent. Thus, Theorem 8 can be applied even when the dimensionality is infinite. Generally speaking, the regularizer r(·) is nonnegative, and thus H∗ ≤ F∗. So, the second bound is even better than those in Theorems 3 and 5. Finally, we note that Theorem 8 should be treated as a counterpart of Theorem 5 for supervised learning, because both of them do not rely on the individual complexity, i.e., Assumption 4(d). One may wonder whether it is possible to derive a counterpart of Theorem 3, that is, whether it is possible to utilize the individual convexity to reduce the lower bound of n by a factor of κ. We will investigate this question as a future work."

Our theoretical results show that it is possible to achieve O(1/n)-type of risk bounds under (i) the smoothness and small minimal risk conditions (i.e., Theorem 1) or (ii) the smoothness and strong convexity conditions (i.e., the first part of Theorems 3, 5, and 8). A more exciting result is that when n is large enough, ERM has O(1/n2)-type of risk bounds under the smoothness, strong convexity, and small minimal risk conditions (i.e., the second part of Theorems 3, 5, and 8).\nIn the context of SCO, there remain many open problems about ERM.\n1. Our current results are restricted to the Hilbert or Euclidean space, because the smoothness and strong convexity are defined in terms of the ℓ2-norm. We will extend our analysis to other geometries in the future. 2. As mentioned in Remark 3, under the strong convexity condition, a dimensionalityindependent risk bound, e.g., Õ(κ/n) or Õ(1/λn), that holds with high probability is still missing. 3. As discussed in Remark 9, it is unclear whether the convexity of the loss can be exploited to improve the lower bound of n in the second part of Theorem 8. Ideally, we expect that n = Ω(κ) is sufficient to deliver an O(1/[λn2] + κH∗/n) risk bound. 4. The O(1/n2)-type of risk bounds require both the smoothness and strong convexity conditions. One may investigate whether strong convexity can be relaxed to other weaker conditions, such as exponential concavity. Finally, as far as we know, there are no O(1/n2)-type of risk bounds for stochastic approximation (SA). We will try to establish such bounds for SA."

    "abstractText" : "Although there exist plentiful theories of empirical risk minimization (ERM) for supervised learning, current theoretical understandings of ERM for a related problem—stochastic convex optimization (SCO), are limited. In this work, we strengthen the realm of ERM for SCO by exploiting smoothness and strong convexity conditions to improve the risk bounds. First, we establish an Õ(d/n+ √ F∗/n) risk bound when the random function is nonnegative, convex and smooth, and the expected function is Lipschitz continuous, where d is the dimensionality of the problem, n is the number of samples, and F∗ is the minimal risk. Thus, when F∗ is small we obtain an Õ(d/n) risk bound, which is analogous to the Õ(1/n) optimistic rate of ERM for supervised learning. Second, if the objective function is also λ-strongly convex, we prove an Õ(d/n + κF∗/n) risk bound where κ is the condition number, and improve it to O(1/[λn] + κF∗/n) when n = Ω̃(κd). As a result, we obtain an O(κ/n) risk bound under the condition that n is large and F∗ is small, which to the best of our knowledge, is the first O(1/n)-type of risk bound of ERM. Third, we stress that the above results are established in a unified framework, which allows us to derive new risk bounds under weaker conditions, e.g., without convexity of the random function and Lipschitz continuity of the expected function. Finally, we demonstrate that to achieve an O(1/[λn] + κF∗/n) risk bound for supervised learning, the Ω̃(κd) requirement on n can be replaced with Ω(κ), which is dimensionality-independent.",
