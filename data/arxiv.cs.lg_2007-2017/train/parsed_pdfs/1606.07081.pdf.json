      "text" : "Ordinal embedding, also known as non-metric multidimensional scaling, aims to represent items as points in Rd so that the distances between items agree as well as possible with a given set of ordinal comparisons such as item i is closer to item j than to item k. This is a classic problem that is often used to visualize perceptual similarities [1, 2]. Recently, several authors have proposed a variety of new algorithms for learning a metric embedding from ordinal information [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. There has also been some theoretical progress towards characterizing the consistency of ordinal embedding methods. For example, it has been shown that the correct embedding can be learned in the limit as the number of items grows [8, 9, 10]. However, a major shortcoming of all prior work is the lack of generalization and embedding error bounds for problems involving a finite number of items and observations. This paper addresses this problem, developing error bounds for ordinal embedding algorithms with known observation models. The bounds explicitly show the dependence on the number of ordinal comparisons relative to the number of items and the dimension of the embedding. In addition, we propose two new algorithms for recoverying embeddings: the first is based on unbiasing a nuclear norm constrained optimization and the second is based on projected gradient descent onto the space of rank-d matrices, commonly referred to as hard-thresholding. Both methods match state-of-the-art performance while being simpler to implement and faster to converge.\nar X\niv :1\n60 6.\n07 08\n1v 1\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n2 2\nJu n"

Ordinal embedding is the problem of recovering X given ordinal constraints on distances. This paper focuses on “triplet” constraints of the form D?ij < D ? ik, where 1 ≤ i 6= j 6= k ≤ n. Furthermore, we only observe noisy indications of these constraints, as follows. Each triplet t = (i, j, k) has an associated probability pt satisfying\npt > 1/2 ⇐⇒ ‖xi − xj‖2 < ‖xi − xk‖2 .\nLet S denote a collection of triplets drawn independently and uniformly at random. And for each t ∈ S we observe an independent random variable yt = −1 with probability pt, and yt = 1 otherwise. The goal is to recover the embedding X from these data. Exact recovery of D? from such data requires a known link between pt and D?. To this end, our main focus is the following problem.\nOrdinal Embedding from Noisy Data\nConsider n points x1,x2 · · · ,xn in d-dimensional Euclidean space. Let S denote a collection of triplets and for each t ∈ S observe an independent random variable\nyt =  −1 w.p. f(D?ij −D?ik)\n1 w.p. 1− f(D?ij −D?ik) .\nwhere the link function f : R→ [0, 1] is known. Estimate X from S , {yt}, and f . For example, if f is the logistic function, then for triplet t = (i, j, k)\npt = P(yt = −1) = f(D?ij −D?ik) = 1\n1 + exp(D?ij −D?ik) , (1)\nthen D?ij − D?ik = log (1−pt\npt\n) . However, we stress that we only require the existence of a link function\nfor exact recovery of D?. Indeed, if one just wishes to predict the answers to unobserved triplets, then the results of Section 2 hold for arbitrary pt probabilities. We note that a problem known as one-bit matrix completion has similarly used link functions to recover structure [11]. However, while that work made direct measurements of the entries of the matrix, in this work we observe linear projections and as we will see later, the collection of these linear operators has a a non-empty kernel creating non-trivial challenges."

These bounds exploit the fact that the rank of a distance matrix of points in Rd is at most d+ 2. Then we consider the special case of a known observation model and the Maximum Likelihood estimator in Section 3. The link function enables us to relate prediction errors to error bounds on estimates of differences {D?ij −D?ik}. In Section 4, we study the non-trivial problem of recovering D?, and thus X , from the {D?ij −D?ik}.

      "text" : "We will use (D?,G?) to denote the distance and Gram matrices of the latent embedding, and (D,G) to denote an arbitrary distance matrix and its corresponding Gram matrix. The observations {yt} carry\ninformation about D?, but distance matrices are invariant to rotation and translation, and therefore it may only be possible to recover X up to a rigid transformation. Therefore, we make the following assumption throughout the paper.\nAssumption 1. To eliminate the translational ambiguity, assume the points x1, . . .xn ∈ Rd are centered at the origin (i.e., ∑n i=1 xi = 0).\nDefine the centering matrix V := I − 1n11 T . Note that under the above assumption, XV = X . Note that D? is determined by the Gram matrix G? = XTX . In addition, X can be determined from G up to a unitary transformation. Furthermore, we will assume that the Gram matrix is “centered” so that V GV = G. Centering is equivalent to assuming the underlying points are centered at the origin (e.g., note that V G?V = V XTXV = XTX). It will be convenient in the paper to work with both the distance and Gram matrix representations, and the following identities will be useful to keep in mind. For any distance matrix D and its centered Gram matrix G\nG = V DV , (2)\nD = diag(G)1T − 2G + 1diag(G)T , (3)\nwhere diag(G) is the column vector composed of the diagonal of G. In particular this establishes a bijection between centered Gram matrices and distance matrices. We refer the reader to [12] for an insightful and thorough treatment of the properties of distance matrices. We also define the set of all unique triplets\nT := { (i, j, k) : 1 ≤ i 6= j 6= k ≤ n, j < k } .\nAssumption 2. The observed triplets in S are drawn independently and unifomly from T ."

In general, for any Gram matrix G\nLt(G) := Gjj − 2Gij −Gkk + 2Gik.\nWe can naturally view Lt as a linear operator on Sn+, the space of n × n symmetric positive semidefinite matrices. We can also represent Lt as a symmetric n× n matrix Lt that is zero everywhere except on the submatrix corresponding to i, j, k which has the form 0 −1 1−1 1 0\n1 0 −1  and then\nLt(G) := 〈Lt,G〉\nwhere 〈A,B〉 = vec(A)T vec(B) for any compatible matrices A,B. Ordering the elements of T lexicographically, we arrange all the Lt(G) together to define the n ( n−1 2 ) -dimensional vector\nL(G) = [L123(G),L124(G), · · · ,Lijk(G), · · · ]T . (4)\nLet `(yt〈Lt,G〉) denote a loss function. For example we can consider the 0 − 1 loss `(yt〈Lt,G〉) = 1{sign{yt〈Lt,G〉}6=1}, the hinge-loss `(yt〈Lt,G〉) = max{0, 1− yt〈Lt,G〉}, or the logistic loss\n`(yt〈Lt,G〉) = log(1 + exp(−yt〈Lt,G〉)). (5)\nLet pt := P(yt = −1) and take the expectation of the loss with respect to both the uniformly random selection of the triple t and the observation yt, we have the risk of G\nR(G) := E[`(yt〈Lt,G〉)] = 1 |T | ∑ t∈T pt`(−〈Lt,G〉) + (1− pt)`(〈Lt,G〉).\nGiven a set of observations S under the model defined in the problem statement, the empirical risk is,\nR̂S(G) = 1 |S| ∑ t∈S `(yt〈Lt,G〉) (6)\nwhich is an unbiased estimator of the true risk: E[R̂S(G)] = R(G).

(7)\nWe estimate G? by solving the optimization\nmin G∈Gλ,γ R̂S(G) . (8)\nSince G? is positive semidefinite, we expect the diagonal entries of G? to bound the off-diagonal entries. So an infinity norm constraint on the diagonal guarantees that the points x1, . . . ,xn corresponding to G? live inside a bounded `2 ball. The `∞ constraint in (7) plays two roles: 1) if our loss function is Lipschitz, large magnitude values of 〈Lt,G〉 can lead to large deviations of R̂S(G) from R(G); bounding ||G||∞ bounds |〈Lt,G〉|. 2) Later we will define ` in terms of the link function f and as the magnitude of 〈Lt,G〉 increases the magnitude of the derivative of the link function f typically becomes very small, making it difficult to “invert”; bounding ||G||∞ tends to keep 〈Lt,G〉 within an invertible regime of f .\nTheorem 1. Fix λ, γ and assume G? ∈ Gλ,γ . Let Ĝ be a solution to the program (4).

The proof follows from standard statistical learning theory techniques, see for instance [13].

By definition,\n{G : ‖G‖∗ ≤ λ} = λ · conv({uuT : |u| = 1}).\nwhere conv(U) is the convex hull of a set U . Since the Rademacher complexity of a set is the same as the Rademacher complexity of it’s closed convex hull,\nE sup G∈Gλ,γ ∣∣∣∣∣∑ t∈S t〈Lt,G〉 ∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ λE sup|u|=1 ∣∣∣∣∣∑ t∈S t〈Lt, uuT 〉 ∣∣∣∣∣ = λE sup|u|=1 ∣∣∣∣∣uT (∑ t∈S tLt ) u ∣∣∣∣∣ which we recognize is just λE‖ ∑ t∈S tLt‖. By [14, 6.6.1] we can bound the operator norm ‖ ∑ t∈S tLt‖\nin terms of the variance of ∑\nt∈S L 2 t and the maximal eigenvalue of maxtLt. These are computed in Lemma\n1 given in the supplemental materials. Combining these results gives,\n2Lλ |S| E‖ ∑ t∈S tLt‖ ≤ 2Lλ |S|\n(√ 18|S| log(n)\nn +\n√ 3\n3 log n\n) .\nWe remark that if G is a rank d < n matrix then\n‖G‖∗ ≤ √ d‖G‖F ≤ √ dn‖G‖∞\nso if G? is low rank, we really only need a bound on the infinity norm of our constraint set. Under the assumption that G? is rank d with ||G?||∞ ≤ γ and we set λ = √ dnγ, then Theorem 1 implies that for |S| > n log n/161\nR(Ĝ)−R(G?) ≤ 8Lγ\n√ 18dn log(n)\n|S| + Lγ\n√ 288 log 2/δ\n|S|\nwith probability at least 1− δ. The above display says that |S| must scale like dn log(n) which is consistent with known finite sample bounds [5]."

Let S be a collection of triplets sampled uniformly at random with replacement and let f : R → (0, 1) be a known probability function governing the observations.

      "text" : "In this section, let Ĝ be the maximum likelihood estimator; i.e., a solution to the optimization with LLipschitz log-likelihood loss function `f for a fixed λ, γ. We have shown that the maximum likelihood estimator allows us to bound ‖L(Ĝ)−L(G?)‖2F . In this section, we discuss how this bound can lead us to recover an embedding. For the analysis in this section, it will be convenient to work with distance matrices in addition to Gram matrices. Analogous to the operators Lt(G) defined above, we define the operators ∆t for t ∈ T satisfying,\n∆t(D) := Dij −Dik ≡ Lt(G) .\nWe will view the ∆t as linear operators on the space of symmetric hollow n× n matrices Snh, which includes distance matrices as special cases. As with L, we can arrange all the ∆t together, ordering the t ∈ T lexicographically, to define the n ( n−1 2 ) -dimensional vector\n∆(D) = [D12 −D13, · · · , Dij −Dik, · · · ]T .\nWe will use the fact that L(G) ≡ ∆(D) heavily. Because ∆(D) consists of differences of matrix entries, ∆ has a non-trivial kernel. However, it is easy to see that D can be recovered given ∆(D) and any one off-diagonal element of D, so the kernel is 1-dimensional. Also, the kernel is easy to identify by example. Consider the regular simplex in d dimensions. The distances between all n = d+ 1 vertices are equal and the distance matrix can easily be seen to be 11T − I. Thus ∆(D) = 0 in this case. This gives us the following simple result.\nLemma 2. Let Snh denote the space of symmetric hollow matrices, which includes all distance matrices. For any D ∈ Snh, the set of linear functionals {∆t(D), t ∈ T } spans an ( n 2 ) − 1 dimensional subspace of Snh, and the 1-dimensional kernel is given by the span of 11T − I .\nSo we see that the operator ∆ is not invertible on Snh. Define J := 11T − I . For any D, let C, the centered distance matrix, be the component of D orthogonal to the kernel of L (i.e., tr(CJ) = 0). Then we have the orthogonal decomposition\nD = C + σD J ,\nwhere σD = trace(DJ)/‖J‖2F . Since G is assumed to be centered, the value of σD has a simple interpretation:\nσD = 1 2 ( n 2 ) ∑ 1≤i≤j≤n Dij = 2 n− 1 ∑ 1≤i≤n 〈xi, xi〉 = 2‖G‖∗ n− 1 , (9)\nthe average of the squared distances or alternatively a scaled version of the nuclear norm of G. Let D̂ and Ĉ be the corresponding distance and centered distance matrices.\nNow following the notation of sections 2 and 3, assume that there is a true Gram matrix G? and a link function f as in section 3, and assume that we have observed a set of triples S. Though ∆ is not invertible on all Snh, it is invertible on the subspace orthogonal to the kernel, namely J\n⊥. So if L(Ĝ) = ∆(D̂) is close to L(G?) we expect ∆(Ĉ) to be close to ∆(C?). The next theorem quantifies this.\nTheorem 3. Consider the setting of Theorems 1 and 2 and let Ĉ,C? be defined as above. Then\n1 2 ( n 2 )‖Ĉ −C?‖2F ≤ Lλ4C2f |S| (√ 18|S| log(n) n + √ 3 3 log n ) + Lγ 4C2f √ 288 log 2/δ |S|\nProof. By combining Theorem 2 with the prediction error bounds obtainined in 1 we see that\n2C2f n ( n−1 2 )‖L(Ĝ)− L(G?)‖2F ≤ 4Lλ|S| (√ 18|S| log(n) n + √ 3 3 log n ) + Lγ √ 288 log 2/δ |S| .\nNext we employ the following restricted isometry property of ∆ on the subspace J⊥ whose proof is in the supplementary materials.\nLemma 3. Let D and D′ be two different distance matrices of n points in Rd and Rd′ . Let C and C ′ be the components of D and D′ orthogonal to J . Then\nn‖C −C ′‖2F ≤ ‖∆(C)−∆(C ′)‖2 = ‖∆(D)−∆(D′)‖2 ≤ 2(n− 1)‖C −C ′‖2F .\nThe result then follows.\nThis implies that by collecting enough samples, we can recover the centered distance matrix. By applying the discussion following Theorem 1 when G? is rank d, we can state an upperbound of 1\n2(n2) ‖Ĉ −C?‖2F ≤\nO ( Lγ C2f √ dn log(n)+log(1/δ) |S| ) . However, it is still not clear that this is enough to recover D? or G?.\nRemarkably, despite this unknown component being in the kernel, we show next that it can be recovered. Though ∆ is not invertible on Snh in general, we can provide a heuristic argument for why we might still expect it to be invertible on the (non-linear) space of low rank distance matrices. Since a distance matrix of n points in Rd is at most rank d+ 2, the space of all distance matrices has at most n(d+ 2) degrees of freedom. Now ∆ is a rank ( n 2 ) − 1 operator and since ( n 2 ) − 1 n(d + 2) for n > d + 2, it is not unreasonable to hope that the entries of ∆(D) provide enough information to parametrize the set of rank d+ 2 Euclidean distance matrices. In fact as the next theorem will show, the intuition that ∆ is invertible on the set of low rank distance matrices is in fact true. Perhaps even more surprisingly, merely knowing the centered distance matrix C uniquely determines D.\nTheorem 4. Let D be a distance matrix of n points in Rd, let C be the component of D orthogonal to the kernel of L, and let λ2(C) denote the second largest eigenvalue of C. If n > d+ 2, then\nD = C + λ2(C)J .\nThis shows that D is uniquely determined as a function of C. Therefore, since ∆(D) = ∆(C) and because C is orthogonal to the kernel of ∆, the distance matrix D can be recovered from ∆(D), even though the linear operator ∆ is non-invertible.\nWe now provide a proof of Theorem 4. In preparing this paper for publication we became aware of an alterntive proof of this theorem [15]. We nevertheless present our independently derived proof next for completeness.\nProof. To prove Theorem 4 we first state two simple lemmas, which are proved in the supplementary material.\nLemma 4. Let D be a Euclidean distance matrix on n points. Then D is negative semidefinite on the subspace\n1⊥ := {x ∈ Rn|1Tx = 0}.\nFurthermore, ker(D) ⊂ 1⊥.\nLemma 5. If D is an n × n distance matrix of rank r, then D has a single positive eigenvalue, n − r eigenvalues equal to 0, and r − 1 negative eigenvalues.\nWe will use the following notation. For any matrix M , let λi(M) denote its ith largest eigenvalue. We will show that for σ > 0 and any n× n distance matrix D with n > d+ 2,\nλ2(D − σJ) = σ .\nSince C = D − σDJ , this proves the theorem. Note that λi(D − σ11T + σI) = λi(D − σ11T ) + σ, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n and σ arbitrary. So it suffices to show that λ2(D − σ11T ) = 0. Let the rank of D be r where r ≤ d+ 2 and consider an eigendecomposition D = USUT where U is unitary. If v is an eigenvector of D − σ11T with eigenvalue λ, then\nDv − σ11Tv = λv ⇒ USUTv − σ1(UT1)TUTv = λv ⇒ SUTv − σUT1(UT1)TUTv = λUTv.\nSo UTv is an eigenvalue of S − σUT1(UT1)T with the same eigenvalue λ. Denoting z = UT1, we see that λi(D − σ11T ) = λi(S − σzzT ) for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n.\nBy a result on interlaced eigenvalues [16, Cor 4.3.9],\nλ1(S) ≥ λ1(S − σzzT ) ≥ λ2(S) ≥ λ2(S − σzzT ) ≥ · · · ≥ λn(S) ≥ λn(S − σzzT ).\nFrom the above inequality and using the fact that λ2(S) = 0 (since n > d+ 2), it is clear that S − σzzT has at least one positive eigenvalue. It is also clear that since σ > 0, each eigenvalue of S − σzzT is bounded above by an eigenvalue of S, so S − σzzt has at least r − 1 negative eigenvalues. Hence dim kerS − σzzT ≤ n− r.\nIf x ∈ kerD, then 1Tx = 0 by lemma 4. Thus x ∈ kerD − σ11T and so UTx ∈ kerS − σzzT . This implies that UT kerD ⊂ kerS − σzzT and dim kerS − σzzT ≥ n − r. However from the above, dim kerS − σzzT ≤ n− r. Hence we can conclude that λ2(S − σzzT ) = 0.\nThe previous theorem along with Theorem 3 guarantees that we can recover G? as we increase the number of triplets sampled. We summarize this in our final theorem, which follows directly from Theorems 3 and 4.\nTheorem 5. Assume n > d+ 2 and consider the setting of Theorems 1 and 2. As |S| → ∞, the maximum likelihood estimator\nĜ = −1 2 V (Ĉ + λ2(Ĉ)J)V\nconverges to G?."

In what follows each of the n points is generated randomly: xi ∼ N (0, 12dId) ∈ R\nd, i = 1, . . . , n, motivated by the observation that\nE[|〈Lt,G?〉|] = E [∣∣ ‖xi − xj‖22 − ||xi − xk||22 ∣∣] ≤ E[‖xi − xj‖22] = 2E[‖xi‖22] = 1\nfor any triplet t = (i, j, k). We perform 36 trials to see the effect of different random samples of triplets. We report the prediction error on a holdout set of 10, 000 triplets and the error in Frobenius norm of the estimated Gram matrix. Three algorithms are considered. For each, the domain of the objective variable G is the space of symmetric positive semi-definite matrices. None of the methods impose the constraint maxij |Gij | ≤ γ (as done in our theoretical analysis), since this was used to simplify the analysis and does not have a significant impact in practice. Rank-d Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) performs gradient descent on the objective R̂S(G) = 1|S| ∑ t∈S log(1 + exp(−yt〈Lt,G〉)) with line search, projecting onto the subspace spanned by the top d eigenvalues at each step (i.e. setting the bottom n − d eigenvalues to 0). Nuclear Norm PGD performs gradient descent on R̂S(G) projecting onto the nuclear norm ball with radius ‖G?‖∗, where G? = XTX is the Gram matrix of latent embedding. The nuclear norm projection can have the undesirable effect of shrinking the non-zero eigenvalues toward the origin. To compensate for this potential bias, we also employ Nuclear Norm PGD Debiased, which takes the (biased) output of Nuclear Norm PGD, decomposes it into UEUT where U ∈ Rn×d are the top d eigenvectors, and outputs Udiag(ŝ)UT where ŝ = arg mins∈Rd R̂S(Udiag(s)U\nT ). This last algorithm is motivated by the fact observation that heuristics like minimizing ‖ · ‖1 or ‖ · ‖∗ are good at identifying the true support or basis of a signal, but output biased magnitudes [18]. Rank-d PGD and Nuclear Norm PGD Debiased are novel ordinal embedding algorithms.\nFigure 1 presents how the algorithms behave in n = 64 and d = 2, 8 on the left and right, respectively. We observe that the unbiased nuclear norm solution behaves near-identically to the rank-d solution in this\ncase and remark that this was observed in all of our experiments (see the supplementary materials for a variety values of n, d, and scalings of G?). A popular technique for recovering rank d embeddings is to perform (stochastic) gradient descent on R̂S(UTU) with objective variable U ∈ Rn×d taken as the embedding [17, 4, 6]. In all of our experiments this method produced Gram matrices that were nearly identical to those produced by our Rank-d-PGD method, but Rank-d-PGD was an order of magnitude faster in our implementation. Also, in light of our isometry theorem, we can show that the Hessian of E[R̂S(G)] is nearly a scaled identity, which leads us to hypothesize that a globally optimal linear convergence result for this non-convex optimization may be possible using the techniques of [19, 20]. Finally, we note that previous literature has reported that nuclear norm optimizations like Nuclear Norm PGD tend to produce less accurate embeddings than those of non-convex methods [4, 6]. We see from the results that the Nuclear Norm PGD Debiased appears to close the performance gap between the convex and non-convex solutions."

One way of approaching such a result is showing\nc1‖D −D′‖2F ≤ ‖∆(D)−∆(D′)‖2 ≤ c2‖D −D′‖2F\nfor the tightest possible constants c1 and c2. By inspecting our proofs, we can provide satisfying values for c1 and c2, however, they differ by a factor of n and hence we do not believe these to be tight. Empirically we observe that if n d+ 2, then the ratio of c1 to c2 appears to be independent of n."

With respect to this basis ∆ is an n ( n−1 2 ) × ( n 2 ) matrix, which we will denote by ∆. Since C and C ′ are orthogonal to the kernel of ∆, the lemma follows immediately from the following characterization of the eigenvalues of ∆T∆.\nLemma 6. ∆T∆ : Snh → Snh has the following eigenvalues and eigenspaces,\n• Eigenvalue 0, with a one dimensional eigenspace.\n• Eigenvalue n, with a n− 1 dimensional eigenspace. • Eigenvalue 2(n− 1), with a ( n 2 ) − n dimensional eigenspace.\nProof. The rows of ∆ are indexed by triplets t ∈ T and columns indexed by pairs i, j with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and vice-versa for ∆T . The row of ∆T corresponding to the pair i, j is supported on columns corresponding to triplets t = (l,m, n) where m < n and l and one of m or n form the pair i, j or j, i. Specifically, letting [∆T ](i,j),t denote the entry of ∆T corresponding to row i, j and column t,\n• if l = i,m = j then [∆T ](i,j),t = 1\n• if l = i, n = j then [∆T ](i,j),t = −1\n• if l = j,m = i then [∆T ](i,j),t = 1\n• if l = j, n = i then [∆T ](i,j),t = −1\nUsing this one can easily check that\n[∆T∆D]i,j = ∑\n(i,j,k)∈T\nDij −Dik − ∑\n(i,k,j)∈T\nDik −Dij + ∑\n(j,i,k)∈T\nDji −Djk − ∑\n(j,k,i)∈T\nDjk −Dji\n= 2(n− 1)Dij − ∑ n6=i Din − ∑ n 6=j Djn.

This eigenspace corresponds to all symmetric hollow matrices such that D1 = 0. For such a matrix each row and column sum is zero and so in particular, the sums in (10) are both zero. Hence for such a D, [∆T∆D]i,j = 2(n− 1)Dij The dimension of this subspace is ( n 2 ) − n, indeed there are ( n 2 ) degree of freedom to choose the elements of D and D1 = 0 adds n constraints.

    "abstractText" : "The goal of ordinal embedding is to represent items as points in a low-dimensional Euclidean space given a set of constraints in the form of distance comparisons like “item i is closer to item j than item k”. Ordinal constraints like this often come from human judgments. To account for errors and variation in judgments, we consider the noisy situation in which the given constraints are independently corrupted by reversing the correct constraint with some probability. This paper makes several new contributions to this problem. First, we derive prediction error bounds for ordinal embedding with noise by exploiting the fact that the rank of a distance matrix of points in R is at most d+ 2. These bounds characterize how well a learned embedding predicts new comparative judgments. Second, we investigate the special case of a known noise model and study the Maximum Likelihood estimator. Third, knowledge of the noise model enables us to relate prediction errors to embedding accuracy. This relationship is highly non-trivial since we show that the linear map corresponding to distance comparisons is non-invertible, but there exists a nonlinear map that is invertible. Fourth, two new algorithms for ordinal embedding are proposed and evaluated in experiments.",
