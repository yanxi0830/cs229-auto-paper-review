      "text" : "In a probabilistic approach, inaccuracies are embedded in the stochastic nature of the model, particularly in the conditional probability density representing the measurement process. It is of vital importance that all types of inaccuracies affecting the measurements are incorporated in the probabilistic sensor model. Inaccuracies arise from sensor limitations, noise, and the fact that most complex environments can only be represented and perceived in a limited way. The dynamic nature of the environment in particular is an important source of inaccuracies. This dynamic nature results from the presence of unmodeled and possibly moving objects and people.\nThis paper proposes a probabilistic range finder sensor model for dynamic environments. Range finders, which are widely used in mobile robotics, measure the distances z to objects in the environment along certain directions θ relative to the sensor. We derive the sensor\nc©2008 AI Access Foundation.

The presented model is however useful in other applications of range sensors as well.\nFirst, this paper derives a probabilistic sensor model for one beam of a range finder, i.e. the beam model. In particular, this paper gives a rigorously Bayesian derivation using a Bayesian network model while stating all model assumptions and giving a physical interpretation for all model parameters. The obtained model is named RBBM, short for Rigorously Bayesian Beam Model. The innovations of the presented approach are (i) to introduce extra state variables A = a for the positions of unmodeled objects in the probabilistic sensor model P (z | x,m, a), and (ii) to marginalize out these extra state variables from the total probability before estimation. The latter is required because extra variables (exponentially!) increase the computational complexity of state estimation while in a lot of applications estimating the position of unmodeled objects is not of primary interest. In summary, the marginalization avoids the increase in complexity to infer the probability distributions P (x) and P (m), while maintaining the modeling of the dynamic nature of the environment.\nThis paper furthermore presents a maximum-likelihood and a variational Bayesian estimator (both based on expectation-maximization) to learn the model parameters of the RBBM.\nNext, the paper presents an extension of the RBBM to a full scan model i.e.: P (z | θ, x,m) where z and θ contain all the measured distances and beam angles, respectively. This full scan model accounts for the dependency between beams and adapts to the local sample density when using a particle filter. In contrast to Gaussian-based state of the art models, the proposed full scan model uses a sample-based approximation. The sample-based approximation allows us to capture the multi-modality of the full scan model, which is shown to occur even in simple static environments."

      "text" : "Three basic approaches to deal with dynamic environments exist in the literature (Fox, Burgard, & Thrun, 1999; Thrun et al., 2005): state augmentation, adapting the sensor model and outlier detection.\nIn state augmentation the latent states, e.g. the position of moving objects and people in the environment, are included in the estimated states. Wang, Thorpe, and Thrun (2003) developed an algorithm ‘SLAM with DATMO’, short for SLAM with the detection and tracking of moving objects. State augmentation however is often infeasible since the computational complexity of state estimation increases exponentially with the number of independent state variables to estimate. A closely related solution consists of adapting the map according to the changes in the environment. Since such approaches assume that the environment is almost static, they are unable to cope with real dynamics as in populated environments (Fox et al., 1999). A more recent, related approach proposed by Wolf and Sukhatme (2004) maintains two coupled occupancy grids of the environment, one for the static map and one for the moving objects, to account for environment dynamics.\nProbabilistic approaches are to some extent robust to unmodeled dynamics, since they are able to deal with sensor noise. In such approaches however, the sensor noise should reflect the real uncertainty due to the unmodeled dynamics of the environment. Therefore, a second approach for dealing with dynamic environments is to adapt the sensor model to correctly reflect situations in which measurements are affected by the unmodeled environment dynamics. Fox et al. (1999) show that such approaches are only capable to model such noise on average, and, while these approaches work reliably with occasional sensor blockage, they are inadequate in situations where more than fifty percent of the measurements are corrupted.\nTo handle measurement corruption more effectively, an approach based on outlier detection can be used. This approach uses an adapted sensor model, as explained in the previous paragraph. The idea is to investigate the cause of a sensor measurement and to reject measurements that are likely to be affected by unmodeled environment dynamics. Hähnel, Schulz, and Burgard (2003a) and Hähnel, Triebel, Burgard, and Thrun (2003b) studied the problem of performing SLAM in environments with many moving objects using the EM algorithm for filtering out affected measurements. By doing so, they were able to acquire maps in the environment where conventional SLAM techniques failed. Fox et al. (1999) propose two different kinds of filters: an entropy filter, suited for an arbitrary sensor, and a distance filter, designed for proximity sensors. These filters detect whether a measurement is corrupted or not, and discard sensor readings resulting from objects that are not contained in the map.\nThis paper focuses on (sonar and laser) range finders, whose physical principle is the emission of a sound or light wave, followed by the recording of its echo. Highly accurate sensor models would include physical parameters such as surface curvature and material absorption coefficient. These parameters are however difficult to estimate robustly in unstructured environments. Hence, the literature typically relies on purely basic geometric models.\nThe range finder sensor models available from the literature are traditionally divided in three main groups: feature-based approaches, beam-based models and correlation-based\nmethods. Feature-based approaches extract a set of features from the range scan and match them to features contained in an environmental model. Beam-based models, also known as ray cast models, consider each distance measurement along a beam as a separate range measurement. These models represent the one-dimensional distribution of the distance measurement by a parametric function, which depends on the expected range measurement in the respective beam directions. In addition, these models are closely linked to the geometry and the physics involved in the measurement process. They often result in overly peaked likelihood functions due to the underlying assumption of independent beams. The last group of range finder sensor models, correlation-based methods, build local maps from consecutive scans and correlate them with a global map. The simple and efficient likelihood field models or end point model (Thrun, 2001) are related to these correlation-based methods. Plagemann, Kersting, Pfaff, and Burgard (2007) nicely summarize the advantages and drawbacks of the different range finder sensor models.\nRange finder sensor models can also be classified according to whether they use discrete geometric grids (Hähnel et al., 2003a, 2003b; Fox et al., 1999; Burgard, Fox, Hennig, & Schmidt, 1996; Moravec, 1988) or continuous geometric models (Thrun et al., 2005; Choset, Lynch, Hutchinson, Kantor, Burgard, Kavraki, & Thrun, 2005; Pfaff, Burgard, & Fox, 2006). Moravec proposed non-Gaussian measurement densities over a discrete grid of possible distances measured by sonar; the likelihood of the measurements has to be computed for all possible positions of the mobile robot at a given time. Even simplified models (Burgard et al., 1996) in this approach turned out to be computationally too expensive for real-time application. Therefore, Fox et al. proposed a beam model consisting of a mixture of two physical causes for a measurement: a hit with an object in the map, or with an object not yet modeled in the map. The last cause accounts for the dynamic nature of the environment. An analogous mixture (Thrun et al., 2005; Choset et al., 2005) adds two more physical causes: a sensor failure and an unknown cause resulting in a ‘max-range’ measurement and a ‘random’ measurement, respectively. While Thrun et al. and Pfaff et al. use a continuous model, Choset et al. present the discrete analog of the mixture, taking into account the limited resolution of the range sensor. Pfaff et al. extend the basic mixture model for use in Monte Carlo localization. To overcome problems due to the combination of the limited representational power and the peaked likelihood of the accurate range finder, they propose an adaptive likelihood model. The likelihood model is smooth during global localization and more peaked during tracking.\nRecently, different researchers tried to tackle the problems associated with beam-based models, caused by the independence assumptions between beams. Plagemann et al. (2007) propose a sensor model for the full scan. The model treats the sensor modeling task as a non-parametric Bayesian regression problem, and solves it using Gaussian processes. It is claimed that the Gaussian beam processes combine the advantages of the beam-based and the correlation-based models. Due to the underlying assumption that the measurements are jointly Gaussian distributed, the Gaussian beam processes are not suited to take into account the non-Gaussian uncertainty due to the dynamic nature of the environment. An alternative approach to handle the overly-peaked likelihood functions resulting from the traditional beam models is proposed by Pfaff, Plagemann, and Burgard (2007). A locationdependent full scan model takes into account the approximation error of the sample-based representation, and explicitly models the correlations between individual beams introduced\nby the pose uncertainty. The measurements are assumed to be jointly Gaussian distributed just as Plagemann et al. proposed. While Plagemann et al. represent the covariance matrix as a parametrized covariance function using Gaussian processes whose parameters are learned from data, Pfaff et al. learn the full covariance matrix being less restrictive in this manner. Despite the modeled correlation between beams, the measurements are still assumed to be jointly Gaussian distributed, which again limits the applicability in dynamic environments.\nThis paper proposes a rigorously Bayesian modeling of the probabilistic range sensor beam model for dynamic environments, referred to as RBBM. Similar to the work of Thrun et al. (2005) and Pfaff et al. (2006) the sensor model is derived for a continuous geometry. Unlike previous models of Thrun et al. (2005), Pfaff et al. (2006), Fox et al. (1999) and Choset et al. (2005), the mixture components are founded on a Bayesian modeling. This modeling makes use of probabilistic graphical models, in this case Bayesian networks. Such graphical models provide a simple way to visualize the structure of a probabilistic model, and can be used to design and motivate new models (Bishop, 2006). By inspection of the graph, insights of the model, including conditional independence properties are obtained. Next, inspired by the adaptive full scan models in the literature (Pfaff et al., 2006, 2007; Plagemann et al., 2007), the RBBM is extended to an adaptive full scan model. The underlying sample-based approximation of the full scan model, in contrast to the Gaussianbased approximation proposed by Pfaff et al. (2007) and Plagemann et al., enables handling dynamic environments and capturing multi-modality, which occurs even in simple static environments."

      "text" : "Bayesian networks graphically represent probabilistic relationships between variables in a mathematical model, to structure and facilitate probabilistic inference computations with those variables (Jensen & Nielsen, 2007; Neapolitan, 2004). A Bayesian network is defined as follows: (i) a set of nodes, each with an associated random variable, connected by directed edges forming a directed acyclic graph (DAG); (ii) each discrete (continuous) random variable has a finite (infinite) set of mutually exclusive states; (iii) each random variable A with parents B1, . . . , BN has a conditional probability distribution P (A |B1, . . . , Bn) (known as conditional probability table in the case of discrete variables). Although the definition of Bayesian networks does not refer to causality, and there is no requirement that the directed edges represent causal impact, a well-known way of structuring variables for reasoning under uncertainty is to construct a graph representing causal relations (Jensen & Nielsen, 2007). In this case the graphical models are also known as generative models (Bishop, 2006), since they capture the causal process generating the random variables.\nIn this application, the range sensor ideally measures z⋆, the distance to the closest object in the map. An unknown number n of unmodeled objects, possibly preventing the measurement of the closest object in the map, are however present in the environment. Depending on the position of the jth unmodeled object along the measurement beam, xNj , the unmodeled object occludes the map or not. The unmodeled object only occludes the map if it is located in front of the closest object contained in the map. k is the total number of occluding objects out of the n unmodeled objects. The positions of these occluding objects on the measurement beam are denoted by {xKi}i=1:k. If the map is occluded by an unmodeled object, the range sensor will ideally measure z⋆occl = xKc, with xKc the position of the closest occluding object.\nThe following extra state variables, a in Eq. (1), are included in the Bayesian model: N is the discrete random variable indicating the unknown number of unmodeled objects in the environment; XNj is the continuous random variable for the position of the jth unmodeled object on the measurement beam; K is the discrete random variable indicating the number of objects occluding the measurement of the map; XKi is the continuous random variable for the position of the ith occluding object on the measurement beam; and Z⋆occl is the continuous random variable indicating the ideal range measurement of the closest occluding object. Fig. 1 shows the Bayesian network for the probabilistic range finder sensor model with the variables Z,X and M that occur in the probabilistic sensor model (defined in Section 1), all the extra variables N,XN = {XNj}j=1:n,K,XK = {XKi}i=1:k, Z ⋆ occl and the model parameters p and σm (defined in Section 3.2).\nThe directed edges in the graphical model represent causal relationships between the variables. For example, X and M unambiguously determine the measured range Z for a perfect sensor in the absence of unmodeled occluding objects. The number of occluding objectsK depends on the total number N of unmodeled objects and their positionsXN with respect to the measurement beam. X and M also have a causal impact on K: the larger the expected measurement z⋆, the higher the possibility that one or more unmodeled objects are occluding the modeled object corresponding to the expected measurement. The positions along the measurement beam XK of the occluding objects are equal to the positions of the K of N unmodeled objects occluding the map. Therefore, random variables XK are\nnot only influenced by K but also by XN . Since the K objects are occluding the map, their positions along the measurement beam are limited to the interval [0, z⋆], so XK has a causal dependency on X and M . The ideal measurement z⋆occl of an occluding object is the position of the occluding object closest to the sensor, so Z⋆occl depends on the positions XK of the occluding objects. Finally, measurement Z also depends on the ideal measurement of the occluding object Z⋆occl and the number of occluding objects K. In case of occlusion (k ≥ 1), z⋆occl is ideally measured, else (no occlusion, k = 0) z ⋆ is ideally measured."

      "text" : "Inferring the probability distribution of the extra state variables such as P (n) is often infeasible. Marginalization of the extra state variables Z,X,M,N,XN ,K,XK , Z ⋆ occl avoids the increase in complexity of the estimation problem, but still takes into account the dynamic nature of the environment. Marginalization requires the modelling of all conditional probability tables and conditional probability distributions (pdf) of each random variable conditionally on its parents.\nFirst of all, some assumptions have to be made for P (n). Assume that the probability of the number of unmodeled objects decreases exponentially, i.e. P (n) is given by:\nP (n) = (1− p) pn, (2)\nwith p a measure for the degree of appearance of unmodeled objects. More precisely, p is the probability that at least one unmodeled object is present. While p is indicated in Fig. 1, Fig. 2 shows the resulting distribution P (n).\nSecondly, assume that nothing is known a priori about the position of the unmodeled objects along the measurement beam. Hence each unmodeled object’s position is assumed to be uniformly distributed over the measurement beam (Fig. 3):\nP (xNj) =\n{ 1\nzmax if xNj ≤ zmax 0 otherwise, (3)\nwith zmax the maximum range of the range sensor. Thirdly, assume the positions of the unmodeled objects are independent :\nP (xN | n) = n∏\nj=1\nP (xNj) . (4)\nNext, an expression is needed for the conditional probability: P (k | n, xN , x,m), i.e. the probability that k of the n unmodeled objects are occluding the map m. An unmodeled object is occluding the map m if it is located along the measurement beam and in front of the closest object in the map. It is straightforward to show that P (k | n, xN , x,m) is a binomial distribution:\nP (k | n, xN , x,m) =\n \n\n(\nn\nk\n)\nuk (1− u)n−k if k ≤ n\n0 otherwise,\n(5)\nwhere u is the probability that an unmodeled object is occluding the map and\n( n\nk\n)\n=\nn! (n−k)!k! is the number of ways of selecting k objects out of a total of n objects. Fig. 4 shows\nthis binomial distribution. Since it was assumed that the positions of the unmodeled objects were uniformly distributed, u, the probability that an unmodeled object is occluding the map is:\nu = P (xNj < z ⋆) =\nz⋆\nzmax , (6)\nas depicted in Fig. 3.\nFurthermore, an analytical expression for P (xK | xN , k) is necessary. The positions of the occluding objects xK are equal to the positions of the unmodeled objects xN that are occluding the map, as shown in Fig. 5. In other words, xKi equals xNj if and only if the unmodeled object is occluding the map, i.e. if xNj ≤ z ⋆:\nP (xKi | xNj , k, x,m) =\n \n\n1 P(xNj≤z⋆) δ (xKi − xNj) = zmax z⋆ δ (xKi − xNj) if xNj ≤ z ⋆ 0 otherwise, (7)\nwith δ the Dirac function and xKi the occluding object corresponding to xNj .\nIn case of occlusion, the range sensor ideally measures the distance to the closest occluding object xKc:\nP (z⋆occl | xK) = δ (z ⋆ occl − xKc) . (8)\nWhile range finders are truly quite deterministic since the measurements are to a great extent explainable by underlying physical phenomena such as specular reflections, inference, ... these underlying phenomena are complex and therefore costly to model. On top of these underlying phenomena additional uncertainty on the measurement is due to (i) uncertainty in the sensor position, (ii) inaccuracies of the world model and (iii) inaccuracies of the sensor itself. So far only disturbances on the measurements due to unmodeled objects in the environment are included. To capture the additional uncertainty, additional measurement noise is added. After taking into account the disturbances by unmodeled objects, unexplainable measurements and sensor failures (Section 3.4), there is no physical reason to expect that the mean value of the true measurements deviates from the expected measurement and that the true measurements are distributed asymmetrically around the mean. Therefore\nsymmetrical noise with mean value zero is added. Two facts justify the modeling of the measurement noise as a normal distribution: (i) the normal distribution maximizes the information entropy among all distributions with known mean and variance, making it the natural choice of underlying distribution for data summarized in terms of sample mean and variance; and (ii) if the underlying phenomena are assumed to have a small, independent effect on the measurement, the central limit theorem states that under certain conditions (such as being independent and identically distributed with finite variance), the sum of a large number of random variables is approximately normally distributed. If the measurement noise is modeled by a zero mean Gaussian with standard deviation σm, the conditional probability P (z | x,m, z⋆occl, k) is:\nP (z | x,m, z⋆occl, k) =\n{\nN (z; z⋆, σm) if k = 0 N (z; z⋆occl, σm) if k ≥ 1, (9)\nwhere the conditional probability P (z | x,m, z⋆occl, k) has two main cases, the first for k = 0 where no occlusion is present and the sensor is observing the map m, and the second case for k ≥ 1 where the sensor observes an occluding object. σm is included in the Bayesian network of Fig. 1."

Since all occluding objects are considered independent:\nP (xK | n, k, x,m) =\n{( 1 z⋆ )k if ∀ 0 ≤ i ≤ k : xKi ≤ z ⋆\n0 otherwise. (16)\nThis equation shows that P (xK | n, k, x,m) is independent of n and thus can be moved out of the summation over n in Eq.

(23)\nThis equation shows that the conditional probability P (z⋆occl | k, x,m) represents the probability that the perfect measurement of the nearest occluding object is z⋆occl, i.e. the probability that the nearest occluding object is located at z⋆occl. This is only the case when one of the k objects along the measurement beam is located such that z⋆occl is measured, while all other objects along the measurement beam are located behind the occluding object, or expressed in probabilities:\nP (z⋆occl | k, x,m) = k∑\ni=1\nP (xK 6=i ≥ z ⋆ occl | k, x,m)P (xKi = z ⋆ occl | k, x,m) .

The second term is an integration over all possible positions of the occluding object of a scaled Gaussian distribution centered at the ideal measurement of the occluding object (z⋆occl). The scaling factor represents the probability that the occluding objects are located such that z⋆occl is measured. From Eq. (20) and Eq. (32) it follows that the scaling factor can be written as:\nα (z⋆occl | x,m) = p (1− p)\nzmax\n[ 1− ( 1− z⋆ occl\nzmax\n) p ]2 , (35)\nwhich is independent of z⋆. Until now, no approximations where made to obtain Eq. (34) for the beam model P (z | x,m). The integral over the scaled Gaussian distributions however, cannot be obtained analytically. Therefore, a first approximation in the marginalization is made by neglecting the noise on the range measurement in case of occlusion, i.e.: N (z; z⋆occl, σm) ≈ δ (z − z⋆occl). Using this approximation the second term in the right hand side of Eq. (34) becomes:\np′ (1− p′)\nz⋆ [ 1− z\n⋆−z z⋆\np′ ]2 =\np (1− p)\nzmax\n[ 1− (\n1− z zmax\n) p ]2 .

      "text" : "The following paragraphs give some insights in the RBBM and its derivation. The mixture representation (45) shows the four possible causes of a range measurement: a hit with the map, a hit with an unmodeled object, an unknown cause resulting in a random measurement and a sensor failure resulting in a maximum reading measurement.\nThe derivation of Section 3.3 shows that the position of each of the occluding objects is uniformly distributed between the sensor and the ideally measured object in the environment (Eq. (15), Fig. 6). This is perfectly reasonable considering the assumption of uniformly distributed unmodeled objects.\nFurthermore, some insights are provided concerning α (z⋆occl | x,m) (Eq. (35), Fig. 7), the probability that the occluding objects are located such that z⋆occl is measured. First of all, this probability is independent of the location of the ideally measured object in the environment (z⋆) (except that this probability is zero for z > z⋆). This agrees with intuition, since one expects the measurements caused by the occluding objects to be independent of z⋆, the measurement in the case of no occlusion. Second, the probability of sensing unmodeled objects decreases with the range, as expected. This is easily explained with the following thought experiment: if two objects are present with the same likelihood in the perception field of the range finder, and the first object is closest to the range sensor, then the sensor is more likely to measure the first object. To measure the second object, the second object\nshould be present and the first object should be absent (Thrun et al., 2005). Moreover, the rate of decrease of the likelihood of sensing unmodeled objects is only dependent on p, the degree of appearance of unmodeled objects.\nThe probability of measuring a feature of the map, and therefore the integral under the scaled Gaussian (1−p′)Phit (z | x,m) (45), decreases with the expected range. This is easily explained since the probability that the map is not occluded decreases when the feature is located further away.\nFinally, the discontinuity of the RBBM (Fig. 8) was shown to be caused by the only approximation made (Section 3.5). Since the state of the art range sensors are very accurate, neglecting the measurement noise on the measurement of an occluding object is an acceptable approximation. This is also shown by the experiments presented in Section 5.\nWith respect to the state of the art beam model of Thrun et al. (2005), the model proposed here, Eq. (45), has: (i) a different functional form for the probability of range measurements caused by unmodeled objects, (ii) an intuitive explanation for the discontinuity encountered in the cited paper, and (iii) a reduction in the number of model parameters. Thrun et al. find that Poccl (z | x,m) has an exponential distribution. This exponential distribution results from the following underlying assumptions (although not revealed by the authors): (i) the unmodeled objects are equally distributed in the environment and (ii) a beam is reflected with a constant probability at any range. The last assumption equals assuming that the probability that an unmodeled object is located at a certain distance is constant. This assumption fails to capture that the number of unmodeled object is finite and that it is more probable to have a limited number of unmodeled objects than a huge number of them. While we also assume that unmodeled objects are equally distributed in the environment (Eq. (3)), we assume that the number of unmodeled objects is geometrically distributed (Eq. (2)) capturing the finiteness of the number of unmodeled objects and the higher probability of a smaller number of unmodeled objects. The modeling of the finiteness of the number of unmodeled objects and the higher probability of a smaller number of unmodeled objects results in a quadratic decay of Poccl (z | x,m), instead of the exponential decay of Poccl (z | x,m) found by Thrun et al..\nAs stated in the previous paragraph, the discontinuity of the RBBM (Fig. 8) is caused by an approximation. While Thrun’s model considers the rate of decay of Poccl (z | x,m) to be independent of π2, the probability of an occlusion, it is shown here that they both depend on the same parameter p′ (Eq. (42), Eq. (47)). Therefore the RBBM has fewer parameters than Thrun’s model."

However, another, more flexible way is to learn the model parameters from actual data containing J measurements Z = {zι}ι=1:J with corresponding states X = {xι}ι=1:J and map m. Furthermore, learning the model parameters is also a validation for the proposed analytical model: if the learning algorithm succeeds in finding model parameters such that the resulting distribution gives a good explanation of the data, the analytical model is likely to agree well with reality.\nIn this paper two different estimators3, a maximum likelihood (ML) (Dempster, Laird, & Rubin, 1977; McLachlan & Krishnan, 1997; Bishop, 2006) and a variational Bayesian (VB) (Beal & Ghahramani, 2003; Bishop, 2006) estimator, are presented to learn the model parameters from data. Section 4.1 derives a maximum likelihood estimator, which is a known approach for this problem, but reformulated for the RBBM. This ML estimator only provides point estimates of the parameters and leads to overfitting since the likelihood function is generally higher for more complex model structures. Therefore, we propose a variational Bayesian (VB) estimator in Section 4.2, which is a new approach for learning the parameters for beam models. The VB estimator is a fully Bayesian learning approach; priors over the unknown parameters are included, complex (overfitting) models are punished, and a full probability distribution over the parameters is obtained.\n3.

(45)), the estimation problem can be formulated as finding the ML estimates for the parameters Θ′ = [σm,π] provided that the constraint in Eq. (49) is included. In general it is not known which of the four possible causes actually caused each of the measurements. In that case the ML estimation problem is difficult and lacks a closed-form solution. If however, the corresponding causes of each of the measurements are known, the solution is easily obtained in closed form. Therefore, introduce a latent correspondence variable d = [d1, d2, d3, d4], representing the unknown cause, using a 1-of-S representation. The elements ds of d give the probability that the measurement is a result of the s’th cause. The graphical representation of the mixture formulation including the latent correspondence d variable is shown in Fig. 10. Although the ML estimation problem lacks a closed-form solution due to the unknown correspondences, an expectation-maximization approach (EM) can solve the problem by iterating an expectation and a maximization step.

      "text" : "The ML estimator only provides point estimates of the parameters and is sensitive to overfitting (Bishop, 2006). Therefore, we propose a variational Bayesian (VB) estimator, which is a new approach for learning the parameters for beam models. The VB estimator is a fully Bayesian learning approach; priors over the unknown parameters are included, complex (overfitting) models are punished, and a full probability distribution over the parameters is obtained. The VB estimator has only a little computational overhead as compared to the ML estimator (Bishop, 2006).\nThe Bayesian approach attempts to integrate over the possible values of all uncertain quantities rather than optimize them as in the ML approach (Beal, 2003; Beal & Ghahramani, 2003). The quantity that results from integrating out both the latent variables and the\nparameters is known as the marginal likelihood4: P (Z) = ∫ P (Z |D,Θ)P (D,Θ) d(D,Θ), where P (D,Θ) is a prior over the latent variables and the parameters of the model. Integrating out the parameters penalizes models with more degrees of freedom, since these models can a priori model a larger range of data sets. This property of Bayesian integrations is known as Occam’s razor, since it favors simpler explanations for the data over complex ones (Jeffreys & Berger, 1992; Rasmussen & Ghahramani, 2000).\nUnfortunately, computing the marginal likelihood, P (Z), is intractable for almost all models of interest. The variational Bayesian method constructs a lower bound on the marginal likelihood, and attempts to optimize this bound using an iterative scheme that has intriguing similarities to the standard EM algorithm. To emphasize the similarity with ML-EM, the algorithm based on variational Bayesian inference is further on called VB-EM.\nBy introducing the distribution Q over the latent variables the complete log marginal likelihood can be decomposed as (Bishop, 2006):\nlogP (Z) = L (Q) +KL (Q||P ) , (67)\nwhere\nL (Q) =\n∫\nQ (D, Θ) log\n( P (Z,D, Θ)\nQ (D, Θ)\n)\nd (D, Θ) , (68)\nand KL (Q||P ) is the KL-divergence between Q and P . Since this KL-divergence is always greater or equal than zero, L (Q) is a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood. Maximizing this lower bound with respect to the distribution Q (D,Θ) is equivalent to minimizing the KL-divergence. If any possible choice for Q (D,Θ) is allowed, the maximum of the lower bound would occur when the KL-divergence vanishes, i.e. when Q (D,Θ) is equal to the posterior distribution P (D,Θ | Z). Working with the true posterior distribution is however often intractable in practice. One possible approximate treatment considers only a restricted family of distributions Q (D,Θ) and seeks the member of this family minimizing the KL-divergence. The variational Bayesian treatment uses a factorized approximation, in this case between the latent variables D and the parameter Θ:\nQ (D,Θ) = QD(D)QΘ (Θ) . (69)\nThe variational approach makes a free form (variational) optimization of L (Q) with respect to the distributions QD(D) and QΘ (Θ), by optimizing with respect to each of the factors in turn. The general expressions for the optimal factors are (Bishop, 2006):\nlogQ⋆D(D) = EΘ [logP (Z,D, Θ)] + C te, and (70)\nlogQ⋆Θ (Θ) = ED [logP (Z,D, Θ)] + C te, (71)\nwhere ⋆ indicates the optimality. These expressions give no explicit solution for the factors, because the optimal distribution for one of the factors depends on the expectation computed with respect to the other factor. Therefore an iterative procedure, similar to EM, that cycles through the factors and replaces each in turn with a revised optimal estimate is used.\n4. To avoid overloading the notation the conditioning on the map m and the positions X = {xι} associated with the data Z = {zι} is not explicitly written.\nIntroducing priors Since the variational Bayesian approach is a fully Bayesian approach, priors have to be introduced over the parameters Θ′′ = [µ, σm,π]. Remark that in the variational Bayesian estimator not only the standard deviation σm governing Phit (z | x,m) (Eq. (41)) is estimated but also the means, referred to as µ further on. Since the analysis is considerably simplified if conjugate prior distributions are used, a Dirichlet prior is chosen for the mixing coefficients π:\nP (π) = Dir (π|α0) , (72)\nas well as an independent Gaussian-Wishart prior5 for the mean µ and the precision λm = σ−1m of the Gaussian distribution Phit (z | x,m) (Eq. (41)):\nP (µ, λm) = N ( µ|µ̄, (βλm) − ) W (λm|W, ν) . (73)\nα0 gives the effective prior number of observations associated with each component of the mixture. Therefore, if the value of α0 is set small, the posterior distribution will be mainly influenced by the data rather than by the prior.\nExpectation step Using these conjugate priors, it can be shown that the factor Q⋆ D (D) can be written as:\nQ⋆D(D) = J∏\nι=1\nrdι1ι1 r dι2 ι2 r dι3 ι3 r dι4 ι4 , (74)\nwhere the quantities rιs are responsibilities analogous to the γιs of Eq.

(79)\nThe above equations can be rewritten as:\nlog ρι1 = E [log π1] + \n E [log |λm|]−\n  log (π)−   Eµ,λm\n[\n(zι − µ) T λ (zι − µ)\n]\n, (80)\nlog ρι2 = E [log π2] + logPoccl (zι | xι,m) , (81)\nlog ρι3 = E [log π3] + logPrand (zι | xι,m) , and (82)\nlog ρι4 = E [log π4] + logPmax (zι | xι,m) , (83)\n5.

Due to the similarity with the E-step of the EM-algorithm, the step of calculating the responsibilities in the variational Bayesian inference is known as the variational E-step.\nMaximization step In accordance with the graphical representation in Fig. 10, it can be shown that the variational posterior QΘ (Θ) factorizes as Q (π)Q (µ1, σm) and that the first optimal factor is given by a Dirichlet distribution:\nQ⋆ (π) = Dir (π|α) , (90)\nwith\nαs = α0 + Js. (91)\nThe second optimal factor is given by a Gaussian-Wishart distribution:\nQ⋆ (µ1, λm) = N ( µ|µ̄, (βλm) − ) W (λm|W, ν) , (92)\nwith\nβ = β0 + J1, (93) µ̄ = 1\nβ (β0µ̄0 + J1z̄1) , (94)\nW−1 = W−10 + J1C1 + β0J1\nβ0 + J1 (z̄1 − µ̄0) (z̄1 − µ̄0)\nT , and (95)\nν = ν0 + J1.

The variational M-step computes a distribution over the parameters (in the conjugate family) rather than a point estimate as in the case of the maximum likelihood estimator. This distribution over the parameters allows us to calculate a predictive density P (z | Z).\nDue to the use of conjugate priors, the integrals in the predictive density can be calculated analytically:\nP (z |Z) = α1St\n( z|µ̄, νβ1+βW, ν ) + α2Poccl (z | x,m) + α3Prand (z | x,m) + α4Pmax (z | x,m)\nα1 + α2 + α3 ,\n(97) where St (.) is a Student’s t-distribution.

A Sick LMS 200 laser scanner is mounted on the first axis of an industrial Kuka 361 robot (Fig. 13). The laser scanner provides measurements of the robot environment and therefore of people and other unexpected objects in the robot’s workspace. Processing these measurements is a first step towards making industrial robots aware of their possibly changing environment and as such of moving these robots out of their cages.\nIn a first step, a map (Fig. 14) is build of the robot’s static environment, i.e. without any unexpected objects or people moving around, by rotating the first axis of the industrial robot. Next, the robot performs a pick-and-place operation while a number of people are walking around at random in the robot environment. Different sets of measurements are acquired each with a different number of people. Similar to the first learning experiment, measurements are selected centered around different expected ranges from the acquired data. The studied expected ranges in the second learning experiment range from 3.0m to 4.5m in steps of 0.1m (Fig. 14). For safety reasons, people were not allowed to move closer than 1m to the robot, i.e. the safety region (Fig. 14). Therefore, measurements smaller than 1m are discarded.\nFrom the data, the model parameters are learning using the same learning parameters as in the first learning experiment (Table. 1).\nTable 3 shows the Kullback Leibler divergence (Eq.

      "heading" : "6. Adaptive Full Scan Model",
      "text" : "This section extends the RBBM to an adaptive full scan model for dynamic environments; adaptive, since it automatically adapts to the local density of samples when using samplebased representations; full scan, since the model takes into account the dependencies between individual beams.\nIn many applications using a range finder, the posterior is approximated by a finite set of samples (histogram filter, particle filters). The peaked likelihood function associated with a range finder (small σm due to its accuracy) is problematic when using such finite set of samples. The likelihood P (z | x,m) is evaluated at all samples, which are approximately distributed according to the posterior estimate. Basic sensor models typically assume that the estimate x and the map m are known exactly, that is, they assume that one of the samples corresponds to the true value. This assumption, however, is only valid in the limit of infinitely many samples. Otherwise, the probability that a value exactly corresponds to the true location is virtually zero. As a consequence, these peaked likelihood functions do not adequately model the uncertainty due to the finite, sample-based representation of the posterior (Pfaff et al., 2007). Furthermore, the use of a basic range finder model typically results in even more peaked likelihood models, especially when using a large number of beams per measurement, due to multiplication of probabilities. In practice, the problem\nof peaked likelihoods, is dealt with in various ways: sub-sampling the measurement (fewer beams); introducing minimal likelihoods for beams; inflating the measurement uncertainty; or other means of regularization of the resulting likelihoods. These solutions are not satisfactory however, since the additional uncertainty due to the sample-based representation is not known in advance. The additional uncertainty strongly varies with the number of samples and the uncertainty of the estimate (Pfaff et al., 2006). Fox (2003) proposes to dynamically adapt the number of samples by means of KLD sampling (KLD stands for Kullback-Leibler divergence). For very peaked likelihoods however, this might result in a huge number of samples. Lenser and Veloso (2000) and Thrun, Fox, Burgard, and Dellaert (2001) ensure that a critical mass of samples is located at the important parts of the state space by sampling from the observation model. Sampling from the observation model however, is often only possible in an approximate and inaccurate way. Pfaff et al. (2006) introduced an adaptive beam model for dynamic environments, which explicitly takes location uncertainty due to the sample-based representation into account. They compute the additional uncertainty due to the sample-based representation, using techniques from density estimation. When evaluating the likelihood function at a sample, they consider a certain region around the sample, depending on the sample density at that location. Then, depending on the area covered by the sample, the variance of the Gaussian, σm, governing the beam model in Eq. (38), is calculated for each sample. As a result, the beam model automatically adapts to the local density of samples. Such a location dependent model results in a smooth likelihood function during global localization and a more peaked function during position tracking without changing the number of samples.\nPlagemann et al. (2007) and Pfaff et al. (2007) showed that by considering a region around samples, the individual beams become statistically dependent. The degree of dependency depends on the geometry of the environment and on the size and location of the considered region. Beam models, such as the RBBM, implicitly assume however that the beams are independent, that is:\nP (z | θ, x,m) = B∏\nb=1\nP (zb | θb, x,m) , (104)\nwhere z = {zb}b=1:B and θ = {θb}b=1:B are the vectors containing the measured ranges and the angles of the different beams respectively; zb is the range measured at the beam with angle θb; B is the total number of beams and P (zb | θb, x,m) is for instance the RBBM (Eq. (45)). By neglecting the dependency between beams, the resulting likelihoods P (z | θ, x,m) are overly peaked. Models taking into account the dependencies between beams consider the full range scan and are therefore called full scan models further on. The full scan models proposed by Plagemann et al. (2007) and Pfaff et al. (2007) both assume that the beams of a range scan are jointly Gaussian distributed. The off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix associated with the Gaussian distribution represent the dependency. To learn the model parameters, both methods draw samples from the region around a sample and perform ray-casting using these samples. Plagemann et al. train a Gaussian process which models the full scan, while Pfaff et al. directly provide a maximum likelihood estimate for the mean and covariance of the Gaussian.\nSection 6.1 shows that the dependency between beams may introduce multi-modality, even for simple static environments. Multi-variate Gaussian models as proposed by Plage-\nmann et al. (2007) and Pfaff et al. (2007) cannot handle this multi-modality. Therefore, a new sample-based method for obtaining an adaptive full scan model from a beam model, able to handle multi-modality, is proposed. Section 6.2 extends the adaptive full scan model for dynamic environments by taking into account non-Gaussian model uncertainty."

The environment U (x) is modeled as a circular region around x. Since this section does not consider the dynamics of the environment, only one component of the RBBM in Eq.

The marginalization over the environment U (x) in Eq.(105) introduces dependencies between the measurements zb of the measurement vector z.\nThe environment U (x), as explained above, depends on the sample density around the sample x under consideration. Pfaff et al. (2006) proposed to use a circular region with diameter dU(x), which is a weighted sum of the Euclidean distance and the angular difference. Like Plagemann et al. (2007) and Pfaff et al. (2007), an approximation of the above likelihood can be estimated online for each sample x by simulating L complete range scans at locations drawn from U (x) using the given map m of the environment.

The U (x) results from a local uncertainty on the x- and y−position of 0.01m and a rotational uncertainty of 5◦.

      "text" : "This paper proposed and experimentally validated the RBBM, a rigorously Bayesian network model of a range finder adapted to dynamic environments. All modeling assumptions are rigorously explained, and all model parameters have a physical interpretation. This approach resulted in a transparent and intuitive model. The rigorous modeling revealed all underlying assumptions and parameters. This way a clear physical interpretation of all parameters is obtained providing intuition for the parameter choices. In contrast to the model of Thrun et al. (2005), the assumption underlying the non-physical discontinuity in the RBBM is discovered. Furthermore, the paper proposes a different functional form for the probability of range measurements caused by unmodeled objects Poccl (z | x,m) (Eq. (45)), i.e. quadratic rather than exponential as proposed by Thrun et al. Furthermore, compared to the work of Thrun et al. (2005), Choset et al. (2005), Pfaff et al. (2006) the RBBM depends on fewer parameters, while maintaining the same representational power for experimental data. Bayesian modeling revealed that both the rate of decay of Poccl (z | x,m) and\nthe probability of an occluded measurement π2 depend on one parameter p ′. State of the art sensor models however, assume independency of these two parameters. Finally, a maximumlikelihood and a variational Bayesian estimator (both based on expectation-maximization) were proposed to learn the model parameters of the RBBM. Learning the model parameters from experimental data benefits from the RBBM’s reduced number of parameters. Using two sets of learning experiments from different application areas in robotics (one reported by Thrun et al. (2005)) the RBBM was shown to explain the obtained measurements at least as well as the state of the art model of Thrun et al.\nFurthermore, the paper extended the RBBM to an adaptive full scan model in two steps: first, to a full scan model for static environments and next, to a full scan model for general, dynamic environments. The full scan model adapts to the local sample density when using a particle filter, and accounts for the dependency between beams. In contrast to the Gaussian-based state of the art models of Plagemann et al. (2007) and Pfaff et al. (2007), the proposed full scan model uses a sample-based approximation, which can cope with dynamic environments and with multi-modality (which was shown to occur even in simple static environments)."

The probability of measuring a feature of the map, and therefore the integral under the scaled Gaussian (1−p)Phit (z | x,m) (45), decreases with the expected range. This is easily explained since the probability that the map is not occluded decreases when the feature is located further away. Finally, the discontinuity of the RBBM (Fig. 8) was shown to be caused by the only approximation made (Section 3.5). Since the state of the art range sensors are very accurate, neglecting the measurement noise on the measurement of an occluding object is an acceptable approximation.

    "abstractText" : "This paper proposes and experimentally validates a Bayesian network model of a range finder adapted to dynamic environments. All modeling assumptions are rigorously explained, and all model parameters have a physical interpretation. This approach results in a transparent and intuitive model. With respect to the state of the art beam model this paper: (i) proposes a different functional form for the probability of range measurements caused by unmodeled objects, (ii) intuitively explains the discontinuity encountered in the state of the art beam model, and (iii) reduces the number of model parameters, while maintaining the same representational power for experimental data. The proposed beam model is called RBBM, short for Rigorously Bayesian Beam Model. A maximum likelihood and a variational Bayesian estimator (both based on expectation-maximization) are proposed to learn the model parameters. Furthermore, the RBBM is extended to a full scan model in two steps: first, to a full scan model for static environments and next, to a full scan model for general, dynamic environments. The full scan model accounts for the dependency between beams and adapts to the local sample density when using a particle filter. In contrast to Gaussian-based state of the art models, the proposed full scan model uses a sample-based approximation. This sample-based approximation enables handling dynamic environments and capturing multimodality, which occurs even in simple static environments.",
