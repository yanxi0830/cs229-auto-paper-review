      "text" : "Lemma 1. Let φ : XG → X be a fundamental cross section with basepoint w. Then γ ◦ φ is a fundamental cross section with basepoint γw for all γ ∈ G.\nProof. From the axioms of a group action follows that γ is bijective. A cross section φ is injective by definition. Then the composition φ′ = γ ◦ φ is also injective. We show that W ·X = φ′(W )Tφ′(X). We have\nφ′(W )Tφ′(X) = γwTγx,\nwhere w = φ(W ) and x = φ(X). Since G is a permutation group, the mapping γ is orthogonal. As an orthogonal mapping, γ preserves the inner product, that is γwT γx = wTx. Since φ is a fundamental cross section with basepoint w, we have\nW ·X = φ(W )T φ(X) = wTx = γwTγx = φ′(W )Tφ′(X).\nNote that this part also shows that the φ′ is a cross section with basepoint γw. Finally, we show that π ◦ φ′(X) = X for all X ∈ XG . Since φ is a fundamental cross section, the vector x = φ(X) projects to X via π. The graph X can be regarded as the orbit [x] of x. As an element of [x] the vector γx also projects to X via π. This shows π ◦ φ′(X) = X . ⊓⊔\nLemma 2. Let φ : XG → X be a fundamental cross section with basepoint w and Dirichlet domain Dw. Then w is an interior point of Dw if and only if W = π(w) is regular.\nProof. Let w be an interior point of Dw. We assume that W is not regular. Then there is a γ ∈ G \\ {id} such that w = γw. According to Lemma 1, the composition φ′ = γ ◦ φ is a fundamental cross section with basepoint γw and Dirichlet domain γDw = Dγw. From w = γw follows that\nD = intDw ∩ int γDw 6= ∅,\nwhere intS denotes the interior of a set S ⊆ X . As an intersection of open convex sets, the setD is also open and convex. Then there are n+1 points x0, . . . ,xn ∈ D\nin general position, where n = dim(X ). By definition of a Dirichlet domain, we have\nw T xi = w Tγxi\nfor all i ∈ {0, . . . , n}. This implies xi = γxi, because cross sections are injective. Observe that G acts isometrically on X . Since two isometries are the same if they coincide on n+ 1 points in general position, we obtain γ = id. This contradicts our assumption that there is a γ 6= id such that w = γw. Hence, W is regular.\nNow we assume that W is regular and show that there is a representation w of W such that w ∈ intDw. The boundary of Dw is of the form\nbdDw = ⋃\nγ∈G\\{id}\nDw ∩ γDw.\nSince W is regular, γw 6= w for all γ ∈ G \\ {id}\nSuppose that w̃ 6= w is another representation of W with Dirichlet domain Dw̃. The bisection of Dw and Dw̃ is defined by the set\nH(w, w̃) = { x ∈ D : wTx = w̃Tx } ,\nwhere D = Dw ∩ Dw̃. Since w and w̃ are unequal, H(w,w ′) is a subset of a hyperplane H defined by the equation h(x) = (w− w̃)Tx. The hyperplane H is perpendicular to the vector v = w − w̃ and passes through the midpoint of the connecting line between w and w̃. This shows that w is not a point on H(w, w̃). Since w̃ was chosen arbitrarily, w is in the interior of Dw. ⊓⊔\nLemma 3. Let W ∈ XG be regular. Suppose that φ is a fundamental cross section with basepoint w and Dirichlet domain Dw. Then −w /∈ Dw.\nProof. Observe that w 6= 0 and w 6= −w for all representations w of a regular graph W . In addition, with W the graph W ′ = π(−w) is also regular. As shown in [1], we have\nW ·W = max γ∈G\nγwTw = wTw. (1)\nLet W ′ be the graph represented by −w. From eq. (1) follows\n−wTw = −min γ γwTw < max γ −wTw = W ′ ·W (2)\nStrict inequality in eq. (2) follows from regularity of W and W ′ together with w 6= −w. Thus, −w is not an element of the Dirichlet domainDw with basepoint w. ⊓⊔\nProof of Theorem 1\nSuppose that each graph X ∈ XG has a class label y ∈ Y = {±1}. By C[f ] we denote the expected misclassification error of the sublinear function f . Consider a sublinear function of the form f(X) = W · X + b, where W is regular and b 6= 0. The equation f(X) = 0 defines a decision surface Hf that separates the graph space XG into two disjoint regions R+(f) and R−(f). By construction we have C[f ] = 0.\nLet φ be a fundamental cross section with basepoint w = φ(W ) and Dirichlet domain Dw. By D+(f) = φ(R+(f)) and D−(f) = φ(R−(f)) we denote the images of both class regions R+(f) and R−(f) in Dw. The hyperplane separating D+(f) and D−(f) is defined by the equation h(x) = wTx+ b = 0. By construction, the expected misclassification error of h(x) is CX [h] = 0. In addition, h(x) is the unique global minimum of CX [·] over all linear functions.\nNow we relabel both class regions R+(f) and R−(f) such that all graphs from the positive class region R+(f) have negative labels and all graphs from the negative class region R−(f) have positive labels. We denote the relabeled regions in XG by R+(f) and R−(f), resp., and similarly the relabeled regions in Dw by D+(f) and D−(f). For the relabeled variant, the linear classifier in Dw determined by h′(x) = −wTx + b has also minimal misclassification error CX [h\n′] = 0 and is the unique minimizer of CX [·]. By Lemma 3 the opposite direction −w of basepoint w is not an element of the Dirichlet domain Dw.\nSuppose that f ′(X) = W ′ ·X + b′ is a sublinear function such that\nC[f ′] = min g C[g]\nunder the relabeled setting with class regionsR+(f) andR−(f). Let w′ = φ(W ′) be a representation of W ′ in Dw and let φ′ be a fundamental cross section with basepoint w′ = φ′(W ′) and Dirichlet domain Dw′ . We consider the intersection D = Dw ∩ Dw′ . According to [3], Theorem 12, the intersection of two convex polyhedral cones is again a convex polyhedral cone. We show that D has codimension 0. For this, we first show that the relative interior of the intersection D contains an inner point z from Dw. Since W is regular, w is an inner point of Dw lying in D. Two cases can occur: (i) w is in the relative interior of D; and (ii) w lies on the boundary of D. If (i) holds, we set z = w. Suppose that (ii) holds. Since w and w′ are distinct elements of the intersection D, any point z = λw+(1−λ)w′ with 0 < λ < 1 lies in the relative interior of D by convexity.\nNext we show that there is an ε > 0 such that the open ball B(z, ε) with center z and radius ε is contained in D. We choose ε < min(λ, 1 − λ). Then B(z, ε) ⊂ Dw, because z is an interior point of Dw. Suppose that B(z, ε) is not contained in D. Since z lies in the relative interior of D, the co-dimension of D is positive. In addition, z lies on the boundary of Dw′ . This implies that z is also a boundary point of Dw, which is a contradiction of our construction. Hence, the co-dimension of D is zero.\nSince b 6= 0, the hyperplane defined by equation h(x) = wTx + b = 0 does not pass through the origin 0. Boundaries of any Dirichlet domain are\nV supported by hyperplanes passing through 0. Thus the intersection D contains an open set U separated by the hyperplane segment Hf . Then there are n + 1 points x0, . . . ,xn ∈ D in general position that fix the unique hyperplane. Since −w /∈ Dw, we have C[f ′] > 0 implying that f ′ is not a dual of f .\nThe probabilistic statement follows from the fact that interior points are regular and therefore have Lebesgue measure one. With respect to the bias b, the set R \\ {0} also has Lebesgue measure one. Combining all parts we arrive at the assertion. ⊓⊔"
