      "text" : "I. INTRODUCTION\nWe develop an automatic stochastic gradient algorithm which reduces the burden of extensive hyper-parameter search for the optimizer. Our proposed algorithm exploits a lower variance estimator of curvature of the cost function and uses it to obtain an automatically tuned adaptive learning rate for each parameter.\nIn deep learning and numerical optimization literature, several papers suggest using a diagonal approximation of the Hessian (second derivative matrix of the cost function with respect to parameters), in order to estimate optimal learning rates for stochastic gradient descent over high dimensional parameter spaces [2], [3], [4]. A fundamental advantage of using such approximation is that inverting such approximation can be a trivial and cheap operation. However generally, for neural networks, the inverse of the diagonal Hessian is usually a bad approximation of the diagonal of the inverse of Hessian. For example, obtaining a diagonal approximation of Hessian are the Gauss-Newton matrix [5] or by finite differences [6]. Such estimations may however be very sensitive to the noise coming from the Monte-Carlo estimates of the gradients. [3] suggested a reliable way to estimate the local curvature in the stochastic setting by keeping track of the variance and average of the gradients.\nWe propose a different approach: instead of using a diagonal estimate of Hessian, to estimate curvature along the direction of the gradient and we apply a new variance reduction technique to compute it reliably. By using root mean square statistics, the variance of gradients are reduced adaptively\n* denotes equal contribution. 1This paper is an extension/update of our previous paper [1].\nwith a simple transformation. We keep track of the estimation of curvature using a technique similar to that proposed by [3], which uses the variability of the expected loss. Standard adaptive learning rate algorithms only scale the gradients, but regular Newton-like second order methods, can perform more complicate transformations, e.g. rotating the gradient vector. Newton and quasi-newton methods can also be invariant to affine transformations in the parameter space. AdaSecant algorithm is basically a stochastic rank-1 quasi-Newton method. But in comparison with other adaptive learning algorithms, instead of just scaling the gradient of each parameter, AdaSecant can also perform an affine transformation on them."

      "text" : "Directional Newton is a method proposed for solving equations with multiple variables[7]. The advantage of directional Newton method proposed in[7], compared to Newton’s method is that, it does not require a matrix inversion and still maintains a quadratic rate of convergence.\nIn this paper, we develop a second-order directional Newton method for nonlinear optimization. Step-size tk of update ∆k for step k can be written as if it was a diagonal matrix:\n∆k = −tk ∇θf(θk), (1) = −diag(tk)∇θf(θk), (2) = −diag(dk)(diag(Hdk))−1∇θf(θk). (3)\nwhere θk is the parameter vector at update k, f is the objective function and dk is a unit vector of direction that the optimization algorithm should follow. Denoting by hi = ∇θ ∂f(θ k) ∂θi\nthe ith row of the Hessian matrix H and by ∇θif(θ k) the ith element of the gradient vector at update k, a reformulation of Equation 1 for each diagonal element of the step-size diag(tk) is:\n∆ki = −tki∇θi f(θ k), (4)\n= −dki ∇θi f(θ k)\nhki d k\n.

(8)\nLet us note that alternatively one might use the R-op to compute the Hessian-vector product for the denominator in Equation 7 [9].\nTo choose a good direction dk in the stochastic setting, we use block-normalized gradient vector that the parameters of each layer is considered as a block and for each weight matrix Wik and bias vector b i k for θ = { Wik,b i k } i=1···k at\neach layer i and update k, dk = [ dk W0k dk b0k · · ·dk blk ] for a neural network with l layers.

      "text" : "Our secant approximation of the gradients are also very closely tied to diagonal approximation of the Hessian matrix. Considering that ith diagonal entry of the Hessian matrix can be denoted as, Hii =\n∂2f(θ) ∂θ2i\n. By using the finite differences, it is possible to approximate this with as in Equation 12,\nHii = lim |∆|→0 ∇θi f(θ + ∆)−∇θi f(θ) ∆i , (12)\nAssuming that the diagonal of the Hessian is denoted with A matrix, we can see the equivalence:\nA ≈ diag(∇θf(θ + ∆)−∇θf(θ)) diag(∆)−1. (13)\nThe Equation 13 can be easily computed in a stochastic setting from the consecutive minibatches.\nIV. VARIANCE REDUCTION FOR ROBUST STOCHASTIC GRADIENT DESCENT\nVariance reduction techniques for stochastic gradient estimators have been well-studied in the machine learning literature. Both [10] and [11] proposed new ways of dealing with this problem. In this paper, we proposed a new variance reduction technique for stochastic gradient descent that relies only on basic statistics related to the gradient. Let gi refer to the ith element of the gradient vector g with respect to the parameters θ and E[·] be an expectation taken over minibatches and different trajectories of parameters.\nWe propose to apply the following transformation to reduce the variance of the stochastic gradients:\ng̃i = gi + γiE[gi]\n1 + γi , (14)\nwhere γi is strictly a positive real number. Let us note that:\nE[g̃i] = E[gi] and Var(g̃i) = 1\n(1 + γi)2 Var(gi). (15)\nThe variance is reduced by a factor of (1 + γi)2 compared to Var(gi).\nIn practice we do not have access to E[gi], therefore a biased estimator gi based on past values of gi will be used instead. We can rewrite the g̃i as:\ng̃i = 1\n1 + γi gi + (1−\n1\n1 + γi )E[gi], (16)\nAfter substitution βi = 11+γi , we will have:\ng̃i = βigi + (1− βi)E[gi]. (17)\nBy adapting γi or βi, it is possible to control the influence of high variance, unbiased gi and low variance, biased gi on g̃i. Denoting by g′ the stochastic gradient obtained on the next minibatch, the γi that well balances those two influences is the one that keeps the g̃i as close as possible to the true gradient E[g′i] with g ′ i being the only sample of E[g ′ i] available. We try to find a regularized βi, in order to obtain a smoother estimate of it and this yields us to more more stable estimates of βi. λ is the regularization coefficient for β.\narg min βi\nE[||g̃i − g′i||22] + λ(βi)2. (18)\nIt can be shown that this a convex problem in βi with a closedform solution (details in appendix) and we can obtain the γi from it:\nγi = E[(gi − g′i)(gi − E[gi])]\nE[(gi − E[gi])(gi′ − E[gi]))] + λ , (19)\nAs a result, to estimate γ for each dimension, we keep track of a estimation of E[(gi−g ′ i)(gi−E[gi])]\nE[(gi−E[gi])(g′i−E[gi]))]+λ during training.\nThe necessary and sufficient condition here, for the variance reduction is to keep γ positive, to achieve a positive estimate of γ we used the root mean square statistics for the expectations."

      "text" : "It is very well-known that the repeated application of the non-linearities can cause the gradients to vanish [12], [13]. Thus, in order to tackle this problem, we normalize the gradients coming into each block/layer to have norm 1. Assuming the normalized gradient can be denoted with g̃, it can be computed as, g̃ = g||E[g]||2 . We estimate, E[g] via moving averages.\nBlockwise gradient normalization of the gradient adds noise to the gradients, but in practice we did not observe any negative impact of it. We conjecture that this is due to the angle between the stochastic gradient and the block-normalized gradient still being less than 90 degrees."

(20)\nThe Ek[·] that is used to compute the secant update, is taken over the minibatches at the past values of the parameters.\nComputing the expectation in Equation20 was numerically unstable in stochastic setting.

      "heading" : "B. Outlier Gradient Detection",
      "text" : "Our algorithm is very similar to [6], but instead of incrementing τi[t+1] when an outlier is detected, the time-constant is reset to 2.2. Note that when τi[t + 1] ≈ 2, this assigns approximately the same amount of weight to the current and the average of previous observations. This mechanism made learning more stable, because without it outlier gradients saturate τi to a large value.\nC. Variance Reduction\nThe correction parameters γi (Equation19) allows for a finegrained variance reduction for each parameter independently. The noise in the stochastic gradient methods can have advantages both in terms of generalization and optimization. It introduces an exploration and exploitation trade-off, which can be controlled by upper bounding the values of γi with a value ρi, so that thresholded γ′i = min(ρi, γi).\nWe block-wise normalized the gradients of each weight matrix and bias vectors in g to compute the g̃ as described in Section II. That makes AdaSecant scale-invariant, thus more robust to the scale of the inputs and the number of the layers of the network. We observed empirically that it was easier to train very deep neural networks with block normalized gradient descent. In our experiments, we fixed λ to 1e− 5.\nVIII. IMPROVING CONVERGENCE\nClassical convergence results for SGD are based on the conditions: ∑\ni (η(i))2 <∞ and ∑ i η(i) =∞ (26)\nsuch that the learning rate η(i) should decrease [14]. Due to the noise in the estimation of adaptive step-sizes for AdaSecant, the convergence would not be guaranteed. To ensure it, we developed a new variant of Adagrad [15] with thresholding, such that each scaling factor is lower bounded by 1. Assuming aki is the accumulated norm of all past gradients for i th parameter at update k, it is thresholded from below ensuring that the algorithm will converge:\naki = √√√√ k∑ j=0 (gji ) 2, (27)\nand ρki = maximum(1, a k i ), (28)\ngiving\n∆ki = 1\nρi ηki g̃ k i . (29)\nIn the initial stages of training, accumulated norm of the perparameter gradients can be less than 1. If the accumulated\nper-parameter norm of a gradient is less than 1, Adagrad will augment the learning-rate determined by AdaSecant for that update, i.e. η k i\nρki > ηki where η k i = Ek[t k i ] is the per-parameter\nlearning rate determined by AdaSecant. This behavior tends to create unstabilities during the training with AdaSecant. Our modification of the Adagrad algorithm is to ensure that, it will reduce the learning rate determined by the AdaSecant algorithm at each update, i.e. η k i\nρki ≤ ηki and the learning rate\nwill be bounded. At the beginning of the training, parameters of a neural network can get 0-valued gradients, e.g. in the existence of dropout and ReLU units. However this phenomena can cause the per-parameter learning rate scaled by Adagrad to be unbounded.\nIn Algorithm 1, we provide a simple pseudo-code of the AdaSecant algorithm.\nAlgorithm 1: AdaSecant: minibatch-AdaSecant for adaptive learning rates with variance reduction\nrepeat draw n samples, compute the gradients g(j) where g(j) ∈ Rn for each minibatch j, g(j) is computed as, 1n ∑n k=1∇ (k) θ f(θ)\nestimate E[g] via moving averages. block-wise normalize gradients of each weight matrix\nand bias vector for parameter i ∈ {1, . . . , n} do\ncompute the correction term by using, γki = E[(gi−g′i)(gi−E[gi])]k E[(gi−E[gi])(g′i−E[gi]))]k compute corrected gradients g̃i = gi+γiE[gi]\n1+γi\nif |g(j)i − E[gi]| > 2 √ E[(gi)2]− (E[gi])2 or ∣∣∣α(j)i − E[αi]∣∣∣ >\n2 √\nE[(αi)2]− (E[αi])2 then reset the memory size for outliers τi ← 2.2\nend\nupdate moving averages according to Equation 23\nestimate learning rate\nη (j) i ←\n√ Ek[(∆ (k) i )\n2]√ Ek[(αki ) 2] − Ek[α k i ∆ k i ] Ek[(αki ) 2]\nupdate memory size as in Equation 25\nupdate parameter θji ← θ j−1 i − η (j) i · g̃ (j) i\nend until stopping criterion is met;"

The convergence of SGD depends on the careful choice of learning rate and the amount of the noise in stochastic estimates of the gradients. In this paper, we propose an adaptive learning rate algorithm, which utilizes stochastic curvature information of the loss function for automatically tuning the learning rates. The information about the element-wise curvature of the loss function is estimated from the local statistics of the stochastic first order gradients. We further propose a new variance reduction technique to speed up the convergence. In our experiments with deep neural networks, we obtained better performance compared to the popular stochastic gradient algorithms. 1",
