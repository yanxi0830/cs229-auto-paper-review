      "text" : "The rate with which a learning algorithm converges as more data comes in play a central role in machine learning. Recent progress has refined our theoretical understanding about setting under which fast learning rates are possible, leading to the development of robust algorithms that can automatically adapt to data with hidden structures and achieve faster rates whenever possible. The literature, however, has mainly focused on bounded losses and little has been known about rates of learning in the unbounded cases, especially in cases when the distribution of the loss has heavy tails (van Erven et al., 2015).\nMost of previous work about learning rate for unbounded losses are done in the context of density estimation (van Erven et al., 2015; Zhang, 2006a,b), of which the proofs of fast rates implicitly employ the central condition (Grünwald, 2012) and cannot be extended to address losses with polynomial tails (van Erven et al., 2015). Efforts to resolve this issue include Brownlees et al. (2015), which proposes using some robust mean estimators to replace empirical means, and Cortes et al. (2013), which derives relative deviation and generalization bounds for unbounded losses with the assumption that Lr-diameter of the hypothesis class is bounded. However, results about fast learning rates were not obtained in both approaches. Fast learning rates are derived in Lecué and Mendelson (2013) for sub-Gaussian losses and in Lecué and Mendelson (2012) for hypothesis classes that have sub-exponential envelope functions. To the best of our knowledge, no previous work about fast learning rates for heavy-tailed losses has been done in the literature.\nThe goal of this research is to study fast learning rates for the empirical risk minimizer when the losses are not necessarily bounded and may have a distribution with heavy tails.\n∗V Dinh was supported by DMS-1223057 and CISE-1564137 from the National Science Foundation and U54GM111274 from the National Institutes of Health. LST Ho was supported by NSF grant IIS 1251151.\nWe recall that heavy-tailed distributions are probability distributions whose tails are not exponentially bounded: that is, they have heavier tails than the exponential distribution. To enable the analyses of fast rates with heavy-tailed losses, two new assumptions are introduced. First, we assume the existence and the Lr-integrability of the envelope function F = supf∈F |f | of the hypothesis class F for some value of r ≥ 2, which enables us to use the results of Lederer and van de Geer (2014) on concentration inequalities for suprema of empirical unbounded processes. Second, we assume that the loss function satisfies the multi-scale Bernstein’s condition, a generalization of the standard Bernstein’s condition for unbounded losses, which enables derivation of fast learning rates.\nBuilding upon this framework, we prove that if the loss has finite moments up to order r large enough and if the hypothesis class satisfies the regularity conditions described above, then learning rate faster than O(n−1/2) can be obtained. Moreover, depending on r and the multi-scale Bernstein’s powers, the learning rate can be arbitrarily close to the optimal rate O(n−1). We then verify these assumptions and derive fast learning rates for the k-mean clustering algorithm and prove that if the distribution of observations has finite moments up to order r and satisfies the Pollard’s regularity conditions, then fast learning rate can be derived. The result can be viewed as an extension of the result from Antos et al. (2005) and Levrard (2013) to cases when the source distribution has unbounded support, and produces a more favorable convergence rate than that of Telgarsky and Dasgupta (2013) under similar settings."

      "text" : "Let the hypothesis class F be a class of functions defined on some measurable space X with values in R. Let Z = (X,Y ) be a random variable taking values in Z = X × Y with probability distribution P where Y ⊂ R. The loss ℓ : Z × F → R+ is a non-negative function. For a hypothesis f ∈ F and n iid samples {Z1, Z2, . . . , Zn} of Z, we define\nPℓ(f) = EZ∼P [ℓ(Z, f)] and Pnℓ(f) = 1\nn\nn ∑\ni=1\nℓ(Zi, f).\nFor unsupervised learning frameworks, there is no output (Y = ∅) and the loss has the form ℓ(X, f) depending on applications. Nevertheless, Pℓ(f) and Pnℓ(f) can be defined in a similar manner. We will abuse the notation to denote the losses ℓ(Z, f) by ℓ(f). We also denote the optimal hypothesis f∗ be any function for which Pℓ(f∗) = inff∈F Pℓ(f) := P ∗\nand consider the empirical risk minimizer (ERM) estimator f̂n = argminf∈F Pnℓ(f).\nWe recall that heavy-tailed distributions are probability distributions whose tails are not exponentially bounded. Rigorously, the distribution of a random variable V is said to have a heavy right tail if limv→∞ eλvP[V > v] = ∞ for all λ > 0 and the definition is similar for heavy left tail. A learning problem is said to be with heavy-tailed loss if the distribution of ℓ(f) has heavy tails from some or all hypotheses f ∈ F . For a pseudo-metric space (G, d) and ǫ > 0, we denote by N (ǫ,G, d) the covering number of (G, d); that is, N (ǫ,G, d) is the minimal number of balls of radius ǫ needed to cover G. The universal metric entropy of G is defined by H(ǫ,G) = supQ logN (ǫ,G, L2(Q)), where the supremum is taken over the set of all probability measures Q concentrated on some finite subset of G. For convenience, we define G = ℓ ◦ F the class of all functions g such that g = ℓ(f) for some f ∈ F and denote by Fǫ a finite subset of F such that G is contained in the union of balls of radius ǫ with centers in Gǫ = ℓ ◦ Fǫ. We refer to Fǫ and Gǫ as an ǫ-net of F and G, respectively. To enable the analyses of fast rates for learning problems with heavy-tailed losses, throughout the paper, we impose the following regularity conditions on F and ℓ. Assumption 2.1 (Multi-scale Bernstein’s condition). Define F∗ = argminF Pℓ(f). There exist a finite partition of F = ∪i∈IFi, positive constants B = {Bi}i∈I , constants γ = {γi}i∈I in (0, 1], and f∗ = {f∗i }i∈I ⊂ F∗ such that E[(ℓ(f) − ℓ(f∗i ))2] ≤ Bi (E[ℓ(f)− ℓ(f∗i )])γi for all i ∈ I and f ∈ Fi.\nAssumption 2.2 (Entropy bounds). The hypothesis class F is separable and there exist C ≥ 1, K ≥ 1 such that ∀ǫ ∈ (0,K], the L2(P )-covering numbers and the universal metric entropies of G are bounded as logN (ǫ,G, L2(P )) ≤ C log(K/ǫ) and H(ǫ,G) ≤ C log(K/ǫ). Assumption 2.3 (Integrability of the envelope function). There exists W > 0, r ≥ C + 1 such that (\nE supg∈G |g|r )1/r ≤ W .\nThe multi-scale Bernstein’s condition is more general than the Bernstein’s condition. This entails that the multi-scale Bernstein’s condition holds whenever the Bernstein’s condition does, thus allows us to consider a larger class of problems. In other words, our results are also valid with the Bernstein’s condition. The multi-scale Bernstein’s condition is more proper to study unbounded losses since it is able to separately consider the behaviors of the risk function on microscopic and macroscopic scales, for which the distinction can only be observed in an unbounded setting.\nWe also recall that if G has finite VC-dimension, then Assumption 2.2 is satisfied (Boucheron et al., 2013; Bousquet et al., 2004). Both Bernstein’s condition and the assumption of separable parametric hypothesis class are standard assumptions frequently used to obtain faster learning rates in agnostic settings. A review about the Bernstein’s condition and its applications is Mendelson (2008), while fast learning rates for bounded losses on hypothesis classes satisfying Assumptions 2.2 were previously studied in Mehta and Williamson (2014) under the stochastic mixability condition. Fast learning rate for hypothesis classes with envelope functions were studied in Lecué and Mendelson (2012), but under a much stronger assumption that the envelope function is sub-exponential.\nUnder these assumptions, we illustrate that fast rates for heavy-tailed losses can be obtained. Throughout the analyses, two recurrent analytical techniques are worth mentioning. The first comes from the simple observation that in the standard derivation of fast learning rates for bounded losses, the boundedness assumption is used in multiple places only to provide reverse-Holder-type inequalities, where the L2-norm are upper bounded by the L1-norm. This use of the boundedness assumption can be simply relieved by the assumption that the Lr-norm of the loss is bounded, which implies\n‖u‖L2 ≤ ‖u‖(r−2)/(2r−2)L1 ‖u‖ r/(2r−2) Lr .\nThe second technique relies on the following results of Lederer and van de Geer (2014) on concentration inequalities for suprema of empirical unbounded processes.\nLemma 2.1. If {Vk : k ∈ K} is a countable family of non-negative functions such that E sup\nk∈K |Vk|r ≤ M r σ2 = sup k∈K EV 2k and V := sup k∈K PnVk,\nthen for all ζ, x > 0, we have\nP[V ≥ (1 + ζ)EV + x] ≤ min 1≤l≤r\n(1/x)l [ ( 64/ζ + ζ + 7) (l/n) 1−l/r M + 4σ √ l/n )l ] .\nAn important notice from this result is that the failure probability is a polynomial in the deviation x. As we will see later, for a given level of confidence δ, this makes the constant in the convergence rate a polynomial function of (1/δ) instead of log(1/δ) as in sub-exponential cases. Thus, more careful examinations of the order of the failure probability are required for the derivation of any generalization bound with heavy-tailed losses."

First, we will use the assumption of integrable envelope function to prove a localization-based result that allows us to reduce the analyses from the separable parametric classes F to its finite ǫ-net Fǫ.

The two results are then combined to obtain fast learning rates."

We recall that convergence rate of O(n−1/(2−γ)) is obtained in Mehta and Williamson (2014) under the same setting but for bounded losses. (The analysis there was done under the γweakly stochastic mixability condition, which is equivalent with the standard γ-Bernstein’s condition for bounded losses (van Erven et al., 2015)). We note that if the loss is bounded, r = ∞ and (3.4) reduces to the convergence rate obtained in Mehta and Williamson (2014). Fast learning rates for unbounded loses are previously derived in Lecué and Mendelson (2013) for sub-Gaussian losses and in Lecué and Mendelson (2012) for hypothesis classes that have sub-exponential envelope functions. In Lecué and Mendelson (2013), the Bernstein’s condition is not directly imposed, but is replaced by condition (ii) of Lemma 3.7 with m = 2 on the whole hypothesis class, while the assumption of sub-Gaussian hypothesis class validates condition (i). This implies the standard Bernstein’s condition with γ = 1 and makes the convergence rate O(n−1) consistent with our result (note that for sub-Gaussian losses, r can be chosen arbitrary large). The analysis of Lecué and Mendelson (2012) concerns about non-exact oracle inequalities (rather than the sharp oracle inequalities we investigate in this paper) and can not be directly compared with our results.\n4 Application: k-means clustering with heavy-tailed source\ndistributions\nk-means clustering is a method of vector quantization aiming to partition n observations into k ≥ 2 clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. Formally, let X be a random vector taking values in Rd with distribution P . Given a codebook (set of k cluster centers) C = {yi} ∈ (Rd)k, the distortion (loss) on an instant x is defined as ℓ(C, x) = minyi∈C ‖x− yi‖2 and k-means clustering method aims at finding a minimizer C∗ of R(ℓ(C)) = Pℓ(C) via minimizing the empirical distortion Pnℓ(C).\nThe rate of convergence of k-means clustering has drawn considerable attention in the statistics and machine learning literatures (Pollard, 1982; Bartlett et al., 1998; Linder et al., 1994; Ben-David, 2007). Fast learning rates for k-means clustering (O(1/n)) have also been derived by Antos et al. (2005) in the case when the source distribution is supported on a finite set of points, and by Levrard (2013) under the assumptions that the source distribution has bounded support and satisfies the so-called Pollard’s regularity condition, which dictates that P has a continuous density with respect to the Lebesgue measure and the Hessian matrix of the mapping C → R(C) is positive definite at C∗. Little is known about the finite-sample performance of empirically designed quantizers under possibly heavy-tailed distributions. In Telgarsky and Dasgupta (2013), a convergence rate ofO(n−1/2+2/r) are derived, where r is the number of moments of X that are assumed to be finite. Brownlees et al. (2015) uses some robust mean estimators to replace empirical means and derives a convergence rate of O(n−1/2) assuming only that the variance of X is finite.\nThe results from previous sections enable us to prove that with proper setting, the convergence rate of k-means clustering for heavy-tailed source distributions can be arbitrarily close to O(1/n). Following the framework of Brownlees et al. (2015), we consider\nG = {ℓ(C, x) = min yi∈C ‖x− yi‖2, C ∈ F = (−ρ, ρ)d×k}\nfor some ρ > 0 with the regular Euclidean metric.

If X has finite moments up to order r ≥ 4k(d + 1), P has a continuous density with respect to the Lebesgue measure, the risk function has a finite number of global minimizers and the Hessian matrix of C → R(C) is positive definite at the every optimal C∗ in the interior of F , then for all β that satisfies\n0 < β < r − 1 r (1− 2 √ k(d+ 1)/r),\nthere exists c1, c2 > 0 such that for all δ > 0, with probability at least 1− δ, we have R(Ĉn)−R(C∗) ≤ ( c1 + 4 (c2/δ) 2/r ) n−β\nMoreover, when r → ∞, β can be chosen arbitrarily close to 1.\nProof. We have (\nE sup C∈F\nℓ(C,X)r )1/r ≤ ( 1\n2r E[‖X‖2 + ρ2]r\n)1/r\n≤ ( 1 2 E‖X‖2r + 1 2 ρ2r\n)1/r\n≤ W < ∞,\nwhile standard results about VC-dimension of k-means clustering hypothesis class guarantees that C ≤ k(d+ 1) (Linder et al., 1994). On the other hand, we can verify that\nE[ℓ(C,X)− ℓ(C′, X)]2 ≤ Lρ‖C − C′‖22, which validates condition (i) in Lemma 3.7. The fact that the Hessian matrix of C → R(C) is positive definite at C∗ prompts R(Ĉn) − R(C∗) ≥ c‖Ĉn − C∗‖2 for some c > 0 in a neighborhood U around any optimal codebook C∗. Thus, Lemma 3.6 confirms the multiscale Bernstein’s condition with γ = ((r − 2)/(r − 1), 1, . . . , 1). The inequality is then obtained from Theorem 3.3."

      "text" : "We have shown that fast learning rates for heavy-tailed losses can be obtained for hypothesis classes with an integrable envelope when the loss satisfies the multi-scale Bernstein’s condition. We then verify those conditions and obtain new convergence rates for k-means clustering with heavy-tailed losses. The analyses extend and complement existing results in the literature from both theoretical and practical points of view. We also introduce a new fast-rate assumption, the multi-scale Bernstein’s condition, and provide a clear path to verify the assumption in practice. We believe that the multi-scale Bernstein’s condition is the proper assumption to study fast rates for unbounded losses, for its ability to separate the behaviors of the risk function on microscopic and macroscopic scales, for which the distinction can only be observed in an unbounded setting.\nThere are several avenues for improvement. First, we would like to consider hypothesis class with polynomial entropy bounds. Similarly, the condition of independent and identically distributed observations can be replaced with mixing properties (Steinwart and Christmann, 2009; Hang and Steinwart, 2014; Dinh et al., 2015). While the condition of integrable envelope is an improvement from the condition of sub-exponential envelope previously investigated in the literature, it would be interesting to see if the rates retain under weaker conditions, for example, the assumption that the Lr-diameter of the hypothesis class is bounded (Cortes et al., 2013). Finally, the recent work of Brownlees et al. (2015); Hsu and Sabato (2016) about robust estimators as alternatives of ERM to study heavy-tailed losses has yielded more favorable learning rates under weaker conditions, and we would like to extend the result in this paper to study such estimators."

Under these assumptions, we illustrate that fast rates for heavy-tailed losses can be obtained. Throughout the analyses, two recurrent analytical techniques are worth mentioning. The first comes from the simple observation that in the standard derivation of fast learning rates for bounded losses, the boundedness assumption is used in multiple places only to provide reverse-Holder-type inequalities, where the L2-norm are upper bounded by the L1-norm. This use of the boundedness assumption can be simply relieved by the assumption that the Lr-norm of the loss is bounded, which implies ‖u‖L2 ≤ ‖u‖(r−2)/(2r−2) L1 ‖u‖ r/(2r−2) Lr .

To enable such analyses, we introduce two new conditions: (i) the envelope function supf∈F |l ◦ f |, where l is the loss function and F is the hypothesis class, exists and is Lintegrable, and (ii) l satisfies the multi-scale Bernstein’s condition on F . Under these assumptions, we prove that learning rate faster than O(n−1/2) can be obtained and, depending on r and the multi-scale Bernstein’s powers, can be arbitrarily close to O(n−1). We then verify these assumptions and derive fast learning rates for the problem of vector quantization by k-means clustering with heavy-tailed distributions. The analyses enable us to obtain novel learning rates that extend and complement existing results in the literature from both theoretical and practical viewpoints.",
