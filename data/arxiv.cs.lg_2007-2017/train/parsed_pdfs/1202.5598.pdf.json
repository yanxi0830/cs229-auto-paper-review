      "text" : "Clustering as the problem of partitioning data into clusters with strong similarity inside the clusters and strong dissimilarity across different clusters is one of the main problems in machine learning. In this paper, we consider the problem of cut-based, or correlation, clustering [4] that has received a lot of attention recently [1, 22, 3]: Given G(V, E) on n nodes with normalized symmetric affinity matrix A (for all u, v ∈ V: 0 ≤ Auv ≤ 1 and Auu = 1), we want to partition V into clusters C = {C1, . . . , Ck} so as to minimize the total disagreement\nD(C) = k∑ i=1 ∑ u,v∈Ci (1−Auv) + k∑ i 6=j=1 ∑ u∈Ci,v∈Cj Auv.\nThe first term, captures the internal disagreement inside clusters, and the second term captures the external agreement between nodes in different clusters. In an ideal cluster, the affinities between all members of the same cluster are 1 and the affinities between members of two different clusters are zero and hence the objective is zero. This objective does not require the number of clusters to be known ahead of time—we may decide to use any number of clusters, and this is accounted for in the objective. Unfortunately, finding a clustering minimizing the disagreement D(C) is NP-Hard [4].\nWe formulate this problem as an optimization of a convex disagreement objective over a non-convex set of valid clustering matrices (Section 2) and then consider convex relaxations of this constraint. Recently, Jalali et al. [16] suggested a trace-norm (aka nuclear-norm) relaxation, casting the problem as minimizing an `1 loss and a trace-norm penalty, and providing conditions under which the true underlying clustering is recovered. Instead of trace-norm, we propose using the max-norm (aka γ2 : `1 → `∞ norm) [30], which is a tighter convex relaxation than the trace-norm. Accordingly, we establish an exact recovery guarantee for our max-norm based formulation that is strictly better then the trace-norm based guarantee. We show that if the affinity matrix is a corruption of an “ideal” clustering matrix, with a certain bound on the corruption, then the optimal solution of the max-norm bounded optimization problem is exactly the ideal clustering (Section 3.1). We also discuss even tighter convex relaxations related to the max-norm, and suggest augmenting the convex relaxation with a single-linkage post-processing step in case of non-exact recovery, showing the empirical advantages of these approaches (Section 5).\nThe approach we suggests relies on optimizing an `1 objective subject to a max-norm constraint. A similar optimization problem with a trace-norm constraint (or trace-norm regularization) has recently been the subject of some interest in the context of “robust PCA” [8, 33] and recovering the structure of graphical models with latent variables [10]. As with the trace-norm regularized variant, the `1 + max-norm problem can be formulated as an SDP and solved using standard solvers, but this is only applicable to fairly small scale problems. In Section 4, we discuss various optimization approaches to this problems, including approaches which preserve the sparsity of the solution.\nar X\niv :1\n20 2.\n55 98\nv4 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n1 3\nA pr\n2 01\n2"

      "text" : "Our convex relaxation approach is related to the classic SDP relaxations of max-cut [13] and more generally the cut-norm [2]. In fact, if we are interested in a partition to exactly two clusters, the correlation clustering problem is essentially a max-cut problem, though with both positive and negative weights (i.e. a symmetric cut-norm problem), and our relaxation is essentially the classic SDP relaxation of these problems. Our approach and results differ in several ways.\nFirst, we deal with problems with multiple clusters, and even when the number of clusters is not predetermined. If the number of clusters k is pre-determined, the correlation clustering problem can be written as an integer quadratic program, with a k variables per node, and can be relaxed to an SDP. But this SDP will be very different from ours, and will involve a matrix of size nk × nk, unlike our relaxation where the matrix is of size n× n regardless of the number of clusters. Consequently, the rounding techniques based on (random) projections typically employed for classic SDP relaxations do not seem relevant here. Instead, we employ a single-linkage post-processing as a form of “rounding” imperfect solutions.\nSecond, the type of guarantees we provide are very different from those in the Theory of Computation literature. Most of the SDP relaxation work we are aware of (including the classical work cited above) focuses on worst case constant factor approximation guarantees. On one hand, this means the guarantee needs to hold even on “crazy” inputs where there is really no reasonable clustering anyway, and second, and on the other hand it is not clear how approximating the objective to within a constant factor translates to recovering an underlying clustering. Instead, we prove that when the affinity matrix is close enough to following some underlying “true” clustering, the true clustering will be recovered exactly. This type of guarantee is more in the spirit of compressed sensing, which where exact recovery of a support set is guaranteed subject to conditions on the input [16]."

      "text" : "There are several classes of clustering algorithms with different objectives. In hierarchical clustering algorithms such as UPGMA [28], SLINK [27] and CLINK [11] the goal is to generate a sequence of clusterings by produce a sequence of clustering by merging/splitting two clusters at each step of the sequence according to a local disagreement objective as opposed to our global D(C). Because of this locality, these methods are known to be very sensetive to outliers.\nCut-based clustering algorithms such as k-means/medians [31, 15], ratio association [26], ratio cut [9] and normalized cut [34] try to optimize an objective function globally. The main issue with these objectives is that they are typically NP-Hard and need to know the number of clusters ahead of time, since these objectives are monotone in the number of clusters.\nIn contrast, spectral clustering algorithms[32] try to find the first k principal component of the affinity matrix or a transformed version of that [24]. These methods require the number of clusters in advance and has been shown to be tractable (convex) relaxations to NP-Hard cut-based algorithms [12]. These methods are again very sensitive to outliers as they might change the principal components dramatically."

      "heading" : "2 Problem Setup",
      "text" : "Our approach is based on representing a clustering C through its incidence matrix K(C) ∈ Rn×n where Kuv = 1 iff u and v belong to the same cluster in C (i.e. u, v ∈ Ci for some i), and Kuv = 0 otherwise (i.e. if u and v belong to different clusters). The matrix K(C) is thus a permuted block-diagonal matrix, and can also be thought of as the edge incidence matrix of a graph with cliques corresponding to clusters in C. We will say that a matrix K is a valid clustering matrix, or sometimes simply valid, if it can be written as K = K(C) for some clustering C (i.e. if it is a permuted block diagonal matrix, with 1s in the diagonal blocks).\nThe disagreement can then be written as either: D(C) = ‖A−K(C)‖1 = ∑ u,v |Auv −K(C)uv| (1)\nor as: D(C) = ∑ u,v K(C)uv(1− 2Auv) + ∑ uv Auv , (2)\nwhere the term ∑ uv Auv does not depend on the clustering C and can thus be dropped.\nWe now phrase the correlation clustering problem as matrix problem, where we would like to solve\nmin K D(K) s.t. K is a valid clustering matrix. (3)\nThe problem is that even though the objectives (1) and (2) are convex, the constraint that K is valid is certainly not constraint. Our approach to correlation clustering will thus be to relax this non-convex constraint (the validity of K) to a convex constraint.\nWe note that although both the absolute error objective (1) and the linear objective (2) agree on valid clustering matrices (or more generally, on binary matrices K), they can differ when K is fractional, and especially when A is also fractional. The choice of objective can thus be important when relaxing the validity constraint to a convex constraint. More specifically, as long as A is binary (i.e. Auv ∈ {0, 1}), and 0 ≤ Kuv ≤ 1, even if K is fractional, the two objectives agree. Non-negativity of Kuv is ensured in some, but not all, of the convex relaxations we study. When non-negativity is not ensured, the absolute error objective (1) would tend to avoid negative values, but the linear objective might certainly prefer them. More importantly, once the affinities Auv are also fractional, the two objectives differ even for 0 ≤ Kuv ≤ 1. While the linear objective would tend to not care much about entries with affinities close to 1/2, the absolute error objective would tend to encourage fractional values in thees cases.\nThe linear objective also has some optimization advantages over the absolute function as well. From a numerical optimization point of view, dealing with the linear objective function is easier since we do not need to compute the sub-gradients of the `1-norm."

      "heading" : "3 Max-Norm Relaxation",
      "text" : "As discussed in the previous Section, we are interested in optimizing over the non-convex set of valid clustering matrices. The approach we discuss here is to relaxing this set to the set of matrices with bounded max-norm [30]. The max-norm of a matrix K is defined as\n‖K‖max = min K=RLT ‖R‖∞,2‖L‖∞,2\nwhere, ‖ · ‖∞,2 is the maximum of the `2 norm of the rows, and the minimization is over factorization of any internal dimensionality. It is not hard to see that if K is a valid clustering matrix, with K = K(C), then ‖K‖max = 1. This is achieved, e.g., by a factorization with R = L, and where each row Ru of R is a (unit norm) indicator vector with Rui = 1 for u ∈ Ci and zero elsewhere.\nRelaxing the validity constraint to a max-norm constraint, and using the absolute error objective, we obtain the following convex relaxation of the correlation clustering problem:\nK̂ = arg min K ‖A−K‖1 s.t. ‖K‖max ≤ 1. (4)\nAlternatively, we could have used the linear objective (2) instead. In any case, after finding K̂, it is easy to check whether it is valid, and if so recover the clustering from its block structure. If K̂ is valid, we are assured the corresponding clustering is a globally optimal solution of the correlation clustering problem."

      "heading" : "3.1 Theoretical Guarantee",
      "text" : "Assuming there exists an underlying true clustering, we provide a worst-case (deterministic) guarantee for exact recovery of that clustering in the presence of noise when the affinity matrix A is a binary 0− 1 matrix using absolute objective. The flavor of our result is similar to [16] for trace-norm, except that we show the max-norm constraint problem recovers the underlying clustering with larger noise comparing to tracenorm constraint. This matches our intuition that max-norm is a tighter relaxation than trace-norm for valid clustering matrices.\nTo present our theoretical result, we start by introducing an important quantity that our main result is based upon. Suppose C∗ = {C∗1 , . . . , C∗k} is the underlying true clustering. For a node u and a cluster C∗i , let du,C∗i = ∑ v∈C∗ i Au,v |C∗i | if u /∈ C∗i and du,C∗i = 1− ∑ v∈C∗ i Au,v |C∗i | otherwise and\nDmax(A,K) ≡ Dmax(A,K(C∗)) = max u,i du,C∗i\nFigure 1: Theorem 1 guarantee region of the noise level Dmax vs the unbalanceness parameter\n1 k∗\n∑\ni\n(\n|C∗i | |Cmin|\n)2\n.\nbe the maximum of the disagreement ratios on the adjacency matrix. This definition is inspired by [16] but is slightly different. Notice that the larger Dmax(A,K) is, the more noisy (comparing to ideal clusters) the graph is; and hence, the harder the clustering becomes. In particular for ideal clusters (fully connected inside and fully disconnected outside clusters), we have Dmax(A,K) = 0.\nWe would like to ensure that when Dmax(A,K) is small enough, our method can recover K. The following lemma helps us understand the information theoretic limit of Dmax(A,K), i.e. what value of Dmax is certainly not enough to ensure recovery, even information theoretically: Lemma 1. For any clustering C = {C1, . . . , Ck} and for all γ > 25+r with r = n2∑\ni |Ci|2 , there exists an\naffinity matrix A such that Dmax(A,K(C)) = γ and the combinatorial program (3) does not output C.\nNote that the minimum of 25+r is attained when all clusters have equal sizes. If we have k ∗ clusters of\nsize nk∗ , then r = k ∗ and the bound in Lemma 1 asserts that if Dmax(A,K) > 2 k∗+5 , then there are examples for which the original clustering cannot be recovered by the combinatorial program (3). This implies that Dmax(A,K) cannot be scaled better than Θ( 1 k∗ ) in general even without convex relaxation.\nSuppose there exist a true underlying clustering C∗ with k∗ clusters. Let Cmin be the smallest size underlying true cluster and we are given an affinity matrix A with Dmax = Dmax(A,K(C∗)). Introducing lagrange multiplier µ, we consider the optimization problem\nK̂µ = arg min K 1− µ n2 ‖A−K‖1 + µ ‖K‖max. (5)\nThe following theorem characterizes the noise regime under which the simple max-norm relaxation (5) recovers C∗.\nTheorem 1. For binary 0 − 1 matrix A, if Dmax < 1k∗+1 is small enough to satisfy 1 k∗ ∑ i ( |C∗i | |Cmin| )2 ≤\n(1−3Dmax)2 (1+Dmax)Dmax then, for any µ0 satisfying (1+Dmax) (1−3Dmax)|Cmin|2 < (1−µ0)k∗ µ0n2 < (1−3Dmax)k ∗ Dmax ∑ i |C∗i |2 , the matrix K̂µ0 (the solution to (5)) is unique and equal to the matrix K∗ = K(C∗) (the solution to (3)). Remark 1: Consider the parameter 1k∗ ∑ i ( |C∗i | |Cmin| )2 in the theorem. Notice that for a balanced underlying clustering (k∗ clusters of size n/k∗), this parameter is 1 and as the underlying clustering gets more and more unbalanced, this parameter increases. That motivates to call it unbalanceness of the clustering. It is clear that as unbalanceness parameter increases, the region of Dmax for which our theorem guarantees the clustering recovery shrinks. We plot the admissible region of Dmax due to unabalanceness in Fig 1. Remark 2: According to the Lemma 1, the bound on Dmax is order-wise tight and can be only improved by a constant in general."

      "text" : "Considering single-linkage algorithm (SLINK) [27] as a baseline for clustering, we compare the power our algorithm in cluster recovery with that. SLINK generates a hierarchy of clusterings starting with each node\nas a cluster. At each iteration, SLINK measures the similarity of all pairs of clusters and combines the most similar pair of clusters to a new cluster. We consider the closedness of the columns Ai and Aj as the similarity measure of nodes i and j.\nConsider the graph shown in Fig. 2. With exhaustive search, one can show that the non-convex problem (3) outputs two clusters as shown. Running SLINK on this graph, the algorithm first finds two cliques of size 17 and nodes A and B as four separate clusters in the hierarchy. Next, it combines nodes A and B as a separate cluster since they are more similar to each other than to their own clusters. This means that single linkage algorithm will never find the correct clustering. However, it can be easily checked that our proposed max-norm constrained algorithm will recover the solution of (3)."

      "text" : "Since the max-norm constraint is strictly a tighter relaxation to the trace-norm constraint, we expect the max-norm algorithm to perform better. Our theorem shows improvement over the guarantees provided for trace-norm clustering. Comparing to the result of [16] on trace-norm (Dmax ≤ |Cmin|4n ), the max-norm tolerates more noise. To see this, consider a balanced clustering, then trace-norm requires Dmax ≤ 14k∗ and max-norm requires Dmax ≤ min( 1k∗+1 , 0.1789) which is larger than 1 4k∗ for all k\n∗. The difference gets more clear for unbalanced clustering. Suppose we have one small cluster of constant size |Cmin| and other clusters are approximately of size nk∗ . As (n, k ∗) scales, trace-norm guarantee requires that Dmax = o( 1 n ) which is inverse proportional to the size of the smallest cluster, whereas, max-norm guarantee requires Dmax = o( k∗\nn ) which is inverse proportional to the size of the largest cluster. This is a huge theoretical advantage in our theorem.\nBesides comparing the provided guarantees, we compare max-norm clustering with trace-norm clustering both deterministically and probabilistically. Running Trace-Norm constrained minimization [16] on the graph shown in Fig. 2, the resulting clustering consists of two clusters and node B belongs to the correct cluster. However, node A belongs to both clusters! – The clustering matrix contains two blocks of ones and the row/column corresponding to the node A contain all ones. Also, the diagonal entry corresponding to node A is larger than one and the diagonal entry corresponding to the node B is less than one. In short, this algorithm is confused as of which cluster the node A belongs to.\nFurther, we compare our algorithm with trace-norm algorithm [16] and SLINK on a probabilistic setup. Start from two different ideal clusters on 100 nodes: a) Balanced clusters: four ideal clusters of size 25, b) Unbalanced clusters: three ideal clusters of size 30 and one ideal cluster of size 10. Then, gradually increase Dmax on both graphs and run all algorithms and report the probability of success in exact recovery of the underlying clusters. Although our theoretical guarantee is for binary affinity matrices, here, we run the same experiment for fractional affinity matrix. We run all experiments for both absolute and linear objectives.\nFig. 3.1 shows that in all cases max-norm outperforms the trace-norm and the improvement is more significant for unbalanced clustering with fractional affinity matrix. Moreover, this experiments reveal that the absolute objective has slight advantage if the affinity matrix is binary and clusters are balanced; otherwise, the linear objective is better.\n4 Max-norm + `1-norm Optimization\nIn this Section we consider optimization problems of the form (4). This problem recovers a sparse and low-rank matrix from their sum, considering max-norm as a proxy to rank. In Section 4.1, we discuss how (4) can be formulated as an SDP, allowing us to easily solve it using standard SDP solvers, as long as the problem size is relatively small. We then propose three other methods to numerically solve the optimization problem (4)."

By counter-example provided in [14], the sub-set relation is strict (i.e., there is a positive semi-definite and positive entry K0 that does not belong to CP)."

      "text" : "The proof has two main steps; in the first step, we characterize a sufficient optimality condition set based on the existence of a dual variable and in the second step, we construct such dual variable. For the sake of the\nproof, we consider a useful equivalent definition [21] of the max norm as\n‖K‖max = max X:‖X‖2≤1 ‖K ◦X‖2 (8)\nwhere, ‖·‖2 is the spectral norm (maximum eigenvalue) of the matrix and “ ◦ ” is the Hadamard element-wise product.\nC.1 Notation\nIn this section, we introduce our notation and definitions used throughout the paper.\nC.1.1 Residual Matrix Notations\nIn general, we do not expect the residual matrix B∗ = A−K∗ to be sparse unless we threshold the affinity matrix (or we have adjacency matrix). However, to provide a guarantee, we need to characterize the subgradient of the `1-norm and hence distinguish between zeros and non-zeros of B ∗. Let\nΩ = {B ∈ Rn×n : B = BT ,Supp(B) ⊆ Supp(B∗)}, (9)\nwhere, Supp(·) is the index set of non-zero entries. The orthogonal projection of a matrix M to this space is defined to be a matrix of the same size with PΩ(M)ij = Mij if (i, j) ∈ Supp(B∗) and zero otherwise. The orthogonal complement of this space is denoted by Ω⊥ and the projection is defined as PΩ⊥(M) = M−PΩ(M).\nC.1.2 Clustering Matrix Notations\nLet U ∈ Rn×k∗ be constructed as\nU =  1√ |C1| 1|C1| 1√ |C2| 1|C2|\n· 1√ |Ck∗ | 1|Ck∗ |\n . (10)\nDefine T = {UXT + Y UT : X,Y ∈ Rn×k∗} to be the space of matrices sharing either row or column space with U . The orthogonal projection to this space can be defined as\nPT (M) = UUTM +MUUT − UUTMUUT ,\nwhere,\nUUT =  1 |C1|1|C1|×|C1| 1 |C2|1|C2|×|C2|\n· 1 |Ck∗ | 1|Ck∗ |×|Ck∗ |  . Denote the orthogonal complement of the space T by T ⊥ equipped with projection PT ⊥(M) = M −PT (M). Let α = 2Dmax be the contraction between the ideal clusters and disagreements (See Lemma 5 for more details on this definition). Under the assumption of the theorem, we have α < 1 and hence, T ∩ Ω = {0}.\nUsing definitions in (11), let X∗ = W (Z∗) + V (UUT ),\nwhere,\nZ∗ = PΩ  1 |C1|1|C1|×|C1|\n1√ |C1| |C2| 1|C1|×|C2| · 1√|C1| |Ck∗ | 1|C1|×|Ck∗ |\n1√ |C2| |C1| 1|C2|×|C1| 1 |C2|1|C2|×|C2| ·\n1√ |C2| |Ck∗ | 1|C2|×|Ck∗ |\n· · · · 1√\n|Ck∗ | |C1| 1|Ck∗ |×|C1| 1√ |Ck∗ | |C2| 1|Ck∗ |×|C2| · 1 |Ck∗ | 1|Ck∗ |×|Ck∗ |\n .\nNotice that PT (X∗) = UUT and hence X∗ − UUT ∈ T ⊥. If we show that X∗ − UUT has spectral norm less than 1, then it is immediate that X∗ ∈ arg maxX:‖X‖2≤1 ‖K∗ ◦ X‖2. Also, we have an eigenvalue decomposition K∗ ◦ X∗ = [U V ]Σ[U V ]T , where, U is as defined above and contains the eigenvector(s) corresponding to the maximum magnitude eigenvalue +1 (with k∗ repetitions). To bound the spectral norm of X∗ − UUT , consider\n‖X∗ − UUT ‖2 = ‖W (PΩ(Z∗ − UUT ))‖2\n≤ Dmax 1− α (k∗ − 1) < 1.\nThe first inequality follows from Lemma 6. We make assumptions so that the last inequality holds.\nWe use the variational form (8) to characterize the sub-gradient of the max-norm at the point K∗.\nLemma 3. For a matrix M ∈ Rn×n, we have M ∈ ∂‖K∗‖max if M = (USUT +W ) ◦X∗, for some diagonal positive semi-definite matrix S ∈ Rr×r with Trace (S) = 1 and for some matrix W ∈ Rn×n with PT (W ) = 0 and ‖W‖∗ < 1.\nProof. Using the variational form (8) and theorem 4.4.2 in [17] on the sub-gradient of the maximum of convex functions, we have\n∂‖K∗ ◦X∗‖2 ⊆ ∂‖K∗‖max.\nThus, it suffices to show that M ∈ ∂‖K∗ ◦X∗‖2 (which is the case).\nC.2 Sufficient Optimality Conditions\nWe provide similar optimality conditions to those provided in `1 plus trace norm minimization in the literature. The main difference here is the existence of the auxiliary variable X∗ in the conditions. The following lemma characterizes a sufficient optimality condition set.\nLemma 4 (Sufficient Optimality Condition.). K∗ = K̂µ (Problem (3)≡ Problem (5)), if T ∩ Ω = {0} and there exists a dual matrix Q such that\n(a) PΩ(Q ◦X∗) = − 1−µn2 Sign(A−K ∗)\n(b) ‖PΩ⊥(Q ◦X∗)‖∞ < 1−µ n2\n(c) PT (Q) = USUT , for some diagonal matrix S 0 with Trace(S) = µ.\n(d) ‖PT ⊥(Q)‖∗ < µ.\nProof. Notice that since X∗ by construction has no zero entry (except for the very corner case where there are only two clusters both of size 2), the matrix Q ◦X∗ can take any value/sign on each entry by choosing the values of Q properly. Under these conditions, Q ◦X∗ ∈ ∂‖A−K∗‖1 and also Q ◦X∗ ∈ ∂‖K∗‖max and the result follows from the standard first order optimality argument and zero duality gap of both `1 and max norms.\nC.3 Dual Variable Construction\nFirst notice that under the assumption of the theorem, we have α < 1 and hence, by Lemma 5, we have T ∩ Ω = {0} and also µ = µ0 is feasible. Second, we construct Q by using alternating projections. Consider the infinite sums\nW (M) = M − PT (M) + PΩ(PT (M))− PT (PΩ(PT (M))) + . . . V (N) = N − PΩ(N) + PT (PΩ(N)) − PΩ(PT (PΩ(N))) + . . .\n(11)\nBy the proof of the Lemma 5, these sums converge geometrically with parameter α (See Lemma 5 in [16] for the proof). Denoting element-wise division with “/” (and 00 = 0), let\nQ = −1− µ n2 W (Sign(A−K∗)/X∗) + µ k∗ V (UUT ).\nIt is easy to check that conditions (a) and (c) in lemma 4 are both satisfied for S = 1k∗ I. To show condition (b), first notice that ‖PΩ⊥PT PΩ(M)‖∞ ≤ Dmax‖PΩ⊥(M)‖∞ and hence, we have\n‖PΩ⊥(Q ◦X∗)‖∞ ≤ 1\n(1−Dmax)2 ∥∥∥∥PΩ⊥ (1− µn2 PT (Sign(A−K∗)/X∗) + µk∗UUT ) ◦ PΩ⊥ ( UUT − PT (Z∗) )∥∥∥∥ ∞\n= max i\n1\n(1−Dmax)2\n( (1− µ)|Ci|\nn2 Dmax +\nµ k∗ 1 |Ci| ) 1 +Dmax |Ci|\n= 1\n(1−Dmax)2 ( (1− µ) n2 (1 +Dmax)Dmax + µ k∗ 1 +Dmax |Cmin|2 ) < 1− µ n2 .\nThe last inequality holds for (1−µ)k ∗\nµn2 > (1+Dmax) (1−3Dmax)|Cmin|2 .

If α < 1 then T ∩ Ω = {0}.\nProof. We show that the projection PT PΩ(·) has a norm α strictly less than one. Then, if there exists a non-zero matrix M ∈ T ∩ Ω, then ‖M‖∞ = ‖PT PΩ(M)‖∞ ≤ α‖M‖∞ < ‖M‖∞ is a trivial contradiction. Let M ∈ Ω and consider\n‖PT (M)‖∞ = maxi,j ∥∥∥∥ 1|Ci|1|Ci|×|Ci|MCi,Cj + 1|Cj |MCi,Cj1|Cj |×|Cj | − 1|Ci| |Cj |1|Ci|×|Ci|MCi,Cj1|Cj |×|Cj | ∥∥∥∥ ∞\n≤ 2Dmax‖M‖∞ = α‖M‖∞.\nThe last step is attained by optimizing over |Ci| and |Cj |. This concludes the proof of the lemma.\nLemma 6. ‖W (PΩ(Z∗ − UUT ))‖2 ≤ Dmax1−α (k ∗ − 1).\nProof. For M ∈ Ω, we have ‖M‖2 ≤ ‖Mσ‖2, where, Mσ ∈ Rk ∗×k∗ with (Mσ)i,j = ‖MCi,Cj‖2. By definition of Dmax, we have ‖MCi,Cj‖2 ≤ Dmax √ |Ci| |Cj |‖MCi,Cj‖∞. Thus,\n‖PΩ(Z∗ − UUT )‖2 ≤ Dmax ∥∥∥∥∥∥∥∥  0 1 · 1 1 0 · 1 · · · · 1 1 · 0  ∥∥∥∥∥∥∥∥\n2\n= Dmax(k ∗ − 1).\nThe rest of the proof is straight forward as follows\n‖W (PΩ(Z∗ − UUT ))‖2 = ∥∥∥∥∥PT ⊥PΩ ( ∞∑ i=0 (PT PΩ)i(PΩ(Z∗ − UUT )) )∥∥∥∥∥ 2\n≤ ∥∥∥∥∥PΩ ( ∞∑ i=0 (PT PΩ)i(PΩ(Z∗ − UUT )) )∥∥∥∥∥ 2 = Dmax 1− α (k∗ − 1).\nThis concludes the proof of the lemma."
