      "text" : "Recently, there has been an increasing interest in adapting machine learning and statistical methods to tensors. Data with a natural tensor structure is encountered in many scientific areas including neuroimaging (Zhou et al., 2013), signal processing (Cichocki et al., 2009), spatio-temporal analysis (Bahadori et al., 2014) and computer vision (Lu et al., 2013). Extending multivariate regression methods to tensors is one of the challenging task in this area. Most existing works extend linear models to the multilinear setting and focus on the tensor structure of the input data (e.g. Signoretto et al. (2013)). Little has been done however to investigate learning methods for tensor-structured output data.\nWe consider a multilinear regression task where inputs are vectors and outputs are tensors. In order to leverage the tensor structure of the output data, we formulate the problem as the minimization of a least squares criterion subject to a multilinear rank constraint on the regression tensor. The rank constraint enforces the model to capture the low-rank structure of the outputs and to explain the dependencies between inputs and outputs in a low-dimensional multilinear subspace.\nUnlike previous work we do not use a convex relaxation of this difficult non-convex optimization problem. Instead we design an efficient approximation algorithm (HOLRR) for which we are able to provide good approximation\n∗Contact author: guillaume.rabusseau@lif.univ-mrs.fr.\nar X\niv :1\n60 2.\n06 86\n3v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n2 Fe\nguarantees. We also present a kernelized version of HOLRR which extends our model to the nonlinear setting. Experiments on synthetic and real data shows that HOLRR obtains better predictive accuracy while being computationally very competitive. We also present an image recovery experiment which gives an illustrative insight on the effects of multilinear rank regularization.\nRelated work. In the context of multi-task learning, Romera-Paredes et al. (2013) have proposed a linear model using a tensor-rank penalization of a least squares criterion to take into account the multi-modal interactions between tasks. Their approach relies on a convex relaxation of the multlinear rank constraint using the trace norms of the matricizations. They also propose a non-convex approach (MLMT-NC) but it is computationally very expensive. Bahadori et al. (2014) have proposed a greedy algorithm to solve a low-rank tensor learning problem in the context of multivariate spatio-temporal data analysis. The linear model they assume is different from the one we propose, it is specifically designed for spatio-temporal data and does not fit into the general tensor-valued regression framework we consider here.\nPaper outline. We provide some background on low-rank regression and tensors in Section 2. In Section 3 we introduce the tensor response regression problem, we develop the HOLRR algorithm to tackle the minimization problem with mulitlinear rank constraint, and we prove that this algorithm has good approximation guarantees. A kernelized version of HOLRR is provided in Section 4. Finally, we assess the performances of our method through simulation study and real data analysis in Section 5."

      "text" : "We first recall some basic definitions of tensor algebra; more details can be found in Kolda & Bader (2009). A tensor T ∈ Rd1×···×dp is a collection of real numbers (T i1,··· ,ip : in ∈ [dn], n ∈ [p]). The mode-n fibers of T are the vectors obtained by fixing all indices except for the nth one, e.g. T :,i2,··· ,ip ∈ Rd1 .\nThe nth mode matricization of T is the matrix having the mode-n fibers of T for columns and is denoted by T(n) ∈ Rdn×d1···dn−1dn+1···dp . The vectorization of a tensor is defined by vec(T ) = vec(T(1)). The inner product between two tensors S and T (of the same size) is defined by 〈S,T 〉 = 〈vec(S), vec(T )〉 and the Frobenius norm is defined by ‖T ‖2F = 〈T ,T 〉. In the following T always denotes a tensor of size d1 × · · · × dp.\nmode-n product. The mode-n matrix product of the tensor T and a matrix X ∈ Rm×dn is a tensor denoted by T ×n X. It is of size d1 × · · · × dn−1 ×m× dn+1×· · ·×dp and is defined by the relation Y = T ×nX⇔ Y(n) = XT(n). The mode-n vector product of the tensor T and a vector v ∈ Rdn is a tensor defined by T •n v = T ×n v> ∈ Rd1×···×dn−1×dn+1×···×dp . Given tensors S and T and matrices X,A and B, it is easy to check that 〈T ×n X,S〉 = 〈T ,S×n X>〉 and (T ×n A)×n B = T ×n BA (where we assumed conforming dimensions of the tensors and matrices).\nMultilinear rank. The mode-n rank of T is the dimension of the space spanned by its mode-n fibers, that is rankn(T ) = rank(T(n)). The multilinear rank of T , denoted by rank(T ), is the tuple of mode-n ranks of T : rank(T ) = (R1, · · · , Rp) where Rn = rankn(T ) for n ∈ [p]. We will write rank(T ) ≤ (S1, · · · , Sp) whenever rank1(T ) ≤ S1, rank2(T ) ≤ S2, · · · , rankp(T ) ≤ Sp.\nTucker decomposition. The Tucker decomposition is a form of higher-order principal component analysis. It decomposes a tensor T into a core tensor G transformed by an orthogonal matrix along each mode:\nT = G ×1 U1 ×2 U2 ×3 · · · ×p Up , (1)\nwhere G ∈ RR1×R2×···×Rp , Ui ∈ Rdi×Ri for i ∈ [p] and U>i Ui = I for all i ∈ [p]. The number of parameters involved in a Tucker decomposition can be considerably smaller than d1d2 · · · dp. We have the following identities when matricizing and vectorizing a Tucker decomposition\nT(n) = UnG(n)(Up ⊗ · · · ⊗Un+1 ⊗Un−1 ⊗ · · · ⊗U1)>\nvec(T ) = (Up ⊗Up−1 ⊗ · · · ⊗U1)vec(G) . (2)\nIt is well known that T admits the Tucker decomposition (1) if and only if rank(T ) ≤ (R1, · · · , Rp) (see e.g. Kolda & Bader (2009)). Finding an exact Tucker decomposition can be done using the higher-order SVD algorithm (HOSVD) introduced by De Lathauwer et al. (2000). Although finding the best approximation of multilinear rank (R1, · · · , Rp) of a tensor T is a difficult problem, the truncated HOSVD algorithm provides good approximation guarantees and often performs well in practice."

      "text" : "Multivariate regression is the task of recovering a function f : Rd → Rp from a set of input-output pairs {(x(n),y(n))}Nn=1, where the outputs are sampled from the model with an additive noise y = f(x) + ε, where ε is the error term. To solve this problem, the ordinary least squares (OLS) approach assumes a linear dependence between input and output data and boils down to finding a matrix W ∈ Rd×p that minimizes the squared error ‖XW−Y‖2F , where X ∈ RN×d and Y ∈ RN×p denote the input and the output matrices. To prevent overfitting and to avoid numerical instabilities a ridge regularization term (i.e. γ‖W‖2F ) is often added to the objective function, leading to the regularized least squares (RLS) method. The main drawback of this method is that it does not take into account the dependencies between the components of the response. It performs poorly when the outputs are correlated and the true dimension of the response is less than p. Indeed, it is easy to see that the OLS/RLS approach in the multivariate setting is equivalent to performing p linear regressions for each scalar output {yj}pj=1 independently.\nLow-rank regression (or reduced-rank regression) addresses this issue by solving the following rank penalized problem\nmin W∈Rd×p ‖XW−Y‖2F + γ‖W‖2F s.t. rank(W) ≤ R , (3)\nfor a given integer R. Suppose that f(x) = Wx. The constraint rank(W) = R implies linear restrictions on W, i.e. there must exist p − R linearly independent vectors v1, · · · ,vp−R ∈ Rp such that Wvi = 0, which, in turn, implies that y>vi = ε>vi for each i ∈ [p − R]. Intuitively this means that the linear subspace generated by the vi’s only contains noise. Another way to see this is to write W = AB with A ∈ Rd×R and B ∈ RR×p, which implies that the relation between x and y is explained in an R-dimensional latent space.\nThe rank constraint in (3) was first proposed in (Anderson, 1951), whereas the term reduced-rank regression was introduced in (Izenman, 1975). Adding a ridge regularization to the rank penalized problem was proposed in Mukherjee & Zhu (2011). In the rest of the paper we will refer to this approach as lowrank regression (LRR). The solution of minimization problem (3) is given by projecting the RLS solution onto the space spanned by the top R eigenvectors of Y>PY where P is the orthogonal projection matrix onto the column space of X, that is WLRR = WRLSΠ where Π is the matrix of the aforementioned projection. For more description and discussion of reduced-rank regression, we refer the reader to the books of Reinsel & Velu (1998) and Izenman (2008)."

      "text" : "We consider a multivariate regression task where the response has a tensor structure. Let f : Rd0 → Rd1×d2×···×dp be the function we want to learn from a sample of input-output data {(x(n),Y(n))}Nn=1 drawn from the model Y = f(x) + E, where E is an error term. We assume that the function f is linear, that is f(x) = W •1 x for some regression tensor W ∈ Rd0×d1×···×dp . Note that the vectorization of this relation leads to vec(f(x)) = W>(1)x showing that this model is equivalent to the standard multivariate linear model.\nVectorization of the outputs. One way to tackle this linear regression task for tensor responses would be to vectorize each output sample and to perform a standard multivariate low-rank regression on the data {(x(n), vec(Y(n)))}Nn=1 ⊂ Rd0 × Rd1···dp . A major drawback of this approach is that the tensor structure of the output is lost in the vectorization step. The low-rank model tries to capture linear dependencies between components of the output but it ignores higher level dependencies that could be present in a tensor-structured output. For illustration, suppose the output is a matrix encoding the samples of d1 continuous variables at d2 different time steps, one could expect structural relations between the d1 time series, for example linear dependencies between the rows of the output matrix.\nLow-rank regression for tensor responses. To overcome the limitation described above we propose an extension of the low-rank regression method for tensor-structured responses by enforcing low multilinear rank of the regression tensor W . Let {(x(n),Y(n))}Nn=1 ⊂ Rd0 × Rd1×d2×···×dp be a training sample of input/output data drawn from the model f(x) = W •1 x + E where W is assumed of low multilinear rank. Considering the framework of empirical risk minimization, we want to find a low-rank regression tensor W minimizing the loss on the training data. To avoid numerical instabilities and to prevent overfitting we add a ridge regularization to the objective function, leading to the following minimization problem\nmin W∈Rd0×···×dp N∑ n=1 `(W •1 x(n),Y(n)) + γ‖W‖2F (4)\ns.t. rank(W) ≤ (R0, R1, · · · , Rp) ,\nfor some given integers R0, R1, · · · , Rp and where ` is a loss function. In this paper, we consider the squared error loss between tensors defined by `(T , T̂ ) =\n‖T − T̂ ‖2F . Using this loss we can rewrite problem (4) as\nmin W∈Rd0×d1×···×dp ‖W ×1 X−Y‖2F + γ‖W‖2F (5)\ns.t. rank(W) ≤ (R0, R1, · · · , Rp) ,\nwhere the input matrix X ∈ RN×d0 and the output tensor Y ∈ RN×d1×···×dp are defined by Xn,: = (x(n))>, Yn,:,··· ,: = Y(n) for n = 1, · · · , N (Y is the tensor obtained by stacking the output tensors along the first mode).\nLow-rank regression function. Let W∗ be a solution of problem (5), it follows from the multilinear rank constraint that W∗ = G×1 U0×2 · · ·×p+1 Up for some core tensor G ∈ RR0×···×Rp and orthogonal matrices Ui ∈ Rdi×Ri for 0 ≤ i ≤ p. The regression function f∗ : x 7→W∗ •1 x can thus be written as\nf∗ : x 7→ G ×1 x>U0 ×2 · · · ×p+1 Up .\nThis implies several interesting properties. First, for any x ∈ Rd0 we have f∗(x) = T x ×1 U1 ×2 · · · ×p Up with T x = G •1 U>0 x, which implies rank(f∗(x)) ≤ (R1, · · · , Rp), that is the image of f∗ is a set of tensors with low multilinear rank. Second, the relation between x and Y = f∗(x) is explained in a low dimensional subspace of size R0 ×R1 × · · · ×Rp. Indeed one can decompose the mapping f∗ into the following steps: (i) project x in RR0 as x̄ = U>0 x, (ii) perform a low-dimensional mapping Ȳ = G •1 x̄, (iii) project back into the output space to get Y = Ȳ ×1 U1 ×2 · · · ×p Up.\nComparison with LRR. First, it is obvious that the function learned by vectorizing the outputs and performing LRR does not enforce any multilinear structure in the predictions. That is, the tensor obtained by reshaping a vectorized prediction will not necessarily have a low multilinear rank. This is well illustrated in the experiment from Section 5.2 where this fact is particularly striking when we try to learn an image from noisy measurements with a rank constraint set to 1 (see Figure 2, left). Second, since the multilinear rank is defined with respect to the ranks of the matricizations there are some scenarios where the rank constraint in LRR after vectorizing the output will be (almost) equivalent to the multilinear rank constraint in (5). This is clear if the regression tensor is of low mode-1 rank and of full mode-n rank for n > 1, but even when R0 Ri for i ≥ 1 we can expect LRR to be able to capture most of the low-rank structure which is concentrated along the first mode."

We start by showing that the core tensor G solution of (6) is determined by the factor matrices U0, · · · ,Up.\nTheorem 1. For given orthogonal matrices U0, · · · ,Up the tensor G that minimizes (6) is given by\nG = Ỹ ×1 (U>0 X̃>X̃U0)−1U>0 X̃> ×2 U>1 ×3 · · · ×p+1 U>p .\nProof.

The solution w.r.t. vec(G) of this classical linear least-squares problem is given by (M>M)−1M>. Using the mixed-product and inverse properties of the Kronecker product and the columnwise orthogonality of U1, · · · ,Up we obtain\nvec(G) = ( Up ⊗ · · · ⊗U1 ⊗ (U>0 X̃>X̃U0)−1U>0 X̃> ) vec(Ỹ) .\nIt follows from Theorem 1 that problem (5) can be written as\nmin Ui∈R\ndi×Ri , 0≤i≤p\n‖Ỹ ×1 Π0 ×2 · · · ×p+1 Πp − Ỹ‖2F (7)\ns.t.

Note that Π0 is the orthogonal projection onto the space spanned by the columns of X̃U0 and Πi is the orthogonal projection onto the column space of Ui for i ≥ 1. Hence solving problem (5) is equivalent to finding p+ 1 low-dimensional subspaces U0, · · · , Up such that projecting Ỹ onto the spaces X̃U0, U1, · · · , Up along the corresponding modes is close to Ỹ .\nHOLRR algorithm. Since solving problem (7) for the p+1 projections simultaneously is a difficult non-convex optimization problem we propose to solve it independently for each projection. This approach has the benefits of both being computationally efficient and providing good theoretical approximation guarantees (see Theorem 2). The following proposition gives the analytic solutions of (7) when each projection is considered independently.\nProposition 1. For 0 ≤ i ≤ p, using the definition of Πi in (7), the optimal solution of\nmin Ui∈Rdi×Ri ‖Ỹ ×i+1 Πi − Ỹ‖2F s.t. U>i Ui = I\nis given by the eigenvectors of{ (X̃>X̃)−1X̃>Ỹ(1)Ỹ>(1)X̃ if i = 0 Ỹ(i)Ỹ>(i) otherwise\nthat corresponds to the Ri largest eigenvalues.\nProof. For any 0 ≤ i ≤ p, since Πi is a projection we have 〈Ỹ ×1 Πi, Ỹ〉 = 〈ΠiỸ(i), Ỹ(i)〉 = ‖ΠiỸ(i)‖2F , thus minimizing ‖Ỹ ×i Πi − Ỹ‖2F is equivalent to minimizing ‖ΠiỸ(i)‖2F − 2〈ΠiỸ(i), Ỹ(i)〉 = −‖ΠiỸ(i)‖2F . For i ≥ 1, we have ‖ΠiỸ(i)‖2F = Tr(U>i Ỹ(i)Ỹ>(i)Ui) which is maximized by letting the columns of Ui be the top Ri eigenvectors of the matrix Ỹ(i)Ỹ>(i). For i = 0 we have\n‖Π0Ỹ(i)‖2F = Tr(Π0Ỹ(1)Ỹ>(1)Π > 0 ) = Tr ( (U>0 AU0)−1U>0 BU0 ) with A = X̃>X̃ and B = X̃>Ỹ(1)Ỹ>(1)X̃, which is maximized by the top R0 eigenvectors of A−1B.\nThe results from Theorem 1 and Proposition 1 can be rewritten using the original input matrix X and output tensor Y . Since X̃>X̃ = X>X + γI and Ỹ ×1 X̃> = Y ×1 X>, we can rewrite the solution of Theorem 1 as\nG = Y ×1 (U>0 (X>X + γI)U0)−1U>0 XT ×2 U>1 ×3 · · · ×p+1 U>p .\nSimilarly for Proposition 1 we have\n(X̃>X̃)−1X̃>Ỹ(1)Ỹ>(1)X̃ = (X>X + γI)−1X>Y(1)Y>(1)X\nand one can check that Ỹ(i)Ỹ>(i) = Y(i)Y>(i) for any i ≥ 1. The overall Higher-Order Low-Rank Regression procedure (HOLRR) is summarized in Algorithm 1. Note that the Tucker decomposition of the solution returned by HOLRR could be a good initialization point for an Alternative Least Square method. However, studying the theoretical and experimental properties of this approach is beyond the scope of this paper and is left for future work.\nAlgorithm 1 HOLRR Input: X ∈ RN×d0 , Y ∈ RN×d1×···×dp , rank (R0, R1, · · · , Rp) and regulariza-\ntion parameter γ. 1: U0 ← top R0 eigenvectors of (X>X + γI)−1X>Y(1)Y>(1)X 2: for i = 1 to p do 3: Ui ← top Ri eigenvectors of Y(i)Y>(i) 4: end for 5: M = ( U>0 (X>X + γI)U0\n)−1 U>0 X> 6: G ← Y ×1 M×2 U>1 ×3 · · · ×p+1 U>p 7: return G ×1 U0 ×2 · · · ×p+1 Up"

For both algorithms the computational cost for matrix multiplications is asymptotically the same (dominated by the products X>X and Y(1)Y>(1)). We thus focus our analysis on the computational cost of matrix inversions and truncated singular value decompositions. For the two methods the inversion of the matrix X>X + γI can be done in O((d0)3).

We compare the predictive accuracy of HOLRR with the following methods: - RLS: Regularized least squares. - LRR: Low-rank regression (see Section 2.2). - ADMM: a multilinear approach based on tensor trace norm regularization introduced in (Gandy et al., 2011) and (Romera-Paredes et al., 2013). - MLMT-NC: a nonconvex approach proposed in (Romera-Paredes et al., 2013) in the context of multilinear multitask learning.\nFor experiments with kernel algorithms we use the readily available kernelized RLS and the LRR kernel extension proposed in (Mukherjee & Zhu, 2011) (note that ADMM and MLMT-NC only consider a linear dependency between inputs and outputs).\nAlthough MLMLT-NC is perhaps the closest algorithm to ours, we applied it only to simulated data. This is because MLMLT-NC is computationally very expensive and becomes intractable for large data sets. To give an idea on the running times, averages for some of the experiments are reported in Table 1.\n1The code and data used in the experiments will be made available by the authors."

The linear data is drawn from the model Y = W •1 x+E where W ∈ R10×10×10×10 is a tensor of multilinear rank (6, 4, 4, 8) drawn at random, x ∈ R10 is drawn from N (0, I) and each component of the error tensor E is drawn from N (0, 0.1). The nonlinear data is drawn from the model Y = W •1 (x⊗ x) + E where W ∈ R25×10×10×10 is a tensor of rank (5, 6, 4, 2) drawn at random and x ∈ R5 and E are generated as above. The hyper-parameters for all algorithms are selected using 3-fold cross validation on the training data.\nThese experiments have been carried out for different sizes of the training data set, 20 trials have been executed for each size. The average RMSEs on a test set of size 100 for the 20 trials are reported in Figure 1. We see that the HOLRR algorithm clearly outperforms the other methods on the linear data. MLMT-NC is the method obtaining the better accuracy after ours, it is however much more computationally expensive (see Table 1). On the nonlinear data the LRR method achieves good performances but HOLRR is still significantly more accurate for small data set sizes."

      "text" : "To give an illustrative intuition on the differences between matrix and multilinear rank regularization we generate data from the model Y = W •1 x+E where the tensor W is a color image of size m× n encoded with three color channels RGB. We consider two different tasks depending on the input dimension: (i) W ∈ R3×m×n, x ∈ R3 and (ii) W ∈ Rn×m×3, x ∈ Rn. In both tasks the components of both x and E are drawn from N (0, 1) and the regression tensor W is learned from a training set of size 200.\nThis experiment allows us to visualize the tensors returned by the RLS, LRR and HOLRR algorithms. The results are shown in Figure 2 for three images: a green cross (of size 50 × 50), a thumbnail of a Rothko painting (44 × 70) and a square made of triangles (70× 70), note that the first two images have a low rank structure which is not the case for the third one.\nWe first see that HOLRR clearly outperforms LRR on the task where the\ninput dimension is small (task (i)). This is to be expected since the rank of the matrix W(1) is at most 3 and LRR is unable to enforce a low-rank structure on the output modes of W . When the rank constraint is set to 1 for LRR and (3, 1, 1) for HOLRR we clearly see that unlike HOLRR the LRR approach does not enforce any low-rank structure on the regression tensor along the output modes. On task (ii) the difference is more subtle, but we can see that setting a rank constraint of 2 for the LRR algorithm prevents the model from capturing the white border around the green cross and creates the vertical lines artifact in the Rothko painting. For higher values of the rank the model starts to learn the noise. The tensor returned by HOLRR with rank (4, 4, 3) does not exhibit these behaviors and gives better results on these two images. On the square image which does not have a low-rank structure both algorithms do not perform very well. Overall, we see that capturing the mutlilinear low-rank structure of the output data allows HOLRR to separate the noise from the true signal better than RLS and LRR."

We collected data from the meteorological office of the UK 2: monthly average measurements of 5 variables in 16 stations across the UK from 1960 to 2000. The forecasting task consists in predicting the values of the 5 variables in the 16 stations from their values in the preceding months. We use the values of all the variables from the past 2 months as covariates and consider the tasks of predicting the values of all variables for the next k months, the output tensors are thus in Rk×16×5.\nWe randomly split the available data into a training set of size N , a test set of size 50 and a validation set of size 20, for all methods hyper-parameters are chosen w.r.t. to their performance on the validation set. The average test RMSE over 10 runs of this experiment for different values of N and k are reported in Table 2. We see that the HOLRR has overall a better predictive accuracy than the other methods, especially when the tensor structure of the output data gets richer (k = 3 and k = 5). On this dataset, nonlinear methods only improve the results by a small margin with the RBF kernel, and the polynomial kernel performs poorly."
