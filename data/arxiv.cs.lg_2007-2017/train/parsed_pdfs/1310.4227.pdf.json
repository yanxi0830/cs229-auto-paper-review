      "text" : "Modern machine learning tasks in computer vision, natural language processing, and computational biology involve inference in high-dimensional complex models. Examples include scene understanding [Felzenszwalb and Zabih, 2011], parsing [Koo et al., 2010], and protein design [Sontag et al., 2008]. In these settings inference involves finding likely structures that fit the data, such as objects in images, parsers in sentences, or molecular configurations in proteins. Each structure corresponds to an assignment of values to random variables and the likelihood of an assignment is based on defining potential functions that account for interactions over these variables. Given the observed data, these likelihoods yield a posterior probability distribution on assignments known as the Gibbs distribution. Contemporary practice gives rise to posterior probabilities that consider potential influence of the data on the variables of the model (high signal) as well as human knowledge about the potential interactions between these variables (high coupling). The resulting posterior probability landscape is often “ragged”; in such landscapes Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches to sampling from the Gibbs distribution may become prohibitively expensive.

[2004], Huber [2003]) where no data term (signal) exists.\nOne way around the difficulties of sampling from the Gibbs distribution is to look for the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) structure. Substantial effort has gone into developing algorithms for recovering MAP assignments by exploiting domain-specific structural restrictions such as super-modularity [Kolmogorov, 2006] or by linear programming relaxations such as cuttingplanes [Sontag et al., 2008, Werner, 2008]. A drawback of MAP inference is that it returns a single assignment; in many contemporary models with complex potential functions on many variables, there are several likely structures, which makes MAP inference less appealing. We would like to also find these other “highly probable” assignments.\nRecent work has sought to leverage the current efficiency of MAP solvers to build procedures to sample from the Gibbs distribution, thereby avoiding the computational burden of MCMC methods. These works calculate the MAP structure of a randomly perturbed potential function. Such an approach effectively ignores the raggedness of the landscape that hinders MCMC. Papandreou and Yuille [2011] and Tarlow et al. [2012] have shown that randomly perturbing the potential of each structure with an independent random variable that follows the Gumbel distribution and finding the MAP assignment of the perturbed potential function provides an unbiased sample from the Gibbs distribution. Unfortunately the total number of structures, and consequently the total number of random perturbations, is exponential in the structure’s dimension. Alternatively, Hazan et al. [2013] use expectation bounds on the partition function [Hazan and Jaakkola, 2012] to build a sampler for Gibbs distribution using MAP solvers on low dimensional perturbations which are only linear in the dimension of the structures.\nThe samplers based on low dimensional perturbations involve calculating expectations of the value of the MAP solution after perturbations. In this paper we give a statistical characterization of this value. In particular, we prove new measure concentration inequalities that show the expected perturbed MAP value can be estimated with high probability using only a few random samples. This is an important ingredient to construct an alternative to MCMC in the data-knowledge domain that relies on MAP solvers. The key technical challenge comes from the fact that the perturbations are Gumbel random variables. Since the Gumbel distribution is continuous, the MAP value of the perturbed potential function is unbounded and standard approaches such as McDiarmid’s inequality do not apply. Instead, we derive a new Poincaré inequality for the Gumbel distribution, as well as a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality using the approach suggested by Bobkov and Ledoux [1997], as described in the monograph of Ledoux [2001]. These results, which are of general interest, also guarantee that the deviation of the sampled mean of random MAP perturbations from their expectation has an exponential decay."

      "text" : "Statistical inference problems involve reasoning about the states of discrete variables whose configurations (assignments of values) specify the discrete structures of interest. Suppose that our\nmodel has n variables x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn) where each xi taking values in a discrete set Xi. Let X = X1 × X2 × · · · × Xn so that x ∈ X . Let Dom(θ) ⊆ X be a subset of possible configurations and θ : X → R be a potential function that gives a score to an assignment or structure x, where θ(x) = −∞ for x /∈ Dom(θ). The potential function induces a probability distribution on configurations x via the Gibbs distribution:\np(x) ∆ =\n1 Z exp(θ(x)), (1)\nZ ∆ = ∑ x∈X exp(θ(x)). (2)\nThe normalization constant Z is called the partition function. Sampling from (1) is often difficult because the sum in (2) involves an exponentially large number of terms (equal to the number of discrete structures). In many cases, computing the partition function is in the complexity class #P (e.g., Valiant [1979]).\nFinding the most likely assignment of values to variables is easier. As the Gibbs distribution is typically constructed given observed data, we call this the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) prediction. Maximizing (1):\nx̂MAP = argmax x∈X θ(x). (3)\nThere are many good optimization algorithms for solving (3) in cases of practical interest. Although MAP prediction is still NP-hard in general, it is often simpler than sampling from the Gibbs distribution.\nHowever, there are often several values of x whose scores θ(x) are close to θ(x̂MAP), and we would like to recover those as well. As an alternative to MCMC methods for sampling from the Gibbs distribution in (1), we can draw samples by perturbing the potential function and solving the resulting MAP problem. The MAP perturbation approach adds a random function γ : X → R to the potential function in (1) and solves the resulting MAP problem:\nx̂R−MAP = argmax x∈X\n{θ(x) + γ(x)} . (4)\nThe random function γ(·) associates a random variable to each x ∈ X . The simplest approach to designing a perturbation function is to associate an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variable γ(x) for each x ∈ X . We can find the distribution of the randomized MAP predictor in (4) when {γ(x) : x ∈ X} are i.i.d.; in particular, suppose each γ(x) a Gumbel random variable with zero mean, variance π2/6, and cumulative distribution function\nG(y) = exp(− exp(−(y + c))), (5)\nwhere c ≈ 0.5772 is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. The following result characterizes the distribution of the randomized predictor x̂R−MAP in (4).\nTheorem 1. Gumbel and Lieblein [1954] Let Γ = {γ(x) : x ∈ X} be a collection of i.i.d. Gumbel random variables whose distribution is given by (5). Then\nlogZ = EΓ [ max x∈X {θ(x) + γ(x)} ] , (6)\nexp(θ(x̂))\nZ = PΓ\n( x̂ = argmax\nx∈X {θ(x) + γ(x)}\n) .\nThe max-stability of the Gumbel distribution provides a straightforward approach to generate unbiased samples from the Gibbs distribution – simply generate the perturbations in Γ and solve the problem in (4). However, because Γ contains |X | i.i.d. random variables, this approach to inference has complexity which is exponential in n."

      "text" : "Sampling from the Gibbs distribution is inherently tied to estimating the partition function in (2). If we could compute Z exactly, then we could sample x1 with probability proportional to∑\nx2,...,xn exp(θ(x)), and for each subsequent dimension i, sample xi with probability proportional to ∑\nxi+1,...,xn exp(θ(x)), yielding a Gibbs sampler. However, this involves computing the partition\nfunction, which is hard. Instead, Hazan et al. [2013] use the representation in (6) to derive a family of self-reducible upper bounds on Z and then use these upper bounds in an iterative algorithm that samples from the Gibbs distribution using low dimensional random MAP perturbations. This gives a method which has complexity linear in n.\nIn the following, instead of the |X | independent random variables in (4), we define the random function γ(x) in (4) as the sum of independent random variables for each coordinate xi of x:\nγ(x) = n∑ i=1 γi(xi).\nThis function involves generating ∑n\ni=1 |Xi| random variables for each i and xi ∈ Xi. Let Γ = n⋃ i=1 {γi(xi) : xi ∈ Xi}\nbe a collection of ∑\ni |Xi| i.i.d. Gumbel random variables with distribution (5). The sampling algorithm in Algorithm 1 uses these random perturbations to draw unbiased samples from the Gibbs distribution. For a fixed x1:(j−1) = (x1, . . . , xj−1), define\nVj = max xj:n θ(x) + n∑ i=j γi(xi)  . (7) The sampler proceeds sequentially – for each j it constructs a distribution pj(·) on Xj ∪{r}, where r indicates a “restart” and attempts to draw an assignment for xj . If it draws r then it starts over again from j = 1, and if it draws an element in Xj it fixes xj to that element and proceeds to j+ 1.\nImplementing Algorithm 1 requires estimating the expectations EΓ[Vj ] in (7). In this paper we show how to estimate EΓ[Vj ] and bound the error with high probability by taking the sample mean of M i.i.d. copies of Vj . Specifically, we show that the estimation error decays exponentially with M . To do this we derive a new measure concentration result by proving a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality for the product of Gumbel random variables. To do so we derive a more general result – a Poincaré inequality for log-concave distributions that may not be log-strongly concave, i.e., for which the second derivative of the exponent is not bounded away from zero.\nAlgorithm 1 Sampling with low-dimensional random MAP perturbations from the Gibbs distribution [Hazan et al., 2013]\nIterate over j = 1, ..., n, while keeping fixed x1:(j−1)\n1. For each xj ∈ Xj , set pj(xj) = exp(EΓ[Vj+1])exp(EΓ[Vj ]) , where Vj is given by (7)\n2. Set pj(r) = 1− ∑\nxj∈Xj p(xj)\n3. Sample an element in Xj ∪{r} according to pj(·). If r is sampled then reject and restart with j = 1. Otherwise, fix the sampled element xj and continue the iterations\nOutput: x = (x1, ..., xn)"

      "text" : "We can think of the maximum value of the perturbed MAP problem as a function of the associated perturbation variables Γ = {γi(xi) : i ∈ [n], xi ∈ Xi}. There are m ∆ = |X1| + |X2| + · · · + |Xn| i.i.d. random variables in Γ. For practical purposes, e.g., to estimate the quality of the sampling algorithm in Algorithm 1, it is important to evaluate the deviation of its sampled mean from its expectation. For notational simplicity we would only describe the deviation of the maximum value of the perturbed MAP from its expectation, namely\nF (Γ) = V1 − E [V1] . (8)\nSince the expectation is a linear function, E [F ] = ∫ F (Γ)dµ(Γ) = 0 is zero, with respect to any measure µ on Γ. The deviation of F (Γ) is dominated by its moment generating function\nΛ(λ) ∆ = E [exp(λF )] . (9)\nThat is, for every λ > 0,\nP (F (γ) ≥ r) ≤ Λ(λ)/ exp(−λr).\nMany measure concentration results such as McDiarmid’s inequality rely on bounds on the variation of F (Γ). Unfortunately, this does not hold for MAP perturbations and instead we use the logSobolev approach bound (9). Specifically, we want to construct a differential bound on the λ−scaled cumulant generating function:\nH(λ) ∆ =\n1 λ log Λ(λ). (10)\nFirst note that that by L’Hôpital’s rule H(0) = Λ ′(0) Λ(0) = ∫ Fdµn = 0, so we may represent H(λ) by\nintegrating its derivative: H(λ) = ∫ λ\n0 H ′(λ̂)dλ̂. Thus to bound the moment generating function it\nsuffices to bound H ′(λ) ≤ α(λ) for some function α(λ). A direct computation of H ′(λ) translates this bound to\nλΛ′(λ)− Λ(λ) log Λ(λ) ≤ λ2Λ(λ)α(λ). (11)\nThe left side of (11) turns out to be the so-called functional entropy Ledoux [2001] of the function h = exp(λF ) with respect to a measure µ:\nEntµ(h) ∆ = ∫ h log hdµ− (∫ hdµ ) log ∫ hdµ.\nUnlike McDiarmid’s inequality, this approach provides measure concentration for unbounded functions, such those arising from MAP perturbations.\nA log-Sobolev inequality upper-bounds the entropy Entµ(h) in terms of an integral involving ‖∇F‖2. They are appealing to derive measure concentration results in product spaces, i.e., for functions of subsets of variables Γ, because it is sufficient to prove a log-Sobolev inequality on a single variable function f . Given such a scalar result, the additivity property of the entropy (e.g., [Boucheron et al., 2004]) extends the inequality to functions F of many variables. In this work we derive a log-Sobolev inequality for the Gumbel distribution, by bounding the variance of a function by its derivative:\nVarµ(f) ∆ = ∫ f2dµ− (∫ fdµ )2 ≤ C ∫ |f ′|2dµ. (12)\nThis is called a Poincaré inequality, proven originally for the Gaussian case. We prove such an inequality for the Gumbel distribution, which then implies the log-Sobolev inequality and hence measure concentration. We then apply the result to the MAP perturbation framework."

      "text" : "We are interested in efficient sampling from the Gibbs distribution in (1) when n is large an the model is complex due to the amount of data and the domain-specific modeling. This is often done with MCMC (cf. Koller and Friedman [2009]), which may be challenging in ragged probability landscapes. MAP perturbations use efficient MAP solvers as black box, but the statistical properties of the solutions, beyond Theorem 1, are still being studied. Papandreou and Yuille [2011] consider probability models that are defined by the maximal argument of randomly perturbed potential function, while Tarlow et al. [2012] considers sampling techniques for such models and Keshet et al. [2011] explores the generalization bounds for such models. Rather than focus on the statistics of the solution (the argmaxx) we study statistical properties of the MAP value (the maxx) of the estimate in (4).\nHazan and Jaakkola [2012] used the random MAP perturbation framework to derive upper bounds on the partition function in (2), and Hazan et al. [2013] derived the unbiased sampler in Algorithm 1. Both of these approaches involve computing an expectation over the distribution of the MAP perturbation, which can be estimated by sample averages. This paper derives new measure concentration results that bound the error of this estimate in terms of the number of samples, making Algorithm 1 practical.\nMeasure concentration has appeared in many machine learning analyses, most commonly to bound the rate of convergence for risk minimization, either via empirical risk minimization (ERM) (e.g., Bartlett and Mendelson [2003]) or in PAC-Bayesian approaches (e.g., McAllester [2003]). In these applications the function for which we want to show concentration is “well-behaved” in the sense that the underlying random variables are bounded or the function satisfies some boundeddifference or self-bounded conditions conditions, so measure concentration follows from inequalities\nsuch as Bernstein [1946], Azuma-Hoeffding [Azuma, 1967, Hoeffding, 1963, McDiarmid, 1989], or Bousquet [2003]. However, in our setting, the Gumbel random variables are not bounded, and random perturbations may result in unbounded changes of the perturbed MAP value.\nThere are several results on measure concentration for Lipschitz functions of Gaussian random variables (c.f. Maurey and Pisier [1986]). In this work we use logarithmic Sobolev inequalities Ledoux [2001] and prove a new measure concentration result for Gumbel random variables. To do this we generalize a classic result of Brascamp and Lieb [1976] on Poincaré inequalities to non-strongly log-concave distributions, and also recover the concentration result of Bobkov and Ledoux [1997] for functions of Laplace random variables."

      "text" : "Our Theorem 2 in this section generalizes a celebrated result of Brascamp and Lieb [1976, Theorem 4.1] to a wider family of log-concave distributions and strictly improves their result. For an appropriately scaled convex function Q on R, the function q(y) = exp(−Q(y)) defines a density on R corresponding to a log concave measure µ. Unfortunately, their result is restricted to distributions for which Q(y) is strongly convex. The Gumbel distribution with CDF (5) has density\ng(y) = exp (− (y + c+ exp(−(y + c)))) , (13)\nand the second derivative of y+c+exp(−(y+c)) cannot be lower bounded by any constant greater than 0, so it is not log-strongly convex.\nTheorem 2. Let µ be a log-concave measure with density q(y) = exp(−Q(y)), where Q : R→ R is convex function satisfying the following conditions:\n• Q has a unique minimum in a point y = a\n• Q is twice continuously differentiable in each point of his domain, except possibly in y = a\n• Q′(y) 6= 0 for any y 6= a\n• limy→a± Q′(y) 6= 0 or limy→a± Q′′(y) 6= 0\nLet f : R→ R a continuous function, differentiable almost everywhere, such that\nlim y→±∞ f(y)q(y) = 0, (14)\nthen for any 0 ≤ η < 1, such that Q ′′(y) |Q′(y)| + η|Q ′(y)| 6= 0, ∀y ∈ R \\ {a}, we have\nVarµ(f) ≤ 1\n1− η ∫ R\n(f ′(y))2\nQ′′(y) + η(Q′(y))2 q(y)dy.\nProof. The proof is based on the one in Brascamp and Lieb [1976], but it uses a different strategy in the final critical steps. We first observe that for any K ∈ R,\nVarµ(f) ≤ ∫ R (f(y)−K)2dµ, (15)\nso we will focus on bounding the left-hand side of (15) for the particular choice of K = h(a).\nLet f̃(y) ∆ = f(y)− f(a) and U(y) ∆= f̃(y) 2q(y) Q′(y) . Note that dµ = q(y)dy. We have that\nU ′(y) = 2f̃ ′(y)f̃(y)q(y)\nQ′(y) − f̃(y)2q(y)\n( Q′′(y)\n(Q′(y))2 + 1\n) .\nRearranging terms and integrating, we see that∫ f̃(y)2q(y)dy = ∫ ( 2f̃ ′(y)f̃(y)\nQ′(y) − f̃(y)\n2Q′′(y)\n(Q′(y))2\n) q(y)dy − U(y).\nWe now consider the integral between −∞ and a (analogous reasoning holds for the one between a and +∞). We claim that limy→a− U(y) = 0. There are two possible cases: Q′(a) 6= 0 and Q′(a) = 0. In the first case the claim is obvious, in the second case we have limy→a− f̃(y)2 Q′(y) = limy→a− 2f ′(y)f̃(y) Q′′(y) = 0, and anagously for the limit from the left. Using (14) too, we have∫ a\n−∞ f̃(y)2q(y)dy = lim →0− ∫ a+ −∞ ( 2f̃ ′(y)f̃(y) Q′(y) − f̃(y) 2Q′′(y) (Q′(y))2 ) q(y)dy\n≤ lim →0− ∫ a+ −∞ ( 2|f̃ ′(y)||f̃(y)| |Q′(y)| − f̃(y) 2Q′′(y) (Q′(y))2 ) q(y)dy\n≤ lim →0− ∫ a+ −∞ ( f̃ ′(y)2 Q′′(y) + η(Q′(y))2 + ηf̃(y)2 ) q(y)dy,\nwhere in the second inequality we used 2αβ ≤ α2ζ + β 2ζ, for any α, ζ ∈ R and ζ > 0, with α = |f̃ ′(y)|, β = |f̃(x)|, and ζ = Q ′′(y) |Q′(y)| + η|Q\n′(y)|. Reasoning in the same way for the interval [a,+∞), reordering the terms, and using (15), we have the result.\nThe main difference between Theorem 2 and the result of Brascamp and Lieb [1976, Theorem 4.1] is that the latter requires the function Q to be strongly convex. Our result holds for non-strongly concave functions including the Laplace and Gumbel distributions. If we take η = 0 in Theorem 2 we recover the original result of Brascamp and Lieb [1976, Theorem 4.1]. For the case η = 1/2, Theorem 2 yields the Poincaré inequality for the Laplace distribution given in Ledoux [2001]. Like the Gumbel distribution, the Laplace distribution is not strongly log-concave and previously required an alternative technique to prove measure concentration Ledoux [2001]. The following gives a Poincaré inequality for the Gumbel distribution.\nCorollary 1. Let µ be the measure corresponding to the Gumbel distribution and q(y) = g(y) in (13). For any function f that satisfies the conditions in Theorem 2, we have\nVarµ(f) ≤ 4 ∫ R (f ′(y))2dµ. (16)\nProof. For the Gumbel distribution we have Q(y) = y + c+ exp(−(y + c)) in Theorem 2, so\nQ′′(y) + η(Q′(y))2 = e−(y+c) + η(1− e−(y+c))2.\nWe want an lower bound for all y. Minimizing,\ne−(y+c) = 2η(1− e−(y+c))e−(y+c)\nor e−(y+c) = 1− 12η , so the lower bound is 1− 1 2η + 1 4η or 4η−1 4η for η > 1 2 . For η ≤ 1 2 ,\nη + (1− 2η)e−(y+c) + e−2(y+c) ≥ η.\nSo min {\n4η (4η−1)(1−η) , 1 η(1−η) } = 4 at η = 12 , so applying Theorem 2 we obtain (16)."

Gumbel random variables whose gradient satisfies ‖∇Vj‖ 2 = n − j + 1 and ‖∇Vj‖∞ = 1 almost everywhere, so a 2 = n− j+ 1 and b = 1. Suppose U = Vj −E [Vj ] is a random variable that measures the deviation of Vj from its expectation, and assume we sample Mj i.i.d. random variable U1, U2, . . . , UMj . We then estimate this deviation by the sample mean 1 Mj ∑Mj i=1 Ui. Applying Corollary 2 to both Vj and −Vj to get the following bound with probability 1− δ:∣∣∣∣∣∣ 1Mj Mj∑ i=1 Ui ∣∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ max ( 20 Mj log 2 δ , √ 20(n− j + 1) Mj log 2 δ ) . (19)\nFor each j in Algorithm 1, we must estimate |Xj | expectations EΓ[Vj+1], for a total at most m expectation estimates. For any > 0 we can choose {Mj : j = 1, . . . , n} so that the right side of (19) is at most for each j with probability 1 − nδ. Let p̂j(xj) be the ratio estimated in the first step of Algorithm 1, and δ′ = nδ. Then with probability 1 − δ′, for all j = 1, 2, . . . , n, exp(E[Vj+1]− ) exp(E[Vj ]+ ) ≤ p̂j(xj) ≤ exp(E[Vj+1]+ ) exp(E[Vj ]− ) , or\nexp(−2 ) ≤ p̂j(xj) pj(xj) ≤ exp(2 )."

Each spin has a local field parameter θi(xi) = θixi and interacts in a grid shaped graphical structure with couplings θi,j(xi, xj) = θi,jxixj . Whenever the coupling parameters\nare positive the model is called attractive since adjacent variables give higher values to positively correlated configurations. We used low dimensional random perturbations γ(x) = ∑n i=1 γi(xi).\nThe local field parameters θi were drawn uniformly at random from [−1, 1] to reflect high signal. The parameters θi,j were drawn uniformly from [0, c], where c ∈ [0, 4] to reflect weak, medium and strong coupling potentials. As these spin glass models are attractive, we are able to use the graphcuts algorithm (Kolmogorov [2006]) to compute the MAP perturbations efficiently. Throughout our experiments we evaluated the expected value of F (Γ) with 100 different samples of Γ. We note that we have two random variables γi(xi) for each of the spins in the 100 × 100 model, thus Γ consists of m = 2 ∗ 104 random variables.\nFigure 1 shows the error in the sample mean 1M ∑M\nk=1 F (Γk) versus the coupling strength for three different sample sizes M = 1, 5, 10. The error reduces rapidly as M increases; only 10 samples are needed to estimate the expected value of a random MAP perturbation with 104 variables. To test our measure concentration result, that ensures exponential decay, we measure the deviation of the sample mean from its expectation by using M = 1, 5, 10 samples. Figure 2 shows the histogram of the sample mean, i.e., the number of times that the sample mean has error more than r from the true mean. One can see that the decay is indeed exponential for every M , and that for larger M the decay is much faster. These show that by understanding the measure concentration properties\nof MAP perturbations, we can efficiently estimate the mean with high probability, even in very high dimensional spin-glass models."

      "text" : "Sampling from the Gibbs distribution is important because it helps find near-maxima in posterior probability landscapes that are typically encountered in the high dimensional complex models. These landscapes are often ragged due to domain-specific modeling (coupling) and the influence of data (signal), making MCMC challenging. In contrast, sampling based on MAP perturbations ignores the ragged landscape as it directly targets the most plausible structures. In this paper we characterized the statistics of MAP perturbations.\nTo apply the low-dimensional MAP perturbation technique in practice, we must estimate the expected value of the quantities Vj under the perturbations. We derived high-probability estimates of these expectations that allow estimation with arbitrary precision. To do so we proved more general results on measure concentration for functions of Gumbel random variables and a Poincaré inequality for non-strongly log-concave distributions. These results hold in generality and may be of use in other applications.\nThe results here can be taken in a number of different directions. MAP perturbation models are related PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds, so it may be possible to derive PAC-Bayesian bounds for unbounded loss functions using our tools. Such loss functions may exclude certain configurations and are already used implicitly in computer vision applications such as interactive segmentations. More generally, Poincaré inequalities relate the variance of a function and its derivatives. Our result may suggest new stochastic gradient methods that control variance via controlling gradients. This connection between variance and gradients may be useful in the analysis of other learning algorithms and applications."

By maximizing a randomly perturbed potential function, MAP perturbations generate unbiased samples from the Gibbs distribution. Unfortunately, the computational cost of generating so many high-dimensional random variables can be prohibitive. More efficient algorithms use sequential sampling strategies based on the expected value of low dimensional MAP perturbations. This paper develops new measure concentration inequalities that bound the number of samples needed to estimate such expected values. Applying the general result to MAP perturbations can yield a more efficient algorithm to approximate sampling from the Gibbs distribution. The measure concentration result is of general interest and may be applicable to other areas involving expected estimations.",
