      "text" : "Data privacy has become an increasingly important issue in the age of data science. Differential Privacy (DP), proposed in 2006 by Dwork et al.,[11], provide a solid foundation and rigorous standard for private data analysis. Since then, there has been extensive literature studying the fundamental trade-offs between differential privacy and accuracy for query answering [16, 15, 34, 40], machine learning [4, 5, 30, 39], and statistical inference [27, 31]. For more details on DP results, please refer to the excellent monograph written by Dwork and Roth [12]. Intuitively, a DP algorithm uses randomized response to defend against adversary, so that change of one of data points could not be detected.\nDespite the prevailing success of this notion in academia, its applicability in data science practice could be limited. For example, if data analysts just promise to follow the differential privacy constraints, user will not feel their privacy are preserved. The promise could not be validated; the mechanisms are complicated; and even worse: users do not trust the data collector at all. Unfortunately, most of differential privacy algorithms are based on adding noise calibrated to stability of loss function, which essentially requires access to original data.\n∗These two authors contributed equally †zhengk92@pku.edu.cn ‡mouwenlong@pku.edu.cn §wanglw@cis.pku.edu.cn\nBorrowing ideas from classical wisdom on collecting sensitive survey data [41], Local Differential Privacy (LDP) [22, 9] was proposed as a stronger notion of privacy to resolve this problem. LDP requires each of data points to be passed through a noisy channel during collection. This channel will ensure one can hardly tell anything about the user based on what he have sent. The practical advantage of LDP is obvious: users will be comfortable sending their sensitive information through noisy channels, which are transparent and reliable; additionally, users can choose their own privacy parameters, making it possible to associate with economic value. Therefore, this line of research has attracted lots of attention [8, 9, 19, 1, 18].\nDespite the analogy in definition, the way in which LDP achieves accurate results are fundamentally different from classical DP. Essentially, the information collected from each user is almost completely noisy, from which one needs to obtain accurate results. The only way to do that is to make the independently distributed noise cancel out with each other in some sense. With sand being washed away by waves, golds begin to appear.\nTwo local privacy notions have been discussed in existing literature: the interactive model allows the algorithm to collect data sequentially, and decide what to ask based on information from previously asked users. The non-interactive model, on the contrary, requires all data to be collected at once, with no interactive queries allowed. Apparently the non-interactive model is strictly stronger, and prohibition on interactive queries rules out most of SGD-type approaches, making the problem significantly harder. However, non-interactive LDP is more useful in real-world applications, as opportunities of interactive queries may not be available in most settings.\nIn existing literature, learning and inference under interactive and non-interactive LDP therefore are exhibiting different appearances. In the interactive world, LDP is promised with connection to Statistical Query (SQ) model [25], from its very beginning [24]. SQ algorithms for a wide range of convex ERM problems were proposed by [13], implying good risk bounds for LDP. [9] established matching upper and lower bounds for convex risk minimization problems. On the other hand, very few has been done in the non-interactive setting. Existing works primarily focus on basic estimation problems such as means and discrete densities [8, 7, 1], or some function calculations [21]. Most of important modern learning and inference tasks, including estimation in linear models and convex ERM, are still poorly understood in non-interactive local DP settings.\nFor the high-dimensional world, where d ≫ n while some low-complexity constraints are imposed, we may hope the error induced by privacy constraints to be logarithmically dependent upon d. In classical differential privacy literature, this has been be addressed using different techniques, guarantee error bounds logarithmically dependent on dimension [33, 32]. However, lower bounds have been shown in local privacy model even for high-dimensional 1-sparse mean estimation, ruling out any good guarantees [7]. The lower bound result illustrates fundamental difficulties of local differential privacy. But if we still want to do high-dimensional learning under local privacy, are there additional assumptions that helps?\nTherefore, the starting point of this work lies on making learning possible under the noninteractive LDP setting, which is the hardest yet the most useful. We initiate the first attempt towards a broad range of learning tasks beyond simple distribution estimation. In particular, we investigate two important classes of problems under non-interactive LDP: (1) High-dimensional sparse linear regression and mean estimation; (2) Generalized linear models. Our focus is to design corresponding mechanisms and study their convergence rates with respect to the number and dimension of data. One can also consider optimal mechanisms in terms of privacy parameters like [14], which is of independent interests.\nOur Contributions: In this paper, we propose several efficient algorithms for learning and estimation problems under non-interactive LDP model, with good theoretical guarantees. In the following we summarize our contributions.\n(1) High Dimensional Estimation: One of exciting findings in this paper is about local privacy for high-dimensional data. Roughly speaking, convergence rate with logarithmic dependence on the dimension can be attained under LDP, if we assume data points are ℓ2 bounded. This is in sharp contrast with information-theoretic lower bounds for 1-sparse mean estimation for ℓ∞ bounded data [7]. Valid algorithms are presented for both sparse mean estimation and sparse linear regression, respectively. Intuitively, non-interactivity doesn’t bring about additional difficulties, since the loss functions are quadratic forms. However, if we directly add noise to each of data points and send it to the server, the aggregated noise will lead to linear dependence on the dimension. Thus we adopt the random projection technique, and send the noisy version of projected data to the server. Based on the aggregated information, we can approximately recover the optimal solution via linear inverse problem.\n(2) Learning Smooth Generalized Linear Models: Generalized linear problems which has additional smooth properties (we call the loss with respect to it as smooth generalized linear loss (SGLL), see rigorous definition in section 2) include many common loss functions, such as logistic loss, square loss, etc. Optimizing such losses are intuitively much more difficult in noninteractive LDP model, as the loss can be an arbitrary function wTx. This even makes it difficult for us to obtain an unbiased estimator for objective function, or its gradient. As a result, when we aggregate the loss of noisy data together, it is even hard to ensure it converge to the population loss. Approximation theory techniques are introduced to tackle this problem. In particular, we use polynomials of wTx to approximate nonlinear coefficients of gradients. Chebyshev bases, instead of Taylor series, are used to get faster convergence within an arbitrary domain. Then we are able to build inexact stochastic gradient oracles to arbitrarily specified accuracy. SIGM algorithm in [10] is exploited to find the minimizer with inexact gradients.\nOther Related Work: Local privacy dates back to [41], who uses random responses to protect privacy in surveys. In recent LDP literature, both [8] and [18] studied density estimation methods and their theoretical behaviors in LDP model. Rather than statistical setting in above two work, [1] considered how to produce frequent items and corresponding frequencies of a dataset in local model. Besides, [19] investigated optimality of LDP mechanisms based on information theoretical measures for statistical discrimination.\nApproximation techniques are commonly used in DP literature. [34] employed polynomials for marginal queries. [40] leveraged trigonometric polynomials to answer smooth queries. [43] also used polynomial approximations and get basic convergence results in standard DP model. Besides, the random projection and recovery has also been used in DP learning [23] and local DP histogram estimation [1].\nIn standard DP model, both high-dimensional sparse estimation and generalized linear model have been intensively studied. [26] and [32] considered the convergence of private LASSO estimator under RSC and incoherence assumptions. [33] considered constrained ERM of sparse linear regression, and obtained Õ(log d/n2/3) rate using private Frank-Wolfe. Above results assume ℓ∞-bounded data. By stronger assumption of ℓ2 bounded data, [23] gave a general framework for high dimensional empirical risk minimization (ERM) problem. There are several works to estimate generalized linear model under DP, with a particular emphasis on logistic regression. Objective and output perturbation are used to get low excess risks [4, 5]. Both [2] and [42] considered concrete private algorithms to solve ERM. None of these existing results extends directly to non-interactive LDP setting."

      "text" : "In this section, we propose a non-interactive LDP mechanism for high-dimensional sparse mean estimation problem. By assuming ℓ2 bounded data points, and ℓ1 bounded population mean, we can get error rates with logarithmic dependence on d. Our results are in sharp contrast with the lower bound for ℓ2-bounded general mean estimation under standard DP [2], as well as the lower bound for ℓ∞-bounded 1-sparse mean estimation under local DP [7]. It can be easily seen that our method extends to mean estimation problem for arbitrary low-complexity constraint set in high dimensions. We state our results in ℓ1 setting to keep the arguments clear. Our problem adopts a statistical estimation setting as follows:\nℓ2-bounded sparse mean estimation Suppose there is an unknown distribution D supported on B(0, 1), with ‖ED(x)‖1 ≤ Λ.

We are primarily using two techniques: random projection and recovery from low-complexity structures; median-of-mean estimator to boost failure probability. The privacy argument is directly implication\nof Theorem 1. Intuitively, adding noise to each entry of mean vector will result in error rate’s linear dependence on d. Thus we adopt the random projection technique to send a compressed version of data vector through the noisy channel. This locally private estimation procedure can be viewed as a variant of noisy compressed sensing, where ℓ2 recovery rate is fundamentally controlled by the Gaussian Mean Width of constraint set [38]. Though the distribution has bounded support, the concentration for mean estimation is dimension-dependent, while dimension-independent Markov Inequalities hold. To tackle this problem, we employ Median-of-Mean estimator to get exponential tails [17].\nWe first give the following bound on the error in projected space.\nLemma 3. Let x1,x2, · · · ,xn ∼ i.i.d.D with µ = ED[x] and supp(D) ⊆ B(0, 1). Let G and {yi}ni=1 defined in the above procedure.

The tail properties are guaranteed in the following lemma:\nLemma 4 (Proposition 9 in [17]). Suppose in metric space X , a set of points M = [θ1,θ2, · · · ,θm] ∼ i.i.d.D, with Pr[dX (θi,θ) ≥ ǫ] ≤ 23 . Let θ̂ be generated from the following procedure: ri = min {\nr : |BX (θi, r) ∩M| ≥ m2 } ,and θ̂ = argminθi ri. Then we have:\nPr[dX (θ̂,θ) ≥ 3ǫ] ≤ e− m 18\nSince the original data are i.i.d. samples from underlying distribution, small group with fixed indices should also be i.i, d.. Therefore µ1,µ2, · · · ,µk are i.i.d.. Combining Lemma 3 and Lemma 4 we get the following result:\nCorollary 1.

We subtract a quadratic term to ensure unbiasedness and project to PSD matrices to preserve convexity. To show good approximation guarantee, we make use of RIP bounds for random projection. As the loss function is determined by inner products between w and data, it could be uniformly preserved in projected space, which guarantees the accuracy of solution estimated with local privacy. Apparently, our methods also imply bounds with general low-complexity constraint set that preserves RIP.\nOur private learning mechanism is given in Algorithm 3 and any random projection matrix can be used here.

Non-interactive LDP learning for this problem is essentially difficult, as it is even hard to obtain an unbiased estimator of gradient. We resolve this problem using Chebyshev polynomial expansion, which requires additional smoothness assumptions. Fortunately these assumptions are naturally satisfied by a broad range of learning tasks.\nWe will first define the Smooth GLM loss family with appropriate assumptions. Our definition could be shown with connection to exponential family GLM, which is commonly used in machine learning. We also illustrate our algorithm and guarantees with logistic regression.\nDefinition 2. (Absolutely Smooth Functions) We say that an univariate function h(x) is absolutely smooth, if for any r > 0, f(x) := h(rx) satisfies the following properties: there exist functions µ1(k; r), µ2(k; r), which are polynomial on k and µ2(k; r) = O(kr), such that for any k ∈ N+, there is:\n(1) f(x), f ′(x), . . . , f (k−1)(x) are absolutely continuous on [−1, 1];\n(2) ∥ ∥f (k)(x) ∥ ∥ T 6 µ1(k; r) · µ2(k; r)k.\nDefinition 3. (Smooth Generalized Linear Loss, SGLL) A loss function ℓ(w;x, y), is called smooth generalized linear loss, if for any given data (x, y), ℓ(w;x, y) is convex and β-smooth with respect to w, and there exist absolutely smooth functions h1(x), h2(x), such that ℓ(w;x, y) = −yh1(xTw)+ h2(x Tw).\nIt will be convenient to consider population risk directly. Now, we adopt standard setting of learning problems, where each data point (x, y) is drawn from some underlying unknown distribution D and ‖x‖2 6 1. Given a SGLL ℓ(w;x, y), the population loss is defined as L(w) := E(x,y)∼Dℓ(w;x, y).\nFor simplicity, instead of assuming w belongs to B2(r), we use the following equivalent notation: ℓ(w;x, y) = −yh1(rxTw) + h2(rxTw), and the constraint set for w is C = B2(1). Denote G(w;x, y) = ∇ℓ(w;x, y) = rm(w;x, y)x, where m(w;x, y) = h′2(rxTw) − yh′1(rxTw). Suppose E(x,y)∼D[‖G(w;x, y)− g(w)‖22] 6 σ20, where g(w) = ∇L(w). This is a common assumption in stochastic optimization literature, such as [3].\nGiven any α > 0, we hope to design a noninteractive local DP mechanism with low sample complexity, such that the final output point wpriv satisfies L(wpriv)− L(w∗) 6 α.\nFor GLM loss functions, it is easy to see that the stochastic gradient evaluated on w with data point xi is at the same direction with xi. So adding isotropic noise to xi provides \"unbiased\" information about direction of stochastic gradient. However, the magnitude is a nonlinear function of wTxi, making it hard for SGD even to converge to population minimizer. This is why we seek to find polynomial approximation of the magnitude of gradients.\nTo estimate the magnitude of gradients, we use Chebyshev polynomials to approximate nonlinear univariate function fi(x) = h ′ i(rx), where x ∈ [−1, 1]. For brevity of notations, we just use f(x) to represent either f1(x) or f2(x). Denote the Chebyshev approximation with degree p as f̂p(x) = 1 2 + ∑p k=1 akTk(x), where Tk(x) is the k-th Chebyshev polynomial, and ak = 2 π ∫ 1 −1 f(x)Tk(x)√ 1−x2 dx is the corresponding coefficient. According to existing results about Chebyshev approximations and some calculations, we have the following lemma:\nLemma 8.

In particular, for sparse linear regression and mean\nestimation problem, we propose efficient algorithms and prove the polynomial dependence of excess risk or square error over log d and 1n , which is exactly to be expected in high dimensional case. We also extend our methods to nonparametric case and show good bounds for Kernel Ridge Regression.\nFor more difficult smooth generalized linear loss optimization problems, we use private Chebyshev approximations to estimate gradients of the objective loss, combined with existing inexact gradient descent methods to obtain final outputs. The sample complexity of our mechanism is quasi-polynomial with respect to 1α , where α is the desired population excess risk.\nAn interesting open problem is whether our theoretical guarantees are optimal. If not, how to improve them while preserving the efficiency in non-interactive LDP model. We think these problems are critical to understand LDP in the future."

Besides, there is an one-to-one continuous differentiable transformation g(·) such that g(b′(θ)) = xTw∗.\nAccording to the key equality g(b′(θ)) = xTw∗, usually we can obtain smooth function θ = h1(x\nTw∗), b(θ) = h2(xTw∗), and what’s more, univariate function hi(x)(i = 1, 2) satisfies the absolutely smooth property.\nFor such GLM, if we consider optimizing the expected negative logarithmic probability −E(x,y)∼D log p(x, y;w), once discarding unrelated terms tow, we obtain the new population loss, L(w) := E(x,y)∼Dℓ(w;x, y), where ℓ(w;x, y) = −yh1(xTw) + h2(xTw), exactly the form of smooth generalized linear loss defined in section 4. Hence our SGLL is a natural loss defined by GLM with additional smoothness assumptions.\nA.2.2 Omitted proofs\nLemma 8.

    "abstractText" : "Non-interactive Local Differential Privacy (LDP) requires data analysts to collect data from users through noisy channel at once. In this paper, we extend the frontiers of Non-interactive LDP learning and estimation from several aspects. For learning with smooth generalized linear losses, we propose an approximate stochastic gradient oracle estimated from non-interactive LDP channel using Chebyshev expansion, which is combined with inexact gradient methods to obtain an efficient algorithm with quasi-polynomial sample complexity bound. For the highdimensional world, we discover that under l2-norm assumption on data points, high-dimensional sparse linear regression and mean estimation can be achieved with logarithmic dependence on dimension, using random projection and approximate recovery. We also extend our methods to Kernel Ridge Regression. Our work is the first one that makes learning and estimation possible for a broad range of learning tasks under non-interactive LDP model.",
