This problem received much attention, using different methods (see e.g. [1] or Chapter 21 in [2]). Most of those methods assume fixing a class H of models or “hypotheses”, each of which defines a probability measure on sequences of observations (and also conditional probability measures), and produce a forecast FH which satisfies at least one of two kinds of guarantees:\n• In the realizable setting, the guarantee is that if the observations are sampled from some µ ∈ H, then FH converges to an “ideal” forecast in some sense.\n• In the unrealizable setting, the guarantee is that for any sequence of observations, FH is asymptotically as good as the forecast produced by any µ ∈ H.\nThe realizable setting is often unrealistic, in particular because it requires that the environment under observation is simpler than the observer itself. Indeed, even though we avoid analyzing computational complexity in this work, it should be noted that the computational (e.g. time) complexity of a forecaster is always greater than the complexities of all µ ∈ H. On the other hand, the unrealizable setting usually only provides guarantees for short-term forecasts (since otherwise the training data is insufficient). The latter is in contrast to e.g. Bayesian inference where the time to learn the model depends on its prior probability, but once “learned” (i.e. once FH converged to a given total variation distance from the true probability measure), arbitrarily long-term forecasts become reliable.\nThe spirit of our approach is that the environment might be very complex, but at the same time it might posses some simple features, and it is these features that the forecast must capture. For example, if we consider a sequence of observations {on ∈ {0, 1}}n∈N s.t. o2k+1 = o2k, then whatever is the behavior of the even observations o2k, the property o2k+1 = o2k should asymptotically be assigned high probability by the forecast (this idea was discussed in [3] as “open problem 4j”).\nFormally, we introduce the notion of an incomplete model, which is a convex set M in the space P(Oω) of probability measures on the space of sequences Oω. Such an incomplete model may be regarded as a hybrid of probabilistic and Knightian uncertainty. We then consider a countable1 set H of incomplete models. For any M ∈ H and µ ∈ M , our forecasts will converge to M in an appropriate sense with µ-probability 1. This convergence theorem can be regarded as an analogue for incomplete models of Bayesian merging of opinions (see [4]), and is our main result. Our setting can be considered to be in between realizable and unrealizable: it is “partially realizable” since we require the environment to conform to some M ∈ H, it is “partially unrealizable” since µ ∈ M can be chosen adversarially (we can even allow non-oblivious choice, i.e. dependence on the forecast itself).\nThe forecasting method we demonstrate is based on the principles introduced in [5]. The forecast may be regarded as the pricing of a certain combinatorial prediction market, with a countable set of gamblers making bets. The market pricing is then defined by the requirement that the aggregate of all gamblers doesn’t make a net profit. The existence of such a pricing follows from the Kakutani-Glicksberg-Fan fixed point theorem and the Kuratowski-Rill-Nardzewski measurable selection theorem (the latter in order to show that the dependence on observation history can be made measurable). The fact that the aggregate of all gamblers cannot make a net profit implies that each individual gambler can only make a bounded profit.\nThe above method is fairly general, but for our purposes, we associate with each incomplete model M ∈ H a set of gamblers that make bets which are guaranteed to be profitable assuming the true environment µ satisfies the incomplete model (i.e. µ ∈ M). The existence of these gamblers follows from the Hahn-Banach separation theorem (where the incomplete model defines the convex set in question) and selection theorems used to ensure that the choice of separating functional depends in a sufficiently “regular” way on the market pricing. In order to show that the forecaster we described satisfies the desired convergence property, we use tools from martingale theory.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 defines the setting and states the main theorem. Section 3 lays out the formalism of “combinatorial prediction markets,” and the central concept of a dominant forecaster. Section 4 introduces the concept of a prudent gambling strategy, which is a technique for proving convergence theorems about dominant forecasters. Section 5 describes the gamblers associated with incomplete models and completes the proof of the main theorem.\n2 Learning Incomplete Models\nN will denote the set of natural numbers {0, 1, 2 . . .}. Let {On}n∈N be a sequence of compact Polish spaces. On represents the space of possible observations at time n. Denote On := ∏\nm<nOn and O ω :=\n∏\nn∈NOn. π O n : O ω → On is the\nprojection mapping and x:n := π O n (x). Given y ∈ O\nn, yOω := (\nπOn\n)−1 (y) is a closed subspace of\nOω. On will be regarded as a topological space using the product topology and as a measurable\n1This work only deals with the nonparametric setting in which H is discrete.\nspace with the σ-algebra of universally measurable sets2. For any measurable space X, P (X) will denote the space of probability measures on X. When X is a Polish space with the Borel σ-algebra, P (X) will be regarded as a topological space using the weak topology and as a measurable space using the σ-algebra of Borel sets. Given µ ∈ P (X), we denote suppµ ⊆ X the support of µ.\nDefinition 1. A forecaster F is a family of measurable mappings\n{Fn : O n → P(Oω)}n∈N\ns.t. suppFn (y) ⊆ yO ω.\nGiven a forecaster F and y ∈ On, Fn (y) represents the forecast corresponding to observation history y. The condition suppFn (y) ⊆ yO\nω reflects the obvious requirement of consistency with past observations.\nIn order to formulate a claim about forecast convergence, we will need a metric on P(Oω). Consider ρ : Oω×Oω → R a metrization of Oω. Let Lip (Oω, ρ) be the Banach space of ρ-Lipschitz functions on Oω, equipped with the norm\n‖f‖ρ := max x |f (x)|+ sup x 6=y\n|f (x)− f (y)|\nρ (x, y) (1)\nP(Oω) can be regarded as a compact subset of the dual space Lip (Oω, ρ)′, yielding the following metrization of P(Oω):\ndρKR (µ, ν) := sup ‖f‖ρ≤1\n( Eµ [f ]− Eν [f ] )\n(2)\nWe call dρKR the Kantorovich-Rubinstein metric 3. Fix any x ∈ Oω. It is easy to see that\nlim n→∞ max x′∈x:nOω\nρ ( x′, x ) = 0 (3)\nDenote δx ∈ P(O ω) the unique probability measure s.t. δx\n( {x} )\n= 1. It follows that for any sequence {µn ∈ P(O ω)}n∈N s.t. suppµn ⊆ x:nO ω\nlim n→∞\ndρKR (µn, δx) = 0 (4)\nTherefore, formulating a non-vacuous convergence theorem requires “renormalizing” dKR for each n ∈ N. To this end, we consider a sequence of metrizations of Oω: {ρn : O\nω ×Oω → R}n∈N. In the special case when On = O for all n ∈ N and some fixed space O, there is a natural class of metrizations with the property that ρn(yx, yx\n′) = ρ(x, x′) for some fixed metric ρ on Oω and any y ∈ On, x, x′ ∈ Oω4. We denote dnKR := d ρn KR.\n2The fact we use universally measurable sets rather than Borel sets will play an important role in the proof of Lemma 4.\n3This is slightly different from the conventional definition but strongly equivalent (i.e. each metric is bounded by a constant multiple of the other). Other names used in the literature for the strongly equivalent metric are “1st Wasserstein metric” and “earth mover’s distance.”\n4In this special case, the need for renormalization is a side effect of our choice of notation where the forecaster produces a probability measure over the entire sequence rather than over future observations only. Also, in this case the choice of ρ determines everything, since we only use Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance between measures with support in yOω for the same y ∈ On.\nAnother ingredient we will need is a notion of regular conditional probability for incomplete models. Given measurable spaces X and Y , we will use the notation K : X k −→ Y to denote a Markov kernel with source X and target Y . Given x ∈ X, we will use the notation K (x) ∈ P (Y ). Given µ ∈ P (X), µ ⋉ K ∈ P (X × Y ) denotes the semidirect product of µ and K, that is, the unique measure satisfying\n(µ⋉K)(A×B) =\n∫\nA\nK(x)(B)µ(dx) (5)\nK∗µ ∈ P (Y ) denotes the pushforward of µ by K (i.e. the pushforward of µ ⋉ K by the projection to Y ). When X,Y are Polish and π : X → Y is Borel measurable, µ | π : Y k −→ X is defined to be s.t. π∗µ ⋉ ( µ | π ) is supported on the graph of π and ( µ | π )\n∗ π∗µ = µ (i.e. µ | π is\na regular conditional probability). By the disintegration theorem, µ | π exists and is defined up to coincidence π∗µ-almost everywhere.\nDefinition 2. Let X,Y be compact Polish spaces, π : X → Y continuous and M ⊆ P(X). We say that N : Y → 2P(X) is a regular upper bound for M | π when\ni. The set graphN := {(y, µ) ∈ Y ×P(X) | µ ∈ N(y)} is closed.\nii. For every y ∈ On, N(y) is convex.\niii. For every µ ∈ M and π∗µ-almost every y ∈ Y , (µ | π)(y) ∈ N(y).\nNote that, although technically we haven’t assumedM is convex, we might as well have assumed it, since it is not hard to see that, if N is a regular upper bound for M | π and M ′ is the convex hull of M , then N is a regular upper bound for M ′ | π. The same remark applies to Theorem 1 below.\nWe give a few examples for Definition 2. The proofs that these examples are valid are in Appendix B.\nExample 1. Suppose thatM is convex and Y is a finite set (in particular, this example is applicable when the On are finite sets, X = O ω, Y = On and π = πOn ). Then, there is a unique N : Y → 2 P(X) which is a minimal (w.r.t. set inclusion) regular upper bound for M | π and we have\nN(y) = { ( µ | π−1(y) ) | µ ∈ M, µ ( π−1(y) ) > 0} (6)\nHere, µ | π−1(y) is the conditional probability measure.\nExample 2. Consider some I ⊆ N and suppose that for each n ∈ I, we are given Kn : O n k−→ On. Define MK by\nMK := {µ ∈ P(Oω) | ∀n ∈ I : πOn+1∗µ = π O n∗µ⋉Kn} (7)\nFor each n ∈ N, define MKn : O n → 2P(O ω) by\nMKn (y) = {µ ∈ P(O ω) | suppµ ⊆ yOω, ∀m ∈ I : m ≥ n =⇒ πOm+1∗µ = π O m∗µ⋉Km} (8)\nThen, MKn is a regular upper bound for M K | πOn .\nExample 3. Suppose that Y is a compact subset of Rd for some d ∈ N (in particular, this example is applicable when each On is a compact subset of R\ndn , X = Oω, Y = On and π = πOn ; in that case d = ∑\nm<n dn). We regard Y as a metric space using the Euclidean metric. For any y ∈ Y and r > 0, Br (y) will denote the open ball of radius r with center at y.\nFix any M ⊆ P(X). Then, there is a unique N : Y → 2P(X) which is minimal among mappings which both satisfy conditions i and ii of Definition 2 and are s.t. for any y ∈ Y , ν ∈ P(X) and\nµ ∈ M , if y ∈ suppπ∗µ and ν = limr→0\n(\nµ | π−1 ( Br (y) )\n)\n, then ν ∈ N(y) (the limit is defined\nusing the the weak topology). Moreover, N is a regular upper bound for M | π.\nWe are now ready to formulate the main result. Given a metric space X with metric ρ : X×X → R, x ∈ X and A ⊆ X, we will use the notation\nρ (x,A) := inf y∈A ρ (x, y) (9)\nTheorem 1. Fix any H ⊆ 2P(O ω) countable. For every M ∈ H and n ∈ N, let Mn be a regular upper bound for M | πOn . Then, there exists a forecaster F H s.t. for any M ∈ H, µ ∈ M and µ-almost any x ∈ Oω\nlim n→0\ndnKR\n( FHn (x:n) ,Mn (x:n) ) = 0 (10)\nNote that FH as above exists for any choice of {ρn}n∈N but it depends on the choice. Informally, we can think of this choice as determining the duration of the future time period over which we need our forecast to be reliable. It also might depend on the choice of regular upper bounds (of course, if there are minimal regular upper bounds, these yield a forecaster than works for any other regular upper bounds).\nThe example from the Introduction section can now be realized as follows. TakeOn = O = {0, 1} and let MK ⊆ P(Oω) be as in Example 2, where I = 2N+1 and Pro∼K2n+1(y) [o = y2n] = 1. Define ρn by\nρn(x, x ′) :=\n{\nmax{2n−m | xm 6= x ′ m} if x 6= x ′ 0 if x = x′ (11)\nIf MK ∈ H, and x ∈ Oω is s.t. x2n+1 = x2n, then for any k ∈ N, the forecaster F H of Theorem 1\nsatisfies\nlim n→∞ Pr x′∼F2n(x:2n)\n[\nx′2(n+k)+1 = x ′ 2(n+k)\n]\n= 1 (12)\nlim n→∞ Pr x′∼F2n+1(x:2n+1)\n[\nx′2(n+k)+1 = x ′ 2(n+k)\n]\n= 1 (13)\nIf we only cared about predicting the next observation (as opposed to producing a probability measure over the entire sequence), this example (and any other instance of Example 2, at least in the case On = O finite) would be a special case of the “sleeping experts” setting in online learning (see [6]). However, our formalism is much more general, even for predicting the next observation. For instance, we can consider O = {0, 1, 2, 3} and have an incomplete model specifying that the next observation is an odd number (thus, the “expert” specializes by predicting specific properties of the observation rather than only making predictions at specific times). As another example, we can consider O = {0, 1, 2} and an incomplete model specifying that the probability distribution\n(p0, p1, p2) of each observation satisfies p0, p1, p2 ≥ 0.1. This model would capture any environment that can be regarded as a process observed through a noisy sensor that has a probability of 0.3 to output a uniformly random observation instead of the real state of the process.\nThe rest of the paper is devoted to proving Theorem 1.\n3 Dominant Forecasters\nIn this section we explain our generalization of the methods introduced in [5] under the name “logical inductors.” The main differences between our formalism and that of [5] are\n• We are interested in sequence forecasting rather than formal logic.\n• We consider probability measures on certain Polish spaces, rather than probability assignment functions on finite sets.\n• In particular, no special treatment of expected values is required.\n• The observations are stochastic rather than deterministic.\nOur terminology also differs from [5]: their “market” is our “forecaster”, their “trader” is our “gambler”. In any case, our exposition assumes no prior knowledge about logical inductors.\nThe idea is to consider a collection of gamblers making bets against the forecaster. If a gambler with finite budget cannot make an infinite profit, the gambler is said to be “dominated” by the forecaster. We then prove that for any countable collection of gamblers, there is a forecaster that dominates all of them.\nGiven a compact Polish space X, C (X) will denote the Banach space of continuous functions with uniform norm. We will also use the shorthand notation B (X) := C ( P (X)×X )\n. Equivalently, B (X) can be regarded to be the space of continuous functions from P (X) to C (X), and we will curry implicitly in our notation.\nWe regard B(Oω) as the space of bets that can be made against a forecaster. Given β ∈ B(Oω), a forecast µ ∈ P(Oω) and observation sequence x ∈ Oω, the value of the bet β is\nV β (µ, x) := β (µ, x)− Ex′∼µ\n[\nβ ( µ, x′ )\n]\n(14)\nNote that this defines a bounded linear operator V : B (X) → B (X). C (X) and B (X) will also be regarded as a measurable spaces, using the σ-algebra of Borel\nsets. We remind that the σ-algebra on On is the algebra of universally measurable sets.\nDefinition 3. A gambler is a family of measurable mappings\n{Gn : O n × P(Oω)n → B (Oω)}n∈N\nA gambler is considered to observe a forecaster and bet against it. Given y ∈ On and µ ∈ P(Oω)n, Gn (y,µ) = β means that, if y are the first n observations and µ are the first n forecasts (made after observing n − 1 out of the n observations), the gambler will make bet β (which is in itself a function of the forecast the forecaster makes after the n-th observation).\nWe now introduce some notation regarding the interaction of gamblers and forecasters. Given a gambler G and a forecaster F , we define the measurable mappings GFn : O\nn → B(Oω) by\nGFn (y) := Gn ( y, F0, F1 (y:1) . . . Fn−1 (y:n−1) )\n(15)\nHere, y:m denotes the projection of y to O m. We define the measurable mappings VG F n : O n → C(Oω) and ΣVGFn : O n−1 → C(Oω) by\nVG F n (y) :=\n( VGFn (y) ) ( Fn (y) )\n(16)\nΣVGFn (y) := ∑\nm<n\nVG F m (y:m) (17)\nIn the definition of ΣVGF0 , O −1 is considered to be equal to O0 (i.e. the one point space). We define the measurable mappings ΣVminG F n ,ΣVmax G F n : O n−1 → R by\nΣVminG F n (y) := min yOω ΣVGFn (y) (18)\nΣVmax G F n (y) := max yOω ΣVGFn (y) (19)\nWe are now ready to state the formally state the definition of “dominance” alluded to in the beginning of the section.\nDefinition 4. Consider a forecaster F and a gambler G. F is said to dominate G when for any x ∈ Oω, if condition 20 holds then condition 21 holds:\ninf n∈N\nΣVminG F n (x:n−1) > −∞ (20)\nsup n∈N\nΣVmaxG F n (x:n−1) < +∞ (21)\nThe following is the main theorem of this section, which is our analogue of Theorem 3.6.1 from [5].\nTheorem 2. Let {Gk}k∈N be a family of gamblers. Then, there exists a forecaster F G s.t. for any k ∈ N, F dominates Gk.\nThe rest of the section is devoted to proving Theorem 2. The proof will consist of two steps. First we show that for any single gambler, there is a dominant forecaster. Then, given a countable set G of gamblers, we construct a single gambler s.t. dominating this gambler implies dominating all gamblers in the set.\nThe following lemma shows that for any bet, there is a forecast which makes the bet unwinnable.\nLemma 1. Consider X a compact Polish space and β ∈ B (X). Then, there exists µ ∈ P (X) s.t.\nsuppµ ⊆ argmaxβ (µ) (22)\nProof. Define K : P (X) → 2P(X) as follows:\nK (µ) := {ν ∈ P (X) | supp ν ⊆ argmaxβ (µ)}\nFor any µ, K (µ) is obviously convex and non-empty. It is also easy to see that the graph of K in P (X) × P (X) is closed. Applying the Kakutani-Glicksberg-Fan theorem, we conclude that K has a fixed point, i.e. µ ∈ P (X) s.t. µ ∈ K (µ).\nNext, we show that the probability measure of Lemma 1 can be made to depend measurably on past observations and the bet.\nLemma 2. Fix Y1,2 compact Polish spaces and denote X := Y1 × Y2. Then, there exists a Borel measurable mapping α : Y1 × B (X) → P (X) s.t. for any y ∈ Y1 and β ∈ B (X)\nsuppα (y, β) ⊆ argmax y×Y2\nβ ( α (y, β) )\n(23)\nProof. Define Z1, Z2, Z ⊆ Y1 × B (X)× P (X) by\nZ1 := {(y, β, µ) ∈ Y1 × B (X)× P (X) | suppµ ⊆ y × Y2}\nZ2 := {(y, β, µ) ∈ Y1 × B (X)× P (X) | Eµ [ β (µ) ]\n= max y2∈Y2 β (µ, y, y2)}\nZ := Z1 ∩ Z2 = {(y, β, µ) ∈ Y1 × B (X)× P (X) | suppµ ⊆ argmax y×Y2 β (µ)}\nWe can view Z as the graph of a multivalued mapping from Y1 × B (X) to P (X) (i.e a mapping from Y1 × B (X) to 2\nP(X)). We will now show that this multivalued mapping has a selection, i.e. a single-valued Borel measurable mapping whose graph is a subset of Z. Obviously, the selection is the desired α.\nFix ρ a metrization of Y1. Z1 is the vanishing locus of the continuous function E(y1,y2)∼µ [ ρ (y1, y) ]\n. Z2 is the vanishing locus of the continuous function Eµ [ β (µ) ]\n− maxy2∈Y2 β (µ, y, y2). Therefore Z1,2 are closed and so is Z. In particular, the fiber Zyβ of Z over any (y, β) ∈ Y1 × B (X) is also closed.\nFor any y ∈ Y1, β ∈ B (X), define iy : Y2 → X by iy (y2) := (y, y2) and βy ∈ B (Y2) by βy ( ν, y′ )\n:= β ( iy∗ν, y, y ′ ) . Applying Lemma 1 to βy we get ν ∈ P (Y2) s.t.\nsupp ν ⊆ argmaxβy (ν)\nIt follows that ( y, β, iy∗ν )\n∈ Z and hence Zyβ is non-empty. Consider any U ⊆ P (X) open. Then, AU := ( Y1 × B (X)× U )\n∩ Z is locally closed, and in particular, it is an Fσ set. Therefore, the image of AU under the projection to Y1 × B (X) is also Fσ and in particular Borel.\nApplying the Kuratowski-Rill-Nardzewski measurable selection theorem, we get the desired result.\nWe define the measurable mappings ḠFn : O n → C(Oω) by\nḠFn (y) := G F n\n( y;Fn (y) )\n(24)\nCorollary 1. Let G be a gambler. Then, there exists a forecaster F s.t. for all n ∈ N and y ∈ On\nsuppFn (y) ⊆ argmax yOω\nḠFn (25)\nProof. For every n ∈ N, let αn : On × B(O ω) → P(Oω) be as in Lemma 2. Observing that the definition of GFn depends only on Fm for m < n, we define F recursively as\nFn (y) := αn\n( y,GFn (y) )\nIn particular, the forecaster F of Corollary 1 dominates G since, as easy to see, VG F n ≤ 0 and hence ΣVGFn ≤ 0. We will now introduce a way to transform a gambler in a way that enforces a “finite spending budget.” Consider a gambler G and fix b > 0 (the size of the “budget”). Define the measurable functions ΣVGn : O n−1 × P(Oω)n → C(Oω) by\nΣVGn (y,µ) := ∑\nm<n\n( VGm (y:m,µ:m) ) (µm) (26)\nHere, µ:m denotes the projection of µ ∈ P(O ω)n to P(Oω)m that takes components l < m and µm denotes the m-th component of µ. Define the measurable functions ΣVminGn,ΣVmax Gn : On−1 × P(Oω)n → R by\nΣVminGn (y,µ) := min yOω ΣVGn (y,µ) (27)\nΣVmax Gn (y,µ) := max yOω ΣVGn (y,µ) (28)\nDefine the measurable sets\nAbGn := {(y,µ) ∈ O n−1 × P(Oω)n | ΣVminGn (y,µ) > −b} (29)\nNote that Ab Gn×On is a measurable subset of O n×P(Oω)n and in particular can be regarded\nas a measurable space in itself. Define the measurable functions Nb Gn : Ab Gn ×On → C ( P(Oω) ) by\nNb Gn (y,µ; ν) := max\n(\n1,max yOω\n− ( VGn (y,µ) ) (ν)\nΣVGn (y:n−1,µ) + b\n)−1\n(30)\nFinally, define the gambler ΛbG as follows\nΛbGn (y,µ) :=\n{\n0 if ∃m < n : (y:m,µ:m+1) 6∈ Ab Gm+1 NbGn (y,µ) ·Gn (y,µ) otherwise (31)\nThe next proposition shows that as long as G stays “within budget b,” the operator Λb has no effect.\nProposition 1. Consider any gambler G, b > 0, n ∈ N, y ∈ On−1 and µ ∈ P(Oω)n. Assume that for all m < n, (y:m,µ:m+1) ∈ Ab Gm+1. Then, for all m < n\nΛbGm (y:m,µ:m;µm) = Gm (y:m,µ:m;µm) (32)\nProof. Consider any m < n. We have\nΣVminGm+1 (y:m,µ:m+1) + b > 0\n∀x ∈ y:mO ω : ΣVGm+1 (y:m,µ:m+1;x) + b > 0\n∀x ∈ y:mO ω : ΣVGm (y:m−1,µ:m;x) +\n( VGm (y:m,µ:m) ) (µm, x) + b > 0\n∀x ∈ y:mO ω : ΣVGm (y:m−1,µ:m;x) + b > −\n( VGm (y:m,µ:m) ) (µm, x)\nUsing the assumption again, the left hand side is positive. It follows that\n∀x ∈ y:mO ω : 1 >\n− ( VGm (y:m,µ:m) ) (µm, x)\nΣVGm (y:m−1,µ:m;x) + b\nNbGm (y:m,µ:m;µm) = 1\nSince we are in the second case in the definition of ΛbGm (y:m,µ:m), we get the desired result.\nNow, we show that ΛbG indeed never “goes over budget.”\nProposition 2. Consider any gambler G and b > 0. Then, for any n ∈ N, y ∈ On−1 and µ ∈ P(Oω)n\nΣVminΛbGn (y,µ) ≥ −b (33)\nProof. Let m0 ∈ N be the largest number s.t. m0 ≤ n and\n∀m ≤ m0 : ΣVminGm (y:m−1,µ:m) > −b\nFor any m ≤ m0, we have, by Proposition 1\nΣVminΛbGm (y:m−1,µ:m) = ΣVminGm (y:m−1,µ:m) > −b\n(Note that the sum in the definition of ΣVminΛbGm only involves ΛbGl for l < m ≤ m0) For m = m0 + 1 and any x ∈ y:m0O ω, we have\nΣVΛbGm0+1 ( y:m0 ,µ:m0+1;x ) = ΣVΛbGm0 ( y:m0−1,µ:m0 ;x )\n+ (\nVΛbGm0 ( y:m0 ,µ:m0 )\n)\n( µm0 , x )\nThe first term only involves ΛbGl for l < m0, allowing us to apply Proposition 1.

By Proposition 3, FG dominates Gk for all k ∈ N.\n4 Prudent Gambling Strategies\nIn this section we construct a tool for proving asymptotic convergence results about dominant forecasters. We start by introducing a notion of “prudent gambling,” which requires that bets are only made when the expected payoff is a certain fraction of the risk. First, we need some notation.\nGiven X,Y Polish spaces, µ ∈ P(X), π : X → Y Borel measurable and g : X → R Borel measurable, we will use the notation\nEµ\n[ g | π−1 (y) ]\n:= E(µ|π)(y) [g] (39)\nWe remind that πOn is the projection mapping from O ω to On and yOω :=\n(\nπOn\n)−1 (y).\nDefinition 5. A gambling strategy is a uniformly bounded family of measurable mappings\n{Sn : O n → B(Oω)}n∈N\nDefinition 6. Given a gambling strategy S and µ∗ ∈ P(Oω), S is said to be µ∗-prudent when there is α > 0 s.t. for any n ∈ N, πOn∗µ ∗-almost any y ∈ On and any µ ∈ P(Oω)\nEµ∗ [ Sn (y;µ) | yO ω ] − Eµ [ Sn (y;µ) ] ≥ α\n(\nmax yOω Sn (y;µ)−min yOω Sn (y;µ)\n)\n(40)\nThe “correct” way for a gambler to use a prudent gambling strategy is not employing it all the time: in order to avoid running out of budget, a gambler shouldn’t place too many bets simultaneously. To address this, we define a gambler that “plays” (employs the given strategy) only when all previous bets are close to being settled.\nDefinition 7. Consider any gambling strategy S. We define the gambler ΓS recursively as follows\nΓSn (y,µ) :=\n{\nSn (y) if ΣVmax ΓSn (y:n−1,µ) − ΣVmin ΓSn (y:n−1,µ) ≤ 1 0 otherwise (41)\nTheorem 3. Consider µ∗ ∈ P(Oω), S a µ∗-prudent gambling strategy and a forecaster F . Assume F dominates ΓS. Then, for µ∗-almost any x ∈ Oω\n∞ ∑\nn=0\n(\nEµ∗ [ Sn ( x:n;Fn (x:n) ) | x:nO ω ] − EFn(x:n) [ Sn ( x:n;Fn (x:n) ) ]\n)\n< +∞ (42)\nIn particular, the terms of the series on the left hand-side converge to 0 (they are non-negative since S is µ∗-prudent).\nThe rest of the section is dedicated to proving Theorem 3. We start by showing, in a more abstract setting (not specific to forecasting), that for any sequences of bets that is “prudent” in the sense that the expected payoff is bounded below by a fixed fraction of the risk (= bet magnitude), the probability to lose an infinite amount vanishes and, moreover, it holds with probability 1 that if the total bet magnitude is unbounded then there is infinite gain.\nLemma 3. Consider Ω a probability space, {Fn ⊆ 2 Ω}n∈N a filtration of Ω, α,M > 0, {Xn : Ω → R}n∈N and {Yn : Ω → [0,M ]}n∈N stochastic processes adapted to F (i.e. Xn and Yn are Fn-measurable). Assume the following conditions 5:\ni. E [ |X0| ] < +∞\nii. ∀n ∈ N,m ≥ n : |Xn −Xm| ≤ ∑m−1 l=n Yl +M\niii. E [ Xn+1 | Fn ] ≥ Xn + αYn\nThen, for almost all ω ∈ Ω\na. infnXn (ω) > −∞\nb. If supn Xn (ω) < +∞ then ∑ n Yn (ω) < +∞\nProof. Without loss of generality, we can assume M = 1 (otherwise we can renormalize X and Y by a factor of M−1). Define {X0n : Ω → R}n∈N by\nX0n := Xn − α n−1 ∑\nm=0\nYm\nIt is easy to see that X0 is a submartingale. We define {Nn : Ω → N ⊔ {∞}}n∈N recursively as follows\nN0 (ω) := 0\nNk+1 (ω) :=\n\n\n\ninf{n ∈ N | ∑n−1\nm=Nk(ω) Ym (ω) ≥ 1} if Nk (ω) < ∞\n∞ if Nk (ω) = ∞\nFor each k ∈ N, Nk is a stopping time w.r.t. F . As easy to see, for each k ∈ N, {X 0 min(n,Nk) }n∈N is a uniformly integrable submartingale. Using the fact that Nk ≤ Nk+1 to apply Theorem A.1 (see Appendix A), we get\nE [\nX0Nk+1 | FNk\n]\n≥ X0Nk\nClearly, {X0Nk}k∈N is adapted to {FNk}k∈N. Doob’s second martingale convergence theo-\nrem implies that E [ |X0Nk | ] < ∞ (X0Nk is the limit of the uniformly integrable submartingale {X0min(n,Nk)}n∈N). We conclude that {X 0 Nk }k∈N is a submartingale.\n5Equalities and inequalities between random variables are implicitly understood as holding almost surely.\nIt is easy to see that |X0Nk+1 −X 0 Nk | ≤ 3. Applying the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality, we conclude that for any positive integer k:\nPr [ X0Nk −X0 < −k 3 4 ] ≤ exp\n(\n− k\n3 2\n2 · 32k\n)\n= exp\n(\n− k\n1 2\n18\n)\nIt follows that\n∞ ∑\nk=1\nPr [ X0Nk −X0 < −k 3 4 ] < ∞\nPr [\n∃k ∈ N∀l > k : X0Nl −X0 ≥ −l 3 4\n]\n= 1\nPr\n\n∃k ∈ N∀l > k : XNl −X0 ≥ α\nNl−1 ∑\nn=0\nYn − l 3 4\n\n = 1\nIt is easy to see that if ω ∈ Ω is s.t. ∑∞ n=0 Yn (ω) = ∞ then ∑Nl(ω)−1 n=0 Yn (ω) ≥ l. We get\nPr\n\n\n∞ ∑\nn=0\nYn = ∞ =⇒ ∃k ∈ N∀l > k : XNl −X0 ≥ αl − l 3 4\n\n = 1\nTo complete the proof, observe that if ω ∈ Ω is s.t. infnXn (ω) = −∞ then ∑∞\nn=0 Yn (ω) = ∞ (since |Xn (ω)−X0 (ω)| ≤ ∑n−1 m=0 Yn (ω) + 1).\nCorollary 2. Consider Ω a probability space, {Fn ⊆ 2 Ω}n∈N a filtration of Ω, α,M > 0, {X ′ n : Ω → R}n∈N and {Yn : Ω → [0,M ]}n∈N stochastic processes adapted to F and {Xn : Ω → R}n∈N an arbitrary stochastic process. Assume the following conditions:\ni. |Xn −X ′ n| ≤ M\nii. E [ |X0| ] < +∞\niii. |Xn+1 −Xn| ≤ Yn\niv. E [ Xn+1 −Xn | Fn ] ≥ αYn\nThen, for almost all ω ∈ Ω\na. infnXn (ω) > −∞\nb. If supn Xn (ω) < +∞ then ∑ n Yn (ω) < +∞\nProof. Define X ′′n := E [ Xn | Fn ] . We have\nE [ |X ′′0 | ]\n= E [ |E [ X0 | F0 ] | ] ≤ E [ E [ |X0| | F0 ] ] = E [ |X0| ] < ∞\n|X ′′n −X ′ n| = |E\n[ Xn | Fn ] −X ′n| = |E [ Xn −X ′ n | Fn ] | ≤ M\n|X ′′n −Xn| ≤ |X ′′ n −X ′ n|+ |X ′ n −Xn| ≤ 2M\n∀m ≥ n : |X ′′m −X ′′ n| ≤ |Xm −Xn|+ 4M ≤\nn−1 ∑\nl=n\nYl + 4M\nE [ X ′′n+1 −X ′′ n | Fn ]\n= E [ E [ Xn+1 | Fn+1 ] − E [ Xn | Fn ] | Fn ] = E [ Xn+1 −Xn | Fn ] ≥ αYn\nApplying Lemma 3 to X ′′ and using |X ′′n −Xn| ≤ 2M , we get the desired result.\nWe will also need the following property of the operator Γ, reflecting that at any given moment, the uncertainty of the gambler ΓS about the total worth of its bets is bounded.\nProposition 5. Given any gambling strategy S, we have\nΣVΓSn − ΣVmin ΓSn ≤ 2max m<n sup y∈Om ‖Sm (y)‖+ 1 (43)\nIn particular, the left hand side is uniformly bounded.\nProof. We prove by induction. For n = 0 the claim is obvious. Consider any n ∈ N, y ∈ On and µ ∈ P(Oω)n+1. First, assume that\nΣVmax ΓSn (y:n−1,µ:n)− ΣVmin ΓSn (y:n−1,µ:n) > 1\nThen, by definition of ΓS, ΓSn (y,µ:n) ≡ 0 and therefore\nΣVΓSn+1 (y,µ) = ΣVΓSn (y:n−1,µ:n)\nΣVmin ΓSn+1 (y,µ) ≥ ΣVmin ΓSn (y:n−1,µ:n)\nΣVΓSn+1 (y,µ) −ΣVmin ΓSn+1 (y,µ) ≤ ΣVΓSn (y:n−1,µ:n)− ΣVmin ΓSn (y:n−1,µ:n)\nBy the induction hypothesis, we get\nΣVΓSn+1 (y,µ)− ΣVmin ΓSn+1 (y,µ) ≤ 2max m<n sup y∈Om ‖Sm (y)‖+ 1 ≤ max m≤n sup y∈Om ‖Sm (y)‖+ 1\nNow, assume that\nΣVmax ΓSn (y:n−1,µ:n)− ΣVmin ΓSn (y:n−1,µ:n) ≤ 1\nThen, ΓSn (y,µ:n) = Sn (y) and therefore\nΣVΓSn+1 (y,µ) = ΣVΓSn (y:n−1,µ:n) + ( VSn (y) ) (µn)\nWe get\nΣVΓSn+1 (y,µ)−ΣVmin ΓSn+1 (y,µ) ≤ ΣVmax ΓSn (y:n−1,µ:n)−ΣVmin ΓSn (y:n−1,µ:n)+2‖Sn (y)‖\nBy the assumption, the first two terms total to ≤ 1, yielding the desired result.\nAs a final ingredient for the proof of Theorem 3, we will need another property of Γ, namely that when the total magnitude of all bets made is finite, the gambler eventually starts “playing” in every round.\nProposition 6. Let S be a gambling strategy, F a forecaster and x ∈ Oω. Assume that\n∞ ∑\nn=0\n(\nmax x:nOω\nΓS F n (x:n)− min\nx:nOω ΓS\nF n (x:n)\n)\n< +∞ (44)\nThen, for any n ≫ 0, ΓSFn (x:n) = Sn (x:n).\nProof. Choose n0 ∈ N s.t.\n∞ ∑\nn=n0\n(\nmax x:nOω\nΓS F n (x:n)− min\nx:nOω ΓS\nF n (x:n)\n)\n< 1\n2\nSince ΓS F n (x:n) ,VΓS F n (x:n) ∈ C(O ω) differ by a constant function, we have\n∞ ∑\nn=n0\n(\nmax x:nOω\nVΓS F n (x:n)− min\nx:nOω VΓS\nF n (x:n)\n)\n< 1\n2\nIn particular, for any n ≥ n0\nn−1 ∑\nm=n0\n(\nmax x:nOω\nVΓS F m (x:m)− min\nx:nOω VΓS\nF m (x:m)\n)\n< 1\n2\nOn the other hand, it is easy to see that there is n1 ≥ n0 s.t. for any n ≥ n1\nmax x:nOω\nΣVΓSFn0 ( x:n0−1 )\n− min x:nOω\nΣVΓSFn0 ( x:n0−1 )\n< 1\n2\nTaking the sum of the last two inequalities, we conclude that for any n ≥ n1\nΣVmax ΓS F n (x:n−1)− ΣVmin ΓS F n (x:n−1) < 1\nUsing the definition of ΓS, we get the desired result.\nProof of Theorem 3. We regard Oω as a probability space using the σ-algebra F of universally measurable sets and the probability measure µ∗. For any n ∈ N, we define Fn ⊆ F and Xn,X ′ n, Yn : Oω → R by\nFn := { ( πOn )−1 (A) | A ⊆ On universally measurable}\nXn (x) := ΣVΓS F n (x:n−1, x)\nX ′n (x) := ΣVmin ΓS F n (x:n−1)\nYn (x) := max x:nOω\nΓS F n (x:n)− min\nx:nOω ΓS\nF n (x:n)\nClearly, F is a filtration of Oω, X,X ′, Y are stochastic processes and X ′, Y are adapted to F . S is uniformly bounded, therefore ΓS is uniformly bounded and so is Y . Obviously, Y is also non-negative.\nBy Proposition 5, |Xn −X ′ n| are uniformly bounded. X0 vanishes and in particular E\n[ |X0| ]\n< ∞. We have\n|Xn+1 (x)−Xn (x)| = |VΓS F n (x:n, x)| ≤ Yn (x)\nMoreover:\nE [ Xn+1 −Xn | Fn ] (x) = Ex′∼µ∗ [ VΓS F n ( x:n, x ′ ) | x′ ∈ x:nO ω ]\n(As before, the notation on the right hand side signifies the use of a regular conditional probability)\nE [ Xn+1 −Xn | Fn ] (x) = Ex′∼µ∗ [ ΓS F n ( x:n, x ′ ) | x′ ∈ x:nO ω ] − Ex′∼Fn(x:n) [ ΓS F n ( x:n, x ′ ) ]\nLet α > 0 be as in Definition 6. By definition of ΓS, ΓS F n (x:n) is equal to either Sn ( x:n;Fn (x:n) )\nor 0. In either case, we get that for µ∗-almost any x ∈ Oω\nE [ Xn+1 −Xn | Fn ] (x) ≥ α\n(\nmax x:nOω\nΓS F n (x:n)− min\nx:nOω ΓS\nF n (x:n)\n)\n= αYn (x)\nBy Corollary 2a, for µ∗-almost any x ∈ Oω\ninf n∈N\nΣVmin ΓS F n (x:n−1) > −∞\nSince F dominates ΓS, it follows that\nsup n∈N\nΣVmax ΓS F n (x:n−1) < +∞\nBy Corollary 2b, ∑ n Yn (x) < ∞. By Proposition 6, it follows that for any n ≫ 0, ΓS F n (x:n) =\nSn (x:n). We get, for n ≫ 0\nEµ∗ [ Sn ( x:n;Fn (x:n) ) | x:nO ω ] − EFn(x:n) [ Sn ( x:n;Fn (x:n) ) ] = Eµ∗ [ ΓS F n (x:n) | x:nO ω ] − EFn(x:n) [ ΓS F n (x:n) ] ≤ Yn (x)\n∞ ∑\nn=0\n(\nEµ∗ [ Sn ( x:n;Fn (x:n) ) | x:nO ω ] − EFn(x:n) [ Sn ( x:n;Fn (x:n) ) ]\n)\n< +∞\n5 Proof of Main Theorem\nIn order to prove Theorem 1, we will need, given an incomplete model M ⊆ P(Oω) and ǫ > 0, a gambling strategy SMǫ s.t. SMǫ is µ-prudent for any µ ∈ M and s.t. Theorem 3 implies that any F that dominates SMǫ satisfies equation 10 “within ǫ.” This motivates the following definition and lemma. We remind that, given x ∈ R, x+ := max(x, 0).\nDefinition 8.

Multiplying by a scalar, we can make sure that ‖ϕ‖ = 3 4 (r − r0). For any δ > 0, we can choose ζ ∈ Lip (X, ρ)′ s.t. ‖ζ‖ < 1 and ϕ (ζ) > 34 (r − r0) − δ.

Define Z1,2,3 ⊆ Y × B (X)× P (X) 4 by\nZ1 := {(y, β, µ, ν, ξ, ζ) ∈ Y × B (X)× P (X) 4 | ζ ∈ M (y)}\nZ2 := {(y, β, µ, ν, ξ, ζ) ∈ Y ×B (X)× P (X) 4 | ‖β (µ)‖ ≤\n( dKR (µ, ξ)− ǫ )\n+ }\nZ3 := {(y, β, µ, ν, ξ, ζ) ∈ Y×B (X)×P (X) 4 | Eν\n[ β (µ) ] −Eµ [ β (µ) ] ≥ 1\n2\n( dKR (µ, ζ)− ǫ )\n+ dKR (µ, ζ)}\nDefine Z := Z1 ∩ Z2 ∩ Z3. It is easy to see that Z1,2,3 are closed and therefore Z also. Define Z ′ ⊆ Y × B (X)× P (X)3 by\nZ ′ := {(y, β, µ, ν, ξ) ∈ Y × B (X)× P (X)3 | ∃ζ ∈ P (X) : (y, β, µ, ν, ξ, ζ) ∈ Z}\nZ ′ is closed since it is the projection of Z and P (X) is compact. The M (y) are compact, therefore dKR ( µ,M (y) ) = dKR (µ, ζ) for some ζ ∈ M (y), and hence (y, β, µ, ν, ξ) ∈ Z ′ if and only if the following conditions hold:\ni. ‖β (µ)‖ ≤ ( dKR (µ, ξ)− ǫ )\n+\nii. Eν [ β (µ) ] − Eµ [ β (µ) ] ≥ 12\n(\ndKR ( µ,M (y) ) − ǫ )\n+ dKR\n( µ,M (y) )\nDefine W ⊆ Y ×B (X)× P (X)3 by\nW := {(y, β, µ, ν, ξ) ∈ Y × B (X)× P (X)3 | ν, ξ ∈ M (y) , (y, β, µ, ν, ξ) 6∈ Z ′}\nW is locally closed and in particular it is an Fσ set. Define W ′ ⊆ Y × B (X) by\nW ′ := {(y, β) ∈ Y × B (X) | ∃µ, ν, ξ ∈ P (X) : (y, β, µ, ν, ξ) ∈ W}\nW ′ is the projection of W and P (X)3 is compact, therefore W ′ is Fσ. Let A ⊆ Y × B (X) be the complement of W ′. A is Gδ and in particular Borel. As easy to see, (y, β) ∈ A if and only if β is ( M (y) , ǫ )\n-savvy. For any y ∈ Y , Ay := {β ∈ B (X) | (y, β) ∈ A} is closed since\nAy = ⋂\nµ∈P(X)\n⋂\nν,ξ∈M(y)\n{β ∈ B (X) | (y, β, µ, ν, ξ) ∈ Z ′}\nMoreover, Ay is non-empty by Corollary 3. Consider any U ⊆ B (X) open. Then, A ∩ (Y × U) is Borel and therefore its image under the projection to Y is analytic and in particular universally measurable. Applying the Kuratowski– Ryll-Nardzewski measurable selection theorem, we obtain a measurable selection of the multivalued mapping with graph A. This selection is the desired Sǫ.\nWe now obtain a relation between the notions of savviness and prudence. We remind that given X,Y Polish, π : X → Y Borel measurable and µ ∈ P (X), µ | π : Y k −→ X stands for any corresponding regular conditional probability.\nProposition 7. Consider M ⊆ P(Oω), {Mn : O n → 2P(O ω)}n∈N and ǫ > 0. Assume Mn is a regular upper bound for M | πOn . Let S be a gambling strategy s.t. for each n ∈ N and y ∈ O\nn, Sn (y) is ( Mn(y), ǫ ) -savvy (relatively to ρn). Then, S is µ ∗-prudent for any µ∗ ∈ M .\nProof. Fix any µ∗ ∈ M . By Definition 2, for πOn∗µ-almost any y ∈ O n,\n(\nµ∗ | πOn\n)\n(y) ∈ Mn(y).\nSince Sn (y) is ( Mn(y), ǫ ) -savvy, for any µ ∈ P (X), denoting rµy := d n KR ( µ, Mn(y) ) :\nEµ∗ [ Sn (y;µ) | yO ω ] − Eµ [ Sn (y;µ) ] ≥ 1\n2\n( rµy − ǫ )\n+ rµy ≥\n1 2 ‖Sn (y;µ)‖rµy\nWhen rµy ≤ ǫ, Sn (y;µ) = 0, hence for any µ ∈ P (X), ‖Sn (y;µ)‖rµy ≥ ‖Sn (y;µ)‖ǫ. We get\nEµ∗ [ Sn (y;µ) | yO ω ] − Eµ [ Sn (y;µ) ] ≥ ǫ\n2 ‖Sn (y;µ)‖\nCorollary 4. Consider M ⊆ P(Oω), {Mn : O n → 2P(O ω)}n∈N and ǫ > 0. Assume Mn is a regular upper bound for M | πOn . Let S be a gambling strategy s.t. for each n ∈ N and y ∈ O n, Sn (y) is (\nMn(y), ǫ )\n-savvy. Let F be a forecaster that dominates ΓS. Then, for any µ ∈ M and µ-almost any x ∈ Oω\nlim sup n→∞\ndnKR ( Fn (x:n) , Mn (x:n) ) ≤ ǫ (45)\nProof. By Proposition 7, S is µ-prudent. By Theorem 3, for µ-almost any x ∈ X\nlim n→∞\n(\nEµ\n[\nSn ( x:n;Fn (x:n) ) | x:nO ω ] − EFn(x:n) [ Sn ( x:n;Fn (x:n) ) ]\n)\n= 0\nOn the other hand, (\nµ | πOn\n)\n(x:n) ∈ Mn (x:n) and hence, since Sn (x:n) is ( Mn (x:n) , ǫ ) -savvy,\ndenoting rn := d n KR\n( Fn (x:n) ,Mn (x:n) ) :\nEµ\n[\nSn ( x:n;Fn (x:n) ) | x:nO ω ] − EFn(x:n) [ Sn ( x:n;Fn (x:n) ) ] ≥ 1\n2 (rn − ǫ) rn\nWe get\nlim sup n→∞ (rn − ǫ) rn ≤ 0\nlim sup n→∞ rn ≤ ǫ\nWe are finally ready to complete the proof of the main theorem.\nProof of Theorem 1. Consider any M ∈ H and a positive integer k. By Lemma 4, for any n ∈ N, there exists SMkn : O n → B(Oω) measurable s.t. for all y ∈ On, SMkn (y) is ( Mn(y), 1 k ) -savvy. We fix such a SMkn for each M and k. It is easy to see that the d n KR-diameter of P(O\nω) is at most 2, therefore ‖SMkn (y)‖ ≤ 2 and {S Mk n }n∈N is a gambling strategy. By Theorem 2, there is a forecaster FH that dominates ΓSMk for all M and k. By Corollary 4, for any M ∈ H, µ ∈ M , positive integer k and µ-almost any x ∈ X\nlim sup n→∞\ndnKR\n( FHn (x:n) ,Mn (x:n) ) ≤ 1\nk\nIt follows that\nlim n→∞\ndnKR\n( FHn (x:n) ,Mn (x:n) ) = 0\n6 Discussion\nWe see several natural directions for extending this work. Theorem 1 is formulated using the Kantorovich-Rubinstein metric, but instead we could have considered to total variation metric dTV, as in Bayesian merging of opinions [4]. This would remove the need to renormalize the metrization of Oω and yield a stronger result. However, we currently don’t know whether this stronger hypothesis is true.\nThe present work doesn’t analyze any considerations of computational complexity or even computability. It would be very valuable, especially for practical applications, to understand the complexity of forecasters satisfying equation 10 given various complexity-theoretic assumptions on H. In particular, that would entail designing concrete forecasting algorithms of this type, whereas the existence proof in the present work is non-constructive. Also, it would be valuable to analyze\nthe speed of convergence in 10 and the possibly also the trade-offs between forecaster complexity and speed of convergence.\nFinally, we think that the current work may have some bearing on the so-called “grain of truth” problem (problem 5j in [3]). The problem is, given a system of interacting rational agents, proving their convergence to some reasonable game-theoretic solution concept, e.g. a Nash equilibrium. For a pair of Bayesian agents, this normally requires each agent to lie in the model class H of the other agent. However, this requirement is difficult to satisfy in settings that are fairly general, since usually the computational complexity of a Bayesian agent is higher than the complexities of all models in its prior. On the other hand, using our approach, each agent may learn incomplete models satisfied by the other agent that are computationally simpler than a full simulation. This might be sufficient to produce meaningful game-theoretic guarantees.\nA Appendix: Some Useful Theorems\nThe following variant of the Optional Stopping Theorem appears in [7] as Theorem 5.4.7.\nTheorem A.1. Let Ω be a probability space, {Fn ⊆ 2 Ω}n∈N a filtration of Ω, {Xn : Ω → R}n∈N a stochastic process adapted to F and M,N : Ω → N ⊔ {∞} stopping times (w.r.t. F) s.t. M ≤ N . Assume that {Xmin(n,N)}n∈N is a uniformly integrable submartingale. Using Doob’s martingale convergence theorem, we can define XN : Ω → R by 6\nXN (x) := lim n→∞ Xmin(n,N) (x) =\n{\nXN(x) (x) if N (x) < ∞ limn→∞Xn (x) if N (x) = ∞ (46)\nWe define XM : Ω → R is an analogous way 7. We also define the σ-algebra FM ⊆ 2 Ω by\nFM := {A ⊆ X measurable | ∀n ∈ N : A ∩M −1 (n) ∈ Fn} (47)\nThen:\nE [ XN | FM ] ≥ XM (48)\nThe following variant of the Michael selection theorem appears in [8] as Theorem 3.1.\nTheorem A.2 (Yannelis and Prabhakar). Consider X a paracompact Hausdorff topological space and Y a topological vector space. Suppose B : X → 2Y is s.t.\ni. For each x ∈ X, B (x) 6= ∅.\nii. For each x ∈ X, B (x) is convex.\niii. For each y ∈ Y , {x ∈ X | y ∈ B (x)} is open.\nThen, there exists β : X → Y continuous s.t. for all x ∈ X, β (x) ∈ B (x).\n6The limit in equation 46 is converges almost surely, which is sufficient for our purpose. 7This time we can’t use Doob’s martingale convergence theorem, but wheneverM (x) = ∞ we also haveN (x) = ∞,\ntherefore the limit still almost surely converges.\nB Appendix: Examples of Regular Upper Bounds\nProof of Example 1. In this case, condition i means that N must be pointwise closed and condition iii means that for every µ ∈ M and y ∈ Y s.t. µ ( π−1(y) )\n> 0, µ | π−1(y) ∈ N(y). Since all three conditions are closed w.r.t. arbitrary set intersections, there is a unique minimum (it is the intersection of all multivalued mappings satisfying the conditions). It remains to show that N(y) defined by equation 6 is convex. Fix y ∈ Y and denote A the set appearing on the right hand side of equation 6 under the closure. Consider any µ1, µ2 ∈ M s.t. µ1 ( π−1(y) ) , µ2 ( π−1(y) )\n> 0 and p ∈ (0, 1). We have\npµ1 + (1− p)µ2 ∈ M\n( pµ1 + (1− p)µ2 ) | π−1(y) ∈ A\nµ1 ( π−1(y) ) p ( µ1 | π −1(y) ) + µ2 ( π−1(y) ) (1− p) ( µ2 | π −1(y) )\nµ1 ( π−1(y) ) p+ µ2 ( π−1(y) ) (1− p) ∈ A\nIt is easy to see that for any q ∈ (0, 1) there is p ∈ (0, 1) s.t.\nq = µ1\n( π−1(y) ) p\nµ1 ( π−1(y) ) p+ µ2 ( π−1(y) ) (1− p)\nIt follows that for any q ∈ (0, 1)\nq ( µ1 | π −1(y) ) + (1− q) ( µ2 | π −1(y) ) ∈ A\nWe got that A is convex and therefore N(y) = A is also convex.\nProposition B.1. Consider W1,2,3,4 Polish spaces, X := ∏4 i=1 Wi, Y := ∏3\ni=1Wi and Z = W1 × W2. Let π Y : X → Y , πZ : X → Z and πW : X → W1 be the projection mappings, µ ∈ P(X) and K : Z k −→ W3. Assume that π Y ∗ µ = π Z ∗ µ⋉K. Then, for π W ∗ µ-almost any w ∈ W1\nπY∗\n( µ | πW )\n(w) = πZ∗\n( µ | πW ) (w)⋉K (49)\nProof. We know that µ = ( µ | πW )\n∗ πW∗ µ. It follows that\nπY∗ µ = π Y ∗\n( µ | πW )\n∗ πW∗ µ = π Z ∗\n( µ | πW )\n∗ πW∗ µ⋉K\nDefine K ′ : Z k −→ Y by K ′(z) := δz × K(z) and denote composition of Markov kernels by ◦.\nSince pushforward commutes with composition, we have\nπY∗ µ = ( πY ◦ µ | πW )\n∗ πW∗ µ =\n( K ′ ◦ πZ ◦ µ | πW )\n∗ πW∗ µ\nLet πY W : Y → W be the projection mapping and denote ν = πY∗ µ. We get\nν = ( πY ◦ µ | πW )\n∗ πY W∗ ν =\n( K ′ ◦ πZ ◦ µ | πW )\n∗ πY W∗ ν\nWe also know that\nsuppπYW∗ ν ⋉ µ | π W = suppπW∗ µ⋉ µ | π W ⊆ graph πW\nAs easy to see, the above implies\nsuppπY W∗ ν ⋉ ( πY ◦ µ | πW ) ⊆ graphπY W\nsuppπYW∗ ν ⋉ ( K ′ ◦ πZ ◦ µ | πW ) ⊆ graph πYW\nBy the uniqueness of regular conditional probability, we conclude that for πW∗ µ-almost any w ∈ W1\n( ν | πY W ) (w) = ( πY ◦ µ | πW ) (w) = ( K ′ ◦ πZ ◦ µ | πW ) (w)\nThis immediately implies the desired result.\nProof of Example 2. Fix ρ a metrization of Oω. The condition suppµ ⊆ yOω is closed because it is equivalent to the vanishing of the continuous function Ex∼µ [ ρ (x, yOω) ]\n. The other condition in the definition of MKn is closed because pushforward and semidirect product are continuous in the weak topology. This gives us condition i. Condition ii holds since the convex combination of measures supported on yOω is supported on yOω and since pushforward and semidirect product commute with convex combinations.\nConsider any µ ∈ MK . We know that for any m ≥ n, πOm+1∗µ = π O m∗µ ⋉ Km. Applying\nProposition B.1, this implies that for πOn∗µ-almost any y ∈ O n\nπOm+1∗\n(\nµ | πOn\n)\n(y) = πOm∗\n(\nµ | πOn\n)\n(y)⋉Km\nWe conclude that (\nµ | πOn\n)\n(y) ∈ MKn (y), proving condition iii.\nProposition B.2. Consider X a compact Polish space, d ∈ N, Y a compact subset of Rd, π : X → Y continuous and µ ∈ P (X). Then, for π∗µ-almost any y ∈ Y\nlim r→0\nµ | π−1 ( Br (y) ) = ( µ | π ) (y) (50)\nProof. Let {fk ∈ C (X)}k∈N be dense in C (X). For any y ∈ Y and r > 0 we denote χyr : Y → {0, 1} the characteristic function of Br (y) and χ π yr : X → {0, 1} the characteristic function of π −1 ( Br (y) ) . For any k ∈ N and y0 ∈ suppπ∗µ we have µ ( π−1 ( Br (y0) ) ) = π∗µ ( Br (y0) ) > 0 and\nEµ\n[\nfk | π −1\n( Br (y0) )\n] = Eµ\n[\nχπy0rfk\n]\nµ ( π−1 ( Br (y0) )\n) =\nEy∼π∗µ\n[\nEµ\n[\nχπy0rfk | π −1 (y)\n]\n]\nπ∗µ ( Br (y0) )\nEµ\n[\nfk | π −1\n( Br (y0) )\n] = Ey∼π∗µ\n[\nχy0r Eµ [ fk | π −1 (y) ]\n]\nπ∗µ ( Br (y0) )\nIn particular, the above holds for π∗µ-almost any y0 ∈ Y . Applying the Lebesgue differentiation theorem, we conclude that there is A ⊆ Y s.t. π∗µ (A) = 1 and for any y ∈ A\n∀k ∈ N : lim r→0 Eµ\n[\nfk | π −1\n( Br (y) )\n]\n= Eµ\n[\nfk | π −1 (y)\n]\nNow consider any f ∈ C (X). For any ǫ > 0, there is k ∈ N s.t. ‖f − fk‖ < ǫ and therefore, for any y ∈ A\nlim sup r→0 Eµ\n[\nf | π−1 ( Br (y) )\n]\n≤ lim sup r→0 Eµ\n[\nfk | π −1\n( Br (y) )\n]\n+ ǫ = Eµ\n[\nfk | π −1 (y)\n]\n+ ǫ\nlim sup r→0 Eµ\n[\nf | π−1 ( Br (y) )\n]\n≤ Eµ\n[ f | π−1 (y) ] + 2ǫ\nSimilarly\nlim inf r→0 Eµ\n[\nf | π−1 ( Br (y) )\n]\n≥ Eµ\n[ f | π−1 (y) ] − 2ǫ\nTaking ǫ to 0, we conclude that\nlim r→0 Eµ\n[\nf | π−1 ( Br (y) )\n]\n= Eµ\n[ f | π−1 (y) ]\nlim r→0\nµ | π−1 ( Br (y) ) = ( µ | π ) (y)\nProof of Example 3. There is a unique minimum since all three defining properties of N are closed w.r.t. arbitrary set intersections. To see N is a regular upper bound, note that conditions i and ii are part of the definition whereas condition iii follows immediately from Proposition B.2.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was supported by the Machine Intelligence Research Institute in Berkeley, California.
