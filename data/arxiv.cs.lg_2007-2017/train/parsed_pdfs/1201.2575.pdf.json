INTRODUCTION\nEfficient link-scheduling and channel assignment are fundamental to optimal resource utilization in wireless networks [5][14][22]. Distributed scheduling is a frequent scenario, where individual nodes make scheduling decisions using only information from their neighbors [2][21][22][33].\nSuch distributed scheduling is optimal if an objective function to be optimized is local by nature, i.e., decomposable to factors with nodal variables and their neighbors [21][22][33]. Distributed scheduling with local information-exchange becomes non-optimal if information outside neighborhoods is pertinent. For example, interference causes long-range spatial dependence in multi-hop wireless networks [16][28]; thus optimal scheduling decisions made by nodes require information not only within neighborhoods but also outside.\nIn our prior work, we studied such a scenario where there was a long range spatial dependence among nodes but the\ndependence was weak. We developed distributed scheduling based on a machine learning framework, where information exchange occurred only among neighbors. Information, i.e., on residual interference, was entirely ignored outside a neighborhood range. We derived a sufficient condition to show that the aggregated spatial dependence outside a neighborhood needed to be weak, i.e., decay sufficiently fast, for such a distributed algorithm to be near-optimal.\nThis work studies the scenarios that the spatial dependence is of long-range and strong. The information, if ignored outside neighborhoods, would result in a significant link outage probability. Therefore, distributed scheduling with information exchange only from neighbors is no longer nearoptimal[16]. This corresponds to the scenario of either a slowly-decaying channel or densely populated interferers. There, the aggregated residual interference cannot be ignored [1][3][7][28][16]. Hence, a node needs to possess information outside its neighborhood, e.g., on residual interference, when making cooperative scheduling-decisions. Otherwise, decisions on channel-access made by a node may cause significant interference even at faraway nodes in a network. In our prior work [16], we show that residual interference outside a neighborhood cannot be ignored especially for slowly decaying channels and densely populated nodes. However, how to incorporate the information outside a neighborhood is not studied there. Overall, systematic study is also lacking on what size neighborhood is sufficient and what information to include for optimal distributed link-scheduling.\nOne scenario is for nodes to simply include complete information outside their neighborhood. For example, a protocol model based on contention [12] assumes that each node maintains the configuration information from an entire network. This, however, does not reflect a realistic communication environment [16], where complete information is often unavailable at individual nodes. Even if the complete information were available, a node would need to exchange information with all others [7][9][27], which can be prohibitive in a large network. As an alternative, we consider aggregated information outside the neighborhoods as an approximation.\nThe approximation does not consider information from individual nodes outside a neighborhood but their aggregated contribution. Such approximation needs to satisfy a certain optimality in regard to an underlying exact model. Hence, we first provide a network model for distributed link-scheduling. The model is developed in our prior work [16], and based\n2 on Boltzmann distribution and probabilistic graphical models (see [10] [17] and reference therein). The model includes longrange spatial dependence among all nodes in a network, and is exact under given assumptions.\nWe then consider two approximations to the long-range dependence, i.e., residual interference, outside a neighborhood range. Both approximations regard the information outside a neighborhood as one aggregated variable. In particular, the first approximation views the aggregated residual interference as a deterministic mean-field. The mean-field parameters optimize a variational bound of the probabilistic graph of our network model [20]. The parameter values are obtained through solving coupled mean-field equations [17][20]. Mean-field approximations have been used widely in machine learning and image processing [17] in the context of graphical models. In networking, Mean-Field approximation has been applied to loss networks [18]. These forms of Mean-Field approximations are derived based on an underlying model of networks, which motivate our work here. For wireless network, Mean-Field has been considered as a limiting form of a large number of mobile users [4]. This is related to the idea of aggregating dependencies outside a neighborhood in this work. Mean-Field theory is also used to derive effective link capacity of wireless networks [19].\nThe second approximation treats the aggregated residual interference as a random variable, referred to as loss variable. We show that the loss variable can be approximated by a normal distribution through the Lyapunov central limit theorem (CLT) [32]. The mean and the variance of the normal distribution can be learned using information within a neighborhood range. The approximations are combined with iterative and distributed link-scheduling decisions. In particular, a message-passing algorithm on the factor graph [23] is combined with the approximations of the long-range residual interference for the distributed and statistical link-scheduling. The mean-field parameters and the normal residual random variable form particular local functions in the factor graph. The Mean Field approximation or the distribution of the loss variables are learned iteratively from the available information within the neighborhood range. Distributed decisions are then made through alternating between approximation and message passing over the factor graph. This process repeats until convergence.\nWe then conduct simulation on network-wide link outage probability to complement the analytical derivation of the approximation and the algorithm. Simulation results show that distributed link-scheduling with an arbitrarily small neighborhood and aggregated information outside can satisfy the global SINR requirements while maximizing the channel reuse.\nThe rest of the paper is composed as follows. Section II provides motivating examples on distributed scheduling using complete, partial and approximated information. In Section III, we provide a problem formulation. Section IV provides an accurate probabilistic model of distributed link-scheduling decisions at individual nodes. In Section V, we obtain two approximations on residual interference, and the resulting simplified probabilistic graphical models. In Section VI, we derive distributed message-passing algorithm coupled with the\napproximation. In Section VII, we provide simulations to show the performance of the algorithms using two approximations. Section VIII concludes this study and discusses open questions."

The information is on the “state that includes the relative positions, the transmission statues (who is transmitting to whom), transmission power, and scheduling decisions of links. For simplicity, this work does not consider power control and assumes fixed transmission power for each node.\nThe decision made is cooperative and based on two criteria. The first is whether the SINR requirements are satisfied at the neighboring links if a node chooses to use a channel. The second is to maximize the spatial channel-reuse which is the number of concurrently active links in the network.\nDecisions are made in a distributed fashion. A node sends its decision to neighbors. The neighbors use the information to make their own link-scheduling decisions, and then send the decisions to their neighbors. Distributed decisions are made iteratively and collectively by all nodes in a network until convergence.\nAn assumption is that a node knows complete information from its neighbors. Hence, the neighborhood size relative to the entire network determines whether the information used by a node is complete or partial."

      "heading" : "B. Complete Information",
      "text" : "First, we consider an ideal setting, where complete information is available for individual nodes to make link-scheduling decisions [8][30]. The complete information is on the state from all nodes in a network. That is, the neighborhood for any node is an entire network. A node then determines whether to access a channel at a timeslot using the available information. Such a scenario is used as a baseline for comparing approximations.\nConsider an example of a linear network in Figure 1. Assume that the channel-contention constraint requires any active link between two adjacent nodes to be separated by one neighboring link. The interference constraint requires any active link to be separated by at least two links. Assume\n3\nalso that the network achieves the spatial channel-reuse maximization where the total number of concurrent active links is maximized.\nFigure 2 shows all possible configurations of active links. Each row corresponds to a snapshot of active links at a time epoch, where the active links satisfy the aforementioned contention and interference constraints. For example, the first row denotes a configuration where both link (3, 4) and (8, 9) are active. Overall, there are 2 configurations with two active links. The remaining 8 configurations have three active links that result in the maximum channel reuse. Note that for distributed decisions where each node has complete information on the activities of the others, the configurations with three active links are ones that maximize the channel reuse while satisfying the constraints."

      "heading" : "C. Partial Information",
      "text" : "Partial (state) information is available to a node when its neighborhood consists of only nodes from parts of a network.\nFor example, assume the neighborhood for each node is the adjacent link. This means that the neighborhood is only determined by the contention constraint where a node would not access the channel if its neighbor is transmitting. Such a neighborhood size is smaller than desirable since node does not know whether SINR is satisfied at its neighbors’ neighbors. Hence, the SINR constraint may be violated.\nSpecifically, under the above assumption on the neighborhood size, it is legitimate for node 3 to transmit to node 4 when links (1, 2), (6, 7) and (9, 10) are active (see the eighth row in Figure 2). Those active links are outside the neighborhood system and thus invisible to node 2. Active link (3, 4) thus generates interference, violating the SINR constraints at the existing active links.\nBy increasing the neighborhood size, we show, in our prior work [16], that an optimal configuration with three active links can be obtained through fully distributed node decisions with\na chosen neighborhood size. For example, if two links (2, 3) and (7, 8) are active at the beginning, a configuration with 3 active links can be obtained if the distributed algorithms are randomized, i.e., nodes make probabilistic decisions for transmission. Our prior work also derives sufficient conditions for such distributed scheduling to be near-optimal. However, our prior work does not study sufficiently when partial information in distributed scheduling is insufficient for an obtaining optimal configuration.\nD. Importance of Information Outside Neighborhood\nThe above example shows that for a finite and often small number of neighbors, the SINR requirement is not guaranteed [16][28]. In other words, information within a neighborhood can be insufficient for making correct distributed decisions when the information outside the neighborhood is neglected.\nTo further illustrate the importance of information outside a neighborhood, we consider another example of a multihop wireless network. The network has nodes located in a square area of 10 x 10 square meters, L = 200 links, α = 4 as the channel attenuation factor, and SINR threshold SINRth = 10. Here α = 3 corresponds to slow power decay of the channel, resulting in strong interference and thus dependence among nodes. Such a scenario is not studied in our prior work [16], where the strong dependence violates the sufficient condition we derive for distributed scheduling with a moderate neighborhood to be near-optimal.\nSuppose we ignore the residual interference outside a neighborhood range, which is common practice for large wireless networks. We then calculate the link outage probability that the SINR requirement is violated at a link. The outage probability is shown to be significant and not negligible as in Figure 3, especially for a moderate neighborhood size.\nNote that the link outage due to the ignored residual interference is different from the transient outage due to the fading channel. The link outage here is persistent. Thus, the\n4 network connectivity may not be guaranteed. Some nodes can even be permanently disconnected if outages occur persistently at adjacent links.\nThis example clearly shows that the residual interference cannot be arbitrarily ignored in a large wireless network."

The loss variable treats the impact from the rest of a network except the neighbors in aggregation.\nTwo approaches are used for the approximation. The first is to characterize the expected value of a loss variable through the deterministic Mean-Field approximation [24]. That is, a set of Mean-Field equations are obtained through optimizing a variational bound from the network model [20]. The expected values of the loss variables can be obtained iteratively through solving deterministic Mean-Field equations. The second is to regard the loss variable as random and estimate its probability distribution. The probability distribution can be learned iteratively using information within the neighborhood.\nThe approximations are incorporated into distributed scheduling decisions. Each node first estimates either the Mean-Field value or the distribution of the loss variable. The node then determines channel-access schedule using both complete information within its neighborhood and estimated information on the loss variable. The algorithm is to be described in Section VI."

Here node i is assumed to be a transmitter whereas node j is a receiver.\nWe assume that each node maintains complete information within a neighborhood range. The shape of the neighborhood for each node can be arbitrary rather than circular. The neighborhood range can be different for all nodes but bounded by a radius γf . Hence, without loss of generality, γf is assumed to be the neighborhood range for each node.\nThe channel gain for link (i, j) between node i and j is denoted as G(i, j).

Rth is the inverse of an interference threshold. R0 is a large positive constant where R0 > Rij for ∀ (i, j) ∈ L. R0 is used for the objective function to be maximized whenever a new link becomes active. The first term ∑\nij σij is the total number of active links which should be maximized for the channel reuse in the network. The second term ∑\nij Rijσij represents the effect of total interference from active links.\nThe objective function in (3) satisfies the following three properties. The objective function is (i) constrained to satisfy the SINR requirement of any active links; (ii) monotonically increasing with respect to the number of active links; and (iii) monotonically increasing as the inverse SINR of an active link decreases. Therefore, the two terms in the objective function make trade-offs between the channel reuse and the SINR requirements.\nTo measure the optimality of the objective function, we use the link outage probability P (SINRij < SINRth). As soon to be shown, a limited neighborhood size is a major cause of significant link outage probability considered in this work."

As a special case when aij,mn = 0 for mn 6∈ Nij , h∗ij = 0.\nFor (i, j) ∈ L, there are n such equations, where n is the total number of nodes in a network. Those equations are coupled.

Equation (12) then takes the following form,\nlog 1− µij µij η1 η2 = ∑\nmn6∈Nij aij,mnµmn, (13)\nwhere η1 and η2 are functions of h∗kl’s for (k, l) 6= (i, j) (and in turn µkl’s). Hence, the set of n equations are coupled through unknown values of h∗ij’s or µij ’s. Appendix I provides detailed derivations.\nThe coupled Mean-Field equations can be solved iteratively and numerically starting from an initial condition [20]. The Mean-Field entity h∗ij can also be estimated when measurements are available. For example, the interference within the neighborhood range can be known with the information exchange. Thus, if we assume that the aggregated interference can be measured possibly with a measurement error, h∗ij can be estimated when interference measurements are available.\nAn advantage of the Mean-Field approximation is that a resulting probability model is a simple Markov random field, where the deterministic Mean-Field values h∗ijs absorb the long-range spatial dependence in the residual interference. However, the Mean-Field approximation exhibits two disadvantages. First, it can be computationally intensive to solve a set of Mean-Field equations. Second, if the MeanField parameters are estimated by measurements instead, such measurements on the aggregative residual interference are either unavailable or computationally intensive to obtain. For example, such measurements require nodes to transmit test signals during link-scheduling decisions. In addition, nodes need to be capable of measuring the aggregated interference.\n7 For example, packet reception ratio (PRR) versus SINR models need to be seeded by O(n) trials in an n-node network where each node transmits while receivers measure the channel conditions [26]."

Such an approximation can be computationally less expensive to obtain than the Mean-Field approximation.\nLet nij be a random variable that approximates the residual interference of an active link (i, j). Our goal is to identify a probability distribution for nij . As residual interference aggregates interference signals from many interferers, one option is to approximate nij as a normal random variables.\nWe first obtain an expression for nij to understand whether a normal approximation is feasible. Based on our assumptions, interferers have the same transmission power P0. Locations of interferers outside a neighborhood range can be arbitrary/random but follow certain patterns of node-positions within the neighborhood. In other words, the network topology exhibits a certain regularity. Specifically, the following assumptions are posed on the location of interferers.\n• For an active link (i, j), all interferers are located uniformly within radial bands bounded by concentric circles from receiver j. The radius of the circles exhibits randomness, i.e., rk = rk−1 + xk for k ≥ 1, where r0=γf , and xk=x is a uniform random variable between rl and ru. Here, rl and ru are the minimum and maximum distance between any two active links, within the neighborhood of link (i, j). The circle with radius rk is called the k-th frontier. • On the k-th frontier for k ≥ 1, any two neighboring active links are separated by random distance x0. Random variables xk and x0 are independent and identically distributed.\nLemma 1: With the above two assumptions, the residual interference hij for active link (i, j) can be modeled as\nnij =\n∞ ∑\nk=1\n(P0r −α k ) · (2πrk/x0), (14)\nwhere rk = rk−1 + xk with r0=γf as a constant. xk = x is a random variable for k ≥ 1. x and x0 are both independent and identically distributed with a uniform distribution between rl\nand ru, for k 6= m. The proof can be found in Appendix II. This lemma shows that random positions of interferers outside a neighborhood follow similar characteristics to within the neighborhood.\nNext, we derive the mean and the variance of nij’s. For analytical feasibility of obtaining the mean value, we approximate the joint probability density P (r1, · · · , r∞) with a product form based on the Mean-field approximation [24].\nLemma 2: Consider {r1, · · · , r∞} as a random field.

Closed-form expressions can be derived in the following lemma for the individual terms in the sum.\nLemma 3: Let uk be the term in the summation in (16), where uk = 2πP0r 1−α k = 2πP0(rk−1 + xk)\n1−α. Denote the mean and the variance of uk as E(uk) and\nV (uk) respectively. For α > 2,\nE(uk) = 2πP0(D\n2−α 1 −D 2−α 2 )\n(2− α)(ru − rl) ,\nV (uk) = E(u 2 k)− E(uk) 2,\nwhere D1 = γf + (k − 1)rc + ru, D2 = γf + (k − 1)rc + rl, and E(u2k) = 4π 2P 20 (D 3−2α 1 −D 3−2α 2 )/((3− 2α)(r\nu − rl)). Let the k-th term of nij be vk =\nuk x0 . Then, E(vk) = E(uk) ln(r\nu/rl) ru−rl , and V (vk) = V (uk) rurl .\nThe proof is given in Appendix IV. Using the results from Lemmas 1-3, we obtain the mean and the variance of the residual interferences below.\nTheorem 1: For a link (i, j), residual interference nij is a finite sum of independent random variables with different probability distributions. Thus, the probability distribution of nij is approximately normal with mean E(nij) and variance V (nij), where E(nij) = ∑∞ k=1 E(vk), and V (nij) = ∑∞\nk=1 V (vk). The proof is provided in Appendix V.\nHow accurate is the normal approximation? We check the modeling accuracy using Lyapunov condition. For nij to\n8 converge to a normal distribution, the Lyapunov condition on nij = ∑∞ k=1 vk should satisfy\n( ∑∞\nk=1 E(|vk − E(vk)|\n3) )1/3\n( ∑∞\nk=1 V (vk)\n)1/2 → 0. (17)\nSuch condition is valid for an infinite sum of independent random variables. As the interference from far apart interferers is diminishing to zero, nij is in reality a sum of a finite number of independent random variables. As a result, the Lyapunov condition converges to a small constant instead of zero. A numerical analysis on the normal approximation is conducted on a network with infinite nodes, the increase of neighborhood size to k-th frontier neighbors, and channel attenuation parameter α = 4. Figure 7 shows that the Lyapunov condition converges to a small constant around 0.97.\nHence, the advantage of the normal approximation is the simplicity. Only the mean and the variance need to be estimated. However, the approximation can deviate somewhat from a normal random variable measured by the Lyapunov condition."

      "text" : "Using the above experimental setting, we first study through simulation whether distributed decisions converge sufficiently fast. Figure 9 shows that the distributed link-scheduling decisions converge through interactions among neighbors in a few iterations.\n10\nWe now compare the performance of the following algorithms: (a) distributed link scheduling with the MeanField approximation, (b) distributed link scheduling with the normal approximation, and (c) the conventional distributed link-scheduling algorithm [2][9][16] that simply ignores the residual interference outside neighborhood range. The link outage probability is used as a performance measure. Such a performance measure assesses the probability that a link cannot satisfy the SINR requirement. Here, the link outage is mainly caused by the limited neighborhood size. There, improved performance signifies the importance of proper approximations of information outside a neighborhood.\nFigure 10 plots the outage probability as a function of neighborhood size γf assuming that all nodes have the same size neighborhood. This figure shows that our two approximations for the information outside neighborhoods result in a small link outage probability given for a small neighborhood range γf . The conventional scheme, however, has a large linkoutage probability for a small γf . This shows that for a small neighborhood, learning the residual interference with a loss variable provides a big gain. The performance with the meanfield approximation varies with respect to the measurement error of residual interference. When the measurement error is small, the Mean-Field approximation results in a small linkoutage probability across different neighborhood sizes. Overall, the two approximation approaches outperform significantly the method that ignores the residual interference, showing the importance of approximating the information outside a neighborhood.\nFigure 11 shows how the link-outage probability varies with respect to channel attenuation factor α. The link outage probability for the two approximation schemes remains small for different α. As α increases, the residual interference outside the neighborhood decrease, and the link outage probability of the two approximation schemes approaches zero.\nIt is worth mentioning that for small α, e.g., α = 3, the two approximation approaches significantly outperform the conventional approach. The scenario of small α is shown in our prior work [16] to be difficult for distributed scheduling with information only from neighbors. Hence, the result here shows the importance and the ability of the approximations to account for the aggregated residual interference outside a neighborhood.\nFigure 12 and 13 show the performance as a function of SINR. As SINR threshold increases, the link outage probability increases proportionally except for the Mean-Field approximation with small measurement error. The performance of the Mean-Field approximation for a large measurement error is worse as the SINR threshold increases. This is because the SINR constraint is more easily violated due to the measurement error as the SINR threshold increases.\nFor the approximation scheme with Lyapunov central limit theorem (CLT), once γf is moderately large, the proposed scheme copes well with a large SINR threshold. When neighborhood size γf is not sufficiently large, for a moderate SINR threshold, conventional schemes in the literature often fail to satisfy the SINR requirement, resulting in a high link outage probability. On the contrary, across a wide range of SINR threshold values, the proposed scheme with Lyapunov CLT performs efficiently and improves the link outage probability significantly. In particular, if γf is moderate (e.g., γf = 4 in Figure 13), the link outage probability quickly approaches zero. Therefore, with both approximation approaches, resource utilization is significantly improved overall."

      "heading" : "VIII. CONCLUSION",
      "text" : "We have studied in this work distributed scheduling decisions where each wireless node uses complete information within a neighborhood and inferred information outside. We\n11\nhave characterized the complex spatial dependence of distributed link-scheduling decisions with a factor graph. The factor graph enables information exchange among neighbors. More importantly, the long-range dependence in residual interference is not ignored but approximated by one variable as the aggregated dependence outside a neighborhood. The Mean Field approximation considers the residual interference outside a neighborhood as a deterministic Mean-Field. Such Mean-Field approximation optimizes the variational free energy, resulting in a simple Markov Random Field model for distributed decisions. A disadvantage is that the Mean-Field estimates can be computationally costly to obtain. The normal approximation considers the residual interference outside a neighborhood as a random loss variable. Such a loss variable is\napproximately normal by the Lyapunov central limit theorem, resulting in a simple Random Bond model for distributed scheduling decisions. A disadvantage is that the condition for the asymptotic normality can be somewhat deviated for a network with a finite size.\nThe approximated dependencies are easily incorporated into the factor graph. This results in an extended message-passing algorithm with the two phases. First, the approximations are obtained iteratively from the available information at neighboring nodes. Second, the approximations are combined with messages from neighboring nodes and allow each node to make its link-scheduling decisions. The algorithm alternates between the two phases, and has been shown to converge in a few than 10 iterations.\nWe have shown through simulations that the link outage probability of the resulting link-scheduling decisions is significantly improved by the approximated information. The improvement is especially pronounced for distributed decisions with a small number of neighbors and a slowly-varying channel, where the link-outage probability is reduced from, e.g., 0.3 to 0.04.\nAn open issue as possible future work is to derive an analytical relationship between the network-wide link outage probability and the approximated information.\nAPPENDIX"

    "abstractText" : "In a large multi-hop wireless network, nodes are preferable to make distributed link-scheduling decisions with information exchange only among a small number of neighbors. However, for a slowly-decaying channel and densely-populated interfering nodes, a small size neighborhood often results in nontrivial link outages and is thus insufficient for making optimal scheduling decisions. A question arises how to incorporate the information outside a neighborhood in distributed link-scheduling. In this work, we develop joint approximation of information and distributed link scheduling. We first apply machine learning approaches to model distributed link-scheduling with complete information. We then characterize the information outside a neighborhood, i.e., the residual interference, as an aggregated random loss variable. The loss variable is characterized by either a Mean-Field approximation or a normal distribution based on the Lyapunov central limit theorem. The approximated information outside a neighborhood is incorporated in a factor graph. This results in joint approximation of information and distributed link-scheduling in an iterative fashion. Link-scheduling decisions are first made at each individual node based on the approximated loss variables. Loss variables are then updated and used for next link-scheduling decisions. The algorithm repeats between these two phases until convergence. Interactive iterations among these variables are implemented by a message-passing algorithm over a factor graph. Simulation results show that using learned information outside a neighborhood jointly with distributed linkscheduling reduces the outage probability close to zero even for a small neighborhood.",
