      "text" : "For high-dimensional structured estimation problems [7, 27], considerable advances have been made in accurately estimating a sparse or structured parameter θ ∈ Rp even when the sample size n is far smaller than the ambient dimensionality of θ∗, i.e., n p. Instead of a single structure, such as sparsity or low rank, recent years have seen interest in parameter estimation when the parameter θ∗ is a superposition or sum of multiple different structures, i.e., θ = ∑k i=1 θ ∗ i , where θ ∗ 1 may be sparse, θ ∗ 2 may be low rank, and so on [1, 8, 9, 11, 15, 16, 18, 19, 31, 32].\nIn this paper, we substantially generalize the non-asymptotic estimation error analysis for such superposition models such that (i) the parameter θ can be the superposition of any number of component parameters θ∗i , and (ii) the structure in each θ∗i can be captured by any suitable norm Ri(θ ∗ i ). We will analyze the following linear measurement based superposition model\ny = X k∑ i=1 θ∗i + ω , (1)\nwhere X ∈ Rn×p is a random sub-Gaussian design or compressive matrix, k is the number of components,\nar X\niv :1\n70 5.\n10 88\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 3\n0 M\nθ∗i is one component of the unknown parameters, y ∈ Rn is the response vector, and ω ∈ Rn is random noise independent of X . The structure in each component θ∗i is captured by any suitable norm Ri(·), such that Ri(θ ∗ i ) has a small value, e.g., sparsity captured by ‖θ∗i ‖1, low-rank (for matrix θ∗i ) captured by the nuclear norm ‖θ∗i ‖∗, etc. Popular models such as Morphological Component Analysis (MCA) [14] and Robust PCA [8, 11] can be viewed as a special cases of this framework (see Section 9).\nThe superposition estimation problem can be posed as follows: Given (y,X) generated following (1), estimate component parameters {θ̂i} such that all the component-wise estimation errors ∆i = θ̂i − θ∗i , where θ∗i is the population mean, are small. Ideally, we want to obtain high-probability non-asymptotic bounds on the total componentwise error measured as ∑k i=1 ‖θ̂i − θ∗i ‖2, with the bound improving (getting smaller) with increase in the number n of samples.\nWe propose the following estimator for the superposition model in (1):\nmin {θ1,...,θk} ∥∥∥∥∥y −X k∑ i=1 θi ∥∥∥∥∥ 2\n2\ns.t. Ri(θi) ≤ αi , i = 1, . . . , k , (2)\nwhere αi are suitable constants. In this paper, we focus on the case where αi = Ri(θ∗i ), noting that recent advances [22] can be used to extend our results to more general settings.\nThe superposition estimator in (2) succeeds if a certain geometric condition, which we call structural coherence (SC), is satisfied by certain sets (cones) associated with the component norms Ri(·). Since the estimate θ̂i = θ∗i + ∆i is in the feasible set of the optimization problem (2), the error vector ∆i satisfies the constraint Ri(θ∗i + ∆i) ≤ αi where αi = Ri(θ∗i ). The SC condition of is a geometric relationship between the corresponding error cones Ci = cone{∆i|Ri(θ∗i + ∆i) ≤ Ri(θ∗i )} (see Section 3). If SC is satisfied, then we can show that the sum of componentwise estimation error can be bounded with high probability, and the bound takes the form:\nk∑ i=1 ‖θ̂i − θ∗i ‖2 ≤ c maxiw(Ci ∩Bp) + √ log k√ n , (3)\nwhere n is the sample size, k is the number of components, and w(Ci∩Bp) is the Gaussian width [3, 10, 30] of the intersection of the error cone Ci with the unit Euclidean ball Bp ⊆ Rp. Interestingly, the estimation error converges at the rate of 1√\nn , similar to the case of single parameter estimators [21, 3], and depends only\nlogarithmically on the number of components k. Further, while dependency of the error on Gaussian width of the error has been shown in recent results involving a single parameter [3, 30], the bound in (3) depends on the maximum of the Gaussian width of individual error cones, not their sum. The analysis thus gives a general way to construct estimators for superposition problems along with high-probability non-asymptotic upper bounds on the sum of componentwise errors. To show the generality of our work, we provide a detailed review and comparison with related work in Appendix 8.\nNotation: In this paper, we use ‖.‖ to denote vector norm, and |||.||| to denote operator norm. For example, ‖.‖2 is the Euclidean norm for a vector or matrix, and |||.|||∗ is the nuclear norm of a matrix. We denote cone{E} as the smallest closed cone that contains a given set E . We denote 〈., .〉 as the inner product.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: We start with an optimization algorithm in Section 6 and a deterministic estimation error bound in Section 2, while laying down the key geometric and statistical quantities involved in the analysis. In Section 3, we discuss the geometry of the structural coherence (SC) condition, and show that the geometric SC condition implies statistical restricted eigenvalue (RE) condition. In Section 5, we develop the main error bound on the sum of componentwise errors which hold with high probability for sub-Gaussian designs and noise. In Section 7, we compare an estimator using “infimal convolution”[25] of norms with our estimator (2) for the noiseless case. We discuss related work in Section 8. We apply our error bound to practical problems in Section 9, present experimental results in Section 10, and conclude in Section 11. The proofs of all technical results are in the Appendix."

      "text" : "In this section, we start with some basic results and, under suitable assumptions, provide a deterministic bound for the componentwise estimation error in superposition models. Subsequently, we will show that the assumptions made here hold with high probability as long as a purely geometric non-probabilistic condition characterized by structural coherence (SC) is satisfied. Let {θ̂i} be a solution to the superposition estimation problem in (2), {θ∗i } be the optimal (population) parameters involved in the true data generation process. Let ∆i = θ̂i− θ∗i be the error vector for component i of the superposition. Our goal is to provide a preliminary understanding of the structure of error sets where ∆i live, identify conditions under which a bound on the total componentwise error ∑k i=1 ‖θ̂i − θ∗i ‖2 will hold, and provide a preliminary version of such a bound, which will be subsequently refined to the form in (3) in Section 5. Since θ̂i = θ∗i + ∆i lies in the feasible set of (2), as discussed in Section 1, the error vectors ∆i will lie in the error sets Ei = {∆i ∈ Rp|Ri(θ∗i + ∆i) ≤ Ri(θ∗i )} respectively. For the analysis, we will be focusing on the cone of such error sets, given by\nCi = cone{∆i ∈ Rp|Ri(θ∗i + ∆i) ≤ Ri(θ∗i )} . (4)\nLet θ∗ = ∑k\ni=1 θ ∗ i , θ̂ = ∑k i=1 θ̂i, and ∆ = ∑k i=1 ∆i, so that ∆ = θ̂ − θ∗. From the optimality of θ̂ as a\nsolution to (2), we have\n‖y −Xθ̂‖2 ≤ ‖y −Xθ∗‖2 ⇒ ‖X∆‖2 ≤ 2ωTX∆ , (5)\nusing θ̂ = θ∗ + ∆ and y = Xθ∗ + ω. In order to establish recovery guarantees, under suitable assumptions we construct a lower bound to ‖X∆‖2, the left hand side of (5). The lower bound is a generalized form of the restricted eigenvalue (RE) condition studied in the literature [5, 7, 24]. We also construct an upper bound to ωTX∆, the right hand side of (5), which needs to carefully analyze the noise-design (ND) interaction, i.e., between the noise ω and the design X .\nWe start by assuming that a generalized form of RE condition is satisfied by the superposition of errors:\nthere exists a constant κ > 0 such that for all ∆i ∈ Ci, i = 1, 2, . . . , k:\n(RE) 1√ n ∥∥∥∥∥X k∑ i=1 ∆i ∥∥∥∥∥ 2 ≥ κ k∑ i=1 ‖∆i‖2 . (6)\nThe above RE condition considers the following set:\nH = { k∑ i=1 ∆i : ∆i ∈ Ci, k∑ i=1 ‖∆i‖2 = 1 } . (7)\nwhich involves all the k error cones, and the lower bound is over the sum of norms of the component wise errors. If k = 1, the RE condition in (6) above simplifies to the widely studied RE condition in the current literature on Lasso-type and Dantzig-type estimators [5, 24, 3] where only one error cone is involved. If we set all components but ∆i to zero, then (6) becomes the RE condition only for component i. We also note that the general RE condition as explicitly stated in (6) has been implicitly used in [1] and [32]. For subsequent analysis, we introduce the set H̄ defined as\nH̄ = { k∑ i=1 ∆i : ∆i ∈ Ci, k∑ i=1 ‖∆i‖2 ≤ 1 } . (8)\nnoting thatH ⊂ H̄. The general RE condition in (6) depends on the random design matrix X , and is hence an inequality which will hold with certain probability depending on X and the set H. For superposition problems, the probabilistic RE condition as in (6) is intimately related to the following deterministic structural coherence (SC) condition on the interaction of the different component cones Ci, without any explicit reference to the random design matrix X: there is a constant ρ > 0 such that for all ∆i ∈ Ci, i = 1, . . . , k,\n(SC)\n∥∥∥∥∥ k∑ i=1 ∆i ∥∥∥∥∥ 2 ≥ ρ k∑ i=1 ‖∆i‖2 . (9)\nIf k = 1, the SC condition is trivially satisfied with ρ = 1. Since most existing literature on high-dimensional structured models focus on the k = 1 setting [5, 24, 3], there was no reason to study the SC condition carefully. For k > 1, the SC condition (9) implies a non-trivial relationship among the component cones. In particular, if the SC condition is true, then the sum ∑k i=1 ∆i being zero implies that each component ∆i must also be zero. As presented in (9), the SC condition comes across as an algebraic condition. In Section 3, we present a geometric characterization of the SC condition [18], and illustrate that the condition is both necessary and sufficient for accurate recovery of each component. In Section 4, we show that for sub-Gaussian design matrices X , the SC condition in (9) in fact implies that the RE condition in (6) will hold with high probability, after the number of samples crosses a certain sample complexity, which depends on the Gaussian width of the component cones. For now, we assume the RE condition in (6) to hold, and proceed with the error bound analysis.\nTo establish recovery guarantee, following (5), we need an upper bound on the interaction between noise ω\nand design X [3, 20]. In particular, we consider the noise-design (ND) interaction\n(ND) sn(γ) = inf s>0\n{ s : sup\nu∈sH\n1√ n ωTXu ≤ γs2 √ n\n} , (10)\nwhere γ > 0 is a constant, and sH is the scaled version ofH where the scaling factor is s > 0. Here, sn(γ) denotes the minimal scaling needed onH such that one obtains a uniform bound over ∆ ∈ sH of the form: 1 nω\nTX∆ ≤ γs2n(γ). Then, from the basic inequality in (5), with the bounds implied by the RE condition and the ND interaction, we have\n1√ n ‖X∆‖2 ≤ 1√ n\n√ ωTX∆ ⇒ κ k∑ i=1 ‖∆i‖2 ≤ √ γsn(γ) , (11)\nwhich implies a bound on the component-wise error. The main deterministic bound below states the result formally:\nTheorem 1 (Deterministic bound) Assume that the RE condition in (6) is satisfied inH with parameter κ. Then, if κ2 > γ, we have ∑k i=1 ‖∆i‖2 6 2sn(γ).\nThe above bound is deterministic and holds only when the RE condition in (6) is satisfied with constant κ such that κ2 > γ. In the sequel, we first give a geometric characterization of the SC condition in Section 3, and show that the SC condition implies the RE condition with high probability in Section 4. Further, we give a high probability characterization of sn(γ) based on the noise ω and design X in terms of the Gaussian widths of the component cones, and also illustrate how one can choose γ in Section 5. With these characterizations, we will obtain the desired component-wise error bound of the form (3)."

      "text" : "In this section, we give a geometric characterization of the structural coherence (SC) condition in (9). We start with the simplest case of two vectors x, y. If they are not reflections of each other, i.e., x 6= −y, then the following relationship holds:\nProposition 2 If there exists a δ < 1 such that −〈x, y〉 ≤ δ‖x‖2‖y‖2, then\n‖x+ y‖2 ≥ √\n1− δ 2 (‖x‖2 + ‖y‖2) . (12)\nNext, we generalize the condition of Proposition 2 to vectors in two different cones C1 and C2. Given the cones, define\nδ0 = sup x∈C1∩Sp−1,y∈C2∩Sp−1\n− 〈x, y〉 . (13)\nBy construction, −〈x, y〉 ≤ δ0‖x‖2‖y‖2 for all x ∈ C1 and y ∈ C2. If δ0 < 1, then (12) continues to hold for all x ∈ C1 and y ∈ C2 with constant √ (1− δ0)/2 > 0. Note that this corresponds to the SC condition\nwith k = 2 and ρ = √\n(1− δ0)/2. We can interpret this geometrically as follows: first reflect cone C1 to get −C1, then δ is the cosine of the minimum angle between −C1 and C2. If δ0 = 1, then −C1 and C2 share a ray, and structural coherence does not hold. Otherwise, δ0 < 1, implying −C1 ∩ C2 = {0}, i.e., the two cones intersect only at the origin, and structural coherence holds.\nFor the general case involving k cones, denote\nδi = sup u∈−Ci∩Sp−1,v∈ ∑ j 6=i Cj∩Sp−1 〈u, v〉 . (14)\nIn recent work, [18] concluded that if δi < 1 for each i = 1, . . . , k then −Ci and ∑\nj 6=i Cj does not share a ray, and the original signal can be recovered in noiseless case. We show that the condition above in fact implies ρ > 0 for the SC condition in (9), which is sufficient for accurate recovery even in the noisy case. In particular, with δ := maxi δi, we have the following result:\nTheorem 3 (Structural Coherence (SC) Condition) Let δ := maxi δi with δi as defined in (14). If δ < 1, there exists a ρ > 0 such that for any ∆i ∈ Ci, i = 1, . . . , k, the SC condition in (9) holds, i.e.,∥∥∥∥∥ k∑ i=1 ∆i ∥∥∥∥∥ 2 ≥ ρ k∑ i=1 ‖∆i‖2 . (15)\nThus, the SC condition is satisfied in the general case as long as the reflection −Ci of any cone Ci does not intersect, i.e., share a ray, with the Minkowski sum ∑ j 6=i Cj of the other cones."

      "text" : "Assuming that the SC condition is satisfied by the error cones {Ci}, i = 1, . . . , k, in this section we show that the general RE condition in (6) will be satisfied with high probability when the number of samples n in the sub-Gaussian design matrix X ∈ Rn×p crosses the sample complexity n0. We give a precise characterization of the sample complexity n0 in terms of the Gaussian width of the setH. Our analysis is based on the results and techniques in [28, 20], and we note that [3] has related results using mildly different techniques. We start with a restricted eigenvalue condition on H. For a random vector Z ∈ Rp, we define marginal tail function for an arbitrary set E as\nQξ(E;Z) = inf u∈E\nP (|〈Z, u〉| ≥ ξ) , (16)\nnoting that it is deterministic given the set E ⊆ Rp. Let i, i = 1, . . . , n, be independent Rademacher random variables, i.e., random variable with probability 12 of being either +1 or−1, and letXi, i = 1, . . . , n, be independent copies of Z. We define empirical width of E as\nWn(E;Z) = sup u∈E 〈h, u〉, where h = 1√ n n∑ i=1 iXi . (17)\nWith this notation, we recall the following result from [28, Proposition 5.1]:\nLemma 1 Let X ∈ Rn×p be a random design matrix with each row the independent copy of sub-Gaussian random vector Z. Then for any ξ, ρ, t > 0, we have\ninf u∈H ‖Xu‖2 ≥ ρξ\n√ nQ2ρξ(H;Z)− 2Wn(H;Z)− ρξt (18)\nwith probability at least 1− e− t2 2 .\nFrom Lemma 1, in order to obtain lower bound of κ in RE condition (6), we need to lower boundQ2ρξ(H;Z) and upper bound Wn(H;Z). To lower bound Q2ρξ(H;Z), we consider the spherical cap\nA = ( ∑k\ni=1 Ci) ∩ Sp−1 . (19)\nFrom [28, 20], one can obtain a lower bound to Qξ(A;Z) based on the Paley-Zygmund inequality. The Paley-Zygmund inequality lower bound the tail distribution of a random variable by its second momentum. Let u be an arbitrary vector, we use the following version of the inequality.\nP (|〈Z, u〉| ≥ 2ξ) ≥ [E|〈Z, u〉| − 2ξ]2+\nE|〈Z, u〉|2 (20)\nIn the current context, the following result is a direct consequence of SC condition, which shows that Q2ρξ(H;Z) is lower bounded by Qξ(A;Z), which in turn is strictly bounded away from 0. The proof of Lemma 2 is given in Appendix C.1.\nLemma 2 Let setsH andA be as defined in (7) and (19) respectively. If the SC condition in (9) holds, then the marginal tail functions of the two sets have the following relationship:\nQρξ(H;Z) ≥ Qξ(A;Z). (21)\nNext we discuss how to upper bound the empirical width Wn(H;Z). Let set E be arbitrary, and random vector g ∼ N (0, Ip) be a standard Gaussian random vector in Rp. The Gaussian width [3] of E is defined as\nw(E) = E sup u∈E 〈g, u〉. (22)\nEmpirical width Wn(H;Z) can be seen as the supremum of a stochastic process. One way to upper bound the supremum of a stochastic process is by generic chaining [26, 3, 28], and by using generic chaining we can upper bound the stochastic process by a Gaussian process, which is the Gaussian width. As we can bound Q2ρξ(H;Z) and Wn(H;Z), we come to the conclusion on RE condition. Let X ∈ Rn×p be a random matrix where each row is an independent copy of the sub-Gaussian random vector Z ∈ Rp, and where Z has sub-Gaussian norm |||Z|||ψ2 ≤ σx [29]. Let α = infu∈Sp−1 E[|〈Z, u〉|] so that α > 0 [20, 28]. We have the following lower bound of the RE condition. The proof of Theorem 4 is based on the proof of [28, Theorem 6.3], and we give it in appendix C.2.\nTheorem 4 (Restricted Eigenvalue Condition) LetX be the sub-Gaussian design matrix that satisfies the assumptions above. If the SC condition (9) holds with a ρ > 0, then with probability at least 1−exp(−t2/2), we have\ninf u∈H ‖Xu‖2 ≥ c1ρ\n√ n− c2w(H)− c3ρt (23)\nwhere c1, c2 and c3 are positive constants determined by σx, σω and α.\nTo get a κ > 0 in (6), one can simply choose t = (c1ρ √ n − c2w(H))/2c3ρ. Then as long as n > c4w 2(H)/ρ2 for c4 = c22/c21, we have\nκ = inf u∈H 1√ n ‖Xu‖2 ≥ 1 2\n( c1ρ− c2\nw(H)√ n\n) > 0,\nwith high probability.\nFrom the discussion above, if SC condition holds and the sample size n is large enough, then we can find a matrix X such that RE condition holds. On the other hand, once there is a matrix X such that RE condition holds, then we can show that SC must also be true. Its proof is give in Appendix C.3.\nProposition 5 If X is a matrix such that the RE condition (6) holds for ∆i ∈ Ci, then the SC condition (9) holds.\nProposition 5 demonstrates that SC condition is a necessary condition for the possibility of RE. If SC condition does not hold, then there is {∆i} such that ∆i 6= 0 for some i = 1, . . . , k, but ‖ ∑k i=1 ∆i‖2 = 0\nwhich implies ∑k i=1 ∆i = 0. Then for every matrix X , we have X ∑k\ni=1 ∆i = 0, and RE condition is not possible."

To get some properties of decomposition (30), we consider the unit norm balls for normR(.) and component\nnorms Ri(.):\nΩR = {θ ∈ Rp : R(θ) ≤ 1} and ΩiR = {θi ∈ Rp : Ri(θi) ≤ 1} , i = 1, . . . , k .\nThe norm balls are related by the following result, we give the proof in appendix F.1. Lemma 5 For a given set {λi}, the infimal convolution norm ball ΩR is the convex hull of ⋃k i=1 1 λi ΩiR, i.e.,\nΩR = conv( ⋃k i=1 1 λi ΩiR).\nLemma 5 illustrates what the decomposition (30) should be like. If θ is a point on the surface of the norm ball ΩR, then the value of R(θ) is the convex combination of some θi on the surface of 1λiΩ i R such that Ri(θi) = R(θ). Hence if θ can be successfully decomposed into different components along the direction of θi, then we should be able to connect θi and θ by a surface on the R(.) norm ball, or they have to be “close”. Interestingly, the above intuition of “closeness” between different components θi can be described in the language of cones, in a way similar to the structural coherence property discussed in Section 3.\nGiven the intuition above, we state the main result in this section below. Its proof is given in appendix F.2.\nTheorem 7 Given θ̂1, . . . , θ̂k and define\nC0 = ∑ θi 6=0 ( c′i ci − 1 ) θi | c′i ≥ 0, k∑ i=1 c′i = 1  . (32) Suppose dim(span{θi}) = k, then there exist λ1, . . . , λk such that ∑k i=1 θ̂i = θ are unique solutions of\n(30) if and only if there are c1, . . . , ck with ci ≥ 0 and ∑k\ni=1 ci = 1 such that for the corresponding error cone Ci of θ̂i and C0 defined above, −Ci ∩ ∑ j 6=i Cj = {0}, for i = 0, 1, . . . , k.\nTheorem 7 illustrate that the successful decomposition of (30) requires an additional condition, i.e., −C0 ∩∑k i=1 Ci = {0} beyond that is needed by the SC condition (see Section 3). The additional condition needs us to choose parameters {λi} properly. Theorem 7 shows that {λi} depends on both {θ∗i } and {ci}. For appropriate {θ∗i }, there may be a range of {ci} such that the solution is unique. Therefore, in noiseless situation, if we know {Ri(θ∗i )}, then solving estimator (29) would be a better idea, because it requires less condition to recover the true value and we do not need to choose parameters {λi}."

      "text" : "Structured superposition models have been studied in recent literatures. Early work focus on the case when k=2 and noise ω = 0, and assume specific structures such as sparse+sparse [14], and low-rank+sparse [11]. [16] analyze error bound for low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition with noise. Recent work have considered more generalized models and structures. [1] analyze the decomposition of a low-rank matrix plus another matrix with generalized structure. [15] propose an estimator for the decomposition of two generalize structured matrices, while one of them has a random rotation. Because of the increase in practical application and non-trivial of such problem, people have begun to work on unified frameworks for superposition model. In [31], the authors generalize the noiseless matrix decomposition problem to arbitrary number of superposition under random orthogonal measurement. [32] consider the superposition of structures of structures captured by decomposable norm, while [18] consider general norms but with a different measurement model, involving componentwise random rotations. These two papers are similar in spirit to our work, so we briefly discuss and differentiate our work from these papers.\n[32] consider a general framework for superposition model, and give a high-probability bound for the fol-\nlowing estimation problem:\nmin θi,i=1,...,k ∥∥∥∥∥y −X k∑ i=1 θi ∥∥∥∥∥ 2\n2\n+ k∑ i=1 λiRi(θi) (33)\nthey assume each Ri() to be a special kind of norm called decomposable norm. the authors used a different approach for RE condition. They decompose ‖X ∑k i=1 ∆i‖2 into two parts. One is\n1 n‖X∆i‖ 2 2 ≥ κ‖∆i‖22, (34)\nwhich characterizes the restricted eigenvalue of each error cone. The other is\n2 n | ∑ i<j〈X∆i, X∆j〉| ≤ κ 2 ∑k i=1 ‖∆i‖22, (35)\nwhich characterizes the interaction between different error cones. (35) is a strong assumption, and RE condition can hold without it. If ∆i and ∆j are positively correlated, then large interaction terms will make our RE condition stronger. Therefore their results are restricted.\n[19] consider an estimator like (2), which is\nmin θi,i=1,...,k ∥∥∥∥∥y −X k∑ i=1 Qiθi ∥∥∥∥∥ 2\n2\ns.t. Ri(θi) ≤ Ri(θ∗i ), i = 1, . . . , k, (36)\nwhereQi are known random rotations. Problem (36) is then transformed into a geometric problem: whether k random cones intersect. The componentwise random rotation can ensure that any kind of combination can be recovered with high probability. However, in practical problems, we need not have such random rotations available as part of the measurements. Further, their analysis is primarily focused on the noiseless case."

In [14], the authors introduced a quantity\nM = max i,j |Qij |. (37)\nFor small enough M , if the sum of their sparsity is lower than a constant related to M , we can recovery them. We show that for two given sparse vectors, our SC condition is more general.\nConsider the following estimator\nmin θ1,θ2 ‖y −X(θ1 + θ2)‖22 s.t. ‖θ1‖1 ≤ ‖θ∗1‖1, ‖Qθ2‖1 ≤ ‖Qθ∗2‖1, (38)\nwhere vector y ∈ Rn is the observation, vectors θ1, θ2 ∈ Rp are the parameters we want to estimate, matrix X ∈ Rn×p is a sub-Gaussian random design, matrix Q ∈ Rp×p is orthogonal. We assume θ1 and Qθ2 are s1-sparse and s2-sparse vectors respectively. Function ‖Q.‖1 is still a norm. Suppose s1 = 1, s2 = 1, and the i-th entry of θ1 and the j-th entry of Qθ2 are non-zero. If\nQijsign(θ∗1)isign(Qθ ∗ 2) > 0,\nthen we have\nρ ≥ √ (1− √\n1−Q2ij)/2. (39)\nThus we will have chance to separate θ1 and θ2 successfully. It is easy to see that M is lower bounded by θT1 Qθ2. Large θ T 1 Qθ2 leads to larger M , but also leads to larger ρ, which is better for separating θ1 and θ2. The proof of above bound of ρ is given in Appendix E.1.\nIn general, it is difficult for us to derive a lower bound of ρ like 39. Instead, we can derive the following sufficient condition in terms of M :\nTheorem 8 If M ≤ 18√s1s2 , then for problem (38) with high probability\n‖θ1 − θ∗1‖2 + ‖θ2 − θ∗2‖2 = O\n( max {√ s1 log p\nn ,\n√ s2 log p\nn\n}) .\nWhen s1 = s2 = 1, this condition M ≤ 18√s1s2 is much stronger than (39), because every entry of Q has to be smaller than 1/8;\n9.2 Morphological Component Analysis Using k-support Norm\nk-support norm [2] is another way to induce sparse solution instead of l1 norm. Recent works [2, 12] have shown that k-support norm has better statistical guarantee than l1 norm. For arbitrary θ ∈ Rp, its k-support norm ‖θ‖spk is defined as\n‖θ‖spk = inf ∑ I∈Gk ‖uI‖2 : supp(uI) ⊆ I, ∑ I∈Gk uI = θ  . For the superposition of an s1 sparse vector and an s2 sparse vector, the best choice is to use s1-support\nnorm and s2-support norm. The new problem is\nmin θ1,θ2 ‖y −X(θ1 + θ2)‖22 s.t. ‖θ1‖sps1 ≤ ‖θ ∗ 1‖sps1 , ‖Qθ2‖ sp s2 ≤ ‖Qθ ∗ 2‖sps2 . (40)\nDenote σs1,s2(Q) as the set of all the largest singular values ofQ’s s1×s2 submatrices. Let σ = maxσs1,s2(Q). In this case, we have the following sufficient condition and high probability error bound:\nTheorem 9 If σ ≤ 1 4(1+\nθ1max θ1min )(1+ θ2max θ2min\n) where θmax = maxi∈supp(θ) |θi| and θmin = mini∈supp(θ) |θi|,\nthen we have for problem (40) with high probability\n‖θ1 − θ∗1‖2 + ‖θ2 − θ∗2‖2 = O\n( max {√ s1 log(p− s1)\nn ,\n√ s2 log(p− s2)\nn\n}) .\nIn the problem setting of theorem 9, both norms are not decomposable. Therefore we can not apply the framework of [32] for this problem."

These two kinds of norm ensure that the sparsity and the rank of the estimated matrices are small. If we have k > 1, the framework in [32] is not applicable, because k-support norm is not decomposable. When k = 1, the component norms simplify to ‖ · ‖1 for sparsity. Suppose we have a rank-r matrix L∗ and a sparse matrix S∗ with s nonzero entries, S∗, L∗ ∈ Rd1×d2 . Our observation Y comes from the following problem\nYi = 〈Xi, L∗ + S∗〉+ Ei, i = 1, . . . , n,\nwhere each Xi ∈ Rd1×d2 is a sub-Gaussian random design matrix. Ei is the noise matrix.

Let Ci, i = 1, 2, . . . , k be the corresponding error cones of {θi}, ci = λiRi(θi)/R(θ) and C0 be as defined in (56).

Suppose θ1, . . . , θk is a set of optimal solution under the λ defined above. From 55 we can write the decomposition as θ = ∑k i=1 c ′ iθ ′ i where c ′ i is a coefficient of convex combination, c ′ iθ ′ i = θi and λiRi(θ ′ i) = R(θ) under coefficient λi.\nIf θi 6= θ̂i for some i, then as ∑k i=1 λiRi(θ̂i) = ∑k i=1 ci = 1, we have\nλiRi(θi) ≤ 1⇒ Ri(ciθi) ≤ Ri(θ̂i).\nTherefore ciθi − θ̂i ∈ Ci by definition. We also have\nk∑ i=1 θ̂i + k∑ i=1 ( c′i ci − 1)θ̂i + k∑ i=1 c′i ci (ciθi − θi) = θ ⇒ c′i ci (ciθi − θi) = − k∑ i=1 ( c′i ci − 1)θ̂i\nwhich is contradict to our condition. Therefore θ̂i is a solution. Uniqueness is a direct conclusion of lemma 11.\nNote that in this proof we set λi = ciRi(θi) . This is also a general way to choose the parameter {λi}."

We present a simple estimator for such models, give a geometric condition under which the components can be accurately estimated, characterize sample complexity of the estimator, and give high probability non-asymptotic bounds on the componentwise estimation error. We use tools from empirical processes and generic chaining for the statistical analysis, and our results, which substantially generalize prior work on superposition models, are in terms of Gaussian widths of suitable sets.",
