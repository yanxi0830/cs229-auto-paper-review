Such models can also help detect possible differences between training and target distributions, which is useful in applications where concept drift may take place, as in transfer learning settings. This paper describes a general optimization framework that takes as input class membership estimates from existing classifiers learnt on previously encountered “source” data, as well as a similarity matrix from a cluster ensemble operating solely on the target data to be classified, and yields a consensus labeling of the target data. This framework admits a wide range of loss functions and classification/clustering methods. It exploits properties of Bregman divergences in conjunction with Legendre duality to yield a principled and scalable approach.

Moreover, the classifier should be able to adapt to changing statistics to some extent, given the afore-mentioned constraints. This paper addresses the problem of combining multiple classifiers and clusterers in a fairly general setting, that includes the scenario sketched above. An ensemble of classifiers is first learnt on an initial labeled training dataset which can conveniently be denoted by “source” dataset. At this point, the training data can be discarded. Subsequently, when new, unlabeled target data is encountered, a cluster ensemble is applied to it to yield a similarity matrix. In addition, the previously learnt classifier(s) can be used to obtain an estimate of the class probability distributions for this data. The heart of our technique is an optimization framework that combines both sources of information to yield a consensus labeling of the target data. General properties of a large class of loss functions described by Bregman divergences are exploited in this framework in conjunction with Legendre duality and a notion of variable splitting that is also used in alternating direction method of multipliers [Boyd et al. 2011]) to yield a principled and scalable solution. Note that the setting described above is different from transductive learning setups where both labeled and unlabeled data are available at the same time for model building [Silver and Bennett 2008], as well as online methods where decisions are made on one new example at a time, and after each such decision, the true label of the example is obtained and used to update the model parameters [Blum 1998]. Additional differences from existing approaches are described in the section on related works. For the moment we note that the underlying assumption is that similar new instances in the target set are more likely to share the same class label. Thus, the supplementary constraints provided by the cluster ensemble can be useful for improving the generalization capability of the resulting classifier system, specially when labeled data for training the base classifiers is scarce. Also, these supplementary constraints provided by unsupervised models can be useful for designing learning methods that help determine differences between training and target distributions, making the overall system more robust against concept drift. To highlight these additional capabilities that are useful for transfer learning, we provide a separate set of empirical studies where the target data is related to but significantly different from the initial training data. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. After addressing related work in Section 2, the proposed optimization framework and its associated algorithm — namedOAC3, fromOptimization Algorithm for Combining Classifiers and Clusterers — are described in Section 3. This particular algorithm has been briefly introduced in [Acharya et al. 2011]. A convergence analysis of OAC3 is reported in Section 4, while Section 5 analyses its convergence rate. An experimental study illustrating the potential of the proposed framework for a variety of applications is reported in Section 6. Finally, Section 7 concludes the paper. Notation.

      "heading" : "2. RELATED WORK",
      "text" : "This contribution leverages the theory of classifier and cluster ensemble to solve transfer and semi-supervised learning problems. Also, the underlying optimization framework inherits properties from alternating optimization type of algorithms. In this section, a brief introduction to each of these different research areas is provided. The combination of multiple single or base classifiers to generate a more capable ensemble classifier has been an active area of research for the past two decades [Kuncheva 2004; Oza and Tumer 2008]. Several papers provide both theoretical results [Tumer and Ghosh 1996] and empirical evidence showing the utility of such approaches for solving difficult classification problems. For instance, an analytical framework to mathematically quantify the improvements in classification results due to combining multiple models has been addressed in [Tumer and Ghosh 1996]. A survey of traditional ensemble techniques— including their applications to many difficult real-world problems such as remote sensing, person recognition, one vs. all recognition, and medicine — is presented in [Oza and Tumer 2008]. In summary, the extensive literature on the subject has shown that an ensemble created from diversified classifiers is typically more accurate than its individual components. Analogously, several research efforts have shown that cluster ensembles can improve the quality of results as compared to a single clustering solution — e.g., see [Wang et al. 2011; Ghosh and Acharya 2011] and references therein. Indeed, the potential motivations and benefits for using cluster ensembles are much broader than those for using classifier ensembles, for which improving the predictive accuracy is usually the primary goal. More specifically, cluster ensembles can be used to generate more robust and stable clustering results (compared to a single clustering approach), perform distributed computing under privacy or sharing constraints, or reuse existing knowledge [Strehl and Ghosh 2002]. We note however that:\n•Like single classifiers/clusterers, with very few exceptions [Polikar 2007], ensemble methods assume that the test or scoring data comes from the same underlying distribution as the training (and validation) data. Thus their performance degrades if the underlying input-output map changes over time. •There is relatively little work in incorporating both labeled and unlabeled data while building ensembles, in contrast to the substantial amount of recent interest in semi-supervised learning - including semi-supervised clustering, semi-supervised classification, clustering with constraints and transductive learning methods - using a single model [Chapelle et al. 2006; Zhu and Goldberg 2009; Cai et al. 2009; Forestier et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2009].\nTransfer learning emphasizes the transfer of knowledge across related domains, tasks and distributions that are similar but not the same. The domain from which the knowledge is transferred is called the “source” domain and the domain to which the knowledge is transferred is called the “target” domain. In transfer learning scenarios, the source and target distributions are somewhat different, as they represent (potentially) related but not identical tasks. The literature on transfer learning is fairly rich and varied (e.g., see [Pan and Yang 2010; Silver and Bennett 2008] and references therein), with much work done in the past 15 years [Thrun and Pratt 1997]. The tasks may be learnt simultaneously [Caruana 1997] or sequentially [Bollacker and Ghosh 2000]. The novelty of our approach lies in the utilization of the theory of both classifier and cluster ensembles to address the challenge when there is very few labeled examples from the target class. There are certain application domains such as the problem of land-cover classification of spatially separated regions, where the setting is appropri-\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\nate. Moreover, one does not always need to know a priori whether the target is similar to the source domain. Though there is a recent paper that uses a single clustering to modify the weights of base classifiers in an ensemble in order to provide some transfer learning capability [Gao et al. 2008], that algorithm is completely different from ours. Semi-supervised learning is a domain of machine learning where both labeled and unlabeled data are used to train a model – typically with lot of unlabeled data and only a small amount of labeled data (see [Bengio et al. 2006; Zhu and Goldberg 2009] and the references therein for more details). There are several graph-based semisupervised algorithms that use either the graph structure to spread labels from labeled to unlabeled samples, or optimize a loss function that includes a smoothness constraint derived from the graph [Zhang et al. 2006; Subramanya and Bilmes 2009; Subramanya and Bilmes 2011]. These approaches are typically non-parametric and transductive, needing both the labeled and unlabeled data to be simultaneously available for the entire training process. OAC3 can use parametric classifiers so that old labeled data can be discarded once the classifier parameters are obtained, leading to additional savings in speed and storage. A majority of previously proposed graph-based semi-supervised algorithms [Zhu and Ghahramani 2002; Joachims 2003; Belkin et al. 2005; Bengio et al. 2006] are based on minimizing squared-loss, while in [Subramanya and Bilmes 2011] (Measure Propagation – MP), [Corduneanu and Jaakkola 2003] and [Tsuda 2005], the authors used KL divergence. OAC3 uses certain Bregman divergences [Censor and Zenios 1997], among which the KL divergence and squared loss constitute just a subset (further details are provided later, in Section 4). This facilitates one to use well-defined functions of measures for a specific problem in order to improve performance. Additionally, the techniques of variable splitting [Boyd et al. 2011] and alternating minimization procedure [Bezdek and Hathaway 2002] are invoked to provide a more scalable solution. The work that comes closest to ours is by Gao et al. [Gao et al. 2009; Gao et al. 2011], which also combines the outputs of multiple supervised and unsupervised models. Here, it is assumed that each model partitions the target dataset X into groups, so that the instances in the same group share either the same predicted class label or the same cluster label. The data, models and outputs are summarized by a bipartite graph with connections only between group nodes and instance nodes. A group node and an instance node are connected if the instance is assigned to the group — no matter if it comes from a supervised or unsupervised model. The authors cast the final consensus labeling as an optimization problem on this bipartite graph. To solve the optimization problem, they introduce the Bipartite Graph-based Consensus Maximization (BGCM) Algorithm, which is essentially a block coordinate descent based algorithm that performs an iterative propagation of probability estimates among neighboring nodes. Note that their formulation requires hard classification and clustering inputs. In contrast, OAC3 essentially processes only two fused models, namely an ensemble of classifiers and an ensemble of clusterers, the constituents of both of which can be either hard or soft. Moreover,OAC3 avoids solving a difficult correspondence problem— i.e., aligning cluster labels to class labels — implicitly tackled by BGCM, and has a lower computational complexity as well."

      "text" : "The proposed framework that combines classifiers and clusterers to generate a more consolidated classification is depicted in Fig. 1. It is assumed that a set of classifiers (consisting of one or more classifiers) have been previously induced from a training set. Such classifiers could have been derived from labeled and unlabeled data, and they are part of the framework that will be used for classifying new data — i.e., instances from\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\nthe target set X = {xi}ni=1. The target set is a test set that has not been used to build the classifiers. The classifiers are employed to estimate initial class probabilities for every instance xi ∈ X . These probability distributions are stored as a set of vectors {πi}ni=1 and will be refined with the help of the clusterer(s). From this point of view, the clusterers provide supplementary constraints for classifying the instances of X , with the rationale that similar instances are more likely to share the same class label. Given k classes, denoted by C = {Cℓ}kℓ=1\n1, each of πi’s is of dimension k. In order to capture the similarities between the instances of X , OAC3 also takes as input a similarity matrix S, which can be computed from a cluster ensemble, in such a way that each matrix entry corresponds to the relative co-occurrence of two instances in the same cluster [Strehl and Ghosh 2002] — considering all the data partitions that form the cluster ensemble induced from X . Alternatively, S can be obtained from computing pair-wise similarities between instances, or from a cophenetic matrix resulting from running a hierarchical clustering algorithm. To summarize, OAC3 receives as inputs a set of vectors {πi}ni=1 and a similarity matrix S for the target set. After processing these inputs, OAC3 outputs a consolidated classification — represented by a set of vectors {yi}ni=1 ∈ S ⊆ R\nk, where yi ∝ P̂ (C | xi) (estimated posterior class probability assignment) — for every instance in X . This procedure is described in more detail in the sequel."

      "text" : "Consider that r1 (r1 ≥ 1) classifiers, indexed by q1, and r2 (r2 ≥ 1) clusterers, indexed by q2, are employed to obtain a consolidated classification. The following steps (I-III) outline the proposed approach. Steps I and II can be seen as preliminary steps to get the inputs for OAC3, while Step III is the optimization algorithm, which will be discussed in more detail.\n1C, with an overload of notation, is used here to denote a collection of classes and should not be confused with Ck ′ which is used to denote smoothness of a function.\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\nStep I - Obtain input from classifiers. The output of classifier q1 for instance xi is a k-dimensional class probability vector π\n(q1) i . This probability vector denotes the\nprobabilities for xi being assigned to the corresponding classes (which might be soft or hard assignments). From the set of such vectors {π (q1) i } r1 q1=1\n, an average vector can be computed for xi as:\nπi = 1\nr1\nr1 ∑\nq1=1\nπ (q1) i . (1)\nStep II - Obtain a similarity matrix. A similarity matrix can be obtained in a number of ways, such as computing pair-wise similarities between instances from the original space of features. For high-dimensional data, it is usually more appropriate to use a cluster ensemble for computing similarities between instances of the target set. In this case, after applying r2 clustering algorithms (clusterers) to X , a similarity matrix S is computed. Assuming that each clustering is a hard data partition (possibly obtained from a particular subspace), the similarity between two instances is simply the fraction of the r2 clustering solutions in which those two instances lie in the same cluster2. Note that such similarity matrices are byproducts of several cluster ensemble solutions, e.g., the CSPA algorithm in [Strehl and Ghosh 2002]. Step III - Obtain consolidated results fromOAC3. Having defined the inputs for OAC3, namely the set {πi}ni=1 and the similarity matrix, S, the problem of combining classifiers and clusterers can be posed as an optimization problem whose objective is to minimize J in (2) with respect to the set of probability vectors {yi} n i=1, where yi is the new and hopefully improved estimate of the aposteriori class probability distribution for a given instance in X .3\nJoriginal = ∑\ni∈X\nL(πi,yi) + α ∑\n(i,j)∈X\nsijL(yi,yj) (2)\nThe quantity L(·, ·) denotes a loss function. Informally, the first term in Eq. (2) captures dissimilarities between the class probabilities provided by the ensemble of classifiers and the output vectors {yi}ni=1. The second term encodes the cumulative weighted dissimilarity between all possible pairs (yi,yj). The weights to these pairs are assigned in proportion to the similarity values sij ∈ [0, 1] of matrix S. The coefficient α ∈ R+ controls the relative importance of classifier and cluster ensembles. Therefore, minimizing the objective function over {yi}ni=1 involves combining the evidence provided by the ensembles in order to build a more consolidated classification. The approach taken in this paper is quite general in the sense that any Bregman divergence that satisfies some specific properties (these properties will be introduced in more detail in section 4 where the discussion is more relevant) can be used as a loss function L(·, ·) in Eq. (2). So, before going into further details, the formal definition of Bregman divergence is provided.\nDefinition 3.1 ([Bregman 1967], [Banerjee et al. 2005]). Let φ : S → R,S = dom(φ) be a strictly convex function defined on a convex set S ⊆ Rk such that φ is differentiable on ri(S), which is assumed to be nonempty. The Bregman divergence dφ : S × ri(S) → [0,∞) is defined as dφ(p, q) = φ(p) − φ(q) − 〈p − q,∇φ(q)〉, where ∇φ(q) represents the gradient vector of φ evaluated at q.\n2A similarity matrix can also be defined for soft clusterings — e.g., see [Punera and Ghosh 2008]. 3From now on, for generality, we assume that we have two ensembles (a classifier ensemble and a cluster ensemble), but note that each of these ensembles may be formed by a single component.\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\nA specific Bregman Divergence (e.g. KL-divergence) between two vectors yi and yj can be identified by a corresponding strictly convex function φ (e.g. negative entropy for KL-divergence), and hence be written as dφ(yi,yj). Following from Definition 3.1, dφ(yi,yj) ≥ 0 ∀yi ∈ S,yj ∈ ri(S) and equality holds if and only if yi = yj . Using this notation, the objective function of OAC3, that is going to be minimized over {yi}ni=1, can be rewritten as:\nJ0 =\n\n\n∑\ni∈X\ndφ(πi,yi) + α ∑\n(i,j)∈X\nsijdφ(yi,yj)\n\n . (3)\nAll Bregman divergences have the remarkable property that the single best (in terms of minimizing the net loss) representative of a set of vectors, is simply the expectation of this set (!) provided the divergence is computed with this representative as the second argument of dφ(·, ·) — see Theorem 3.2 in the sequel for a more formal statement of this result. Unfortunately, this simple form of the optimal solution is not valid if the variable to be optimized occurs as the first argument. In that case, however, one can work in the (Legendre) dual space, where the optimal solution has a simple form — see [Banerjee et al. 2005] for details. Re-examining Eq. (3), we notice that the yi’s to be minimized over occur both as first and second arguments of a Bregman divergence. Hence optimization over {yi}ni=1 is not available in closed form. We circumvent this problem by creating two copies for each yi — the left copy, y (l) i , and the right copy, y (r) i . The left (right) copies are used whenever the variables are encountered in the first (second) argument of the Bregman divergences. In what follows, it will be clear that the right and left copies are updated iteratively, and an additional soft constraint is used to ensure that the two copies of a variable remain “close enough” during the updates. With this modification, we propose minimizing the following objective J : Sn × Sn → [0,∞):\nJ(y(l),y(r)) =\n\n\nn ∑\ni=1\ndφ(πi,y (r) i ) + α\nn ∑\ni,j=1\nsijdφ(y (l) i ,y (r) j ) + λ\nn ∑\ni=1\ndφ(y (l) i ,y (r) i )\n\n , (4)\nwhere, y(l) = (\ny (l) i\n)n\ni=1 ∈ Sn and y(r) =\n(\ny (r) i\n)n\ni=1 ∈ Sn.\nTo solve the optimization problem in an efficient way, we first keep {y (l) i } n i=1 and\n{y (r) i } n i=1 \\ {y (r) j } fixed, and minimize the objective w.r.t. y (r) j only. The problem can, therefore, be written as:\nmin y (r) j\n[\ndφ(π (r) j ,y (r) j ) + α\n∑\ni(l)∈X\nsi(l)j(r)dφ(y (l) i ,y (r) j ) + λ (r) j dφ(y (l) j ,y (r) j )\n]\n, (5)\nwhere λ (r) j is the corresponding penalty parameter that is used to keep y (r) j and y (l) j\nclose to each other. For every valid assignment of {y (l) i } n i=1, it can be shown that there is a unique minimizer y (r) j ∗ for the optimization problem in (5). For that purpose, a new Corollary is developed from the results of Theorem 3.2 [Banerjee et al. 2005] that is stated below.\nTHEOREM 3.2 ([BANERJEE ET AL. 2005]). Let Y be a random variable that takes values in Y = {yi}ni=1 ⊂ S ⊆ R k following a probability measure v such that Ev[Y ] ∈\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\nri(S). Given a Bregman divergence dφ : S × ri(S) → [0,∞), the optimization problem mins∈ri(S) Ev[dφ(Y, s)] has a unique minimizer given by s ∗ = µ = Ev[Y ].\nTo solve the problem formulated in Eq. (5), the following corollary is required:\nCOROLLARY 3.3. Let {Yi} n i=1 be a set of random variables, each of which takes\nvalues in Yi = {yij} ni j=1 ⊂ S ⊆ R k following a probability measure vi such that Evi [Yi] ∈ ri(S). Consider a Bregman divergence dφ : S × ri(S) → [0,∞) and an objective\nfunction of the form Jφ(s) =\nm ∑\ni=1\nαiEvi [dφ(Yi, s)] with αi ∈ R+ ∀i. This objective function\nhas a unique minimizer given by s∗ = µ =\n[\nm ∑\ni=1\nαiEvi [Yi]\n]\n/\n[\nm ∑\ni=1\nαi\n]\n.\nPROOF. Since Evi [Yi] ∈ ri(S) ∀i, their convex combination should also belong to ri(S), implying that µ ∈ ri(S). Now ∀s ∈ ri(S) we have:\nJφ(s)− Jφ(µ) = m ∑\ni=1\nαiEvi [dφ(Yi, s)]− m ∑\ni=1\nαiEvi [dφ(Yi,µ)]\n=\nm ∑\ni=1\nαi [φ(µ)− φ(s)] − m ∑\ni=1\nαi 〈\nn ∑\nj=1\nvijyij − s,∇φ(s) 〉\n+\nm ∑\ni=1\nαi 〈\nn ∑\nj=1\nvijyij − µ,∇φ(µ) 〉\n=\nm ∑\ni=1\nαi [φ(µ)− φ(s)− 〈µ− s,∇φ(s)〉] = dφ(µ, s) m ∑\ni=1\nαi ≥ 0\nwith equality only when s = µ following the strict convexity of φ. Hence, µ is the unique minimizer of the objective function Jφ.\nFrom the results of Corollary 3.3, the unique minimizer of the optimization problem in (5) is obtained as:\ny (r) j\n∗ =\nπ (r) j + γ (r) j\n∑\ni(l)∈X\nδi(l)j(r)y (l) i + λ (r) j y (l) j\n1 + γ (r) j + λ (r) j\n, (6)\nwhere γ (r) j = α ∑ i(l)∈X si(l)j(r) and δi(l)j(r) = si(l)j(r)/ [ ∑ i(l)∈X si(l)j(r) ] . The same optimization in (5) is repeated over all the y (r) j ’s. After the right copies are updated, the objective function is (sequentially) optimized with respect to all the y (l) i ’s. Like in the first step, {y (l) j } n j=1 \\ {y (l) i } and {y (r) j } n j=1 are kept fixed, and the difference between the left and right copies of yi is penalized, so that the optimization with respect to y (l) i can be rewritten as:\nmin y (l) i\n\nα ∑\nj(r)∈X\nsi(l)j(r)dφ(y (l) i ,y (r) j ) + λ (l) i dφ(y (l) i ,y (r) i )\n\n , (7)\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\nwhere λ (l) i is the corresponding penalty parameter. As mentioned earlier, one needs to work in the dual space now, using the convex function ψ (Legendre dual of φ) which is defined as:\nψ(yi) = 〈yi,∇ −1 φ (yi)〉 − φ(∇ −1 φ (yi)). (8)\nOne can show that ∀yi,yj ∈ int(dom(φ)), dφ(yi,yj) = dψ(∇φ(yj),∇φ(yi)) — see [Banerjee et al. 2005] for more details. Thus, the optimization problem in (7) can be rewritten in terms of the Bregman divergence associated with ψ as follows:\nmin ∇φ(y (l) i )\n[\nα ∑\nj(r)∈X\nsi(l)j(r)dψ(∇φ(y (r) j ),∇φ(y (l) i )) + λ (l) i dψ(∇φ(y (r) i ),∇φ(y (l) i ))\n]\n. (9)\nThe unique minimizer of the problem in (9) can be computed using Corollary 3.3. ∇φ is monotonic and invertible for φ being strictly convex and hence the inverse of the unique minimizer for the problem in (9) is also unique and equals to the unique minimizer for the problem in (7).

Optimization over the left and right arguments of all the instances constitutes one pass (iteration) of the algorithm, and these two steps are repeated till convergence (a detailed proof for convergence will be given in Section 4). Upon convergence, all the yi’s are normalized to unit L1 norm after averaging over the respective left and right copies, to yield the individual class probability distributions for every instance xi ∈ X . The main steps of OAC3 are summarized in Algorithm 1. The update procedure captured by Eq. (10) deserves some special attention.

These divergences along with their associated strictly convex functions φ(.) and domains are listed in Table I. An alternating optimization algorithm, in general, is not guaranteed to converge. Even if it converges it might not converge to the locally optimal solution. Some authors [Cheney and Goldstein 1959; Zangwill 1969; Wu 1982; Bezdek and Hathaway 2003] have shown that the convergence guarantee of alternating optimization can be analyzed using the topological properties of the objective and the space over which it is optimized. Others have used information geometry [Csiszár and Tusnády 1984; Wang and Schuurmans 2003b; Subramanya and Bilmes 2011] to analyze the convergence as well as a combination of both information geometry and topological properties\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\nof the objective [Gunawardana and Byrne 2005]. In this paper, the information geometry approach is utilized to show that the proposed optimization procedure converges to the global minima of the objective J in 4. At this point it is worth mentioning the connection of the optimization framework with other related approaches. The algorithms in [Zhu and Ghahramani 2002; Belkin et al. 2005] are based on minimizing squared-loss and are only suitable for binary classification problems. Multi-class extension of these algorithms is entirely based on one-vs-all strategy. MP [Subramanya and Bilmes 2011], on the other hand, is suitable for multi-class problems and additionally provides guard against degenerate solutions (those that assign equal confidence to all classes). OAC3 does not guard against degenerate solutions but can easily be extended to alleviate the same problem with the addition of a single tuning parameter. In the experiments reported, no significant difference in performance is observed with this extension and hence it is discarded to help tune one less model parameter. Label Propagation ([Zhu 2005] – LP) is another related algorithm and has been shown to converge to the optimal solution. In [Subramanya and Bilmes 2011], the authors also proved that their algorithm converges but the convergence rate (for KL divergence) is not proven and only empirical evidence is given for a linear rate. In this paper, apart from generalizing these algorithms with a larger class of Bregman divergences, we provide proofs for linear rate of convergence for generalized I divergence and KL divergence (the proof for squared loss follows directly from the analysis of [Subramanya and Bilmes 2011]). Spectral graph transduction Joachims 2003 is an approximate solution to the NP-hard norm-cut problem. However, this algorithm requires eigen-decomposition of a matrix of size n × n, where n is the number of instances, which is inefficient for very large data sets. Manifold regularization [Belkin et al. 2005] is a general framework in which a parametric loss function is defined over the labeled samples and is regularized by graph smoothness term defined over both the labeled and unlabeled samples. In the algorithms proposed therein, one either needs to invert an n × n matrix or use optimization techniques for general SVM in case there is no closed form solution. Both OAC3 and MP, on the other hand, have closed form solutions corresponding to each update and hence are perfectly suitable for large scale applications. Information regularization [Corduneanu and Jaakkola 2003], in essence, works on the same intuition as OAC3, but does not provide any proof of convergence and one of the steps of the optimization does not have a closed form solution – a concern for large data applications. [Tsuda 2005] extended the works of [Corduneanu and Jaakkola 2003] to hyper-graphs and used closed form solutions in both steps of the alternating minimization procedure which, surprisingly, can be seen as a special case of MP.\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\nWe now give a sketch of the proof of convergence of OAC3. The so-called 5-points property (5-pp) of the objective function J is essential to analyze the convergence. If J satisfies the 3-points property (3-pp) and the 4-points property (4-pp), then it satisfies the 5-pp. Therefore, to prove 5-pp of J , we will try to prove that it satisfies both 3-pp and 4-pp. However, this proof is not easy for any arbitrary Bregman divergence. In [Subramanya and Bilmes 2011], the authors followed the procedure of [Csiszár and Tusnády 1984] to prove the convergence of a slightly different objective that involves KL-divergence as a loss function. The proof there is specific to KLdivergence and does not generalize to Bregman divergences with properties (a) to (f). Therefore, we take a more subtle route in proving the 3-pp and 4-pp of J . We show that the objective function J , which is a sum of Bregman divergences of different pairs of variables, can itself be thought of as a Bregman divergence in some joint space. This Bregman divergence also satisfies the properties (a) to (f), which then allows one to use the convergence tools developed by [Wang and Schuurmans 2003a]. The formal proof for convergence is placed in appendix A to facilitate an easy perusal of the paper."

There are six datasets (News1 — News6) for 20 Newsgroups and four datasets (Cora1 — Cora4) for Cora. In each task, there is a target set on which the class labels should be predicted. In [Gao et al. 2009], two supervised models and two unsupervised models were used to obtain (on the target sets) class and cluster labels, respectively. These\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\nsame class and cluster labels are used as inputs to OAC3. Then, we vary the OAC3 parameters and observe their respective accuracies. In order to analyze the influence of the parameters α and λ (recall that we set λ (r) i = λ (l) i = λ for all i), we consider that the algorithm converges when the relative difference of the objective function in two consecutive iterations is less than ε = 10−10. By adopting this criterion, OAC3 usually converges after nine iterations (on average). The algorithm has shown to be robust with respect to λ. As far as α is concerned, for most of the datasets — News1, News3, News4, News6, Cora1, Cora3, Cora4, and DBLP— the classification accuracies achieved fromOAC3 are better than those found by the classifier ensemble — no matter the value chosen for α. Figure 5 illustrates a typical accuracy surface for different values of λ and α. It is worth mentioning that the accuracy surface tends to keep steady for α > 1 (i.e., the accuracies do not change significantly). In particular, OAC3 was run for α = {10; 20; ...; 100; 200; ...; 1000; 100000}, for which the obtained results are the same as those achieved for α = 1 for any value of λ. This same observation holds for all the assessed datasets. The interpretation for such results is that there is a threshold value for α that makes the second term of the objective function in (2) dominating — i.e., the information provided by the cluster ensemble is much more important than the information provided by the classifier ensemble. We observed that for five datasets (News3, News6, Cora1, Cora3, and DBLP) any value of α > 0.30 provides the best classification accuracy. Thus, the algorithm can be robust with respect to the choice of its parameters for some datasets. For the datasets News2 and News5, some α values yield to accuracy deterioration, thereby suggesting that, depending on the value chosen for α, the information provided by the cluster ensemble may hurt — e.g., see Figure 7. Finally, for Cora2, accuracy improvements were not observed, i.e., the accuracies provided by the classifier ensemble were always the best ones. This result suggests that the assumption that classes can be represented by means of clusters does not hold. As expected, our experiments also show that the number of iterations may influence the performance of the algorithm. In particular, depending on the values chosen for α, a high number of iterations may prejudice the obtained accuracies. Considering the best values obtained for α in our sensitivity analysis, we observed that, for all datasets, the best accuracies were achieved for less than 10 iterations. By taking into account the results obtained in our sensitivity analyses, and recalling that fine tuning of the OAC3 parameters can be done by means of cross-validation, in the next section we compare the performance of OAC3 with the recently proposed BGCM [Gao et al. 2009; Gao et al. 2011]."

Such choices will hopefully show that one can get good results by using OAC3 without being (necessarily) picky about its parameter values — thus these results are also complementary to the ones provided in Section 6.2. The classification accuracies achieved by the studied methods are summarized in Table II, where one can see that OAC3 shows the best accuracies for all datasets. In order to provide some reassurance about the validity and non-randomness of the obtained results, the outcomes of statistical tests, following the study in [Demsar 2006],\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\nare also reported. In brief, multiple algorithms are compared on multiple datasets by using the Friedman test, with a corresponding Nemenyi post-hoc test. The Friedman test is a non-parametric statistic test equivalent to the repeated-measures ANOVA. If the null hypothesis, which states that the algorithms under study have similar performances, is rejected, then the Nemenyi post-hoc test is used for pairwise comparisons between algorithms. The adopted statistical procedure indicates that the null hypothesis of equal accuracies — considering the results obtained by the ensembles — can be rejected at 10% significance level. In pairwise comparisons, significant statistical differences are only observed between OAC3 and the other ensembles, i.e., there is no evidence that the accuracies of MCLA, HBGF, and BGCM are statistically different from one another."

      "text" : "We also compare OAC3 to a popular semi-supervised algorithm known as S3VM [Sindhwani and Keerthi 2006]. This algorithm is essentially a Transductive Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) which can be viewed as a large scale implementation of the algorithm introduced in [Joachims 1999b]. For dealing with unlabeled data, it appends an additional term in the SVM objective function whose role is to drive the classification hyperplane towards low data density regions [Sindhwani and Keerthi 2006]. The default parameter values have been used for S3VM. Six datasets are used in our experiments:Half-Moon (see Section 6.1),Circles (which is a synthetic dataset that has two-dimensional instances that form two concentric circles — one for each class), and four datasets from the Library for Support Vector Machines5 — Pima Indians Diabetes, Heart, German Numer, and Wine. In order to simulate real-world classification problems where there is a very limited amount of labeled instances, small percentages (e.g., 2%) of the instances are randomly selected for training, whereas the remaining instances are used for testing (target set). The amount of instances for training is chosen so that the pooled covariance matrix of the training set is positive definite. This restriction comes from the use of an LDA classifier in the ensemble, and it imposes a lower bound on the number of training instances (7% for Heart and 10% for German Numer). We perform 10 trials for every proportion of instances in the training/target sets. The number of features are 2, 2, 8, 13, 24, 24 for Half-moon, Circles, Pima, Heart, German Numer and Wine respectively. Considering OAC3, the components of the classifier ensemble are chosen as previously described in Section 6.1. Cluster ensembles are generated by means of multiple runs of k-means (10 data partitions for the two-dimensional datasets and 50 data partitions for Pima, Heart, German Numer, and Wine). The parameters of OAC3 (α and λ) are optimized for better performance in each dataset using 5-fold cross-validation. The optimal values of (α, λ) for Half-moon, Cir-\n5http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\ncles, Pima, Heart, German Numer, and Wine are (0.05,0.1), (0.01,0.1), (0.002,0.1), (0.01,0.2), (0.01,0.1) and (0.01,0.1) respectively. Table III shows that the accuracies obtained by OAC3 are good and consistently better than those achieved by both the classifier ensemble and its best individual component. In addition, OAC3 shows better accuracies than both S3VM and BGCM — from the adopted statistical procedure [Demsar 2006], OAC3 exhibits significantly better accuracies at a significance level of 10%."

      "heading" : "6.5. Transfer Learning",
      "text" : "Transfer learning emphasizes the transfer of knowledge across domains, tasks, and distributions that are similar but not the same [Silver and Bennett 2008]. We focus on learning scenarios where training and test distributions are different, as they represent (potentially) related but not identical tasks. It is assumed that the training and test domains involve the same class labels. The real-world datasets employed in our experiments are: a) Text Documents — [Pan and Yang 2010]: From the well-known text collections 20 newsgroup and Reuters-21758, nine cross-domain learning tasks are generated. The two-level hierarchy in both of these datasets is exploited to frame a learning task involving a top category classification problem with training and test data drawn from different sub categories — e.g., to distinguish documents from two top newsgroup categories (rec and talk), the training set is built from “rec.autos”, “rec.motorcycles”, “talk.politics”, and “talk.politics.misc”, and the test set is formed from the sub-categories “rec.sport.baseball”, “rec.sport.hockey”, “talk.politics.mideast”, and “talk.religions.misc”. The Email spam data set, released by ECML/PKDD 2006 discovery challenge, contains a training set of publicly available messages and three sets of email messages from individual users as test sets. The 4000 labeled examples in the training set and the 2500 test examples for each of the three different users differ in the word distribution. A spam filter learned from public sources are used to test transfer capability on each of the users.\nb) Botswana — [Rajan et al. 2006]: This is an application of transfer learning to the pixel-level classification of remotely sensed images, which provides a real-life scenario where such learning will be useful — in contrast to the contrived setting of text classification, which is chosen as it has been used previously in [Dai et al. 2007]. It is\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\nrelatively easy to acquire an image, but expensive to label each pixel manually, where images typically have about a million pixels and represent inaccessible terrain. Thus typically only part of an image gets labeled. Moreover, when the satellite again flies over the same area, the new image can be quite different due to change of season, thus a classifier induced on the previous image becomes significantly degraded for the new task. These hyperespectral data sets used are from a 1476×256 pixel study area located in the Okavango Delta, Botswana. It has nine different land-cover types consisting of seasonal swamps, occasional swamps, and drier woodlands located in the distal portion of the delta. Data from this region for different months (May, June and July) were obtained by the Hyperion sensor of the NASA EO-1 satellite for the calibration/validation portion of the mission in 2001. Data collected for each month was further segregated into two different areas. While the May scene (Fig. 8) is characterized by the onset of the annual flooding cycle and some newly burned areas, the progression of the flood and the corresponding vegetation responses are seen in the June (Fig. 9) and July (Fig. 10) scenes. The acquired raw data was further processed to produce 145 features. From each area of Botswana, different transfer learning tasks are generated: the classifiers are trained on either May, June or {May ∪ June} data and tested on either June or July data. For text data, we use logistic regression (LR), SVM, and Winnow (WIN) [Gao et al. 2008] as baseline classifiers. The CLUTO package (http://www.cs.umn.edu/~karypis/cluto) is used for clustering the target data into two clusters. We also compare OAC3 with two transfer learning algorithms from the literature — Transductive Support Vector Machines (TSVM) [Joachims 1999a] and the Locally Weighted Ensemble (LWE) [Gao et al. 2008]. We use Bayesian Logistic Regression http://www.bayesianregression.org/ for running the logistic regression classifier, LIBSVM (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) for SVM, SNoW Learning Architecture http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/software_view/1 for Winnow, and SVMlight http://svmlight.joachims.org/ for transductive SVM. The posterior class probabilities from SVM are also obtained using the LIBSVM package with linear kernel. For SNoW, “-S 3 -r 5” is used and the remaining parameters of all the packages are set to their default values. The values of (α, λ), obtained by 10-fold cross-validation in source domain, are set as (0.008, 0.1) and (0.11, 0.1) for the transfer learning tasks corresponding to 20 Newsgroup and Spam datasets, respectively. For Reuters-21578, the best values of the parameters (α, λ) are found as (0.009, 0.1), (0.0001, 0.1), and (0.08, 0.1) for O vs Pe, O vs Pl, and Pe vs Pl, respectively (see Table\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\nV). For the hyperspectral data, we use two baseline classifiers: the well-known Naı̈ve Bayes Wrapper (NBW) and the Maximum Likelihood (ML) classifier, which performs well when used with a best bases feature extractor [Kumar et al. 2001]. The target set instances are clustered by k-means, varying k from 50 to 70. PCA is also used for reducing the number of features employed by ML. In particular, for the hyperspectral data, cross-validation in the source domain does not result in very good performance. Therefore, we take 5% labeled examples from each of the nine classes of the target data and tune the values of α and λ based on the performance on these examples. The classifiers NBW or ML, however, are not retrained with these examples from the target domain and the accuracies reported in Table V are on the unlabeled examples only from the target domain.\nThe results for text data are reported in Table IV. The different learning tasks corresponding to different pairs of categories are listed as “Mode”. OAC3 improves the performance of the classifier ensemble (formed by combining WIN, LR and SVM via output averaging) for all learning tasks, except forO vs Pl, where apparently the training and test distributions are similar. Also, the OAC3 accuracies are better than those achieved by both TSVM and LWE in most of the datasets. Except for WIN, the performances of the base classifiers and clustereres (and hence of OAC3) are quite invariant, thereby resulting in very low standard deviations. The OAC3 accuracies are significantly better than those obtained by both TSVM and LWE (at 10% significance level).\nTable V reports the results for the hyperspectral data. The parameter values (α, λ) for best performance of OAC3 are also presented alongside. Note that OAC3 provides consistent accuracy improvements for both NBW and ML6. In pairwise comparisons,\n6Standard deviations of the accuracies from NBW and ML are close to 0 and hence not shown.\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\nthe accuracies provided by OAC3 are significantly better than those obtained by both NBW and ML (at 10% significance level).

      "heading" : "7. CONCLUDING REMARKS",
      "text" : "We presented a general framework for combining classifiers and clusterers to address semi-supervised and transfer learning problems. The optimization algorithm assumes closed form updates, facilitates parallelization of the same and, therefore, is extremely convenient in handling large scale data – specially with a linear rate of convergence. The proofs for the convergence are quite novel and generalize across a wide variety of Bregman divergences, facilitating one to use proper divergence measure based on the application domain and subsuming many other existing graph based semi-supervised learning algorithms as special cases. The proposed framework has been empirically shown to outperform a variety of algorithms [Gao et al. 2011; Sindhwani and Keerthi 2006; Gao et al. 2008] in both semi-supervised and transfer learning problems. There are few aspects that can be further explored. For example, the impact of the number of classifiers and clusterers in OAC3 deserves further investigation. In addition, a more extensive study across a wide variety of problem domains will reveal the capabilities as well as potential limitations of the framework.\nAPPENDIX"

      "text" : "LEMMA A.1. The objective function J used in Eq. (4) is separately and jointly strictly convex over Sn × Sn. Also, J is jointly lower-semi-continuous w.r.t y(l) and y(r).\nPROOF.\n(a) From the property (a) in Section 4, one can see that J is strictly convex w.r.t y(l) and y(r) separately. From the same property the first term f1(y(r)) = n ∑\ni=1\ndφ(πi,y (r) i ) in J is strictly convex w.r.t. y (r). The 2nd and 3rd terms in the ob-\njective function can collectively be represented by f2(y(l),y(r)). This function is jointly convex by property (b) but is not necessarily jointly strictly convex. Suppose (y1,(l),y1,(r)), (y2,(l),y2,(r)) ∈ Sn × Sn and 0 < w < 1. Then, we have:\nf1(wy 1,(r) + (1− w)y2,(r)) < wf1(y 1,(r)) + (1− w)f1(y 2,(r))\nf2(w(y 1,(l),y1,(r)) + (1− w)(y2,(l),y2,(r))) ≤ wf2(y 1,(l),y1,(r)) + (1− w)f2(y 2,(l),y2,(r)).\nNow, it follows that:\nJ(w(y1,(l),y1,(r)) + (1− w)(y2,(l),y2,(r))) (21)\n= f1(wy 1,(r) + (1 − w)y2,(r)) + f2(w(y 1,(l),y1,(r)) + (1 − w)(y2,(l),y2,(r)))\n< wf1(y 1,(r)) + (1− w)f1(y 2,(r)) + wf2(y 1,(l),y1,(r)) + (1 − w)f2(y 2,(l),y2,(r))\n= wJ(y1,(l),y1,(r)) + (1 − w)J(y2,(l),y2,(r)),\nwhich implies that J is jointly strictly convex.\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\n(b) To prove that J(y(l),y(r)) is lower-semi-continuous in y(l) and y(r) jointly, we observe that\nlim inf (y(l),y(r))→(y0,(l),y0,(r))\nJ(y0,(l),y0,(r)) (22)\n=\n\n\nn ∑\ni=1 lim inf y (r) i →y 0,(r) i\ndφ(πi,y (r) i ) + α\nn ∑\ni,j=1\nsij lim inf (y\n(l) i ,y (r) j )→(y 0,(l) i ,y 0,(r) j )\ndφ(y (l) i ,y (r) j )\n+ λ\nn ∑\ni=1\nlim inf (y\n(l) i ,y (r) i )→(y 0,(l) i ,y 0,(r) i )\ndφ(y (l) i ,y (r) i )\n]\n≥\n\n\nn ∑\ni=1\ndφ(πi,y 0,(r) i ) + α\nn ∑\ni,j=1\nsijdφ(y 0,(l) i ,y 0,(r) j ) + λ\nn ∑\ni=1\ndφ(y 0,(l) i ,y 0,(r) i )\n\n\n= J(y0,(l),y0,(r)).\nThe inequality in the 3rd step follows from the lower semi continuity of dφ(., .) in Section 4 (Property (d)).\nThe following theorem helps prove that the objective function J can be seen as part of a Bregman divergence.\nTHEOREM A.2 ([BANERJEE ET AL. 2005]). A divergence d : S × ri(S) → [0,∞) is a Bregman divergence if and only if ∃a ∈ ri(S) such that the function φa(p) = d(p, a) satisfies the following conditions:\n(a) φa is strictly convex on S. (b) φa is differentiable on ri(S). (c) d(p,q) = dφa(p,q), ∀p ∈ S,q ∈ ri(S) where dφa is the Bregman divergence associ-\nated with φa.\nWe now introduce a function J̃ : Sn × Sn → [0,∞) that is defined as follows:\nJ̃(y(r)′,y(r)) =\n\n\nn ∑\ni=1\ndφ(y (r)′ i ,y (r) i ) + α\nn ∑\ni,j=1\nsijdφ(y (r)′ i ,y (r) j ) + λ\nn ∑\ni=1\ndφ(y (r)′ i ,y (r) i )\n\n . (23)\nNote that J̃ is different from J defined in Eq. (4). The left arguments in the divergences of the first term of J are πi’s which are assumed to be fixed.\nLEMMA A.3. J̃ satisfies properties (a) and (b) in Section 4.\nPROOF. The proof is direct from the definition of J̃ .\nFurther assume:\np = ( (πi) n i=1, (y (l) i ) n i=1, ((y (l) i ) n−1 j=1 ) n i=1 ) ,\nq = ( (y (r) i ) n i=1, (y (r) i ) n i=1, ((y (r) j ) n−1 j=1,j 6=i) n i=1 ) ,\nq′ = ( (y (r)′ i ) n i=1, (y (r)′ i ) n i=1, ((y (r)′ j ) n−1 j=1,j 6=i) n i=1 ) ,\nwith y (l) i ,y (r) i ,y (r)′ i ∈ S ∀i. The vectors p, q and q ′ are each of dimension kn(n+ 1) and formed by concatenating vectors from the set S. (y)ni=1 implies that a new vector is\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\ncreated by repeating y for n times. For ease of understanding, we also define A = {p : y(l) ∈ Sn}, B = {q : y(r) ∈ Sn}. We will assume that whenever a point y(l) ∈ Sn is mapped to a point p ∈ A, p = A(y(l)). Similarly, q = B(y(r)) whenever y(r) ∈ Sn is mapped to q ∈ B. Indeed, both A and B are bijective mappings.\nExample A.4. To explain the mappings A and B more clearly, we consider the fol-\nlowing example. Let n = 3 and y(l),y(r),y(r)′ ∈ S3. Here, y(l) = ( y (l) 1 ,y (l) 2 ,y (l) 3 ) – a concatenation of three vectors y (l) 1 , y (l) 2 and y (l) 3 (corrpesponding to three instances) each of which belongs to S ⊆ Rk. Similarly, y(r) = (\ny (r) 1 ,y (r) 2 ,y (r) 3 ) and y(r)′ = ( y (r)′ 1 ,y (r)′ 2 ,y (r)′ 3 ) .\nThe vector p, formed by the transformation A on y(l), takes the following form:\np = ( π1,π2,π3,y (l) 1 ,y (l) 2 ,y (l) 3 ,y (l) 1 ,y (l) 1 ,y (l) 2 ,y (l) 2 ,y (l) 3 ,y (l) 3 )\nNote that this vector has 12 elements each of dimension k and hence the dimension of the whole vector is of the form kn(n+ 1). Similarly,\nq = B(y(r)) = ( y (r) 1 ,y (r) 2 ,y (r) 3 ,y (r) 1 ,y (r) 2 ,y (r) 3 ,y (r) 2 ,y (r) 3 ,y (r) 1 ,y (r) 3 ,y (r) 1 ,y (r) 2 ) ,\nand,\nq′ = B(y(r)′) = ( y (r)′ 1 ,y (r)′ 2 ,y (r)′ 3 ,y (r)′ 1 ,y (r)′ 2 ,y (r)′ 3 ,y (r)′ 2 ,y (r)′ 3 ,y (r)′ 1 ,y (r)′ 3 ,y (r)′ 1 ,y (r)′ 2 ) .\nNow, in light of Theorem A.2, the following corollary is introduced.\nCOROLLARY A.5. If a mapping d : (A ∪ B)× B → [0,∞) is defined as:\nd(r,q) =\n{\nd(p,q) = J(y(l),y(r)) if r = p ∈ A d(q′,q) = J̃(y(r)′,y(r)) if r = q′ ∈ B\n(24)\nthen d is a Bregman divergence.\nPROOF. We show that conditions (a), (b) and (c) of Theorem A.2 are satisfied for d.\n(a) Since dφ is a Bregman divergence, ∃a ∈ ri(S) such that conditions (a), (b) and (c) are satisfied in corollary A.2 pertaining to this divergence. Note that p ∈ A and q′,q ∈ B. Assume a′ = B((a)ni=1) ∈ B ⊂ (A ∪ B). We now define\nψa′(r) =\n{\nψa′(p) = d(p, a ′) = J(y(l),y(r)) if r = p ∈ A ψa′(q ′) = d(q′, a′) = J̃(y(r)′,y(r)) if r = q′ ∈ B\n(25)\nSince each of dφ(., a) is strictly convex over S n in Eq. (4) and Eq. (23), ψa′ is also strictly convex on A ∪ B. Note the emphasis on B ⊂ (A ∪ B) in the definition of a′\nwhich just ensures that all conditions in Theorem A.2 are satisfied. (b) Again, this is a direct consequence from Eq. (4) and Eq. (23). Since, by the strict\nconvexity of φ(.), each of dφ(., a) is differentiable over ri(Sn), ψa′ is also differentiable over ri(A∪B). Note that we have a bijective mapping of elements from Sn to A ∪ B, and hence ri(Sn) gets mapped to ri(A ∪ B).\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\n(c) We have ∀ (p,q) ∈ A× B,\ndψ a ′ (p,q) =\n[\nψa′(p)− ψa′(q) − 〈∇ψ a ′ (q), (p − q)〉\n]\n= n ∑\ni=1\n[\ndφ(πi, a)− dφ(y (r) i , a)\n] + α n ∑\ni,j=1\nsij\n[\ndφ(y (l) i , a)− dφ(y (r) j , a)\n]\n+ λ\nn ∑\ni=1\n[\ndφ(y (l) i , a)− dφ(y (r) i , a)\n]\n− 〈∇ψ a ′ (q), (p − q)〉\n=\nn ∑\ni=1\n\ndφ(πi,y (r) i ) + α\nn ∑\ni,j=1\nsijdφ(y (l) i ,y (r) j ) + λ\nn ∑\ni=1\ndφ(y (l) i ,y (r) i )\n\n\n= d(p,q).\nThe second step follows from the definition of ψ(.) in Eq. (25) and the last step follows from the definition of d(p,q) in Eq. (24). The equality dψ a ′ (q′,q) = d(q′,q) ∀(q′,q) ∈ B × B can similarly be proved. Therefore, combining the two results, we have dψ\na ′ (r,q) = d(r,q) ∀(r,q) ∈ (A ∪ B) × B. With a slight abuse of notation,\nhenceforth, we will denote the mapping ψa′ by ψ with an implicit assumption of the existence of an a′ ∈ B as described before.\nWe will see next that we require some definition of ψa′(q) for q ∈ B and this explains the definition of d(r,q) in Eq. (24) for the case when r = q′ ∈ B.\nLEMMA A.6. dψ satisfies properties (a) and (b) in Section 4.\nPROOF.\n(a) One can see that dψ is strictly convex separately w.r.t its arguments from its def-\ninition in Eq. (24). Since each of J and J̃ is strictly convex separately w.r.t the arguments and A and B are bijective mappings, dψ is strictly convex separately w.r.t. r and q. (b) The joint convexity of dψ also follows directly from its definition and the joint con-\nvexity of J and J̃ .\nAt this point, we reiterate that defining dψ as in Eq. (24) helps in proving some interesting properties of J in a very elegant way. We, in fact, treat dψ as a surrogate for J , establish two specific properties of dψ and then show that these properties, by the definition of dψ, translates to the same properties of J . The first of them is the 3-Points Property (3-pp) which is introduced in the following definition.\nDefinition A.7 (3-pp). Let P and Q be closed convex sets of finite measures. A function d : P × Q → R ∪ {−∞,+∞} is said to satisfy the 3-points property (3-pp) if for a given q ∈ Q for which d(p, q) < ∞ ∀p ∈ P , δ(p, p∗) ≤ d(p, q) − d(p∗, q) where p∗ = argmin\np∈P\nd(p, q) and δ : P × P → R+ with δ(p, p′) = 0 iff p = p′.\nLEMMA A.8. J satisfies 3-pp.\nPROOF. The proof is based on the works of [Wang and Schuurmans 2003a]. First, we will show that 3-pp is valid for dψ(., .) over A × B. As mentioned earlier, this is where the introduction of dψ becomes useful and elegant. Assume that p = A(y(l)) ∈ A corresponding to some y(l) ∈ Sn, q = B(y(r)) ∈ B corresponding to some y(r) ∈ Sn and\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\np∗ = argmin p∈A dψ(p,q) = argmin y(l)∈Sn\nJ(y(l),y(r)) = A ( y(l) ∗ ) (the fact that the minimizers are\njust transformations of each other under A or A−1 follows directly from the separately strict convexity of J and dψ). Therefore,\ndψ(p,q) − dψ(p ∗,q)\n= ψ(p)− ψ(p∗)− 〈∇ψ(q),p − p ∗〉 = δψ(p,p ∗) + 〈∇ψ(p ∗)−∇ψ(q),p − p ∗〉\nwhere, δψ : A×A → R is defined as follows:\nδψ(p,p ∗) = ψ(p)− ψ(p∗)− 〈∇ψ(p ∗),p− p∗〉. (26)\nSince p∗ = argmin p∈A dψ(p,q), 〈∇pdψ(p∗,q), (p − p∗)〉 ≥ 0, then 〈∇ψ(p∗) − ∇ψ(q), (p − p∗)〉 ≥ 0 which implies dψ(p,q)−dψ(p ∗,q) ≥ δ(p,p∗). Now, by some simple algebra, we\ncan show δψ(p,p∗) = n ∑\ni=1\n\nλ+ α\nn ∑\nj=1;j 6=i\n\n dφ(y (l) i ,y (l) i ∗ ). By assumption, dφ ( y (l) i ,y (l) i ∗) ≥\n0 and hence δψ(p,p∗) ≥ 0 with 0 achieved iff y(l) = y(l) ∗ . If we define δψ(p,p∗) = δJ(A −1(p),A−1(p∗)) then δJ(y(l),y(l) ∗ ) ≥ 0 with 0 achieved iff y(l) = y(l) ∗ . Note that\nδJ(y 1,(l),y2,(l) =\nn ∑\ni=1\n\nλ+ α\nn ∑\nj=1;j 6=i\n\n dφ(y 1,(l) i ,y 2,(l) i ). (27)\nTherefore, following 3-pp of dψ over A× B, we can conclude that\nJ(y(l),y(r))− J(y(l) ∗ ,y(r)) ≥ δJ(y (l),y(l) ∗ ), (28)\nwhich is the 3-pp for J .\nLEMMA A.9. δJ satisfies properties (c) and (f) mentioned in Section 4.\nPROOF.\n(a) Since level sets of each of the terms in Eq. (27) are bounded following the property (c) in Section 4, we conclude that the level set {y(r) : δJ(y(l),y(r)) ≤ ℓ} for a given y(l) ∈ Sn is also bounded. (b) We refer to Eq. (27). As, y2,(l) → y1,(l), each of the dφ(., .)’s goes to 0 by the property (f) in Section 4. Therefore, δJ → 0 as y2,(l) → y1,(l).\nNext, 4-Points Property (4-pp) is introduced.\nDefinition A.10 (4-pp). Let P and Q be closed convex sets of finite measures. A function d : P × Q → R ∪ {−∞,+∞} is said to satisfy 4-pp if for a given p ∈ P , d(p, q∗) ≤ δ(p, p∗)+d(p, q)where q∗ = argmin\nq∈Q\nd(p∗, q) and δ : P×P → R+ with δ(p, p′) = 0\niff p = p′.\nLEMMA A.11. J satisfies 4-pp.\nPROOF. Assume u = A(y1,(l)) ∈ A, p = A(y2,(l)) ∈ A, q = B(y3,(r)) ∈ B,\nand q∗ = argmin q∈B\ndψ(p,q) = B(y 4,(r)∗). Here, y1,(l),y2,(l),y3,(r) ∈ Sn and y4,(r) ∗ =\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\nargmin y(r)∈Sn\nJ(y2,(l),y(r)). From the joint convexity of dψ (established in Lemma A.6) w.r.t\nboth of its arguments we have:\ndψ(u,v) ≥ dψ(p,q ∗) + 〈∇pdψ(p,q ∗),u− p〉+ 〈∇qdψ(p,q ∗),v − q∗〉. (29)\nSince q∗ minimizes dψ(p,q) over q ∈ B, we have 〈∇qdψ(p,q∗),v − q∗〉 ≥ 0 which, in turn, implies:\ndψ(u,p)− dψ(p,q ∗)− 〈∇pdψ(p,q ∗),u− p〉 ≥ 0.\nNow we have:\nδψ(u,p)− dψ(u,q ∗)\n= ψ(q∗)− ψ(p)− 〈∇ψ(q ∗),u− q∗〉 − 〈∇ψ(p),u− p〉 = −dψ(p,q ∗)− 〈∇ψ(p)−∇ψ(q ∗),u− p〉 = −dψ(p,q ∗)− 〈∇pdψ(p,q ∗),u− p〉\nCombining the above two equations, we have,\nδψ(u,p) + dψ(u,v) ≥ dψ(u,q ∗) (30)\nEq. (30) gets translated for J as follows (using definitions of δψ and dψ):\nδJ (y 1,(l),y2,(l)) + J(y1,(l),y3,(r)) ≥ J(y1,(l),y4,(r) ∗ ) (31)\nHence, J satisfies 4-pp.\nWe now introduce the main theorem that establishes the convergence guarantee of OAC3.\nTHEOREM A.12. If y(l,t) = argmin y(l)∈Sn J(y(l),y(r,t−1)), y(r,t) = argmin y(r)∈Sn J(y(l,t),y(r)), then\nlim t→∞ J(y(l,t),y(r,t)) = inf y(l),y(r)∈Sn J(y(l),y(r)).\nPROOF. The proof here follows the same line of argument as given in [Wang and Schuurmans 2003a] and [Eggermont and LaRiccia 1998]. Since, y(r,t+1) = argmin y(r)∈Sn J(y(l,t),y(r)), we have, J(y(l,t),y(r,t)) − J(y(l,t),y(r,t+1)) ≥ 0. By the 3-pp, J(y(l,t),y(r,t+1))− J(y(l,t+1),y(r,t+1)) ≥ δJ(y(l,t),y(l,t+1)). Then,\nJ(y(l,t),y(r,t))− J(y(l,t+1),y(r,t+1))\n= J(y(l,t),y(r,t))− J(y(l,t),y(r,t+1)) + J(y(l,t),y(r,t+1))− J(y(l,t+1),y(r,t+1))\n≥ δJ(y (l,t),y(l,t+1)) ≥ 0.\nThis implies that the sequence J(y(l,t),y(r,t)) is non-increasing and non-negative. Let, (y(l,∞),y(r,∞)) = argmin\ny(l),y(r)∈Sn J(y(l),y(r)). From 4-pp and 3-pp, we can derive the follow-\ning two inequalities:\nJ(y(l,∞),y(r,t+1)) ≤ δJ(y (l,∞),y(l,t)) + J(y(l,∞),y(r,∞)) (32)\nδJ(y (l,∞),y(l,t+1)) ≤ J(y(l,∞),y(r,t+1))− J(y(l,t+1),y(r,t+1)). (33)\nCombining the above two inequalities, we get:\nδJ (y (l,∞),y(l,t))− δJ (y (l,∞),y(l,t+1)) ≥ J(y(l,t+1),y(r,t+1))− J(y(l,∞),y(r,∞)) ≥ 0, (34)\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\nwhich is the 5-points property (5-pp) of J . From (34), the sequence δJ(y(l,∞),y(l,t)) is non-increasing and non-negative. Therefore, it must have a limit (from the Monotone Convergence Theorem) and consequently the left hand side of (34) approaches 0 as t → ∞. Hence, lim\nt→∞ J(y(l,t),y(r,t)) = J(y(l,∞),y(r,∞)) (by the Pinching Theorem).\nFinally, we must show that y(l,t) and y(r,t) themselves converge. From the boundedness of δJ(y(l,∞),y(l,t)) (established in Lemma A.9), it follows that y(l,t) is bounded. Therefore, it has a convergent subsequence {y(l,ti)} – the limit of which can be denoted by y0,(l) (by the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem). Similarly, it can be shown that the subsequence {y(r,ti)} also converges to some limit. Let that limit be denoted by y0,(r). By the lower-semi-continuity of J (established in Lemma A.1), we have:\nJ(y0,(l),y0,(r)) ≤ lim inf i J(y(l,ti),y(r,ti)) = J(y(l,∞),y(r,∞)). (35)\nWe denote Y∞l = {y (l) : arg min y(l),y(r)∈Sn J(y(l),y(r))} and Y∞r = {y (r) : arg min y(l),y(r)∈Sn J(y(l),y(r))}. Therefore, from the joint strict convexity of J , we should have Y∞l = {y 0,(l)} = {y(l,∞)} and Y∞r = {y 0,(r)} = {y(r,∞)}.\nTo prove the convergence of the entire sequence, we apply the same logic as above with y(l,∞) replaced by y0,(l). Then the sequence {δJ(y0,(l),y(l,t))} is bounded and nonincreasing and by using Lemma A.9, we conclude that it has a convergent subsequence {δJ(y\n0,(l),y(l,ti))} that goes to 0 as y(l,ti) → y0,(l). This, from Monotone Convergence Theorem, implies that {δJ(y0,(l),y(l,t))} → 0 and again using Lemma A.9, we can conclude that y(l,t) → y0,(l). Since y(r,t) is also bounded, it should have a convergent subsequence (by the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem). We denote this limit by y(0),(r). Again, by the lower-semi-continuity of J , we have:\nJ(y0,(l),y(0),(r)) ≤ J(y(l,∞),y(r,∞)). (36)\nHence, y(0),(r) = arg min y(r)∈Sn J(y(l),y(r,∞)) and y(r,t) → y(0),(r) = y0,(r).\nThere is another interesting aspect of J that was discovered in [Subramanya and Bilmes 2011] for a slightly different objective function with KL divergence used as a loss function. The same property also holds for J if the loss function is constructed from the assumed family of Bregman divergences. This property is concerned with the equality of solutions of J and J0 and explores under what conditions these two objectives become equal. To establish the theorem that explores this condition, the following lemmata are essential.\nLEMMA A.13. If y(r) = y(l) = y then J0 = J .\nPROOF. This proof immediately follows from the definitions of J0 and J in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4) respectively.\nLEMMA A.14. arg min (y(l),y(r))∈Sn×Sn J(y(l),y(r);λ = 0) ≤ arg min y∈Sn J0(y).\nPROOF.\nmin y∈Sn J0(y) = min (y(l),y(r))∈Sn×Sn;y(r)=y(l) J(y(l),y(r);λ = 0) ≥ min (y(l),y(r))∈Sn×Sn J(y(l),y(r);λ = 0)\nThe last step is due to the fact that the unconstrained minima is never larger than the constrained minima.\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012.\nLEMMA A.15. Given any y(l), y(r), y ∈ Sn such that y(l), y(r), y > 0 and y(l) 6= y(r) (i.e. not all components are equal) then there exists a finite λ such that J(y(l),y(r)) ≥ J(y,y) = J0(y).\nPROOF. For J(y(l),y(r)) ≥ J(y,y), we should have:\n\n\nn ∑\ni=1\ndφ(πi,y (r) i ) + α\nn ∑\ni,j=1\nsijdφ(y (l) i ,y (r) j ) + λ\nn ∑\ni=1\ndφ(y (l) i ,y (r) i )\n\n− J(y,y) ≥ 0\n⇒ λ ≥\nJ(y,y) − n ∑\ni=1\ndφ(πi,y (r) i )− α\nn ∑\ni,j=1\nsijdφ(y (l) i ,y (r) j )\nn ∑\ni=1\ndφ(y (l) i ,y (r) i )\n⇒ λ ≥ J0(y) − J(y (l),y(r);λ = 0) n ∑\ni=1\ndφ(y (l) i ,y (r) i )\n≥ 0.\nwhere the last inequality follows from Lemma A.14.\nThe theorem that formulates the conditions for equality of solutions of J and J0 is given below:\nTHEOREM A.16 (EQUALITY OF SOLUTIONS OF J AND J0). Let y∗ = arg min y∈Sn J0(y)\nand (yλ̃,(l) ∗ ,yλ̃,(r) ∗ ) = arg min\ny∈Sn J(y(l),y(r); λ̃) for an arbitrary λ = λ̃ > 0. Then there\nexists a finite λ̂ such that at convergence of OAC3, we have y∗ = yλ̂,(l) ∗ = yλ̂,(r) ∗ . Further, if yλ̃,(l) ∗ 6= yλ̃,(r) ∗ , then\nλ̂ ≥ J0(y\n∗)− J(yλ̃,(l) ∗ ,yλ̃,(r) ∗ ;λ = 0)\nn ∑\ni=1\ndφ(y λ̃,(l) i ,y λ̃,(r) i )\nand if yλ̃,(l) ∗ = yλ̃,(r) ∗ , then λ̂ ≥ λ̃.\nPROOF. If yλ̃,(l) ∗ = yλ̃,(r) ∗ , then from the strict convexity of both J0 and J , J0(y∗) =\nJ(yλ̃,(l) ∗ ,yλ̃,(r) ∗ ;λ = 0). Also, since for any y(l) 6= y(r), J(y(l),y(r); λ̂) > J(y(l),y(r); λ̃), whenever λ̂ ≥ λ̃, then ∀λ̂ ≥ λ̃ J0(y∗) = J(yλ̂,(l) ∗ ,yλ̂,(r) ∗ ;λ = 0). Also, if yλ̃,(l) ∗ 6= yλ̃,(r) ∗ , then from Lemma A.15, if\n∞ > λ̂ ≥ J0(y\n∗)− J(yλ̃,(l) ∗ ,yλ̃,(r) ∗ ;λ = 0)\nn ∑\ni=1\ndφ(y λ̃,(l) i ,y λ̃,(r) i )\nthen it is guaranteed that yλ̂,(l) ∗ = yλ̂,(r) ∗ .\nACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data, Vol. 2, No. 4, Article 01, Publication date: April 2012."

Such models can also help detect possible differences between training and target distributions, which is useful in applications where concept drift may take place, as in transfer learning settings. This paper describes a general optimization framework that takes as input class membership estimates from existing classifiers learnt on previously encountered “source” data, as well as a similarity matrix from a cluster ensemble operating solely on the target data to be classified, and yields a consensus labeling of the target data. This framework admits a wide range of loss functions and classification/clustering methods. It exploits properties of Bregman divergences in conjunction with Legendre duality to yield a principled and scalable approach. A variety of experiments show that the proposed framework can yield results substantially superior to those provided by popular transductive learning techniques or by naı̈vely applying classifiers learnt on the original task to the target data.",
