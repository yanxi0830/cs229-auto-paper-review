      "text" : "Most supervised learning algorithms assume that training and test data follow the same probability distribution (Vapnik, 1998; Hastie et al., 2001; Bishop, 2006). However, this de facto standard assumption is often violated in realworld problems, caused by intrinsic sample selection bias or inevitable non-stationarity (Heckman, 1979; QuiñoneroCandela et al., 2009; Sugiyama & Kawanabe, 2012).\nIn classification scenarios, changes in class balance are often observed—for example, the male-female ratio is almost fifty-fifty in the real-world (test set), whereas training samples collected in a research laboratory tends to be dominated by male data. Such a situation is called a class-prior change, and the bias caused by differing class balances can be systematically adjusted by instance re-weighting or resampling if the class balance in the test dataset is known (Elkan, 2001; Lin et al., 2002).\nHowever, the class ratio in the test dataset is often unknown\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nin practice. A possible approach to coping with this problem is to learn a classifier so that the performance for all possible class balances is improved, e.g., through maximization of the area under the ROC curve (Cortes & Mohri, 2004; Clémençon et al., 2009). Another, possibly more direct approach is to estimate the class ratio in the test dataset and use the estimates for instance re-weighting or resampling. In this paper, we focus on the latter scenario under a semi-supervised learning setup (Chapelle et al., 2006), where no labeled data is available from the test domain.\nSaerens et al. (2001) is a seminal paper on this topic, which proposed to estimate the class ratio by the expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977)— alternately updating the test class-prior and class-posterior probabilities from some initial estimates until convergence. This method has been successfully applied to various realworld problems such as word sense disambiguation (Chan & Ng, 2006) and remote sensing (Latinne et al., 2001).\nIn this paper, we first reformulate the above algorithm, and show that this actually corresponds to approximating the test input distribution by a linear combination of class-wise input distributions under the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence (Kullback & Leibler, 1951). In this procedure, the class-wise input distributions are approximated via classposterior estimation, for example, by kernel logistic regression (Hastie et al., 2001) or its squared-loss variant (Sugiyama, 2010).\nThis new formulation motivates us to develop a new approach, since indirectly estimating the divergence by estimating the individual class-posterior distributions may not be the best scheme. Recently, KL divergence estimation based on direct density-ratio estimation has been shown to be promising (Nguyen et al., 2010; Sugiyama et al., 2008). Furthermore, a squared-loss variant of the KL divergence called the Pearson (PE) divergence (Pearson, 1900) can also be approximated in the same way, with an analytic solution that can be computed efficiently (Kanamori et al., 2009a). The PE divergence and the KL divergence both belong to the f -divergence class (Ali & Silvey, 1966; Csiszár,\n1967), which share similar properties. In this paper, with the aid of this density-ratio based PE divergence estimator, we propose a new semi-supervised method for estimating the class ratio in the test dataset. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method."

However, we assume that the classconditional density for training data p(x|y) and that for test data p′(x|y) are the same:\np(x|y) = p′(x|y). (1)\nNote that training and test joint densities p(x, y) and p′(x, y) as well as training and test input densities p(x) and p′(x) are generally different under this setup.\nThe goal of this paper is to estimate p′(y) from labeled training samples {(xi, yi)}ni=1 drawn independently from p(x, y) and unlabeled test samples {x′i} n′\ni=1 drawn independently from p′(x). Given test labels {y′i} n′ i=1, p ′(y) can be naively estimated by n′y/n ′, where n′y is the number of test samples in class y. Here, however, we would like to estimate p′(y) without {y′i} n′ i=1."

Obtain an estimate of the training class-posterior probability, p̂(y|x), from training data {(xi, yi)}ni=1, for example, by kernel logistic regression (Hastie et al., 2001) or its squared-loss variant (Sugiyama, 2010).\n2.

(5)\nWe match the model q′(x) with the test input density p′(x) under the KL divergence:\nKL(p′‖q′) := ∫ p′(x) log p′(x)\nq′(x) dx\n= ∫ p′(x) log p′(x)dx\n− ∫ p′(x) log ( c∑\ny=1\nθyp(x|y) ) dx.

The KKT conditions for the above problem is given by Eq.(5) and\n1 n′ n′∑ i=1 p(x′i|y)∑c y′=1 θy′p(x ′ i|y′) = ν, ∀y = 1, . . . , c,\nwhere ν is a Lagrange multiplier. From these equations, we can determine ν as\nν = 1 · ν =\n( c∑\ny=1\nθy\n) ·  1 n′ n′∑ i=1 p(x′i|y)∑c y′=1 θy′p(x ′ i|y′)  = 1\nn′ n′∑ i=1\n∑c y=1 θyp(x\n′ i|y)∑c\ny′=1 θy′p(x ′ i|y′)\n= 1.\nThen the solution {θy}cy=1 can be calculated by fixed-point iteration as follows (McLachlan & Krishnan, 1997):\nθy ←− θy  1 n′ n′∑ i=1 p(x′i|y)∑c y=1 θyp(x ′ i|y)  . (8) Making the substitution p(x′i|y) = p(y|x′i)p(x′i)/p(y), canceling p(x′i) in the numerator and denominator, and replacing p(y|x) with p̂(y|x), we can show that the above updating formula is reduced to\nθy ←− 1\nn′ n′∑ i=1 θyp̂(y|x′i)/p̂(y)∑c y′=1 θy′ p̂(y ′|x′i)/p̂(y′) ,\nwhich is the same as Eq.(3) with Eq.(2) substituted.\nTherefore, the EM method is essentially equivalent to matching the training and test input distributions under the KL divergence, which uses the class-conditional density p(x|y) as a building block (see Eq.(8)). However, this fact is not apparent in the EM expression because of the cancellation of p(x′i) in the numerator and denominator.\nThe convexity of Eq.(7) implies that there are no local minima. However, this was not recognized in Saerens et al. (2001) since the algorithm was derived via the incomplete data EM method."

This shows that methods based on the KL and PE divergences overall outperform EM-KLR, implying that our reformulation of the EM algorithm as distribution matching (see Section 3) contributes to obtaining accurate class-ratio estimates. Among the KL-based methods, KL-KDE tends to perform better than KL-DR. This is because, in KL-KDE, we did not estimate the first term in Eq.(6), which is the negative entropy and is a constant. On the other hand, the negative entropy is also implicitly estimated in KL-DR, possibly incurring additional estimation error. Among the PE-based methods, PE-DR outperforms PE-KDE, showing that directly estimating density ratios without density estimation is more promising as a PE divergence estimator. Overall, PE-DR is shown to be the most accurate.\nNext, we compare classification accuracy when the learned class-prior probabilities are used as instance weights. Figure 2 shows misclassification rates for a regularized leastsquares classifier (Rifkin et al., 2003) with instance weighting. The results show that, as expected, a more accurate estimate of the class ratio tends to give a lower misclassification rate."

In this vehicle classification task, class-prior change is in-\nevitable because the type of vehicles passing through differs depending on time (e.g., day and night).\nn samples are drawn from each of the labeled classes for the training set with the uniform class prior, whereas 100 samples are drawn with probabilities p = [0.6 0.1 0.3] from each of the classes for the test set.

In classification scenarios, changes in class balance are often observed—for example, the male-female ratio is almost fifty-fifty in the real-world (test set), whereas training samples collected in a research laboratory tends to be dominated by male data. Such a situation is called a class-prior change, and the bias caused by differing class balances can be systematically adjusted by instance re-weighting or resampling if the class balance in the test dataset is known (Elkan, 2001; Lin et al., 2002). However, the class ratio in the test dataset is often unknown Appearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s). in practice. A possible approach to coping with this problem is to learn a classifier so that the performance for all possible class balances is improved, e.g., through maximization of the area under the ROC curve (Cortes & Mohri, 2004; Clémençon et al., 2009). Another, possibly more direct approach is to estimate the class ratio in the test dataset and use the estimates for instance re-weighting or resampling. In this paper, we focus on the latter scenario under a semi-supervised learning setup (Chapelle et al., 2006), where no labeled data is available from the test domain. Saerens et al.

If the class ratio of the test dataset is known, instance re-weighting or resampling allows systematical bias correction. However, learning the class ratio of the test dataset is challenging when no labeled data is available from the test domain. In this paper, we propose to estimate the class ratio in the test dataset by matching probability distributions of training and test input data. We demonstrate the utility of the proposed approach through experiments.",
