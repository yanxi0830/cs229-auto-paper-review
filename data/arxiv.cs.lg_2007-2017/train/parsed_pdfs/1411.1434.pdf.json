While there have been recent results for specific graph classes, these involve fairly extensive technical arguments that are specialized to each specific graph class. In contrast, we isolate two key graph-structural ingredients that can then be used to specify sample complexity lower-bounds. Presence of these structural properties makes the graph class hard to learn. We derive corollaries of our main result that not only recover existing recent results, but also provide lower bounds for novel graph classes not considered previously. We also extend our framework to the random graph setting and derive corollaries for Erdős-Rényi graphs in a certain dense setting."

      "text" : "Graphical models provide compact representations of multivariate distributions using graphs that represent Markov conditional independencies in the distribution. They are thus widely used in a number of machine learning domains where there are a large number of random variables, including natural language processing [13], image processing [6, 10, 19], statistical physics [11], and spatial statistics [15]. In many of these domains, a key problem of interest is to recover the underlying dependencies, represented by the graph, given samples i.e. to estimate the graph of dependencies given instances drawn from the distribution. A common regime where this graph selection problem is of interest is the high-dimensional setting, where the number of samples n is potentially smaller than the number of variables p. Given the importance of this problem, it is instructive to have lower bounds on the sample complexity of any estimator: it clarifies the statistical difficulty of the underlying problem, and moreover it could serve as a certificate of optimality in terms of sample complexity for any estimator that actually achieves this lower bound. We are particularly interested in such lower bounds under the structural constraint that the graph lies within a given class of graphs (such as degree-bounded graphs, bounded-girth graphs, and so on).\nThe simplest approach to obtaining such bounds involves graph counting arguments, and an application of Fano’s lemma. [2, 17] for instance derive such bounds for the case of degree-bounded and power-law graph classes respectively. This approach however is purely graph-theoretic, and thus fails to capture the interaction of the graphical model parameters with the graph structural constraints, and thus typically provides suboptimal lower bounds (as also observed in [16]). The other standard approach requires a more complicated argument through Fano’s lemma that requires finding a subset of graphs such that (a) the subset is large enough in number, and (b) the graphs in the subset are close enough in a suitable metric, typically the KL-divergence of the corresponding distributions. This approach is however much more technically intensive, and even for the simple\nclasses of bounded degree and bounded edge graphs for Ising models, [16] required fairly extensive arguments in using the above approach to provide lower bounds.\nIn modern high-dimensional settings, it is becoming increasingly important to incorporate structural constraints in statistical estimation, and graph classes are a key interpretable structural constraint. But a new graph class would entail an entirely new (and technically intensive) derivation of the corresponding sample complexity lower bounds. In this paper, we are thus interested in isolating the key ingredients required in computing such lower bounds. This key ingredient involves one the following structural characterizations: (1) connectivity by short paths between pairs of nodes, or (2) existence of many graphs that only differ by an edge. As corollaries of this framework, we not only recover the results in [16] for the simple cases of degree and edge bounded graphs, but to several more classes of graphs, for which achievability results have already been proposed[1]. Moreover, using structural arguments allows us to bring out the dependence of the edge-weights, λ, on the sample complexity. We are able to show same sample complexity requirements for d-regular graphs, as is for degree d-bounded graphs, whilst the former class is much smaller. We also extend our framework to the random graph setting, and as a corollary, establish lower bound requirements for the class of Erdős-Rényi graphs in a dense setting. Here, we show that under a certain scaling of the edge-weights λ, Gp,c/p requires exponentially many samples, as opposed to a polynomial requirement suggested from earlier bounds[1]."

      "text" : "Notation: R represents the real line. [p] denotes the set of integers from 1 to p. Let 1S denote the vector of ones and zeros where S is the set of coordinates containing 1. Let A − B denote A⋂Bc and A∆B denote the symmetric difference for two sets A and B.\nIn this work, we consider the problem of learning the graph structure of an Ising model. Ising models are a class of graphical model distributions over binary vectors, characterized by the pair (G(V,E), θ̄), where G(V,E) is an undirected graph on p vertices and θ̄ ∈ R(p2) : θ̄i,j = 0 ∀(i, j) /∈ E, θ̄i,j 6= 0 ∀ (i, j) ∈ E. Let X = {+1,−1}. Then, for the pair (G, θ̄), the distribution on X p is\ngiven as: fG,θ̄(x) = 1 Z exp\n(\n∑\ni,j\nθ̄i,j xixj\n)\nwhere x ∈ X p and Z is the normalization factor, also\nknown as the partition function.\nThus, we obtain a family of distributions by considering a set of edge-weighted graphs Gθ , where each element of Gθ is a pair (G, θ̄). In other words, every member of the class Gθ is a weighted undirected graph. Let G denote the set of distinct unweighted graphs in the class Gθ . A learning algorithm that learns the graph G (and not the weights θ̄) from n independent samples (each sample is a p-dimensional binary vector) drawn from the distribution fG,θ̄(·), is an efficiently computable map φ : χnp → G which maps the input samples {x1, . . .xn} to an undirected graph Ĝ ∈ G i.e. Ĝ = φ(x1, . . . ,xn). We now discuss two metrics of reliability for such an estimator φ. For a given (G, θ̄), the probability of error (over the samples drawn) is given by p(G, θ̄) = Pr ( Ĝ 6= G )\n. Given a graph class Gθ, one may consider the maximum probability of error for the map φ, given as:\npmax = max (G,θ)∈Gθ\nPr ( Ĝ 6= G ) . (1)\nThe goal of any estimator φ would be to achieve as low a pmax as possible. Alternatively, there are random graph classes that come naturally endowed with a probability measure µ(G, θ) of choosing the graphical model. In this case, the quantity we would want to minimize would be the average probability of error of the map φ, given as:\npavg = Eµ\n[ Pr ( Ĝ 6= G )]\n(2)\nIn this work, we are interested in answering the following question: For any estimator φ, what is the minimum number of samples n, needed to guarantee an asymptotically small pmax or pavg ? The answer depends on Gθ and µ(when applicable).\nFor the sake of simplicity, we impose the following restrictions1: We restrict to the set of zero-field ferromagnetic Ising models, where zero-field refers to a lack of node weights, and ferromagnetic refers to all positive edge weights. Further, we will restrict all the non-zero edge weights (θ̄i,j) in the graph classes to be the same, set equal to λ > 0. Therefore, for a given G(V,E), we have θ̄ = λ1E for some λ > 0. A deterministic graph class is described by a scalar λ > 0 and the family of graphs G. In the case of a random graph class, we describe it by a scalar λ > 0 and a probability measure µ, the measure being solely on the structure of the graph G (on G). Since we have the same weight λ(> 0) on all edges, henceforth we will skip the reference to it, i.e. the graph class will simply be denoted G and for a given G ∈ G, the distribution will be denoted by fG(·), with the dependence on λ being implicit. Before proceeding further, we summarize the following additional notation. For any two distributions fG and fG′ , corresponding to the graphs G and G′ respectively, we denote the Kullback-Liebler divergence (KL-divergence) between them\nas D (fG‖fG′) = ∑ x∈X p fG(x) log ( fG(x) fG′ (x) )\n. For any subset T ⊆ G, we let CT (ǫ) denote an ǫ-covering w.r.t. the KL-divergence (of the corresponding distributions) i.e. CT (ǫ)(⊆ G) is a set of graphs such that for any G ∈ T , there exists a G′ ∈ CT (ǫ) satisfying D (fG‖fG′) ≤ ǫ. We denote the entropy of any r.v. X by H(X), and the mutual information between any two r.v.s X and Y , by I(X ;Y ). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 3 describes Fano’s lemma, a basic tool employed in computing information-theoretic lower bounds. Section 4 identifies key structural properties that lead to large sample requirements. Section 5 applies the results of Sections 3 and 4 on a number of different deterministic graph classes to obtain lower bound estimates. Section 6 obtains lower bound estimates for Erdős-Rényi random graphs in a dense regime. All proofs can be found in the Appendix (see supplementary material)."

      "heading" : "3 Fano’s Lemma and Variants",
      "text" : "Fano’s lemma [5] is a primary tool for obtaining bounds on the average probability of error, pavg . It provides a lower bound on the probability of error of any estimator φ in terms of the entropy H(·) of the output space, the cardinality of the output space, and the mutual information I(· , ·) between the input and the output. The case of pmax is interesting only when we have a deterministic graph class G, and can be handled through Fano’s lemma again by considering a uniform distribution on the graph class.\nLemma 1 (Fano’s Lemma). Consider a graph class G with measure µ. Let, G ∼ µ, and let Xn = {x1, . . . ,xn} be n independent samples such that xi ∼ fG, i ∈ [n]. Then, for pmax and pavg as defined in (1) and (2) respectively,\npmax ≥ pavg ≥ H(G)− I(G;Xn)− log 2\nlog|G| (3)\nThus in order to use this Lemma, we need to bound two quantities: the entropyH(G), and the mutual information I(G;Xn). The entropy can typically be obtained or bounded very simply; for instance, with a uniform distribution over the set of graphs G, H(G) = log |G|. The mutual information is a much trickier object to bound however, and is where the technical complexity largely arises. We can however simply obtain the following loose bound: I(G;Xn) ≤ H(Xn) ≤ np. We thus arrive at the following corollary:\nCorollary 1. Consider a graph class G. Then, pmax ≥ 1− np+log 2log|G| .\nRemark 1. From Corollary 1, we get: If n ≤ log|G|p ( (1− δ)− log 2log|G| )\n, then pmax ≥ δ. Note that this bound on n is only in terms of the cardinality of the graph class G, and therefore, would not involve any dependence on λ (and consequently, be very loose).\nTo obtain sharper lower bound guarantees that depends on graphical model parameters, it is useful to consider instead a conditional form of Fano’s lemma[1, Lemma 9], which allows us to obtain lower bounds on pavg in terms conditional analogs of the quantities in Lemma 1. For the case of pmax, these conditional analogs correspond to uniform measures on subsets of the original class G.\n1Note that a lower bound for a restricted subset of a class of Ising models will also serve as a lower bound for the class without that restriction.\nThe conditional version allows us to focus on potentially harder to learn subsets of the graph class, leading to sharper lower bound guarantees. Also, for a random graph class, the entropy H(G) may be asymptotically much smaller than the log cardinality of the graph class, log|G| (e.g. Erdős-Rényi random graphs; see Section 6), rendering the bound in Lemma 1 useless. The conditional version allows us to circumvent this issue by focusing on a high-probability subset of the graph class.\nLemma 2 (Conditional Fano’s Lemma). Consider a graph class G with measure µ. Let, G ∼ µ, and let Xn = {x1, . . . ,xn} be n independent samples such that xi ∼ fG, i ∈ [n]. Consider any T ⊆ G and let µ (T ) be the measure of this subset i.e. µ (T ) = Prµ (G ∈ T ). Then, we have\npavg ≥ µ (T ) H(G|G ∈ T )− I(G;Xn|G ∈ T )− log 2\nlog|T | and,\npmax ≥ H(G|G ∈ T )− I(G;Xn|G ∈ T )− log 2\nlog|T |\nGiven Lemma 2, or even Lemma 1, it is the sharpness of an upper bound on the mutual information that governs the sharpness of lower bounds on the probability of error (and effectively, the number of samples n). In contrast to the trivial upper bound used in the corollary above, we next use a tighter bound from [20], which relates the mutual information to coverings in terms of the KL-divergence, applied to Lemma 2. Note that, as stated earlier, we simply impose a uniform distribution on G when dealing with pmax. Analogous bounds can be obtained for pavg .\nCorollary 2. Consider a graph class G, and any T ⊆ G. Recall the definition of CT (ǫ) from Section 2. For any ǫ > 0, we have pmax ≥ ( 1− log|CT (ǫ)|+nǫ+log 2log|T | ) .\nRemark 2. From Corollary 2, we get: If n ≤ log|T |ǫ ( (1− δ)− log 2log|T | − log|CT (ǫ)| log|T | )\n, then pmax ≥ δ. ǫ is an upper bound on the radius of the KL-balls in the covering, and usually varies with λ.\nBut this corollary cannot be immediately used given a graph class: it requires us to specify a subset T of the overall graph class, the term ǫ, and the KL-covering CT (ǫ). We can simplify the bound above by setting ǫ to be the radius of a single KL-ball w.r.t. some center, covering the whole set T . Suppose this radius is ρ, then the size of the covering set is just 1. In this case, from Remark 2, we get: If n ≤ log|T |ρ ( (1− δ)− log 2log|T | )\n, then pmax ≥ δ. Thus, our goal in the sequel would be to provide a general mechanism to derive such a subset T : that is large in number and yet has small diameter with respect to KL-divergence.\nWe note that Fano’s lemma and variants described in this section are standard, and have been applied to a number of problems in statistical estimation [1, 14, 16, 20, 21]."

      "text" : "As discussed in the previous section, we want to find subsets T that are large in size, and yet have a small KL-diameter. In this section, we summarize certain structural properties that result in small KL-diameter. Thereafter, finding a large set T would amount to finding a large number of graphs in the graph class G that satisfy these structural properties. As a first step, we need to get a sense of when two graphs would have corresponding distributions with a small KL-divergence. To do so, we need a general upper bound on the KL-divergence between the corresponding distributions. A simple strategy is to simply bound it by its symmetric divergence[16]. In this case, a little calculation shows :\nD (fG‖fG′) ≤ D (fG‖fG′) +D (fG′‖fG) = ∑\n(s,t)∈E\\E′ λ (EG [xsxt]− EG′ [xsxt]) +\n∑\n(s,t)∈E′\\E λ (EG′ [xsxt]− EG [xsxt])\n(4)\nwhere E and E′ are the edges in the graphs G and G′ respectively, and EG[·] denotes the expectation under fG. Also note that the correlation between xs and xt, EG[xsxt] = 2PG(xsxt = +1)− 1.\nFrom Eq. (4), we observe that the only pairs, (s, t), contributing to the KL-divergence are the ones that lie in the symmetric difference,E∆E′. If the number of such pairs is small, and the difference of correlations in G and G′ (i.e. EG [xsxt]−EG′ [xsxt]) for such pairs is small, then the KL-divergence would be small.\nTo summarize the setting so far, to obtain a tight lower bound on sample complexity for a class of graphs, we need to find a subset of graphs T with small KL diameter. The key to this is to identify when KL divergence between (distributions corresponding to) two graphs would be small. And the key to this in turn is to identify when there would be only a small difference in the correlations between a pair of variables across the two graphs G and G′. In the subsequent subsections, we provide two simple and general structural characterizations that achieve such a small difference of correlations across G and G′."

      "text" : "One scenario when there might be a small difference in correlations is when one of the correlations is very large, specifically arbitrarily close to 1, say EG′ [xsxt] ≥ 1 − ǫ, for some ǫ > 0. Then, EG[xsxt] − EG′ [xsxt] ≤ ǫ, since EG[xsxt] ≤ 1. Indeed, when s, t are part of a clique[16], this is achieved since the large number of connections between them force a higher probability of agreement i.e. PG(xsxt = +1) is large.\nIn this work we provide a more general characterization of when this might happen by relying on the following key lemma that connects the presence of “many” node disjoint “short” paths between a pair of nodes in the graph to high correlation between them. We define the property formally below. Definition 1. Two nodes a and b in an undirected graph G are said to be (ℓ, d) connected if they have d node disjoint paths of length at most ℓ. Lemma 3. Consider a graph G and a scalar λ > 0. Consider the distribution fG(x) induced by the graph. If a pair of nodes a and b are (ℓ, d) connected, then EG [xaxb] ≥ 1− 2\n1+ (1+(tanh(λ))ℓ)d\n(1−(tanh(λ))ℓ)d\n.\nFrom the above lemma, we can observe that as ℓ gets smaller and d gets larger,EG [xaxb] approaches its maximum value of 1. As an example, in a k-clique, any two vertices, s and t, are (2, k − 1) connected. In this case, the bound from Lemma 3 gives us: EG [xaxb] ≥ 1 − 21+(coshλ)k−1 . Of course, a clique enjoys a lot more connectivity (i.e. also (\n3, k−12 ) connected etc., albeit with node\noverlaps) which allows for a stronger bound of ∼ 1− λkeλ eλk (see [16])2\nNow, as discussed earlier, a high correlation between a pair of nodes contributes a small term to the KL-divergence. This is stated in the following corollary. Corollary 3. Consider two graphs G(V,E) and G′(V,E′) and scalar weight λ > 0 such that E − E′ and E′ − E only contain pairs of nodes that are (ℓ, d) connected in graphs G′ and G respectively, then the KL-divergence between fG and fG′ , D (fG‖fG′) ≤ 2λ|E∆E\n′| 1+ (1+(tanh(λ))ℓ)d\n(1−(tanh(λ))ℓ)d\n."

This is formalized below for the situation when they differ by only one edge. Definition 2 (Hamming Distance). Consider two graphs G(V,E) and G′(V,E′). The hamming distance between the graphs, denoted by H(G,G′), is the number of edges where the two graphs differ i.e. H(G,G′) = |{(s, t) | (s, t) ∈ E∆E′}| (5) Lemma 4. Consider two graphs G(V,E) and G′(V,E′) such that H(G,G′) = 1, and (a, b) ∈ E is the single edge in E∆E′. Then, EfG [xaxb] − EfG′ [xaxb] ≤ tanh(λ). Also, the KL-divergence between the distributions, D (fG‖f ′G) ≤ λ tanh(λ).\n2Both the bound from [16] and the bound from Lemma 3 have exponential asymptotic behaviour (i.e. as k grows) for constant λ. For smaller λ, the bound from [16] is strictly better. However, not all graph classes allow for the presence of a large enough clique, for e.g., girth bounded graphs, path restricted graphs, Erdős-Rényi graphs.\nThe above bound is useful in low λ settings. In this regime λ tanhλ roughly behaves as λ2. So, a smaller λ would correspond to a smaller KL-divergence."

Let us assume that λ > 0 is a positive real constant. In a graph even when the edge (s, t) is removed, (s, t) being (ℓ, d) connected ensures that the correlation between s and t is still very high (exponentially close to 1). Therefore, resolving the question of the presence/absence of the edge (s, t) would be difficult – requiring lots of samples. This is analogous in principle to the argument in [16] used for establishing hardness of learning of a set of graphs each of which is obtained by removing a single edge from a clique, still ensuring many short paths between any two vertices. Similarly, if the graphs, G and G′, are close in Hamming distance, then their corresponding distributions, fG and fG′ , also tend to be similar. Again, it becomes difficult to tease apart which distribution the samples observed may have originated from."

Once we have such a graph, we construct a subset T by removing one of the edges for these wellconnected edge pairs.

(This bound is from [1] )\nRemark 4. This means that when λ = Ω( √ p/c), a huge number (exponential for constant λ) of samples are required. Hence, for any efficient algorithm, we require λ = O (√ p/c )\nand in this regime O (c log p) samples are required to learn."

      "text" : "The proof skeleton is based on Lemma 2. The essence of the proof is to cover a set of graphs T , with large measure, by an exponentially small set where the KL-divergence between any covered and the covering graph is also very small. For this we use Corollary 3. The key steps in the proof are outlined below:\n1. We identify a subclass of graphs T , as in Lemma 2, whose measure is close to 1, i.e. µ(T ) = 1− o(1). A natural candidate is the ’typical’ set T pǫ which is defined to be a set of graphs each with ( cp2 − cpǫ 2 , cp 2 + cpǫ 2 ) edges in the graph. 2. (Path property) We show that most graphs in T have property R: there are O(p2) pairs of nodes such that every pair is well connected by O( c 2\np ) node disjoint paths of length 2 with high probability. The measure µ(R|T ) = 1− δ1. 3. (Covering with low diameter) Every graph G in R⋂ T is covered by a graph G′ from a covering set CR(δ2) such that their edge set differs only in the O(p2) nodes that are well connected. Therefore, by Corollary 3, KL-divergence between G and G′ is very small (δ2 = O(λp2 cosh(λ)−c 2/p)). 4. (Efficient covering in Size) Further, the covering set CR is exponentially smaller than T . 5. (Uncovered graphs have exponentially low measure) Then we show that the uncovered\ngraphs have large KL-divergence ( O(p2λ) ) but their measure µ(Rc |T ) is exponentially small.\n6. Using a similar (but more involved) expression for probability of error as in Corollary 2, roughly we need O( log|T |δ1+δ2 ) samples.\nThe above technique is very general. Potentially this could be applied to other random graph classes."

      "text" : "In this paper, we have explored new approaches for computing sample complexity lower bounds for Ising models. By explicitly bringing out the dependence on the weights of the model, we have shown that unless the weights are restricted, the model may be hard to learn. For example, it is hard to learn a graph which has many paths between many pairs of vertices, unless λ is controlled. For the random graph setting, Gp,c/p, while achievability is possible in the c = poly log p case[1], we have shown lower bounds for c > p0.75. Closing this gap remains a problem for future consideration. The application of our approaches to other deterministic/random graph classes such as the ChungLu model[4] (a generalization of Erdős-Rényi graphs), or small-world graphs[18] would also be interesting."

      "text" : "First, we discuss certain properties that most graphs in T pǫ possess building on Lemma 3. Using these properties, we describe the covering set S.\nConsider a graph G on p nodes. Divide the node set into three equal parts A, B and C of equal size (p/3). Two nodes a ∈ A and c ∈ C are (2, γ) connected through B if there are at least γ nodes in B which are connected to both a and c (with parameter γ as defined in Section 4.3). Let D(G) ⊆ A× C be the set of all pairs (a, c) : a ∈ A, c ∈ C such that nodes a and c are (2, γ) connected. Let |D(G)| = mA,C . Let E(G) denote the edge in graph G.\n10.2.1 Technical results on D(G) Nodes a ∈ A and c ∈ C are clearly (2, d)-connected if there are d nodes in B which are connected to both a and b as it will mean d disjoint paths connecting a and b through the partition B. Now if G ∼ G(p, c/p), then expected number of disjoint paths between a and c through B is p3 c 2 p2 since\nthe probability of a path existing through a node b ∈ B is c2p2 . Let na,c be the number of such paths between a and c. The event that there is a path through b1 ∈ B is independent of the event that there is a path through b2 ∈ B, applying chernoff bounds (see [12]) for p/3 independent bernoulli variables we have: Lemma 6. Pr ( na,c ≤ c 2 3p − √ 4p log p )\n≤ 1p2 for any two nodes a ∈ A and c ∈ C when G ∼ G(p, c/p). The bound is useful for c = Ω(p 3 4+ǫ ′ ), ǫ′ > 0.\nTherefore, in this regime of dense graphs, any two nodes in partitions A and C are (2, γ = c2/6p) connected with probability 1− 1p2 .\nGiven a ∈ A and c ∈ C, the probability that a and c are (2, γ) connected is 1 − 1p2 . The expected number of pairs in A × C that are (2, γ) connected is (p/3)2 (1 − 1p2 ). Let D(G) ⊆ A× C be the set of all pairs (a, c) : a ∈ A, c ∈ C such that nodes a and c are (2, γ) connected. Let mA,C = |D|. Then we have the following concentration result on mA,C : Lemma 7. Pr (\nmA,C ≤ 12 (p/3) 2 )\n≤ bp = p/3 exp(−(p/36)) when G ∼ G(p, c/p), c = Ω(p 3 4+ǫ ′ ), ǫ′ > 0.\nProof. The event that the pair (a1, c1) ∈ A × C is (2, γ) connected and the event that the pair (a2, c2) ∈ A×C are dependent if a1 = a2 or c1 = c2. Therefore, we need to obtain a concentration result for the case when you have (p/3)2 Bernoulli variables (each corresponding to a pair in A×C being (2, γ) connected ) which are dependent.\nConsider a complete bipartite graph between A and C. Since, |A| = |C| = p/3. Edges of every complete bipartite graph Kp/3,p/3 can be decomposed into a disjoint union of p/3 perfect matchings between the partitions (this is due to Hall’s Theorem repeatedly applied on graphs obtained by\nremoving perfect matchings. See [9] ). Therefore, the set of pairs A × C = p/3 ⋃\n1=1 Mi where Mi =\n{(ai1 , ci1), . . . (aip/3 , cip/3)} where all for any j 6= k, aik 6= aij and cik 6= cij . Let us focus on the number of pairs which are (2, γ) connected between A and C in a random graph G ∼ G(p, c/p). If mA,C ≤ 12 (p/3)\n2, then at least for one i, the number of pairs in G among the pairs in Mi that are (2, γ) is at most 12 (p/3). This is because (p/3)2 = ∑\ni |Mi|. Let Eci denote the event that number of edges in G among pairs in Mi is at most 12 (p/3).\nPr\n(\nmA,C ≤ 1\n2 (p/3)2\n) ≤ Pr ( ⋃\ni\nEci\n)\n≤ ∑\ni\nPr (Eci ) . (29)\nThe last inequality is due to union bound. A pair in Mi being (2, γ) connected happens with probability 1− 1/p2 from Lemma 6. Since it is a perfect matching, all these events are independent. Let cG(Mi) be the number of pairs in Mi which are (2, γ) connected. Therefore, applying a chernoff bound (see [12] Theorem 18.22) for independent Bernoulli variables, we have:\nPr(Eci ) = Pr (cG(Mi) ≤ E[(p/3)(1/2)) = Pr ( cG(Mi) ≤ E[cG(Mi)]− (p/3)(1/2− 1/p2) )\n(chernoff)\n≤ exp ( −(p/3)2(1/2− 1/p2)2/2(p/3) )\na ≤ exp (−(p/36))\n(a) holds for large p, i.e. for p ≥ p0 such that (1/2− 1/p2o)2 ≥ 1/6. Simple calculation shows that p0 can be taken to be greater than or equal to 10.\nNow, applying this to (29), we have ∀ p ≥ 10:\nPr\n(\nmA,C ≤ 1\n2 (p/3)\n2\n)\n≤ bp = p/3 exp(−(p/36)). (30)\nLet E(G) be the set of edges in G.\nLemma 8. Pr (∣ ∣\n∣ ||E(G)⋂D(G)| |D(G)| − cp\n∣ ∣ ∣ ≥ cpǫ ∣ ∣ ∣mA,C ≥ 12 (p/3) 2 ) ≤ 2 exp(− c2ǫ236 ) = rc when G ∼ G(p, c/p), c = Ω(p 3 4+ǫ ′ ), ǫ′ > 0.\nProof. The presence of an edge between a pair on nodes in A × C is independent of the value of mA,C or whether the pair belongs to D. This is because a pair of nodes being (2, γ) connected depends on the rest of the graph and not on the edges in D(G). Given |D| ≥ 12 (p/3)2, |E(G)⋂D(G)| = ∑\n(i,j)∈D 1(i,j)∈E(G) is the sum of least 1 2 (p/3) 2 bernoulli variables each with suc-\ncess probability c/p. Therefore, applying chernoff bounds we have:\nPr\n(∣\n∣ ∣ ∣ ||E(G)⋂D(G)| |D(G)| − c p\n∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≤ c p ǫ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ mA,C ≥ 1 2 (p/3) 2 ) ≤ 2 exp ( − c 2ǫ2 p22|D| |D| 2 )\na ≤ 2 exp\n(\n−c 2ǫ2\n4 (1/3)2\n)\n(31)\n(32)\n(a)- This is because |D| ≥ 12 (p/3)2.\nLemma 9. Pr ((∣ ∣\n∣ ||E(G)⋂D(G)| |D(G)| − cp\n∣ ∣ ∣ ≥ cpǫ ) ⋃ ( mA,C ≤ 12 (p/3) 2 ))\n≤ bp + rc, c = Ω(p 3 4+ǫ ′ ), ǫ′ > 0.\nProof.\nPr\n((∣\n∣ ∣ ∣ ||E(G)⋂D(G)| |D(G)| − c p\n∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≥ c p ǫ ) ⋃ ( mA,C ≤ 1 2 (p/3) 2 )) a ≤ Pr ( mA,C ≤ 1 2 (p/3) 2 )\n+Pr\n(∣\n∣ ∣ ∣ ||E(G)⋂D(G)| |D(G)| − c p\n∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ≥ c p ǫ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ mA,C ≥ 1 2 (p/3) 2 )\n≤ bp + rc (33)\n(a)- is because Pr(A ⋃ B) ≤ Pr(A) + Pr(Ac)Pr (B|Ac) ≤ Pr(A) + Pr (B|Ac) ."

Then, |Nm,pǫ | = ∑\nmp(1−ǫ)≤q≤mp(1+ǫ)\n(\nm q\n)\n. Further,\n|Nm,pǫ | ≥ (1− ǫ)2mH(p)(1−ǫ). Definition 4. (Covering set) S = {GD=∅|G ∈ Rpǫ}.\nNow, we describe the covering rule for the set Rpǫ . For any G ∈ Rpǫ , we cover G by GD=∅. Note that, given G, by definition, GD=∅ is unique. Therefore, there is no ambiguity and no necessity to break ties. Since, the set D(G) is dependent only on the edges outside the set of pairs A × C, D (GD=∅) = D(G). Therefore, from a given G′ ∈ Rpǫ , by adding different sets of edges in D(G′), it is possible to obtain elements in Rp covered by G′. We now estimate the size of the covering set S relative to the size of T pǫ . We show that it is small.\nLemma 12. log|S| log|T pǫ | ≤ 9 10\n(\n1+ 119 ǫ\n1+ǫ\n)\n− O(1/p) for large p.\nProof. By definition of Rpǫ , for every G ∈ Rpǫ , |D| ≥ 12 (p/3)2 and the number of edges is in D is at least 12 (p/3)\n2(c/p)(1 + ǫ). And the graph that covers G is GD=∅ where all edges from D are removed if present in G. Let any set of q edges be added to GD=∅ among the pairs of nodes in D to form G′ such that |D|(c/p)(1 − ǫ) ≤ q ≤ |D|(c/p)(1 + ǫ). Then, any such G′ belongs to Rpǫ . This follows from the definition of the Rpǫ . And G′ is still uniquely covered by GD=∅. Uniqueness follows from the discussion that precedes this Lemma. For every covering graph Gc ∈ S, there are at least ∑\n|D(Gc)|(c/p)(1−ǫ)≤q≤|D(Gc)|(c/p)(1+ǫ)\n(|D(Gc)| q ) distinct graphs G ∈ Rpǫ uniquely covered by\nGc. Using these observations, we upper bound |S| as follows:\nlog|T pǫ | ≥ log ( ∑\nGc∈S |{G ∈ Rpǫ : G is covered by Gc}|\n)\n≥ log\n\n\n∑\nGc∈S\n∑\n|D(Gc)|(c/p)(1−ǫ)≤q≤|D(Gc)|(c/p)(1+ǫ)\n(|D(Gc)| q )\n\n\na ≥ log\n(\n∑\nGc∈S |N |D(Gc)|,(c/p)ǫ |\n)\na ≥ log|S|+ log ( (1− ǫ)2 12 (p/3)2H(c/p)(1−ǫ) )\n(36)\n(a)- This is due to Lemma 11 and the fact that |D| ≥ 12 (p/3)2. Using (36), we have the following chain of inequalities:\nlog|S| log|T pǫ | a ≤ 1− log(1− ǫ) + 1 2 (1− ǫ)(p/3)2H(c/p) (\np 2\n)\nH(c/p)(1 + ǫ)\n= 1−O(1/p)− (1− ǫ) 9(1 + ǫ)\n(p/p− 1) b ≤ 1−O(1/p)− (1− ǫ)\n10(1 + ǫ)\n= 9\n10\n( 1 + 119 ǫ\n1 + ǫ\n)\n−O(1/p) (37)\n(a)- Upper bound is used from Lemma 5. (b)- This is valid for p ≥ 10."

This is\nbecause there are ( p 2 ) edges and correlation is at most 1. Upper bound for P ((Rpǫ)c) is from Lemma 10.

In contrast, we isolate two key graph-structural ingredients that can then be used to specify sample complexity lower-bounds. Presence of these structural properties makes the graph class hard to learn. We derive corollaries of our main result that not only recover existing recent results, but also provide lower bounds for novel graph classes not considered previously. We also extend our framework to the random graph setting and derive corollaries for Erdős-Rényi graphs in a certain dense setting.",
