      "text" : "In the classical multi-armed bandit problem, a decision-maker repeatedly chooses from among a finite set of actions. Each action generates a random reward drawn independently from a probability distribution associated with the action. The decision-maker is uncertain about these reward distributions, but learns about them as rewards are observed. Strong performance requires striking a balance between exploring poorly understood actions and exploiting previously acquired knowledge to attain high rewards. Because selecting one action generates no information pertinent to other actions, effective algorithms must sample every action many times.\nThere has been significant interest in addressing problems with more complex information structures, in which sampling one action can inform the decision-maker’s assessment of other actions. Effective algorithms must take advantage of the information structure to learn more efficiently. The most popular approaches to such problems extend upper-confidence-bound (UCB) algorithms and Thompson sampling, which were originally devised for the classical multi-armed bandit problem. In some cases, such as the linear bandit problem, strong performance guarantees have been established for these approaches. For some problem classes, compelling empirical results have also been presented for UCB algorithms and Thompson sampling, as well as the knowledge gradient algorithm. However, as we will demonstrate through simple analytic examples, these approaches can perform very poorly when faced with more complex information structures. Shortcomings stem from the fact that they do not adequately account for particular kinds of information.\nIn this paper, we propose a new approach – information-directed sampling (IDS) – that is designed to address this. IDS quantifies the amount learned by selecting an action through an\nar X\niv :1\n40 3.\n55 56\nv7 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n7 J\nul 2\ninformation-theoretic measure: the mutual information between the true optimal action and the next observation. Each action is sampled in a manner that minimizes the ratio between squared expected single-period regret and this measure of information gain. Through this information measure, IDS accounts for kinds of information that alternatives fail to address.\nAs we will demonstrate through simple analytic examples, IDS can dramatically outperform UCB algorithms, Thompson sampling, and the knowledge-gradient algorithm. Further, by leveraging the tools of our recent information theoretic analysis of Thompson sampling [61], we establish an expected regret bound for IDS that applies across a very general class of models and scales with the entropy of the optimal action distribution. We also specialize this bound to several classes of online optimization problems, including problems with full feedback, linear optimization problems with bandit feedback, and combinatorial problems with semi-bandit feedback, in each case establishing that bounds are order optimal up to a poly-logarithmic factor.\nWe benchmark the performance of IDS through simulations of the widely studied Bernoulli, Gaussian, and linear bandit problems, for which UCB algorithms and Thompson sampling are known to be very effective. We find that even in these settings, IDS outperforms UCB algorithms and Thompson sampling. This is particularly surprising for Bernoulli bandit problems, where UCB algorithms and Thompson sampling are known to be asymptotically optimal in the sense proposed by Lai and Robbins [49].\nIDS solves a single-period optimization problem as a proxy to an intractable multi-period problem. Solution of this single-period problem can itself be computationally demanding, especially in cases where the number of actions is enormous or mutual information is difficult to evaluate. We develop numerical methods for particular classes of online optimization problems. In some cases, our numerical methods do not compute exact or near-exact solutions but generate efficient approximations that are intended to capture key benefits of IDS. There is much more work to be done to design efficient algorithms for various problem classes and we hope that our analysis and initial collection of numerical methods will provide a foundation for further developments.\nIt is worth noting that the problem formulation we work with, which is presented in Section 3, is very general, encompassing not only problems with bandit feedback, but also a broad array of information structures for which observations can offer information about rewards of arbitrary subsets of actions or factors that influence these rewards. Because IDS and our analysis accommodate this level of generality, they can be specialized to problems that in the past have been studied individually, such as those involving pricing and assortment optimization (see, e.g., [14, 57, 65]), though in each case, developing a computationally efficient version of IDS may require innovation."

      "text" : "UCB algorithms are the primary approach considered in the segment of the stochastic multi-armed bandit literature that treats problems with dependent arms. UCB algorithms have been applied to problems where the mapping from action to expected reward is a linear [1, 24, 56], generalized linear [25], or sparse linear [2] model; is sampled from a Gaussian process [67] or has small norm in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space [67, 69]; or is a smooth (e.g. Lipschitz continuous) model [17, 45, 68]. Recently, an algorithm known as Thompson sampling has received a great deal of interest. Agrawal and Goyal [6] provided the first analysis for linear contextual bandit problems. Russo and Van Roy [58, 59] consider a more general class of models, and show that standard analysis of upper confidence bound algorithms leads to bounds on the expected regret of Thompson sampling. Very recent work of Gopalan et al. [33] provides asymptotic frequentist bounds on the growth rate of regret for problems with dependent arms. Both UCB algorithms and Thompson\nsampling have been applied to other types of problems, like reinforcement learning [40, 53] and Monte Carlo tree search [10, 46].\nIn one of the first papers on multi-armed bandit problems with dependent arms, Agrawal et al. [3] consider a general model in which the reward distribution associated with each action depends on a common unknown parameter. When the parameter space is finite, they provide a lower bound on the asymptotic growth rate of the regret of any admissible policy as the time horizon tends to infinity and show that this bound is attainable. These results were later extended by Agrawal et al. [4] and Graves and Lai [34] to apply to the adaptive control of Markov chains and to problems with infinite parameter spaces. These papers provide results of fundemental importance, but seem to have been overlooked by much of the recent literature.\nThough the use of mutual information to guide sampling has been the subject of much research, dating back to the work of Lindley [50], to our knowledge, only two other papers [36, 70] have used the mutual information between the optimal action and the next observation to guide action selection. Each focuses on optimization of expensive-to-evaluate black-box functions. Here, black–box indicates the absence of strong structural assumptions such as convexity and that the algorithm only has access to function evaluations, while expensive-to-evaluate indicates that the cost of evaluation warrants investing considerable effort to determine where to evaluate. These papers focus on settings with low-dimensional continuous action spaces, and with a Gaussian process prior over the objective function, reflecting the belief that “smoother” objective functions are more plausible than others. This approach is often called “Bayesian optimization” in the machine learning community [13]. Both Villemonteix et al. [70] and Hennig and Schuler [36] propose selecting each sample to maximize the mutual information between the next observation and the optimal solution. Several papers [37, 38, 39] have extended this line of work since an initial version of our paper appeared online. The numerical routines in these papers use approximations to mutual information, and may give insight into how to design efficient computational approximations to IDS.\nSeveral features distinguish our work from that of Villemonteix et al. [70] and Hennig and Schuler [36]. First, these papers focus on pure exploration problems: the objective is simply to learn about the optimal solution – not to attain high cumulative reward. Second, and more importantly, they focus only on problems with Gaussian process priors and continuous action spaces. For such problems, simpler approaches like UCB algorithms [67], probability of improvement [47], and expected improvement [51] are already extremely effective. As noted by Brochu et al. [13], each of these algorithms simply chooses points with “potentially high values of the objective function: whether because the prediction is high, the uncertainty is great, or both.” By contrast, a major motivation of our work is that a richer information measure is needed to address problems with more complicated information structures. Finally, we provide a variety of general theoretical guarantees for information-directed sampling, whereas Villemonteix et al. [70] and Hennig and Schuler [36] propose their algorithms as heuristics without guarantees. Section 9.1 shows that our theoretical guarantees extend to pure exploration problems.\nThe knowledge gradient (KG) algorithm uses a different measure of information to guide action selection: the algorithm computes the impact of a single observation on the quality of the decision made by a greedy algorithm, which simply selects the action with highest posterior expected reward. This measure was proposed by Mockus et al. [51] and studied further by Frazier et al. [29] and Ryzhov et al. [64]. KG seems natural since it explicitly seeks information that improves decision quality. Computational studies suggest that for problems with Gaussian priors, Gaussian rewards, and relatively short time horizons, KG performs very well. However, there are no general guarantees for KG, and even in some simple settings, it may not converge to optimality. In fact, it may select a suboptimal action in every period, even as the time horizon tends to infinity. IDS also measures the information provided by a single observation, but our results imply it converges to optimality.\nKG is discussed further in Subsection 4.3.3. Our work also connects to a much larger literature on Bayesian experimental design (see [20] for a review). Contal et al. [22] study problems with Gaussian process priors and a method that guides exploration using the mutual information between the objective function and the next observation. This work provides a regret bound, though, as the authors’ erratum indicates, the proof of the regret bound is incorrect. Recent work has demonstrated the effectiveness of greedy or myopic policies that always maximize a measure of the information gain from the next sample. Jedynak et al. [41] and Waeber et al. [71] consider problem settings in which this greedy policy is optimal. Another recent line of work [31, 32] shows that measures of information gain sometimes satisfy a decreasing returns property known as adaptive sub-modularity, implying the greedy policy is competitive with the optimal policy. Our algorithm also only considers the information gain due to the next sample, even though the goal is to acquire information over many periods. Our results establish that the manner in which IDS encourages information gain leads to an effective algorithm, even for the different objective of maximizing cumulative reward.\nFinally, our work connects to the literature on partial monitoring. First introduced by [54] the partial monitoring problem encompasses a broad range of online optimization problems with limited or partial feedback. Recent work [11] has focused on classifying the minimax-optimal scaling of regret in the problem’s time horizon as a function of the level of feedback the agent receives. That work focuses most attention on cases where the agent receives very restrictive feedback, and in particular, cannot observe the reward their action generates. Our work also allows the agent to observe rich forms of feedback in response to actions they select, but we focus on a more standard decision-theoretic framework in which the agent associates their observations with a reward as specified by a utility function.\nThe literature we have discussed primarily focuses on contexts where the goal is to converge on an optimal action in a manner that limits exploration costs. Such methods are not geared towards problems where time preference plays an important role. A notable exception is the KG algorithm, which takes a discount factor as input to account for time preference. Francetich and Kreps [26, 27] discuss a variety of heuristics for the discounted problem. Recent work [62] generalizes Thompson sampling to address discounted problems. We believe that IDS can also be extended to treat discounted problems, though we do not pursue that in this paper.\nThe regret bounds we will present build on our information-theoretic analysis of Thompson sampling [61], which can be used to bound the regret of any policy in terms of its information ratio. The information ratio of IDS is always smaller than that of TS, and therefore, bounds on the information ratio of TS provided in Russo and Van Roy [61] yield regret bounds for IDS. This observation and a preliminary version of our results was first presented in a conference paper [60]. Recent work by Bubeck et al. [18] and Bubeck and Eldan [16] build on ideas from [61] in another direction by bounding the information ratio when the reward function is convex and using that bound to study the order of regret in adversarial bandit convex optimization."

      "text" : "We consider a general probabilistic, or Bayesian, formulation in which uncertain quantities are modeled as random variables. The decision-maker sequentially chooses actions(At)t∈N from a finite action set A and observes the corresponding outcomes (Yt,At)t∈N. There is a random outcome Yt,a ∈ Y associated with each action a ∈ A and time t ∈ N. Let Yt ≡ (Yt,a)a∈A be the vector of outcomes at time t ∈ N. There is a random variable θ such that, conditioned on θ, (Yt)t∈N is an iid sequence. This can be thought of as a Bayesian formulation, where randomness in θ captures\nthe decision-maker’s prior uncertainty about the true nature of the system, and the remaining randomness in Yt captures idiosyncratic randomness in observed outcomes.\nThe agent associates a reward R(y) with each outcome y ∈ Y, where the reward function R : Y → R is fixed and known. Let Rt,a = R(Yt,a) denote the realized reward of action a at time t. Uncertainty about θ induces uncertainty about the true optimal action, which we denote by A∗ ∈ arg max\na∈A E [R1,a|θ]. The T–period regret of the sequence of actions A1, .., AT is the random\nvariable\nRegret(T ) := T∑ t=1 (Rt,A∗ −Rt,At) , (1)\nwhich measures the cumulative difference between the reward earned by an algorithm that always chooses the optimal action and actual accumulated reward up to time T . In this paper we study expected regret\nE [Regret(T )] = E [ T∑ t=1 (Rt,A∗ −Rt,At) ] , (2)\nwhere the expectation is taken over the randomness in the actions At and the outcomes Yt, and over the prior distribution over θ. This measure of performance is commonly called Bayesian regret or Bayes risk.\nThe action At is chosen based on the history of observations Ft = (A1, Y1,A1 , . . . , At−1, Yt−1,At−1) up to time t. Formally, a randomized policy π = (πt)t∈N is a sequence of deterministic functions, where πt(Ft) specifies a probability distribution over the action set A. Let D(A) denote the set of probability distributions over A. The action At is a selected by sampling independently from πt(Ft). With some abuse of notation, we will typically write this distribution as πt, where πt(a) = P(At = a|Ft) denotes the probability assigned to action a given the observed history. We explicitly display the dependence of regret on the policy π, letting E [Regret(T, π)] denote the expected value given by (2) when the actions (A1, .., AT ) are chosen according to π.\nFurther notation. Set αt(a) = P (A∗ = a|Ft) to be the posterior distribution of A∗. For two probability measures P and Q over a common measurable space, if P is absolutely continuous with respect to Q, the Kullback-Leibler divergence between P and Q is\nDKL(P ||Q) = ˆ log ( dP\ndQ\n) dP (3)\nwhere dPdQ is the Radon–Nikodym derivative of P with respect to Q. For a probability distribution P over a finite set X , the Shannon entropy of P is defined as H(P ) = − ∑ x∈X P (x) log (P (x)). The mutual information under the posterior distribution between two random variables X1 : Ω → X1, and X2 : Ω→ X2, denoted by\nIt(X1;X2) := DKL (P ((X1, X2) ∈ ·|Ft) || P (X1 ∈ ·|Ft)P (X2 ∈ ·|Ft)) , (4)\nis the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the joint posterior distribution of X1 and X2 and the product of the marginal distributions. Note that It(X1;X2) is a random variable because of its dependence on the conditional probability measure P (·|Ft).\nTo reduce notation, we define the information gain from an action a to be gt(a) := It(A∗;Yt,a). As shown for example in Lemma 5.5.6 of Gray [35], this is equal to the expected reduction in entropy of the posterior distribution of A∗ due to observing Yt(a):\ngt(a) = E [H(αt)−H(αt+1)|Ft, At = a] , (5)\nwhich plays a crucial role in our results. Let ∆t(a) := E [Rt,A∗ −Rt,a|Ft] denote the expected instantaneous regret of action a at time t.\nWe use overloaded notation for gt(·) and ∆t(·). For an action sampling distribution π ∈ D(A), gt(π) := ∑ a∈A π(a)gt(a) denotes the expected information gain when actions are selected according\nto π, and ∆t(π) = ∑ a∈A π(a)∆t(a) is defined analogously. Finally, we sometimes use the shorthand notation Et[·] = Et[·|Ft] for conditional expectations under the posterior distribution, and similarly write Pt(·) = P(·|Ft)."

      "heading" : "4.1 Motivation",
      "text" : "Our goal is to minimize expected regret over a time horizon T . This is achieved by a Bayes-optimal policy, which, in principle, can be computed via dynamic programming. Unfortunately, computing, or even storing, this Bayes-optimal policy is generally infeasible. For this reason, there has been significant interest in developing computationally efficient heuristics.\nAs with much of the literature, we are motivated by contexts where the time horizon T is “large.” For large T and moderate times t T , the mapping from belief state to action prescribed by the Bayes-optimal policy does not vary significantly from one time period to the next. As such, it is reasonable to restrict attention to stationary heuristic policies. IDS falls in this category.\nIDS is motivated largely by a desire to overcome shortcomings of currently popular design principles. In particular, it accounts for kinds of information that alternatives fail to adequately address:\n1. Indirect information. IDS can select an action to obtain useful feedback about other actions even if there will be no useful feedback about the selected action.\n2. Cumulating information. IDS can select an action to obtain feedback that does not immediately enable higher expected reward but can eventually do so when combined with feedback from subsequent actions.\n3. Irrelevant information. IDS avoids investments in acquiring information that will not help to determine which actions ought to be selected.\nExamples presented in Section 4.3 aim to contrast the manner in which IDS and alternative approaches treat these kinds of information.\nIt is worth noting that we refer to IDS as a design principle rather than an algorithm. The reason is that IDS does not specify steps to be carried out in terms of basic computational operations but only an abstract objective to be optimized. As we will discuss later, for many problem classes of interest, like the Bernoulli bandit, the Gaussian bandit, and the linear bandit, one can develop tractable algorithms that implement IDS. The situation is similar for upper confidence bounds, Thompson sampling, expected improvement maximization, and knowledge gradient; these are abstract design principles that lead to tractable algorithms for specific problem classes."

      "heading" : "4.2 Information-directed sampling",
      "text" : "IDS balances between obtaining low expected regret in the current period and acquiring new information about which action is optimal. It does this by minimizing over all action sampling distributions π ∈ D(A) the ratio between the square of expected regret ∆t(π)2 and information gain gt(π) about the optimal action A∗. In particular, the policy πIDS = ( πIDS1 , π IDS 2 , . . . ) is defined by:\nπIDSt ∈ arg min π∈D(A)\n{ Ψt (π) := ∆t(π)2\ngt(π)\n} . (6)\nWe call Ψt(π) the information ratio of an action sampling distribution π. It measures the squared regret incurred per-bit of information acquired about the optimum. IDS myopically minimizes this notion of cost-per-bit of information in each period.\nNote that IDS is stationary randomized policy: randomized in that each action is randomly sampled from a distribution and stationary in that this action distribution is determined by the posterior distribution of θ and otherwise independent of the time period. It is natural to wonder whether randomization plays a fundamental role or if a stationary deterministic policy can offer similar behavior. The following example sheds light on this matter. Example 1 (A known standard). Consider a problem with two actions A = {a1, a2}. Rewards from a1 are known to be distributed Bernoulli(1/2). The distribution of rewards from a2 is Bernoulli(3/4) with prior probability p0 and is Bernoulli(1/4) with prior probability 1− p0.\nConsider a stationary deterministic policy for this problem. With such a policy, each action At is a deterministic function of pt−1, the posterior probability conditioned on observations made through period t − 1. Suppose that for some p0 > 0, the policy selects A1 = a1. Since this is an uninformative action, pt = p0 and At = a1 for all t, and thus, expected regret grows linearly with time. If, on the other hand, A1 = a2 for all p0 > 0 then At = a2 for all t, which again results in expected regret that grows linearly with time. It follows that, for any deterministic stationary policy, there exists a prior probability p0 such that expected regret grows linearly with time.\nIn Section 5, we will establish a sub-linear bound on expected regret of IDS. The result implies that, when applied to the preceding example, the expected regret of IDS does not grow linearly as does that of any stationary deterministic policy. This suggests that randomization plays a fundamental role.\nIt may appear that the need for randomization introduces great complexity since the solution of the optimization problem (6) takes the form of a distribution over actions. However, an important property of this problem dramatically simplifies solutions. In particular, as we will establish in Section 6, there is always a distribution with support of at most two actions that attains the minimum in (6)."

      "heading" : "4.3.1 Upper confidence bounds and Thompson sampling",
      "text" : "Upper confidence bound (UCB) and Thompson sampling (TS) are two of the most popular principles for balancing between exploration and exploitation. As data is collected, both approaches do\nnot only estimate the rewards generated by different actions, but carefully track the uncertainty in their estimates. They then continue to experiment with all actions that could plausibly be optimal given the observed data. This guarantees actions are not prematurely discarded, but, in contrast to more naive approaches likes the -greedy algorithm, also ensures that samples are not wasted on clearly suboptimal actions.\nWith a UCB algorithm, actions are selected through two steps. First, for each action a ∈ A an upper confidence bound Bt(a) is constructed. Then, the algorithm selects an action At ∈ arg maxa∈ABt(a) with maximal upper confidence bound. The upper confidence bound Bt(a) represents the greatest mean reward value that is statistically plausible. In particular, Bt(a) is typically constructed to be optimistic (Bt(a) ≥ E[Rt,a|θ]) and asymptotically consistent (Bt(a)→ E [Rt,a|θ] as data about the action a accumulates).\nA TS algorithm simply samples each actions according to the posterior probability that it is optimal. In particular, at each time t, an action is sampled from πTSt = αt. This means that for each a ∈ A, P(At = a|Ft) = P(A∗ = a|Ft) = αt(a). This algorithm is sometimes called probability matching because the action selection distribution is matched to the posterior distribution of the optimal action.\nFor some problem classes, UCB and TS lead to efficient and empirically effective algorithms with strong theoretical guarantees. Specific UCB and TS algorithms are known to be asymptotically efficient for multi-armed bandit problems with independent arms [5, 19, 44, 48, 49] and satisfy strong regret bounds for some problems with dependent arms [17, 24, 25, 33, 56, 59, 67].\nUnfortunately, as the following examples demonstrate, UCB and TS do not pursue indirect information and because of that can perform very poorly relative to IDS for some natural problem classes. A common feature of UCB and TS that leads to poor performance in these examples is that they restrict attention to sampling actions that have some chance of being optimal. This is the case with TS because each action is selected according to the probability that it is optimal. With UCB, the upper-confidence-bound of an action known to be suboptimal will always be dominated by others.\nOur first example is somewhat contrived but designed to make the point transparent.\nExample 2. (a revealing action) Let A = {0, 1, . . . ,K} consist of K+1 actions and suppose that θ is drawn uniformly at random from a finite set Θ = {1, . . . ,K} of K possible values. Consider a problem with bandit-feedback Yt,a = Rt,a. Under θ, the reward of action a is\nRt,a =  1 θ = a 0 θ 6= a, a 6= 0 1 2θ a = 0.\nNote that action 0 is known to never yield the maximal reward, and is therefore never selected by TS or UCB. Instead, these algorithms will select among actions {1, . . . ,K}, ruling out only a single action at a time until a reward 1 is earned and the optimal action is identified. Their expected regret therefore grows linearly in K. IDS is able to recognize that much more is learned by drawing action 0 than by selecting one of the other actions. In fact, selecting action 0 immediately identifies the optimal action. IDS selects this action, learns which action is optimal, and selects that action in all future periods. Its regret is independent of K.\nOur second example may be of greater practical significance. It represents the simplest case of a sparse linear model.\nExample 3. (sparse linear model) Consider a linear bandit problem where A ⊂ Rd and the reward from an action a ∈ A is aT θ∗. The true parameter θ is known to be drawn uniformly at\nrandom from the set of 1-sparse vectors Θ = {θ′ ∈ {0, 1}d : ‖θ′‖0 = 1}. For simplicity, assume d = 2m for some m ∈ N. The action set is taken to be the set of vectors in {0, 1}d normalized to be a unit vector in the L1 norm: A = { x ‖x‖1 : x ∈ {0, 1} d, x 6= 0 } .\nFor this problem, when an action a is selected and y = aT θ ∈ {0, 1/‖a‖0} is observed, each θ′ ∈ Θ with aT θ′ 6= y is ruled out. Let Θt denote the set of all parameters in Θ that are consistent with the rewards observed up to time t and let It = {i ∈ {1, . . . , d} : θ′i = 1, θ′ ∈ Θt} denote the corresponding set of possible positive components.\nNote that A∗ = θ. That is, if θ were known, choosing the action θ would yield the highest possible reward. TS and UCB algorithms only choose actions from the support of A∗ and therefore will only sample actions a ∈ A that, like A∗, have only a single positive component. Unless that is also the positive component of θ, the algorithm will observe a reward of zero and rule out only one element of It. In the worst case, the algorithm requires d samples to identify the optimal action.\nNow, consider an application of IDS to this problem. The algorithm essentially performs binary search: it selects a ∈ A with ai > 0 for half of the components i ∈ It and ai = 0 for the other half as well as for any i /∈ It. After just log2(d) time steps the true value of the parameter vector θ is identified.\nTo see why this is the case, first note that all parameters in Θt are equally likely and hence the expected reward of an action a is 1|It| ∑ i∈It ai. Since ai ≥ 0 and ∑ i ai = 1 for each a ∈ A, every action whose positive components are in It yields the highest possible expected reward of 1/|It|. Therefore, binary search minimizes expected regret in period t for this problem. At the same time, binary search is assured to rule out half of the parameter vectors in Θt at each time t. This is the largest possible expected reduction, and also leads to the largest possible information gain about A∗. Since binary search both minimizes expected regret in period t and uniquely maximizes expected information gain in period t, it is the sampling strategy followed by IDS.\nIn this setting we can explicitly calculate the information ratio of each policy, and the difference between them highlights the advantages of information-directed sampling. We have\nΨ1(πTS1 ) = (d− 1)2/d2\nlog(d) d + d−1 d log ( d d−1 ) ∼ dlog(d) Ψ1(πIDS1 ) = 1log(2) ( 1− 1 d )2 ∼ 1log(2)\nwhere h(d) ∼ f(d) if h(d)/f(d) → 1 as d → ∞. When the dimension d is large, Ψ1(πIDS1 ) is much smaller.\nOur final example involves an assortment optimization problem. Example 4. (assortment optimization) Consider the problem of repeatedly recommending an assortment of products to a customer. The customer has unknown type θ ∈ Θ where |Θ| = n. Each product is geared toward customers of a particular type, and the assortment a ∈ A = Θm of m products offered is characterized by the vector of product types a = (a1, . . . , am). We model customer responses through a random utility model in which customers are more likely to derive high value from a product geared toward their type. When offered an assortment of products a, the customer associates with the ith product utility U (t)θ,i (a) = β1{ai=θ} + W (t) i , where W ti follows an extreme–value distribution and β ∈ R is a known constant. This is a standard multinomial logit discrete choice model. The probability a customer of type θ chooses product i is given by\nexp{β1{ai=θ}}∑m j=1 exp{β1{aj=θ}} .\nWhen an assortment a is offered at time t, the customer makes a choice It = arg maxi U (t)θi (a) and leaves a review U (t)θIt(a) indicating the utility derived from the product, both of which are observed by\nthe recommendation system. The reward to the recommendation system is the normalized utility of the customer U (t)θIt(a)/β.\nIf the type θ of the customer were known, then the optimal recommendation would be A∗ = (θ, θ, . . . , θ), which consists only of products targeted at the customer’s type. Therefore, both TS and UCB would only offer assortments consisting of a single type of product. Because of this, TS and UCB each require order n samples to learn the customer’s true type. IDS will instead offer a diverse assortment of products to the customer, allowing it to learn much more quickly.\nTo render issues more transparent, suppose that θ is drawn uniformly at random from Θ and consider the behavior of each type of algorithm in the limiting case where β →∞. In this regime, the probability a customer chooses a product of type θ if it is available tends to 1, and the normalized review β−1U (t)θIt(a) tends to 1{aIt=θ}, an indicator for whether the chosen product is of type θ. The initial assortment offered by IDS will consist of m different and previously untested product types. Such an assortment maximizes both the algorithm’s expected reward in the next period and the algorithm’s information gain, since it has the highest probability of containing a product of type θ. The customer’s response almost perfectly indicates whether one of those items was of type θ. The algorithm continues offering assortments containing m unique, untested, product types until a review near U (t)θIt(a) ≈ 1 is received. With extremely high probability, this takes at most dn/me time periods. By diversifying the m products in the assortment, the algorithm learns a factor of m times faster.\nAs in the previous example, we can explicitly calculate the information ratio of each policy, and the difference between them highlights the advantages of IDS. The information ratio of IDS is more than m times smaller:\nΨ1(πTS1 ) =\n( 1− 1n )2 1 n log(n) + n−1 n log ( n n−1 ) ∼ nlog(n) Ψ1(πIDS1 ) = ( 1− mn )2 m n log( n m) + n−m n log ( n n−m ) ≤ n m log( nm) ."

      "text" : "Another natural information-directed algorithm aims to maximize the information acquired about the uncertain model parameter θ. In particular, consider an algorithm that selects the action at time t that maximizes the weighted combination of the expected reward the action generates and the information it generates about the uncertain model parameter θ: Et[Rt,a] + λIt(Yt,a; θ). Throughout this section we will refer to this algorithm as θ-IDS. While such an algorithm can perform well on particular examples, the next example highlights that it may invest in acquiring information about θ that is irrelevant to the decision problem.\nExample 5. (unconstrained assortment optimization) Consider again the problem of repeatedly recommending assortments of products to a customer with unknown preferences. The recommendation system can choose any subset of products a ⊂ {1, .., n} to display. When offered assortment a at time t, the customer chooses the item Jt = arg maxi∈a θi and leaves the review Rt,a = θJt where θi is the utility associated with product i. The recommendation system observes both Jt and the review Rt,a, and has the goal of learning to offer the assortment that yields the best outcome for the customer and maximizes the review Rt,a. Suppose that θ is drawn as a uniformly random permutation of the vector (1, 12 , 1 3 , . . . , 1 n). The customer is known to assign utility 1 to her most preferred item, 1/2 to the next best item, 1/3 to the third best, and so on, but the rank ordering is unknown.\nIn this example, no learning is required to offer an optimal assortment: since there is no constraint on the size of the assortment, it’s always best to offer the full collection of products a = {1, . . . , n} and allow the customer to choose the most preferred. Offering this assortment reveals which item is most preferred by the customer, but it reveals nothing about her preferences about others. When applied to this problem, θ-IDS begins by offering the full assortment A1 = {1, . . . , n}, which yields a reward of 1, and, by revealing the top item, yields information of I1(Y1,A1 ; θ) = log(n). But, if 1/2 < λ log(n − 1), which is guaranteed for sufficiently large n, it continues experimenting with suboptimal assortments. In the second period, it will offer the assortment A2 consisting of all products except arg maxi θi. Playing this assortment reveals the customer’s second most preferred item, and yields information gain I2(Y2,A2 ; θ) = log(n − 1). This process continues until the first period k where λ log(n+ 1− k) < 1− 1/k.\nIn order to learn to offer effective assortments, θ-IDS tries to learn as much as possible about the customer’s preferences. In doing this, the algorithm inadvertently invests experimentation effort in information that is irrelevant to choosing an optimal assortment. On the other hand, IDS recognizes that the optimal assortment A∗ = {1, . . . , n} does not depend on full knowledge of the vector θ, and therefore does not invest in identifying θ.\nAs shown in Section 9.2, our analysis can be adapted to provide regret bounds in for a version of IDS that uses information gain with respect to θ, rather than with respect to A∗. These regret bounds depends on the entropy of θ, whereas the bound for IDS depends on the entropy of A∗, which can be much smaller."

      "heading" : "4.3.3 Expected improvement and the knowledge gradient",
      "text" : "We now consider two algorithms which measure the quality of the best decision that can be made based on current information, and encourage gathering observations that are expected to immediately increase this measure. The first is the expected improvement algorithm, which is one of the most widely used techniques in the active field of Bayesian optimization (see [13]). Define µt,a = E[Rt,a|Ft] to be the expected reward generated by a under the posterior, and Vt = maxa′ µt,a′ to be the best objective value attainable given current information. The expected improvement of action a is defined to be E[max{fθ(a), Vt}|Ft], where fθ(a) = E[Rt,a|θ] is the expected reward generated by action a under the unknown true parameter θ. The EGO algorithm aims to identify high performing actions by sequentially sampling those that yield the highest expected improvement. Similar to UCB algorithms, this encourages the selection of actions that could potentially offer great performance. Unfortunately, like these UCB algorithms, this measure of improvement does not place value on indirect information: it won’t select an action that provides useful feedback about other actions unless the mean-reward of that action might exceed Vt. For example, the expected improvement algorithm cannot treat the problem described in Example 2 in a satisfactory manner.\nThe knowledge gradient algorithm [64] uses a modified improvement measure. At time t, it computes vKGt,a := E [Vt+1|Ft, At = a]− Vt for each action a. If Vt measures the quality of the decision that can be made based on current information, then vKGt,a captures the immediate improvement in decision quality due to sampling action a and observing Yt,a. For a problem with time horizon T , the knowledge gradient (KG) policy selects an action in time period t by maximizing µt,a + (T − t)vKGt,a over actions a ∈ A.\nUnlike expected-improvement, the measure vKGt,a of the value of sampling an action places value on indirect information. In particular, even if an action is known to yield low expected reward,\nsampling that action could lead to a significant increase in Vt by providing information about other actions. Unfortunately, there are no general guarantees for KG, and it sometimes struggles with cumulating information; individual observations that provide information about A∗ may not be immediately useful for making decisions in the next period, and therefore may lead to no improvement in Vt.\nExample 1 provides one simple illustration of this phenomenon. In that example, action 1 is known to yield a mean reward of 1/2. When p0 ≤ 1/4, upon sampling action 2 and observing a reward 1, the posterior expected reward of action 2 becomes\nE[R2,a2 |R1,a2 = 1] = p0(3/4)\np0(3/4) + (1− p0)(1/4) ≤ 1/2.\nIn particular, a single sample could never be influential enough to change which action has the highest posterior expected reward. Therefore, vKGt,a2 = 0, and the KG decision rule selects action 1 in the first period. Since nothing is learned from the resulting observation, it will continue selecting action 1 in all subsequent periods. Even as the time horizon T tends to infinity, the KG policy would never select action 2. Its cumulative regret over T time periods is equal to (p0/4)T , which grows linearly with T .\nIn this example, although sampling action 2 will not immediately shift the decision-maker’s prediction of the best action (arg maxa E[θa|F1]), these samples influences her posterior beliefs and reduce uncertainty about which action is optimal. As a result, IDS will always assign positive probability to sampling the second action. More broadly, IDS places value on information that is pertinent to the decision problem, even if that information won’t directly improve performance on its own. This is useful when one must combine multiple pieces of information in order to effectively learn.\nTo address problems like Example 1, Frazier and Powell [28] propose KG* – a modified form of KG that considers the value of sampling a single action many times. This helps to address some cases – those where a single sample of an action provides no value even though sampling the action several times could be quite valuable – but this modification may not adequately assess information gain in more general problems. KG* may explore very inefficiently, for instance, in the sparse linear bandit problem considered in Example 3. However, the performance of KG* on this problem depends critically on how ties are broken among actions maximizing µt,a+ (T − t)vKGt,a . To avoid such ambiguity, we instead consider the following modification to Example 3.\nExample 6. (sparse linear model with an outside option) Consider a modification to Example 3 in which the agent has access to a outside option that generates known, but suboptimal, rewards. The action set is A = {O}∪A′, where the outside option O is know to always yield reward 1/2, and A′ = { x ‖x‖1 : x ∈ {0, 1} d, x 6= 0 } is the action space considered in Example 3. As before, the reward generated by action a ∈ A′ is aT θ where θ is drawn uniformly at random from the set of 1-sparse vectors Θ = {θ′ ∈ {0, 1}d : ‖θ′‖0 = 1}. As before, assume for simplicity that d = 2m for some m ∈ N.\nWhen the horizon T is long, the inclusion of the outside option should be irrelevant. Indeed, nothing is learned by sampling the outside option, and it is known apriori to be suboptimal: it generates a reward of 1/2 whereas the optimal action generates a reward of 1 = maxa∈A′ aT θ. An optimal algorithm for Example 6 should sample actions in A′ until the optimal action is identified and should do so in a manner that minimizes the expected regret incurred.\nNote that in the absence of observation noise, KG and KG* are equivalent, and so we will not distinguish between these two algorithms. We will see that when T is large, KG always samples\nactions in A′ until the optimal action is identified. However, the expected number of samples required, and the expected regret incurred, both scale linearly with the dimension d. IDS, on the other hand, identifies the optimal action after only log2(d) steps.\nTo see why, note that unless the agent has exactly identified the parameter θ, selecting the outside option will always generate the highest expected reward in the next period. Only selecting an action with a single positive component could immediately reveal θ, so in response KG only places value on the information generated by such actions. When the horizon is large, KG prioritizes such information over the safe reward offered by the outside option. It therefore engages in exhaustive search, sequentially checking each component i ∈ {1, . . . , d} of θ until θi = 1 is observed.\nTo show this more precisely, let us reintroduce some notation used in Example 3. As before, when an action a ∈ A′ is selected and y = aT θ ∈ {0, 1/‖a‖0} is observed, each θ′ ∈ Θ with aT θ′ 6= y is ruled out. Let Θt denote the set of all parameters in Θ that are consistent with the rewards observed up to time t and let It = {i ∈ {1, . . . , d} : θ′i = 1, θ′ ∈ Θt} denote the corresponding set of possible positive components.\nThe best reward value attainable given current information is\nVt = max {\n1/2, max a∈A′\nE[θTa|Ft] } = max {\n1/2, 1 |Θt|\n} .\nTherefore, Vt = 1/2 whenever |Θt| > 1. For remaining indices i ∈ It, selecting the standard basis vector ei and observing θT ei = 1 establishes that θ = ei. As a result, vKGt,ei = (1/2)P(e T i θ = 1|Ft) =\n1 2|Θt| > 0. For other actions, observing a T θ ∈ {0, 1/‖a‖0} is not sufficient to identify θ, and so vKGt,a = 0. When the horizon T is large, KG always select one of the actions with vKGt,a > 0, and so the algorithm selects only standard basis vectors until θ is revealed\nIDS, on the other hand, essentially performs binary search. In the first period, it selects some permutation of the action a = (2/d, ..., 2/d, 0, ..., 0). By observing either aT θ = 0 or aT θ = 1, it rules out half the parameter vectors in Θ1. Continuing this binary search process, the parameter is identified using O(log2(d)) steps.\nTo see why this is the case, let us focus on the first period. As in Example 3, selecting an action with d/2 positive components, like a = (2/d, ..., 2/d, 0, ..., 0), offers strictly maximal information gain I1(A∗; aT θ) = log(2) and weakly maximal reward E[aT θ] = 1/d among all actions a ∈ A′. As a result, any action in A′ that is not a permutation of a is strictly dominated and is never sampled by IDS. It turns out that IDS also has zero probability of selecting the outside option in this case. Indeed, IDS selects O with probability 1 − α∗, where α∗ can be attained as the minimizer of the information ratio\nα∗ = arg min α∈[0,1]\n((1− α)/2 + α(1− 1/d))2\nα log2(d) = arg min α∈[0,1] 1 2 √ α + √ α (1 2 − 1 d ) = 1.\nThis process continues inductively. Another step of binary search again rules out half the components in |Θ1|, leading to an information gain of log(2) bits. The regret incurred is even lower–now only (1− 2/d) –and hence the algorithm again has zero probability of selecting the outside option. Iterating this process, the true positive component of θ is identified after log2(d) steps."

The entropy of the optimal action distribution H(α1) captures the magnitude of the decision-maker’s initial uncertainty about which action is optimal.

      "text" : "We now establish upper bounds on the information ratio of IDS in several important settings, which yields explicit regret bounds when combined with Corollary 1. These bounds show that, in any period, the algorithm’s expected regret can only be large if it is expected to acquire a lot of information about which action is optimal. In this sense, it effectively balances between exploration and exploitation in every period. For each problem setting, we will compare our upper bounds on expected regret with known lower bounds.\nThe bounds on the information ratio also help to clarify the role it plays in our results: it roughly captures the extent to which sampling some actions allows the decision maker to make inferences about other actions. In the worst case, the ratio depends on the number of actions, reflecting the fact that actions could provide no information about others. For problems with full information, the information ratio is bounded by a numerical constant, reflecting that sampling one action perfectly reveals the rewards that would have been earned by selecting any other action. The problems of online linear optimization under “bandit feedback” and under “semi-bandit feedback” lie between these two extremes, and the ratio provides a natural measure of each problem’s\ninformation structure. In each case, our bounds reflect that IDS is able to automatically exploit this structure.\nThe proofs of these bounds follow from our recent analysis of Thompson sampling, and the implied regret bounds are the same as those established for Thompson sampling. In particular, since Ψt(πIDSt ) ≤ Ψt(πTSt ) where πTS is the Thompson sampling policy, it is enough to bound Ψt(πTSt ). Several bounds on the information-ratio of TS were provided by Russo and Van Roy [61], and we defer to that paper for the proofs. While the analysis is similar in the cases considered here, IDS outperforms Thompson sampling in simulation, and, as we highlighted in the previous section, is sometimes provably much more informationally efficient.\nIn addition to the bounds stated here, recent work by Bubeck et al. [18] and Bubeck and Eldan [16] bounds the information ratio when the reward function is convex, and uses this to study the order of regret in adversarial bandit convex optimization. This points to a broader potential of using information-ratio analysis to study the information-complexity of general online optimization problems.\nTo simplify the exposition, our results are stated under the assumption that rewards are uniformly bounded. This effectively controls the worst-case variance of the reward distribution, and as shown in the appendix of Russo and Van Roy [61], our results can be extended to the case where reward distributions are sub-Gaussian.\nAssumption 1. sup y∈Y R(y)− inf y∈Y R(y) ≤ 1."

(7)\nThat is, the mutual information between A∗ and Yt,a is the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between the posterior predictive distribution Pt(Yt,a = ·) and the predictive distribution conditioned on the identity of the optimal action Pt(Yt,a = ·|A∗ = a∗). For our beta-Bernoulli model, the information gain ~ga is the expected Kullback-Leibler divergence between a Bernoulli distribution with mean Ma|A∗ and the posterior distribution at action a, which is Bernoulli with parameter β1t,a/(β1t,a + β2t,a).\nAlgorithm 2, as we have presented it, is somewhat abstract and can not readily be implemented on a computer. In particular, lines 1-4 require computing and storing functions of a continuous variable and several lines require integration of continuous functions. However, near-exact approximations can be efficiently generated by evaluating integrands at discrete grid of points {x1, . . . , xn} ⊂ [0, 1]. The values of fa(x), Fa(x), Ga(x) and F (x) can be computed and stored for each value in this grid. The compute time can also be reduced via memoization, since values change only for one action per time period. The compute time of such an implementation scales with K2n where K is the number of actions and n is the number of points used in the discretization of [0, 1]. The bottleneck is Line 7.\n2Some details related to the derivation of this fact when Yt,a is a general random variable can be found in the appendix of Russo and Van Roy [61].\nAlgorithm 2 betaBernoulliIR(K,β1, β2) 1: fa(x)← beta.pdf(x|β1a, β2a) ∀a, x 2: Fa(x)← beta.cdf(x|β1a, β2a) ∀a, x 3: F (x)← ∏ a Fa(x) ∀x\n4: Ga(x)← ´ x\n0 yfa(y)dy ∀a, x 5: p∗(a)← ´ 1 0 [ fa(x) Fa(x) ] F (x)dx ∀a\n6: Ma|a ← 1p∗(a) ´ 1 0 [ xfa(x) Fa(x) ] F (x)dx ∀a 7: Ma′|a ← 1p∗(a) ´ 1 0 [ fa(x)F (x) Fa(x)Fa′ (x) ] Ga′(x)dx ∀a, a′ 6= a\n8: ρ∗ ← ∑ a p ∗(a)Ma|a 9: ~∆a ← ρ∗ − β 1 a\nβ1a+β2a ∀a 10: ~ga ← ∑ a′ p ∗(a′) ( Ma|a′ log ( Ma|a′(β1a + β2a)/β1a ) + (1−Ma|a′) log ( (1−Ma|a′)(β1a + β2a)/β2a )) ∀a\n11: return ~∆, ~g"

      "text" : "Though reasonably efficient algorithms can be devised to implement IDS for various problem classes, some applications, such as those arising in high-throughput web services, call for extremely fast computation. As such, it is worth considering approximations to the information ratio that retain salient features while enabling faster computation. In this section, we discuss some useful approximation concepts.\nThe dominant source of complexity in computing ~∆ and ~g is in the calculation of requisite integrals, which can require integration over high-dimensional spaces. One approach to addressing this challenge is to replace integrals with sample-based estimates. Algorithm 4 does this. In addition to the number of actions K and routines for evaluation q and R, the algorithm takes as input M representative samples of θ. In the simplest use scenario, these would be independent samples drawn from the posterior distribution. The steps correspond to those of Algorithm 1, but with the set of possible models approximated by the set of representative samples. For many problems, even when exact computation of ~∆ and ~g is intractable due to required integration over high-dimensional spaces, Algorithm 1 can generate close approximations from a moderate number of samples M .\nAlgorithm 4 SampleIR(K, q,R,M, θ1, . . . , θM )\n1: Θ̂a ← {m|a = arg maxa′ ∑ y qθm,a′(y)R(y)} 2: p̂(a∗)← |Θ̂a∗ |/M ∀a∗ 3: p̂a(y)← ∑ m qa,θm(y)/M ∀y\n4: p̂a(a∗, y)← ∑ m∈Θa qa,θm(y)/M ∀a ∗, y\n5: R̂∗ ← ∑ a,y p̂a(a, y)R(y)\n6: ~ga ← ∑ a∗,y p̂a(a∗, y) log p̂a(a∗,y) p̂(a∗)p̂a(y) ∀a\n7: ~∆a ← R∗ −M−1 ∑ m ∑ y qθm,a(y)R(y) ∀a 8: return ~∆, ~g\nThe information ratio is designed to effectively address indirect information, cumulating information, and irrelevant information, for a very broad class of learning problems. It can sometimes be helpful to replace the information ratio with alternative information measures that adequately address these issues for more specialized classes of problems. As an example, we will introduce the variance-based information ratio, which is suitable for some problems with bandit feedback, satisfies our regret bounds for such problems, and can facilitate design of more efficient numerical methods.\nTo motivate the variance-based information ratio, note that when rewards our bounded, with\nR(y) ∈ [0, 1] for all y, our information measure term is lower-bounded according to\ngt(a) = It(A∗;Yt,a) = ∑ a∗∈A Pt(A∗ = a∗)DKL (Pt(Yt,a = ·|A∗ = a∗) ||Pt(Yt,a = ·))\n≥ ∑ a∗∈A Pt(A∗ = a∗)DKL (Pt(Rt,a = ·|A∗ = a∗) ||Pt(Rt,a = ·))\n(a) ≥ 2 ∑ a∗∈A Pt(A∗ = a∗)(Et[Rt,a|A∗ = a∗]− Et[Rt,a])2 = 2Et[(Et[Rt,a|A∗]− Et[Rt,a])2] = 2Vart(Et[Rt,a|A∗]),\nwhere Vart(X) = Et[(X − Et[X])2] denotes the variance of X under the posterior distribution. Inequality (a) is a simple corollary of Pinsker’s inequality, and is given as Fact 9 in Russo and Van Roy [61]. Let vt(a) := Vart(Et[Rt,a|A∗]), which represents the variance of the conditional expectation Et[Rt,a|A∗] under the posterior distribution. This measures how much the expected reward generated by action a varies depending on the identity of the optimal action A∗. The above lower bound on mutual information indicates that actions with high variance vt(a) must yield substantial information about which action is optimal. It is natural to consider an approximation to IDS that uses a variance-based information ratio:\nmin π∈SK\n( π>~∆ )2 π>~v ,\nwhere ~va = vt(a). While variance-based IDS will not minimize the information ratio, the next proposition establishes that it satisfies the bounds on the information ratio given by Propositions 2 and 4.\nProposition 7. Suppose supy R(y)− infy R(y) ≤ 1 and\nπt ∈ arg min π∈SK\n∆t(π)2\nvt(π) .\nThen Ψt(πt) ≤ |A|/2. Moreover, if A ⊂ Rd, Θ ⊂ Rd, and E [Rt,a|θ] = aT θ for each action a ∈ A, then Ψt(πt) ≤ d/2.\nWe now consider a couple examples that illustrate computation of ~v and benefits of using this approximation. Our first example is the independent Gaussian bandit problem.\nExample 9. (independent Gaussian bandit) Consider a multi-armed bandit problem with A = {1, . . . ,K}, Y = R, and R(y) = y. Model parameters θ ∈ RK specify the mean reward θa of each action a. Components of θ are independent and Gaussian-distributed, with prior means µ1 ∈ RK and covariances σ21 ∈ RK . When an action At is applied, the observation Yt is drawn independently from N(θAt , η2).\nThe posterior distribution of θ is Gaussian, with independent components. Parameters can be\ncomputed recursively according to\nµt+1,a ←  ( µt,a σ2t,a + Yt,a η2 ) / ( 1 σ2t,a + 1 η2 ) if At = a\nµt,a otherwise.\nσt+1,a ←  ( 1 σ2t,a + 1 η2 )−1 if At = a\nσt,a otherwise.\nGiven arguments (K,µt, σt), Algorithm 5 computes ~∆ and ~v for the independent Gaussian bandit problem. Note that this algorithm is very similar to Algorithm 2, which was designed for the beta-Bernoulli bandit. One difference is that Algorithm 5 computes the variance-based information measure. In addition, the Gaussian distribution exhibits special structure that simplifies the computation of Ma′|a := Et [θa′ |θa = maxa′′ θa′′ ] . In particular, the computation of Ma′|a uses the following closed form expression for the expected value of a truncated Gaussian distribution with mean µ̃ and variance σ̃2:\nE [X|X ≤ x] = µ̃− σ̃φ ( x− µ̃ σ̃ ) /Φ ( x− µ̃ σ̃ ) = µ̃− σ̃2f(x)/F (x),\nwhere X ∼ N(µ̃, σ̃2) and f and F are the probability density and cumulative distribution functions. The analogous calculation that would be required to compute the standard information ratio is more complex.\nAlgorithm 5 independentGaussianVIR(K,µ, σ) 1: fa(x)← Gaussian.pdf(x|µa, σ2a) ∀a, x 2: Fa(x)← Gaussian.cdf(x|µa, σ2a) ∀a, x 3: F (x)← ∏ a Fa(x) ∀x\n4: p∗(a)← ´ 1\n0 [ fa(x) Fa(x) ] F (x)dx ∀a\n5: Ma|a ← 1p∗(a) ´∞ −∞ [ xfa(x) Fa(x) ] F (x)dx ∀a 6: Ma′|a ← µa′ − σ2 a′ p∗(a) ´∞ −∞ [ fa(x)fa′ (x) Fa(x)Fa′ (x) ] F (x)dx ∀a, a′ 6= a\n7: ρ∗ ← ∑ a p ∗(a)Ma|a 8: ∆a ← ρ∗ − µa ∀a 9: va ← ∑ a′ p ∗(a′) ( Ma|a′ − µa )2 ∀a\n10: return ~∆, ~v\nWe next consider the linear bandit problem.\nExample 10. (linear bandit) Consider a multi-armed bandit problem with A = {1, . . . ,K}, Y = R, and R(y) = y. Model parameters θ ∈ RK are drawn from a Gaussian prior with mean µ1 and covariance matrix Σ1. There is a known matrix Φ = [Φ1, · · · ,ΦK ] ∈ Rd×K such that, when an action At is applied, the observation Yt,At is drawn independently from N(ΦAtθ, η2), where ΦAt denotes the Atth column of Φ.\nThe posterior distribution of θ is Gaussian and can be computed recursively:\nµt+1 = (Σ−1t + ΦAtΦ>At/η 2)−1(Σ−1t µt + Yt,AtΦAt/η2)\nΣt+1 = (Σ−1t + ΦAtΦ>At/η 2)−1.\nWe will develop an algorithm that leverages the fact that, for the linear bandit, vt(a) takes on a particularly simple form:\nvt(a) = Vart(Et[Rt,a|A∗]) = Vart(Et[Φ>a θ|A∗]) = Vart(Φ>a Et[θ|A∗]) = Φ>a Et[(µA ∗ t − µt)(µA ∗ t − µt)>]Φa\n= Φ>a LtΦa,\nwhere µat = Et[θ|A∗ = a] and Lt = Et[(µA ∗ t −µt)(µA ∗ t −µt)>]. Algorithm 6 presents a sample-based approach to computing ~∆ and ~v. In addition to model dimensions K and d and the problem data matrix Φ, the algorithm takes as input M representative values of θ, which in the simplest use scenario, would be independent samples drawn from the posterior distribution N(µt,Σt). The algorithm approximates posterior means µt and µat as well as Lt by averaging suitable expressions over these samples. Due to the quadratic structure of vt(a), these calculations are substantially simpler than those that would be carried out by Algorithm 4, specialized to this context.\nAlgorithm 6 linearSampleVIR(K, d,M, θ1, . . . , θM ) 1: µ̂← ∑ m θ\nm/M 2: Θ̂a ← {m : (Φ>θm)a = maxa′(Φθm)a′} ∀a 3: p̂∗(a)← |Θ̂a|/M ∀a 4: µ̂a ← ∑ θ∈Θ̂a θ/|Θ̂a| ∀a\n5: L̂← ∑ a p̂ ∗(a) (µ̂a − µ̂) (µ̂a − µ̂)>\n6: ρ∗ ← ∑ a p̂ ∗(a)Φ>a µ̂a 7: ~va ← Φ>a L̂Φ>a ∀a 8: ~∆a ← ρ∗ − Φ>a µ̂ ∀a 9: return ~∆, ~v\nIt is interesting to note that Algorithms 4 and 6 do not rely on any special structure in the posterior distribution. Indeed, these algorithms should prove effective regardless of the form taken by the posterior. This points to a broader opportunity to use IDS or approximations to address complex models for which posteriors can not be efficiently computed or even stored, but for which it is possible to generate posterior samples via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We leave this as a future research opportunity."

In this section, we focus instead on simpler settings where current approaches are extremely effective. We find that even for these simple and widely studied settings, information-directed sampling displays state-of-the-art performance. For each experiment, the algorithm used to implement IDS is presented in the previous section.\nIDS, Thompson sampling (TS), and some UCB algorithms, do not take the horizon T as input, and are instead designed to work well for all sufficiently long horizons. Other algorithms we simulate were optimized for the particular horizon of the simulation trial. The KG and KG* algorithms in particular, treat the simulation horizon as known, and explore less aggressively in later periods. We have tried to clearly delineate which algorithms are optimized for simulation horizon.

      "text" : "Our first experiment involves a multi-armed bandit problem with independent arms and binary rewards. The mean reward of each arm is drawn from Beta(1, 1), which is the uniform distribution, and the means of separate arms are independent. Figure 1a and Table 1 present the results of 1000 independent trials of an experiment with 10 arms and a time horizon of 1000. We compared the performance of IDS to that of six other algorithms, and found that it had the lowest average regret of 18.0.\nThe UCB1 algorithm of Auer et al. [9] selects the action a which maximizes the upper confidence bound θ̂t(a)+ √ 2 log(t)/Nt(a) where θ̂t(a) is the empirical average reward from samples of action a and Nt(a) is the number of samples of action a up to time t. The average regret of this algorithm is 130.7, which is dramatically larger than that of IDS. For this reason UCB1 is omitted from Figure 1a.\nThe confidence bounds of UCB1 are constructed to facilitate theoretical analysis. For practical performance Auer et al. [9] proposed using an algorithm called UCB-Tuned. This algorithm selects the action a which maximizes the upper confidence bound θ̂t(a) + √ min{1/4 , V t(a)} log(t)/Nt(a), where V t(a) is an upper bound on the variance of the reward distribution at action a. While this method dramatically outperforms UCB1, it is still outperformed by IDS. The MOSS algorithm of Audibert and Bubeck [7] is similar to UCB1 and UCB–Tuned, but uses slightly different confidence bounds. It is known to satisfy regret bounds for this problem that are minimax optimal up to a numerical constant factor.\nIn previous numerical experiments [21, 43, 44, 66], Thompson sampling and Bayes UCB exhibited state-of-the-art performance for this problem. Each also satisfies strong theoretical guarantees, and is known to be asymptotically optimal in the sense defined by Lai and Robbins [49]. Unsurprisingly, they are the closest competitors to IDS. The Bayes UCB algorithm, studied in kaufmann et al. [43], constructs upper confidence bounds based on the quantiles of the posterior distribution: at time step t the upper confidence bound at an action is the 1− 1t quantile of the posterior distribution of that action3.\nA somewhat different approach is the knowledge gradient (KG) policy of Powell and Ryzhov [55], which uses a one-step lookahead approximation to the value of information to guide experimentation. For reasons described in Section 4.3.3, KG does not explore sufficiently to identify the optimal arm in this problem, and therefore its regret grows linearly with time. Because KG explores very little, its realized regret is highly variable, as depicted in Table 1. In 200 out of the 2000 trials, the regret of KG was lower than .7, reflecting that the best arm was almost always chosen. In the worst 200 out of the 2000 trials, the regret of KG was larger than 159.\nKG is particularly poorly suited to problems with discrete observations and long time horizons. The KG* heuristic of Ryzhov et al. [63] offers much better performance in some of these problems.\n3Their theoretical guarantees require choosing a somewhat higher quantile, but the authors suggest choosing this quantile, and use it in their own numerical experiments.\nAt time t, KG* calculates the value of sampling an arm for M ∈ {1, .., T − t} periods and choosing the arm with the highest posterior mean in subsequent periods. It selects an action by maximizing this quantity over all possible arms and possible exploration lengths M . Our simulations require computing T = 1, 000 decisions per trial, and a direct implementation of KG* requires order T 3 basic operations per decision. To enable efficient simulation, we use a heuristic approach to computing KG* proposed by Kamiński [42]. The approximate KG* algorithm we implement uses golden section search to maximize a non-concave function, but is still empirically effective.\nFinally, as demonstrated in Figure 1a, variance-based IDS offers performance very similar to standard IDS for this problem.\nIt is worth pointing out that, although Gittins’ indices characterize the Bayes optimal policy for infinite horizon discounted problems, the finite horizon formulation considered here is computationally intractable [30]. A similar index policy [52] designed for finite horizon problems could be applied as a heuristic in this setting. However, with long time horizons, the associated computational requirements become onerous."

The mean θa ∼ N(0, 1) is drawn from a Gaussian prior, and the means of different reward distributions are drawn independently. We ran 2000 simulation trials of a problem with 10 arms. The results are displayed in Figure 1b and Table 2.\nFor this problem, we compare variance-based IDS against Thompson sampling, Bayes UCB, and KG. We use the variance-based variant of IDS because it affords us computational advantages.\nWe also simulated the GPUCB of Srinivas et al. [67]. This algorithm maximizes the upper confidence bound µt(a) + √ βtσt(a) where µt(a) and σt(a) are the posterior mean and standard deviation of θa. They provide regret bounds that hold with probability at least 1 − δ when βt = 2 log ( |A|t2π2/6δ ) . This value of βt is far too large for practical performance, at least in this problem setting. The average regret of GPUCB4 is 157.6, which is roughly almost three times that of V-IDS. For this reason, we considered a tuned version of GPUCB that sets βt = c log(t). We ran 1000 trials of many different values of c to find the value c = .9 with the lowest average regret for this problem. This tuned version of GPUCB had average regret of 53.8, which is slight better than IDS.\nThe work on knowledge gradient (KG) focuses almost entirely on problems with Gaussian reward distributions and Gaussian priors. We find KG performs better in this experiment than it did in the Bernoulli setting, and its average regret is competitive with that of IDS.\nAs in the Bernoulli setting, KG’s realized regret is highly variable. The median regret of KG is the lowest of any algorithm, but in 100 of the 2000 trials its regret exceeded 283 – seemingly reflecting that the algorithm did not explore enough to identify the best action. The KG* heuristic explores more aggressively, and performs very well in this experiment.\n4We set δ = 0 in the definition of βt, as this choice leads to a lower value of βt and stronger performance.\nKG is particularly effective over short time spans. Unlike information-directed sampling, KG takes the time horizon T as an input, and explores less aggressively when there are fewer time periods remaining. Table 3 compares the regret of KG and IDS over different time horizons. Even though IDS does not take the time horizon into account, it is competitive with KG, even over short horizons. We believe that IDS can be modified to exploit fixed and known time horizons more effectively, though we leave the matter for future research."

The action ai ∈ {a1, . . . , aK} yields in each time period a reward that is 1 with probability θi and 0 otherwise.

In addition, IDS may be accelerated considerably via parallel processing or an optimized implementation.\nThe results for KG are mixed. For independent Gaussian models, certain integrals can be computed via closed form expressions, allowing KG to execute quickly. There is also a specialized numerical procedure for implementing KG for correlated (or linear) Gaussian models, but computation is an order of magnitude slower than in the independent case. For correlated Gaussian models, the KG* policy is much slower than both KG and IDS. For beta-Bernoulli problems, KG can be computed very easily, but yields poor performance. A direct implementation of the KG* policy was too slow to simulate, and so we have used a heuristic approach presented in [42], which uses golden section search to maximize a function that is not necessarily unimodal. This method is labeled “Approx KG*” in Table 6.\nTable 6 displays results for the Bernoulli experiment described in Subsection 7.1. It shows the average time required to compute a decision in a 1000 period problem with 10, 30, 50 and 70 arms. IDS was implementing using Algorithm 2 to evaluate the information ratio, and Algorithm 3 to optimize it. The numerical integrals in Algorithm 2 were approximated using quadrature with 1000 equally spaced points. Table 7 presents results of the corresponding experiment in the Gaussian case. Finally, Table 8 displays results for the linear bandit experiments described in Subsection 7.4, which make use of Algorithm 6 and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling withM = 10, 000 samples. The table provides the average time required to compute a decision in a 250 period problem."

      "text" : "measure the information provided by sampling actions. Finally, for some simple and widely studied classes of multi-armed bandit problems we demonstrate simulation performance surpassing popular approaches.\nMany important open questions remain, however. IDS solves a single-period optimization problem as a proxy to an intractable multi-period problem. Solution of this single-period problem can itself be computationally demanding, especially in cases where the number of actions is enormous or mutual information is difficult to evaluate. An important direction for future research concerns the development of computationally elegant procedures to implement IDS in important cases. Even when the algorithm cannot be directly implemented, however, one may hope to develop simple algorithms that capture its main benefits. Proposition 1 shows that any algorithm with small information ratio satisfies strong regret bounds. Thompson sampling is a simple algorithm that, we conjecture, sometimes has nearly minimal information ratio. Perhaps simple schemes with small information ratio could be developed for other important problem classes, like the sparse linear bandit problem.\nIn addition to computational considerations, a number of statistical questions remain open. One question raised is whether IDS attains the lower bound of Lai and Robbins [49] for some bandit problems with independent arms. Beyond the empirical evidence presented in Subsection 7.3, there are some theoretical reasons to conjecture this is true. Next, a more precise understanding of problem’s information complexity remains an important open question for the field. Our regret bound depends on the problem’s information complexity through a term we call the information ratio, but it’s unclear if or when this is the right measure. Finally, it may be possible to derive lower bounds using the same information theoretic style of argument used in the derivation of our upper bounds."

(9)\nRecall that we have defined ∆t(a) := E [Rt,A∗ −Rt,a|Ft] to be the expected regret of action a at time t. This is a “pure exploration problem,” in the sense that one is interested only in the terminal regret (9) and not in the algorithm’s cumulative regret. However, the next proposition shows that bounds on the algorithm’s cumulative expected regret imply bounds on E [mina∈A∆T (a)].\nProposition 8. If actions are selected according to a policy π, then\nE [ min a∈A ∆T (a) ] ≤ E [Regret (T, π)] T .\nProof. By the tower property of conditional expectation, E [∆t+1(a)|Ft] = ∆t(a). Therefore, Jensen’s inequality shows E [mina∈A∆t+1(a)|Ft] ≤ mina∈A∆t(a) ≤ ∆t(πt). Taking expectations and iterating this relation shows that\nE [ min a∈A ∆T (a) ] ≤ E [ min a∈A ∆t(a) ] ≤ E [∆t(πt)] ∀t ∈ {1, . . . , T}. (10)\nThe result follows by summing both sides of (10) over t ∈ {1, . . . , T} and dividing each by T .\nInformation-directed sampling is designed to have low cumulative regret, and therefore balances between acquiring information and taking actions with low expected regret. For pure exploration problems, it’s natural instead to consider an algorithm that always acquires as much information about A∗ as possible. The next proposition provides a theoretical guarantee for an algorithm of this form. The proof of this result combines our analysis of information-directed sampling with Proposition 8.\nProposition 9. If actions are selected so that\nAt ∈ arg max a∈A gt(a),\nand Ψ∗t ≤ λ almost surely for each t ∈ {1, . . . , T}, then\nE [ min a∈A ∆T (a) ] ≤ √ λH(α1) T .\nProof. To simplify notation, let ∆∗t = mina∈A∆t(a) denote the minimal expected regret at time t, and g∗t = maxa∈A gt(a) denote the information gain under the current algorithm.\nSince ∆t(πIDSt )2 ≤ λgt(πIDSt ), it is immediate that ∆∗t ≤ √ λg∗t .

Moreover, this function is minimized over SK by some π∗ for which |{k : π∗k > 0}| ≤ 2.\nProof. First, we show the function Ψ : π 7→ ( πT∆ )2 /πT g is convex on { π ∈ RK |πT g > 0 } . As\nshown in Chapter 3 of Boyd and Vandenberghe [12], f : (x, y) 7→ x2/y is convex over {(x, y) ∈ R2 : y > 0}. The function h : π 7→ (πT∆, πT g) ∈ R2 is affine. Since convexity is preserved under composition with an affine function, the function Ψ = g ◦ h is convex.\nWe now prove the second claim. Consider the optimization problems\nminimize Ψ(π) subject to πT e = 1, π ≥ 0 (15) minimize ρ(π) subject to πT e = 1, π ≥ 0 (16)\nwhere ρ(π) := ( πT∆ )2 − ( πT g ) Ψ∗,\nand Ψ∗ ∈ R denotes the optimal objective value for the minimization problem (15). The set of optimal solutions to (15) and (16) correspond. Note that\nΨ(π) = Ψ∗ =⇒ ρ(π) = 0\nbut for any feasible π, ρ(π) ≥ 0 since ∆(π)2 ≥ Ψ∗g(π). Therefore, any optimal solution π0 to (15) is an optimal solutions to (16) and satisfies ρ(π0) = 0. Similarly, if ρ(π) = 0 then simple algebra shows that Ψ(π) = Ψ∗ and hence that π is an optimal solution to (15)\nWe will now show that there is a minimizer of ρ(·) with at most two nonzero components, which implies the same is true of Ψ(·). Fix a minimizer π∗ of ρ(·). Differentiating ρ(π) with respect to π at π = π∗ yields\n∂\n∂π ρ(π∗) = 2\n( ∆Tπ∗ ) ∆−Ψ∗g\n= 2L∗∆−Ψ∗g\nwhere L∗ = ∆Tπ∗ is the expected instantaneous regret of the sampling distribution π∗. Let d∗ = mini ∂∂πi ρ(π\n∗) denote the smallest partial derivative of ρ at π∗. It must be the case that any i with π∗i > 0 satisfies d∗ = ∂∂πi ρ(π\n∗), as otherwise transferring probability from action ai could lead to strictly lower cost. This shows that\nπ∗i > 0 =⇒ gi = −d∗ Ψ∗ + 2L∗ Ψ∗ ∆i. (17)\nLet i1, .., im be the indices such that π∗ik > 0 ordered so that gi1 ≥ gi2 ≥ · · · ≥ gim .

A full proof is provided below.\nWe will make use of the following fact, which is a matrix-analogue of the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality.

As a result, to show Ψt(πt) ≤ λ/2, it’s enough to show ∆t(πTSt )2 ≤ λvt(πTSt ). We show that this holds always for λ = |A|, and then show it holds for λ = d when A ⊂ Rd, Θ ⊂ Rd, and E [Rt,a|θ] = aT θ for all a ∈ A.\nRecall that by definition, πTSt (a) = Pt(A∗ = a) for each a ∈ A.

Now assume A ⊂ Rd, Θ ⊂ Rd, and E [Rt,a|θ] = aT θ. Write A = {a1, . . . , aK} and define M ∈ RK×K by\nMi,j = √ Pt(A∗ = ai)Pt(A∗ = aj) (Et[Rt,ai |A∗ = aj ]− Et[Rt,ai ])\n= √ αt(ai)αt(aj) (Et[Rt,ai |A∗ = aj ]− Et[Rt,ai ])\nfor all i, j ∈ {1, ..,K}.

Each action is sampled in a manner that minimizes the ratio between squared expected single-period regret and a measure of information gain: the mutual information between the optimal action and the next observation. We establish an expected regret bound for information-directed sampling that applies across a very general class of models and scales with the entropy of the optimal action distribution. We illustrate through simple analytic examples how information-directed sampling accounts for kinds of information that alternative approaches do not adequately address and that this can lead to dramatic performance gains. For the widely studied Bernoulli, Gaussian, and linear bandit problems, we demonstrate state-of-the-art simulation performance.",
