      "text" : "In recent years, online learning (Zinkevich, 2003; Hazan et al., 2007) and its batch counterpart stochastic gradient descent (Juditsky et al., 2009) has contributed substantially to advances in large scale optimization techniques for machine learning. Online convex optimization has been generalized to handle time-varying and non-smooth convex functions (Duchi et al., 2010; Duchi & Singer, 2009; Xiao, 2010). Distributed optimization, where the problem is divided into parts on which progress can be made in parallel, has also contributed to advances in large scale optimization (Boyd et al., 2010; Bertsekas & Tsitsiklis, 1989; Censor & Zenios, 1998).\nImportant advances have been made based on the above ideas in the recent literature. Composite objective mirror descent (COMID) (Duchi et al., 2010) generalizes mirror descent (Beck & Teboulle, 2003) to the online setting. COMID also includes certain other proximal splitting methods such as FOBOS (Duchi & Singer, 2009) as special cases. Regularized dual averaging (RDA) (Xiao, 2010) general-\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nizes dual averaging (Nesterov, 2009) to online and composite optimization, and can be used for distributed optimization (Duchi et al., 2011).\nFirst introduced in (Gabay & Mercier, 1976), the alternating direction method (ADM) has become popular in recent years due to its ease of applicability and empirical performance in a wide variety of problems, including composite objectives (Boyd et al., 2010; Eckstein & Bertsekas, 1992; Lin et al., 2009). The proof of convergence of ADM can be found in (Eckstein & Bertsekas, 1992; Boyd et al., 2010), although the rate of convergence rate has not been established. For further understanding of ADM, we refer the readers to the comprehensive review by (Boyd et al., 2010). An advantage of ADM is that it can handle linear equality constraints of the form {x, z|Ax+Bz = c}, which makes distributed optimization by variable splitting in a batch setting straightforward (Boyd et al., 2010). However, in an online or stochastic gradient descent setting, one obtains a double-loop algorithm where the inner loop ADM iterations have to be run till convergence after every new data point or function is revealed. As a result, ADM has not yet been generalized to the online setting.\nIn this paper, we consider optimization problems of the following form:\nmin x∈X ,z∈Z T∑ t=1 (ft(x) + g(z)) s.t. Ax + Bz = c , (1)\nwhere the functions ft, g are (non-smooth) convex functions, A ∈ Rm×n1 ,B ∈ Rm×n2 , c ∈ Rm, x ∈ X ∈ Rn1×1, z ∈ Z ∈ Rn2×1, where X and Z are convex sets. In the sequel, we drop the convex sets X and Z for ease of exposition, noting that one can consider g and other additive functions to be the indicators of suitable convex feasible sets. The problem is studied both in the batch setting, where ft = f , and in the online setting for time-varying ft. We introduce a new proof technique for ADM in the batch setting, which establishes a O(1/T ) convergence rate of ADM based on variational inequalities (Facchinei & Pang, 2003). Further, the convergence analysis for the batch setting forms the basis of regret analysis in the online setting. We consider two scenarios in the online setting, based on whether or not the solution needs to lie in the feasible set\nin every iteration.\nWe propose efficient online ADM (OADM) algorithms for both scenarios which make a single pass through the update equations and avoid a double loop algorithm. In the online setting, while a single pass through the ADM update equations is not guaranteed to satisfy the linear constraints Axt + Bzt = c, we consider two types of regret: regret in the objective as well as regret in constraint violation. We establish both types of regret bounds for general and strongly convex functions. We also present preliminary experimental results illustrating the performance of the proposed OADM algorithms in comparison with FOBOS and RDA (Duchi & Singer, 2009; Xiao, 2010).\nThe key advantage of the OADM algorithms can be summarized as follows: Like COMID and RDA, OADM can solve online composite optimization problems, matching the regret bounds for existing methods. The ability to additionally handle linear equality constraints of the form Ax + Bz = c makes non-trivial variable splitting possible yielding efficient distributed online optimization algorithms based on OADM. Further, the notion of regret in both the objective as well as constraints may contribute towards development of suitable analysis tools for online constrained optimization problems (Mannor & Tsitsiklis, 2006; Mahdavi et al., 2011).\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we analyze batch ADM and establish its convergence rate. In Section 3, we introduce the online optimization problem with linear constraints. The OADM algorithm is also given in Section 3. In Sections 4 and 5, we present the regret analysis in two different scenarios based on the constraints. We discuss connections to related work in Section 6, present preliminary experimental results in Section 7, and conclude in Section 8."

The augmented Lagrangian for (1) is\nLρ(x,y,z)=f(x)+g(z)+〈y,Ax+Bz−c〉+ ρ\n2 ‖Ax+Bz−c‖2, (2)\nwhere z is the primal variable and y is the dual variable, ρ > 0 is the penalty parameter.

We first analyze the convergence of objective and constraint separately using a new proof technique, which plays an important role for the regret analysis in the online setting. Then, a joint analysis of the objective and constraint using a variational inequality (Facchinei & Pang, 2003) establishes the O(1/T ) convergence rate for ADM.\nWithout loss of generality, we assume that z0 = 0,y0 = 0.

      "heading" : "3. Online ADM",
      "text" : "In this section, we extend the ADM to the online learning setting. Specifically, we focus on using online ADM (OADM) to solve the problem in (1). For our analysis, A and B are assumed to be fixed. At round t, we consider solving the following regularized optimization problem:\nxt+1 = argmin Ax+Bz=c ft(x) + g(z) + ηBφ(x,xt) , (10)\nwhere η ≥ 0 is a learning rate and Bregman divergence Bφ(x,xt) ≥ α2 ‖x − xt‖ 2 2. If the above problem is solved in every step, standard analysis techniques (Hazan et al., 2007) can be suitably adopted to obtain sublinear regret bounds. While (10) can be solved by batch ADM, we essentially obtain a double loop algorithm where the function ft changes in the outer loop and the inner loop runs ADM iteratively till convergence so that the constraints are satisfied. Note that existing online methods, such as projected gradient descent and variants (Hazan et al., 2007; Duchi et al., 2010) do assume a black-box approach for projecting onto the feasible set, which for linear constraints may require iterative cyclic projections (Censor & Zenios, 1998).\nFor our analysis, instead of requiring the equality constraints to be satisfied at each time t, we only require the equality constraints to be satisfied in the long run, with a notion of regret associated with constraints. In particular, we consider the following online learning problem:\nmin xt,zt T∑ t=0 ft(xt) + g(zt)− min Ax+Bz=c T∑ t=0 ft(x) + g(z)\ns.t. T∑ t=1 ‖Axt + Bzt − c‖22 = o(T ) , (11)\nso that the cumulative constraint violation is sublinear in T . The augmented lagrangian function of (10) at time t is\nLt(x,y, z) =ft(x)+g(z)+〈y,Ax+Bz−c〉+ηBφ(x,xt)\n+ ρ\n2 ‖Ax + Bz− c‖2 . (12)\nAt time t, our algorithm consists of just one pass through the following three update steps:\nxt+1 =argmin x\nft(x) + 〈yt,Ax + Bzt − c〉\n+ ρ\n2 ‖Ax + Bzt − c‖2 + ηBφ(x,xt) , (13)\nzt+1 = argmin z\ng(z) + 〈yt,Axt+1 + Bz− c〉\n+ ρ\n2 ‖Axt+1 + Bz− c‖2 , (14)\nyt+1 = yt + ρ(Axt+1 + Bzt+1 − c) . (15)\nThe x-update (13) has two penalty terms: a quadratic term and a Bregman divergence. If the Bregman divergence is not a quadratic function, it may be difficult to solve x efficiently. A common way is to linearize the objective such that\nxt+1 =argmin x 〈f ′t(xt)+AT{yt+ρ(Axt+Bzt−c)},x−xt〉\n+ ηBφ(x,xt) . (16)\n(16) is known as inexact ADM (Boyd et al., 2010) if φ is a quadratic function. In the sequel, we focus on the algorithm using (13).\nOperationally, in round t, the algorithm presents a solution {xt, zt} as well as yt. Then, nature reveals function ft and we encounter two types of losses. The first type is the traditional loss measured by ft(xt) + g(zt). The second type is the residual of constraint violation, i.e., ‖Axt+Bzt−c‖2. The goal is to establish sublinear regret bounds for both the objective and the constraint violation, which we do in Section 4. We consider another scenario, where in round t, we use a solution {x̂t, zt} based on zt such that Ax̂+Bzt = c. While (x̂t, zt) satisfies the constraint by design, the goal is to establish sublinear regret of the objective ft(x̂t) + g(zt) as well as the constraint violation for the true (xt, zt). For the second scenario, we use η = 0 in (13) and present the results in Section 5. As the updates include the primal and dual variables, in line with batch ADM, we use a stronger regret Rc(T ) = ∑T t=1R c t for constraint violation based on both primal and dual residuals, where\nRct =‖Axt+1 + Bzt+1− c‖22 +‖Bzt+1 −Bzt‖22 . (17)\nBefore getting into the regret analysis, we discuss some example problems which can be solved using OADM. Like FOBOS and RDA, OADM can deal with machine learning methods where ft is a loss function and g is a regularizer, e.g. `1 or mixed norm, or an indicator function of a convex set. Examples include generalized lasso and group lasso (Boyd et al., 2010; Tibshirani, 1996; Xiao, 2010). OADM can also solve linear programs, e.g. MAP LP relaxation (Meshi & Globerson, 2011) and LP decoding (Barman et al., 2012), and non-smooth optimization,\ne.g. robust PCA (Lin et al., 2009) where ft is nuclear norm and g is `1 norm. Another promising scenario for OADM is consensus optimization (Boyd et al., 2010) where distributed local variables are updated separately and reach a global consensus in the long run. More examples can be found in (Boyd et al., 2010).\nIn the sequel, we need the following assumptions:\n(1) The norm of subgradient of ft(x) is bounded by Gf .\n(2) We assume g(z0) = 0 and g(z) ≥ 0.\n(3) x0 = 0,y0 = 0, z0 = 0. For any x∗, z∗ satisfying Ax∗ + Bz∗ = c, Bφ(x∗,0) = D2x, ‖z∗‖2 = Dz.\n(4) For any t, ft(xt+1)+g(zt+1)−(ft(z∗)+g(z∗)) ≥ −F , which is true if the functions are lower bounded or Lipschitz continuous in the convex set (Mahdavi et al., 2011)."

The NNZs in FOBOS is large and oscillates in a big range, which has also been observed in (Xiao, 2010).\n2http://www.stanford.edu/˜boyd/papers/ admm/\nTotal Variation: We compare the patterns found by the four algorithms. For all algorithms, N = 100, n = 1000, λ = 0.001 and ρ is chosen through cross validation. In RDA, γ = 100. Recall that η = 0 in OADM. While we use a fixed ρ for OADM and RDA, FOBOS uses ρt = ρ/ √ t. Figure 3 shows the three different patterns and results found by the algorithms. ADM seems to follow the pattern with obvious oscillation. OADM is smoother and generally follows the trend of the patterns. For the first two examples, FOBOS works well and the patterns found by RDA tend to be flat. In the last example, both FOBOS and RDA oscillate."

      "text" : "In this paper, we propose an efficient online learning algorithm named online ADM (OADM). New proof techniques have been developed to analyze the convergence of ADM, which shows that ADM has a O(1/T ) convergence rate. Using the proof technique, we establish the regret bounds for the objective and constraint violation for general and strongly convex functions in OADM. Finally, we illustrate the efficacy of OADM in solving lasso and total variation."
