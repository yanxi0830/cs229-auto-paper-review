      "text" : "In multivariate data analysis, graphical models such as Gaussian Markov Random Fields provide a way to discover meaningful interactions among variables. Let Y = {y(1), . . . , y(n)} be an n-dimensional random vector following an n-variate Gaussian distribution N (µ,Σ), and let G = (V,E) be a Markov network representing the conditional independence structure of N (µ,Σ). Specifically, the set of vertices V = {1, . . . , n} corresponds to the set of variables in Y , and the edge set E contains an edge (i, j) if and only if y(i) is conditionally dependent on y(j) given all remaining variables; i.e., the lack of an edge between i and j denotes the conditional independence of y(i) and y(j), which corresponds to a zero entry in the inverse covariance matrix Σ−1 ([1]). Thus learning the structure of this graphical model is equivalent to the problem of learning the zero-pattern of Σ−1. To estimate this sparse inverse covariance matrix, one can solve the following sparse inverse covariance selection (SICS) problem: maxX∈Sn ++ log det(X) − 〈Σ̂, X〉 − ρ‖X‖0, where Sn++ denotes the set of n × n positive definite matrices, ‖X‖0 is the number of nonzeros in X , Σ̂ = 1\np\n∑p i=1(Yi − β̂)(Yi − β̂)⊤ is the sample covariance matrix, β̂ = 1p ∑p\ni=1 Yi is the sample mean and Yi is the i-th random sample of Y . This problem is NP-hard in general due to the combinatorial nature of the cardinality term ρ‖X‖0 ([2]). To get a numerically tractable problem, one can replace the cardinality term ‖X‖0 by ‖X‖1 := ∑\ni,j |Xij |, the envelope of ‖X‖0 over the set {X ∈ Rn×n : ‖X‖∞ ≤ 1} (see [3]). This results in the convex optimization problem (see e.g., [4, 5, 6, 7]):\nmin X∈Sn\n++\n− log det(X) + 〈Σ̂, X〉+ ρ‖X‖1. (1)\nNote that (1) can be rewritten as minX∈Sn ++ max‖U‖∞≤ρ− log detX + 〈Σ̂ + U,X〉, where ‖U‖∞ is the largest absolute value of the entries of U . By exchanging the order of max and min, we obtain\nthe dual problem max‖U‖∞≤ρminX∈Sn++ − log detX + 〈Σ̂ + U,X〉, which is equivalent to\nmax W∈Sn\n++\n{log detW + n : ‖W − Σ̂‖∞ ≤ ρ}. (2)\nBoth the primal and dual problems have strictly convex objectives; hence, their optimal solutions are unique. Given a dual solution W , X = W−1 is primal feasible resulting in the duality gap\ngap := 〈Σ̂,W−1〉+ ρ‖W−1‖1 − n. (3)\nThe primal and the dual SICS problems (1) and (2) are semidefinite programming problems and can be solved via interior point methods (IPMs) in polynomial time. However, the per-iteration computational cost and memory requirements of an IPM are prohibitively high for the SICS problem. Although an approximate IPM has recently been proposed for the SICS problem [8], most of the methods developed for it are first-order methods. Banerjee et al. [7] proposed a block coordinate descent (BCD) method to solve the dual problem (2). Their method updates one row and one column of W in each iteration by solving a convex quadratic programming problem by an IPM. The glasso method of Friedman et al. [5] is based on the same BCD approach as in [7], but it solves each subproblem as a LASSO problem by yet another coordinate descent (CD) method [9]. Sun et al. [10] proposed solving the primal problem (1) by using a BCD method. They formulate the subproblem as a min-max problem and solve it using a prox method proposed by Nemirovski [11]. The SINCO method proposed by Scheinberg and Rish [12] is a greedy CD method applied to the primal problem. All of these BCD and CD approaches lack iteration complexity bounds. They also have been shown to be inferior in practice to gradient based approaches. A projected gradient method for solving the dual problem (2) that is considered to be state-of-the-art for SICS was proposed by Duchi et al. [13]. However, there are no iteration complexity results for it either. Variants of Nesterov’s method [14, 15] have been applied to solve the SICS problem. d’Aspremont et al. [16] applied Nesterov’s optimal first-order method to solve the primal problem (1) after smoothing the nonsmooth ℓ1 term, obtaining an iteration complexity bound of O(1/ǫ) for an ǫ-optimal solution, but the implementation in [16] was very slow and did not produce good results. Lu [17] solved the dual problem (2), which is a smooth problem, by Nesterov’s algorithm, and improved the iteration complexity to O(1/ √ ǫ). However, since the practical performance of this algorithm was not attractive, Lu gave a variant (VSM) of it that exhibited better performance. The iteration complexity of VSM is unknown. Yuan [18] proposed an alternating direction method based on an augmented Lagrangian framework (see the ADAL method (8) below). This method also lacks complexity results. The proximal point algorithm proposed by Wang et al. in [19] requires a reformulation of the problem that increases the size of the problem making it impractical for solving large-scale problems. Also, there is no iteration complexity bound for this algorithm. The IPM in [8] also requires such a reformulation.\nOur contribution. In this paper, we propose an alternating linearization method (ALM) for solving the primal SICS problem. An advantage of solving the primal problem is that the ℓ1 penalty term in the objective function directly promotes sparsity in the optimal inverse covariance matrix.\nAlthough developed independently, our method is closely related to Yuan’s method [18]. Both methods exploit the special form of the primal problem (1) by alternatingly minimizing one of the terms of the objective function plus an approximation to the other term. The main difference between the two methods is in the construction of these approximations. As we will show, our method has a theoretically justified interpretation and is based on an algorithmic framework with complexity bounds, while no complexity bound is available for Yuan’s method. Also our method has an intuitive interpretation from a learning perspective. Extensive numerical test results on both synthetic data and real problems have shown that our ALM algorithm significantly outperforms other existing algorithms, such as the PSM algorithm proposed by Duchi et al. [13] and the VSM algorithm proposed by Lu [17]. Note that it is shown in [13] and [17] that PSM and VSM outperform the BCD method in [7] and glasso in [5].\nOrganization of the paper. In Section 2 we briefly review alternating linearization methods for minimizing the sum of two convex functions and establish convergence and iteration complexity results. We show how to use ALM to solve SICS problems and give intuition from a learning perspective in Section 3. Finally, we present some numerical results on both synthetic and real data in Section 4 and compare ALM with PSM algorithm [13] and VSM algorithm [17]."

      "text" : "We consider here the alternating linearization method (ALM) for solving the following problem:\nmin F (x) ≡ f(x) + g(x), (4) where f and g are both convex functions. An effective way to solve (4) is to “split” f and g by introducing a new variable, i.e., to rewrite (4) as\nmin x,y\n{f(x) + g(y) : x− y = 0}, (5)\nand apply an alternating direction augmented Lagrangian method to it. Given a penalty parameter 1/µ, at the k-th iteration, the augmented Lagrangian method minimizes the augmented Lagrangian function\nL(x, y;λ) := f(x) + g(y)− 〈λ, x − y〉+ 1 2µ ‖x− y‖22,\nwith respect to x and y, i.e., it solves the subproblem\n(xk, yk) := argmin x,y L(x, y;λk), (6)\nand updates the Lagrange multiplier λ via:\nλk+1 := λk − (xk − yk)/µ. (7) Since minimizing L(x, y;λ) with respect to x and y jointly is usually difficult, while doing so with respect to x and y alternatingly can often be done efficiently, the following alternating direction version of the augmented Lagrangian method (ADAL) is often advocated (see, e.g., [20, 21]):\n\n\n xk+1 := argminx L(x, yk;λk) yk+1 := argminy L(xk+1, y;λk) λk+1 := λk − (xk+1 − yk+1)/µ.\n(8)\nIf we also update λ after we solve the subproblem with respect to x, we get the following symmetric version of the ADAL method.\n\n \n  \nxk+1 := argminx L(x, yk;λky) λk+1x := λ k y − (xk+1 − yk)/µ yk+1 := argminy L(xk+1, y;λk+1x ) λk+1y := λ k+1 x − (xk+1 − yk+1)/µ.\n(9)\nAlgorithm (9) has certain theoretical advantages when f and g are smooth. In this case, from the first-order optimality conditions for the two subproblems in (9), we have that:\nλk+1x = ∇f(xk+1) and λk+1y = −∇g(yk+1). (10) Substituting these relations into (9), we obtain the following equivalent algorithm for solving (4), which we refer to as the alternating linearization minimization (ALM) algorithm.\nAlgorithm 1 Alternating linearization method (ALM) for smooth problem\nInput: x0 = y0 for k = 0, 1, · · · do 1. Solve xk+1 := argminxQg(x, yk) ≡ f(x) + g(yk) + 〈 ∇g(yk), x− yk 〉\n+ 12µ‖x− yk‖22; 2. Solve yk+1 := argminy Qf (xk+1, y) ≡ f(xk+1) + 〈 ∇f(xk+1), y − xk+1 〉\n+ 12µ‖y − xk+1‖22 + g(y);\nend for\nAlgorithm 1 can be viewed in the following way: at each iteration we construct a quadratic approximation of the function g(x) at the current iterate yk and minimize the sum of this approximation and f(x). The approximation is based on linearizing g(x) (hence the name ALM) and adding a “prox” term 12µ‖x− yk‖22. When µ is small enough (µ ≤ 1/L(g), where L(g) is the Lipschitz constant for\n∇g) this quadratic function, g(yk)+ 〈 ∇g(yk), x − yk 〉 + 12µ‖x−yk‖22 is an upper approximation to g(x), which means that the reduction in the value of F (x) achieved by minimizingQg(x, yk) in Step 1 is not smaller than the reduction achieved in the value of Qg(x, yk) itself. Similarly, in Step 2 we build an upper approximation to f(x) at xk+1, f(xk+1)+ 〈 ∇f(xk+1), y − xk+1 〉\n+ 12µ‖y−xk+1‖22, and minimize the sum Qf (xk+1, y) of it and g(y).\nLet us now assume that f(x) is in the class C1,1 with Lipschitz constant L(f), while g(x) is simply convex. Then from the first-order optimality conditions for the second minimization in (9), we have −λk+1y ∈ ∂g(yk+1), the subdifferential of g(y) at y = yk+1. Hence, replacing ∇g(yk) in the definition of Qg(x, yk) by −λk+1y in (9), we obtain the following modified version of (9).\nAlgorithm 2 Alternating linearization method with skipping step\nInput: x0 = y0 for k = 0, 1, · · · do 1. Solve xk+1 := argminxQ(x, yk) ≡ f(x) + g(yk)− 〈 λk, x− yk 〉\n+ 12µ‖x− yk‖22; 2. If F (xk+1) > Q(xk+1, yk) then xk+1 := yk. 3. Solve yk+1 := argminy Qf(xk+1, y); 4. λk+1 = ∇f(xk+1)− (xk+1 − yk+1)/µ.\nend for\nAlgorithm 2 is identical to the symmetric ADAL algorithm (9) as long as F (xk+1) ≤ Q(xk+1, yk) at each iteration (and to Algorithm 1 if g(x) is in C1,1 and µ ≤ 1/max{L(f), L(g)}). If this condition fails, then the algorithm simply sets xk+1 ← yk. Algorithm 2 has the following convergence property and iteration complexity bound. For a proof see the Appendix.\nTheorem 2.1. Assume ∇f is Lipschitz continuous with constant L(f). For β/L(f) ≤ µ ≤ 1/L(f) where 0 < β ≤ 1, Algorithm 2 satisfies\nF (yk)− F (x∗) ≤ ‖x 0 − x∗‖2\n2µ(k + kn) , ∀k, (11)\nwhere x∗ is an optimal solution of (4) and kn is the number of iterations until the k − th for which F (xk+1) ≤ Q(xk+1, yk). Thus Algorithm 2 produces a sequence which converges to the optimal solution in function value, and the number of iterations needed is O(1/ǫ) for an ǫ-optimal solution.\nIf g(x) is also a smooth function in the class C1,1 with Lipschitz constantL(g) ≤ 1/µ, then Theorem 2.1 also applies to Algorithm 1 since in this case kn = k (i.e., no “skipping” occurs). Note that the iteration complexity bound in Theorem 2.1 can be improved. Nesterov [15, 22] proved that one can obtain an optimal iteration complexity bound of O(1/ √ ǫ), using only first-order information. His acceleration technique is based on using a linear combination of previous iterates to obtain a point where the approximation is built. This technique has been exploited and extended by Tseng [23], Beck and Teboulle [24], Goldfarb et al. [25] and many others. A similar technique can be adopted to derive a fast version of Algorithm 2 that has an improved complexity bound of O(1/ √ ǫ), while keeping the computational effort in each iteration almost unchanged. However, we do not present this method here, since when applied to the SICS problem, it did not work as well as Algorithm 2."

      "text" : "The SICS problem\nmin X∈Sn\n++\nF (X) ≡ f(X) + g(X), (12)\nwhere f(X) = − log det(X) + 〈Σ̂, X〉 and g(X) = ρ‖X‖1, is of the same form as (4). However, in this case neither f(X) nor g(X) have Lipschitz continuous gradients. Moreover, f(X) is only defined for positive definite matrices while g(X) is defined everywhere. These properties of the objective function make the SICS problem especially challenging for optimization methods. Nevertheless, we can still apply (9) to solve the problem directly. Moreover, we can apply Algorithm 2 and obtain the complexity bound in Theorem 2.1 as follows.\nThe log det(X) term in f(X) implicitly requires that X ∈ Sn++ and the gradient of f(X), which is given by −X−1 + Σ̂, is not Lipschitz continuous in Sn++. Fortunately, as proved in Proposition 3.1 in [17], the optimal solution of (12) X∗ αI , where α = 1\n‖Σ̂‖+nρ . Therefore, if we define\nC := {X ∈ Sn : X α2 I}, the SICS problem (12) can be formulated as: min X,Y {f(X) + g(Y ) : X − Y = 0, X ∈ C, Y ∈ C}. (13)\nWe can include constraints X ∈ C in Step 1 and Y ∈ C in Step 3 of Algorithm 2. Theorem 2.1 can then be applied as discussed in [25]. However, a difficulty now arises when performing the minimization in Y . Without the constraint Y ∈ C, only a matrix shrinkage operation is needed, but with this additional constraint the problem becomes harder to solve. Minimization in X with or without the constraint X ∈ C is accomplished by performing an SVD. Hence the constraint can be easily imposed.\nInstead of imposing constraint Y ∈ C we can obtain feasible solutions by a line search on µ. We know that the constraint X α2 I is not tight at the solution. Hence if we start the algorithm with X αI and restrict the step size µ to be sufficiently small then the iterates of the method will remain in C. Note however, that the bound on the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of f(X) is 1/α2 and hence can be very large. It is not practical to restrict µ in the algorithm to be smaller than α2, since µ determines the step size at each iteration. Hence, for a practical approach we can only claim that the theoretical convergence rate bound holds in only a small neighborhood of the optimal solution. We now present a practical version of our algorithm applied to the SICS problem.\nAlgorithm 3 Alternating linearization method (ALM) for SICS\nInput: X0 = Y 0, µ0. for k = 0, 1, · · · do\n0.

Solve Y k+1 := argminY f(Xk+1) + 〈∇f(Xk+1), Y −Xk+1〉 + 12µk+1 ‖Y −X\nk+1‖2F + g(Y ); 4. Λk+1 = ∇f(Xk+1)− (Xk+1 − Y k+1)/µk+1.\nend for\nWe now show how to solve the two optimization problems in Algorithm 3. The first-order optimality conditions for Step 1 in Algorithm 3, ignoring the constraint X ∈ C are:\n∇f(X)− Λk + (X − Y k)/µk+1 = 0. (14) Consider V Diag(d)V ⊤ - the spectral decomposition of Y k + µk+1(Λk − Σ̂) and let\nγi =\n(\ndi + √ d2i + 4µk+1\n)\n/2, i = 1, . . . , n. (15)\nSince ∇f(X) = −X−1 + Σ̂, it is easy to verify that Xk+1 := V Diag(γ)V ⊤ satisfies (14). When the constraint X ∈ C is imposed, the optimal solution changes to Xk+1 := V Diag(γ)V ⊤ with γi = max { α/2, ( di + √ d2i + 4µk+1 ) /2 } , i = 1, . . . , n. We observe that solving (14) requires approximately the same effort (O(n3)) as is required to compute ∇f(Xk+1). Moreover, from the solution to (14), ∇f(Xk+1) is obtained with only a negligible amount of additional effort, since (Xk+1)−1 := V Diag(γ)−1V ⊤.\nThe first-order optimality conditions for Step 2 in Algorithm 3 are:\n0 ∈ ∇f(Xk+1) + (Y −Xk+1)/µk+1 + ∂g(Y ). (16) Since g(Y ) = ρ‖Y ‖1, it is well known that the solution to (16) is given by\nY k+1 = shrink(Xk+1 − µk+1(Σ̂− (Xk+1)−1), µk+1ρ),\nwhere the “shrinkage operator” shrink(Z, ρ) updates each element Zij of the matrix Z by the formula shrink(Z, ρ)ij = sgn(Zij) ·max{|Zij | − ρ, 0}. The O(n3) complexity of Step 1, which requires a spectral decomposition, dominates the O(n2) complexity of Step 2 which requires a simple shrinkage. There is no closed-form solution for the subproblem corresponding to Y when the constraint Y ∈ C is imposed. Hence, we neither impose this constraint explicitly nor do so by a line search on µk, since in practice this degrades the performance of the algorithm substantially. Thus, the resulting iterates Y k may not be positive definite, while the iterates Xk remain so. Eventually due to the convergence of Y k and Xk, the Y k iterates become positive definite and the constraint Y ∈ C is satisfied. Let us now remark on the learning based intuition behind Algorithm 3. We recall that −Λk ∈ ∂g(Y k). The two steps of the algorithm can be written as\nXk+1 := arg min X∈C {f(X) + 1 2µk+1 ‖X − (Y k + µk+1Λk)‖2F } (17)\nand\nY k+1 := argmin Y {g(Y ) + 1 2µk+1 ‖Y − (Xk+1 − µk+1(Σ̂− (Xk+1)−1))‖2F }. (18)\nThe SICS problem is trying to optimize two conflicting objectives: on the one hand it tries to find a covariance matrix X−1 that best fits the observed data, i.e., is as close to Σ̂ as possible, and on the other hand it tries to obtain a sparse matrix X . The proposed algorithm address these two objectives in an alternating manner. Given an initial “guess” of the sparse matrix Y k we update this guess by a subgradient descent step of length µk+1: Y k + µk+1Λk. Recall that −Λk ∈ ∂g(Y k). Then problem (17) seeks a solution X that optimizes the first objective (best fit of the data) while adding a regularization term which imposes a Gaussian prior on X whose mean is the current guess for the sparse matrix: Y k+µk+1Λk. The solution to (17) gives us a guess for the inverse covariance Xk+1. We again update it by taking a gradient descent step: Xk+1−µk+1(Σ̂− (Xk+1)−1). Then problem (18) seeks a sparse solution Y while also imposing a Gaussian prior on Y whose mean is the guess for the inverse covariance matrix Xk+1 − µk+1(Σ̂ − (Xk+1)−1). Hence the sequence of Xk’s is a sequence of positive definite inverse covariance matrices that converge to a sparse matrix, while the sequence of Y k’s is a sequence of sparse matrices that converges to a positive definite inverse covariance matrix.\nAn important question is how to pick µk+1. Theory tells us that if we pick a small enough value, then we can obtain the complexity bounds. However, in practice this value is too small. We discuss the simple strategy that we use in the next section."

All numerical experiments were run in MATLAB 7.3.0 on a Dell Precision 670 workstation with an Intel Xeon(TM) 3.4GHZ CPU and 6GB of RAM.\nSince −Λk ∈ ∂g(Y k), ‖Λk‖∞ ≤ ρ; hence Σ̂− Λk is a feasible solution to the dual problem (2) as long as it is positive definite. Thus the duality gap at the k-th iteration is given by:\nDgap := − log det(Xk) + 〈Σ̂, Xk〉+ ρ‖Xk‖1 − log det(Σ̂− Λk)− n. (19) We define the relative duality gap as: Rel.gap := Dgap/(1+ |pobj|+ |dobj|), where pobj and dobj are respectively the objective function values of the primal problem (12) at point Xk, and the dual problem (2) at Σ̂ − Λk. Defining dk(φ(x)) ≡ max{1, φ(xk), φ(xk−1)}, we measure the relative changes of objective function value F (X) and the iterates X and Y as follows:\nFrel := |F (Xk)− F (Xk−1)|\ndk(|F (X)|) , Xrel := ‖Xk −Xk−1‖F dk(‖X‖F ) , Y rel := ‖Y k − Y k−1‖F d(‖Y ‖F ) .\nWe terminate ALM when either\n(i) Dgap ≤ ǫgap or (ii) max{Frel,Xrel, Y rel} ≤ ǫrel. (20)\nNote that in (19), computing log det(Xk) is easy since the spectral decomposition of Xk is already available (see (14) and (15)), but computing log det(Σ̂ − Λk) requires another expensive spectral decomposition. Thus, in practice, we only check (20)(i) every Ngap iterations. We check (20)(ii) at every iteration since this is inexpensive.\nA continuation strategy for updating µ is also crucial to ALM. In our experiments, we adopted the following update rule. After every Nµ iterations, we set µ := max{µ ·ηµ, µ̄}; i.e., we simply reduce µ by a constant factor ηµ every Nµ iterations until a desired lower bound on µ is achieved.\nWe compare ALM (i.e., Algorithm 3 with the above stopping criteria and µ updates), with the projected subgradient method (PSM) proposed by Duchi et al. in [13] and implemented by Mark Schmidt 1 and the smoothing method (VSM) 2 proposed by Lu in [17], which are considered to be the state-of-the-art algorithms for solving SICS problems. The per-iteration complexity of all three algorithms is roughly the same; hence a comparison of the number of iterations is meaningful. The parameters used in PSM and VSM are set at their default values. We used the following parameter values in ALM: ǫgap = 10−3, ǫrel = 10−8, Ngap = 20, Nµ = 20, µ̄ = max{µ0η8µ, 10−6}, ηµ = 1/3, where µ0 is the initial µ which is set according to ρ; specifically, in our experiments, µ0 = 100/ρ, if ρ < 0.5, µ0 = ρ if 0.5 ≤ ρ ≤ 10, and µ0 = ρ/100 if ρ > 10."

Hence, S−1 was sparse.

Since PSM and VSM solve the dual problem, the primal solution X , obtained by inverting the dual solution W , is never sparse due to floating point errors. Thus it is not fair to measure the sparsity of X or a truncated version of X . Instead, we measure the sparsity of solutions produced by PSM and VSM by appealing to complementary slackness. Specifically, the (i, j)-th element of the inverse covariance matrix is deemed to be nonzero if and only if |Wij − Σ̂ij | = ρ. We give results for a random problem (n = 500) and the first real data set in Table 3. For each value of ρ, the first three rows show the number of nonzeros in the solution and the last three rows show the number of entries that are nonzero in the solution produced by one of the methods but are zero in the solution produced by the other method. The sparsity of the ground truth inverse covariance matrix of the synthetic data is 6.76%. From Table 3 we can see that when ρ is relatively large (ρ ≥ 0.5), all three algorithms\nproduce solutions with exactly the same sparsity patterns. Only when ρ is very small, are there slight differences.

      "text" : "We show in the following that the iteration complexity of Algorithm 2 is O(1/ǫ) to get an ǫ-optimal solution. First, we need the following definitions and a lemma which is a generalization of Lemma 2.3 in [24]. Let Ψ : Rn → R and Φ : Rn → R be convex functions and define\nQψ(u, v) := φ(u) + ψ(v) + 〈γψ(v), u − v〉+ 1\n2µ ‖u− v‖22,\nwhere γψ(v) is any subgradient in the subdifferential ∂ψ(v) of ψ(v) at the point v, and\npψ(v) := argmin u Qψ(u, v). (21)\nLemma 5.1. Let Φ(·) = φ(·) + ψ(·). For any v, if Φ(pψ(v)) ≤ Qψ(pψ(v), v), (22)\nthen for any u,\n2µ(Φ(u)− Φ(pψ(v))) ≥ ‖pψ(v)− u‖2 − ‖v − u‖2. (23)\nProof. From (22), we have\nΦ(u)− Φ(pψ(v)) ≥ Φ(u)−Qψ(pψ(v), v) = Φ(u)− (\nφ(pψ(v)) + ψ(v) + 〈γψ(v), pψ(v)− v〉+ 12µ‖pψ(v)− v‖22 ) . (24)\nNow since φ and ψ are convex we have\nφ(u) ≥ φ(pψ(v)) + 〈u − pψ(v), γφ(pψ(v))〉, (25)\nψ(u) ≥ ψ(v) + 〈u− v, γψ(v)〉, (26) where γφ(·) is a subgradient of φ(·) and γφ(pψ(v)) satisfies the first-order optimality conditions for (21), i.e.,\nγφ(pψ(v)) + γψ(v) + 1\nµ (pψ(v)− v) = 0. (27)\nSumming (25) and (26) yields\nΦ(u) ≥ φ(pψ(v)) + 〈u − pψ(v), γφ(pψ(v))〉+ ψ(v) + 〈u− v, γψ(v)〉. (28) Therefore, from (24), (27) and (28) it follows that\nΦ(u)− Φ(pψ(v)) ≥ 〈γψ(v) + γφ(pψ(v)), u − pψ(v)〉 − 1\n2µ ‖pψ(v)− v‖22\n= 〈− 1 µ (pψ(v) − v), u− pψ(v)〉 − 1 2µ ‖pψ(v)− v‖22\n= 1\n2µ\n( ‖pψ(v)− u‖2 − ‖u− v‖2 ) .\nProof of Theorem 2.1. Let I be the set of all iteration indices until k − 1-st for which no skipping occurs and let Ic be its complement. Let I = {ni}, i = 0, . . . , kn − 1. It follows that for all n ∈ Ic xn+1 = yn.\nFor n ∈ I we can apply Lemma 5.1 to obtain the following inequalities. In (23), by letting ψ = f , φ = g, u = x∗ and u = xn+1, we get pψ(v) = yn+1, Φ = F and\n2µ(F (x∗)− F (yn+1)) ≥ ‖yn+1 − x∗‖2 − ‖xn+1 − x∗‖2. (29) Similarly, by letting ψ = g, φ = f , u = x∗ and v = yn in (23) we get pg(v) = xn+1, Φ = F and\n2µ(F (x∗)− F (xn+1)) ≥ ‖xn+1 − x∗‖2 − ‖yn − x∗‖2. (30)\nTaking the summation of (29) and (30) we get\n2µ(2F (x∗)− F (xn+1)− F (yn+1)) ≥ ‖yn+1 − x∗‖2 − ‖yn − x∗‖2. (31)\nFor n ∈ Ic, (29) holds, and we get 2µ(F (x∗)− F (yn+1)) ≥ ‖yn+1 − x∗‖2 − ‖yn − x∗‖2, (32)\ndue to the fact that xn+1 = yn in this case.\nSumming (31) and (32) over n = 0, 1, . . . , k − 1 we get\n2µ((2|I|+ |Ic|)F (x∗)− ∑\nn∈I\nF (xn+1)− k−1 ∑\nn=0\nF (yn+1)) (33)\n≥ k−1 ∑\nn=0\n( ‖yn+1 − x∗‖2 − ‖yn − x∗‖2 )\n=‖yk − x∗‖2 − ‖y0 − x∗‖2\n≥− ‖x0 − x∗‖2.\nFor any n, since Lemma 5.1 holds for any u, letting u = xn+1 instead of x∗ we get from (29) that\n2µ(F (xn+1)− F (yn+1)) ≥ ‖yn+1 − xn+1‖2 ≥ 0, (34) or, equivalently,\n2µ(F (xn)− F (yn)) ≥ ‖yn − xn‖2 ≥ 0. (35)\nSimilarly, for n ∈ I by letting u = yn instead of x∗ we get from (30) that 2µ(F (yn)− F (xn+1)) ≥ ‖xn+1 − yn‖2 ≥ 0. (36)\nOn the other hand, for n ∈ Ic, (36) also holds because xn+1 = yn, and hence holds for all n. Adding (34) and (36) we obtain\n2µ(F (yn)− F (yn+1)) ≥ 0. (37) and adding (35) and (36) we obtain\n2µ(F (xn)− F (xn+1)) ≥ 0. (38) (37) and (38) show that the sequences F (yn) and F (xn) are non-increasing. Thus we have,\nk−1 ∑\nn=0\nF (yn+1) ≥ kF (yk) and ∑\nn∈I\nF (xn+1) ≥ knF (xk). (39)\nCombining (33) and (39) yields\n2µ ( (k + kn)F (x ∗)− knF (xk)− kF (yk) ) ≥ −‖x0 − x∗‖2. (40)\nFrom (35) we know that F (xk) ≥ F (yk). Thus (40) implies that\n2µ(k + kn) ( F (yk)− F (x∗) ) ≤ ‖x0 − x∗‖2, which gives us the desired result (11).\nAlso, for any given ǫ > 0, as long as k ≥ L(f)‖x 0−x∗‖2\n2βǫ , we have from (11) that F (y k)−F (x∗) ≤ ǫ;\ni.e., the number of iterations needed is O(1/ǫ) for an ǫ-optimal solution."

Because the conditional independencies between different nodes correspond to zero entries in the inverse covariance matrix of the Gaussian distribution, one can learn the structure of the graph by estimating a sparse inverse covariance matrix from sample data, by solving a convex maximum likelihood problem with an l1-regularization term. In this paper, we propose a first-order method based on an alternating linearization technique that exploits the problem’s special structure; in particular, the subproblems solved in each iteration have closed-form solutions. Moreover, our algorithm obtains an ǫ-optimal solution in O(1/ǫ) iterations. Numerical experiments on both synthetic and real data from gene association networks show that a practical version of this algorithm outperforms other competitive algorithms.",
