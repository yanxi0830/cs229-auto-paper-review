We suggest an effective architecture of the neural networks for approximating an action-value function with binary vector actions. The proposed architecture approximates the action-value function by a linear function with respect to the action vector, but is still non-linear with respect to the state input. We show that this approximation method enables the efficient calculation of greedy action selection and softmax action selection. Using this architecture, we suggest an online algorithm based on Q-learning. The empirical results in the grid world and the blocker task suggest that our approximation architecture would be effective for the RL problems with large discrete action sets."

      "text" : "One of the big challenges in reinforcement learning (RL) is learning in high dimensional state-action spaces. Recent advances in deep learning technologies have enabled us to treat RL problems with the high-dimensional state space, and it achieved an impressive result in general game playing tasks (e.g. ATARI game plays) [1].\nEven though several approaches are suggested for RL with continuous actions [2][3], RL with a large action space is still problematic, especially when we treat binary vectors as representations of the actions. The difficulty is that the number of actions exponentially grows as the length of the binary vector grows. Recently, several approaches have been used to tackle this problem. Sallans & Hinton suggested an energy-based approach in which restricted Boltzmann machines [4] were adopted in the algorithm and their free energy was used as the function approximator [5]. Heess et al. followed their energy-based approach and investigated natural actor-critic algorithms with energybased policies by RBMs [6]. Although energy-based approaches are known to be effective in large discrete domains, exact action sampling is intractable due to the nonlinearity of the approximation architecture. Hence, an energy-based approach samples actions by Gibbs sampling.\nHowever, the Gibbs sampling-based action selection is computationally expensive and requires careful tuning of the parameters. Also, because of the intractability of the exact sampling of greedy actions, no Q-learning-based online off-policy RL algorithm has so far been proposed for the large discrete action domain. From this background, we treat this issue and suggest novel architecture for the off-policy RL with the a large discrete action set.\n∗This paper was accepted at Deep Reinforcement Learning Workshop, NIPS 2015\n1"

      "text" : "The value-based reinforcement learning algorithms utilize the Markov decision process (MDP) assumption. The MDP is defined by a tuple 〈S,A, P,R〉. S is the state set, A is the action set, P is the transition probability P (s′|s, a), where s′ ∈ S is the next state given a state-action pair (s, a). Finally R is the average reward function R(s, a) = E[r|s, a] and r is the reward sample. In the value-based RL, the action-value function Qπ(s, a) is defined by\nQπ(s, a) = Eπ\n[ ∞ ∑\nt=0\nγtrt\n∣ ∣ ∣ s0 = s, a0 = a ] , (1)\nhere, 0 ≤ γ < 1 is the discount factor. In value-based RL, we look for the optimal policy π∗ that maximizes the action-values for every state-action pair. Q-learning is an algorithm for finding the optimal policy in MDP [7], and the advantage of Q-learning is its off-policy property: the agent can directly approximate the action-value of an optimal policy π∗ while following the other policy π.\nAlthough Q-learning is guaranteed to approximate optimal action-values when we use the tabular functions in a discrete state-action environment [8], tabular function-based approaches become quickly inefficient for RL with large state-action spaces. Then, function approximations become necessary in such domains."

(11)\nBecause we can efficiently sample the greedy action, the ǫ-greedy action selection is tractable in our case. In the experiment section, we tested some variants of the ǫ-greedy action selection.\nThe exact sampling from the softmax action selection for binary vector actions is also tractable.

In this case, if the agent takes the first option and third option, an action is represented as a 5-bit vector (1, 0| 0, 0, 1)⊤).

The agent has 4 discrete actions that correspond to the 4 direction moves (North, South, East, West).

Therefore, efficient sampling of the action is also required in this domain.\nIn this experiment, we used MLPs with 50 hidden units. We tested three types of behavior policies. The first policy is the conventional ǫ-greedy policy. We used ǫ = 0.3 in the task. the second policy is the bit-wise ǫ-greedy policy. In this policy, each bit of the action element undertakes ǫbit-greedy exploration. More concretely, the i-th element of the action vector takes the random action (ai = 1 with probability 0.5) with probability ǫbit. Because we can sample the greedy actions with ease, we can explicitly take this behavior policy. We used ǫbit = 0.05 in this experiment. The third policy is the sofmax policy that was explained in section 3.1. We used β = 20 in this experiment.\nFigure 4 shows the result of the experiment. The horizontal axis represents the number of episodes, the vertical axis is the step size in the episode. The solid lines are the mean performance of 10 runs and the bars are standard deviations. The broken lines are the optimal step size. The results show that all three behavior policies successfully improved the performance of the agent in the highdimensional action space. From these results, the bit-wise ǫ-greedy policy (center) and the softmax policy (right) shows better performance than that of the conventional ǫ-greedy policy (left). This would be because of the large exploration rate in the ǫ-greedy policy (ǫ = 0.3), but running with a smaller exploration rate (ǫ ≤ 0.2) sometimes resulted in divergence of the parameters during the learning.\n6"

Agents and blockers never overlap each other in the grid. To obtain a positive reward, agents need to cooperate in this environment. The “team” of agents obtain a +1 reward when any one of the three agents enters the end-zone, otherwise the team receives a −1 reward. The state vector is given as a 141 binary vector, composed of the positions (grid cells) of all the agents (28 bits × 3 agents), the east most positions of each blocker (28 bits × 2 blockers) and a bias bit that is always one (1 bit). Each agent can move to any of the four directions. Hence the size of the action space is 43 = 64. In this environment, the representation of the action is given as a 12-bit binary vector in which the three one-hot representation is concatenated (for example, (North, North, North) actions corresponding to the vector (1, 0, 0, 0|1, 0, 0, 0|1, 0, 0, 0)⊤). In each episode, the agents start at a random position in the bottom row of the grid. When one of the agents enters the end-zone or 40 time steps have passed, the episode terminates and the next episode starts after the initialization of the environment.\nIn this task, we used MLPs with 100 hidden units. The ǫ-greedy policy was used as the behavior policy. In this task, we used ǫ = 0.3. Also, we tested the agent-wise ǫ-greedy policy as the behavior policy. This policy is a modified version of the ǫ-greedy policy for actions with factored representation, and each agent follows the ǫ-greedy policy independently. In the case of the agentwise-ǫ-greedy policy, we used ǫ = 0.1 for each agent.\nFigure 5 shows the results of the experiment. The horizontal axis represents the time steps, and the vertical axis represents the average reward during the last 1000 steps. The left panel is the result of the conventional ǫ-greedy action selection, the right panel is that of the agent-wise ǫ-greedy action selection.

(23)\n7\nIn this case, the parameter θ is give as a matrix. If the state is given by a one-hot representation, this approximation is identical with the table representation. As suggested in our method, the linear architecture with respect to the action enables efficient sampling of the greedy action. More recently, Mnih et al. proposed a DQN architecture [10]. In this case, we evaluate the action-values corresponding to all the discrete actions by a single forward propagation. And then the training of the approximator is done only on the output, which corresponds to the selected action. This architecture can be interpreted as a linear function approximation with respect to the actions\nQθ(s, a) = a ⊤φθ(s). (24)\nIf we construct φθ(s) by some nonlinear function with high representational power such as deep neural networks, this approximation is sufficient for approximating the Q-values when actions are given by one-hot representation vectors.\nThe goal of our architecture (equation 7) is to adapt these ideas to the RL with binary vector actions. Although our function approximator is strongly restricted by the linear architecture with respect to the action, our function approximator is sufficient to represent an arbitrary deterministic policy π(s) by argmaxa Qθ(s, a) even when we treat the binary vector actions, as long as we represent φθ(s) by a universal function approximator."

The Q-learning-based off-policy algorithm is therefore tractable in our architecture without any Monte-Carlo approximations. We empirically tested our method in several discrete action domains, and the results supported its effectiveness. Based on these promising results, we expect to extend our approach using deep architectures in a future work."

    "abstractText" : "In this paper reinforcement learning with binary vector actions was investigated. We suggest an effective architecture of the neural networks for approximating an action-value function with binary vector actions. The proposed architecture approximates the action-value function by a linear function with respect to the action vector, but is still non-linear with respect to the state input. We show that this approximation method enables the efficient calculation of greedy action selection and softmax action selection. Using this architecture, we suggest an online algorithm based on Q-learning. The empirical results in the grid world and the blocker task suggest that our approximation architecture would be effective for the RL problems with large discrete action sets.",
