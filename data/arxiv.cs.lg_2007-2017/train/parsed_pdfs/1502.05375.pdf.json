      "text" : "By now, the “Parity Problem” of Blum, Kalai and Wasserman [BKW03] has acquired widespread notoriety. The question is simple enough to be in our second sentence: in order to learn a hidden vector x ∈ {0, 1}n, what is the least number of random examples (a, ℓ) that need to be seen, where a is uniformly chosen from {0, 1}n and ℓ = ∑\ni aixi (mod 2) with probability at least 1 − η? Information-theoretically, x can be recovered only after O(n) examples, even if the noise rate η is close to 1/2. But if we add the additional constraint that the running time of the learning algorithm be minimized, the barely subexponential running time of [BKW03]’s algorithm, 2O(n/ log n), still holds the record of being the fastest known for this problem!\nLearning parities with noise is a central problem in theoretical computer science. It has incarnations in several different areas of computer science, including coding theory as the problem of learning random binary linear codes and cryptography as the “learning with errors” problem that underlies lattice-based cryptosystems [Reg09, BV11]. In learning theory, the special case of the problem where the hidden vector x is known to be supported on a set of size k much smaller than n has great relevance. We refer to this problem as learning k-parity with noise or k-LPN. Feldman et al. [FGKP09] showed that learning k-juntas, as well as learning 2k-term DNFs from uniformly random examples and variants of these problems in which the noise is adversarial instead of random, all reduce to the k-LPN problem. For the k-LPN problem, the current record is that of Grigorescu, Reyzin and Vempala [GRV11] who showed a learning algorithm that succeeds with constant probability, takes (\nn k/2 )1+(2η)2+o(1) time and uses k logn(1−2η)2 · ω(1) samples.

Valiant [Val12] that runs in time n0.8k · poly( 11−2η ). It is a wide open challenge to find a polynomial time algorithm for k-LPN for growing k or to prove a negative result.\nAnother outstanding challenge in machine learning is the problem of learning parities without noise in the “attribute-efficient” setting [Blu96]. The algorithm is given access to a source of examples (a, ℓ) where a is chosen uniformly from {0, 1}n and ℓ = ∑\ni aixi (mod 2) with no noise, and the question is to learn x while simultaneously reducing the time complexity and the number of examples drawn by the algorithm. Again, we focus on the case where x has sparsity k ≪ n. Information-theoretically, of course, O(k logn) examples should be sufficient, as each linearly independent example reduces the number of consistent k-parities by a factor of 2. But the fastest known algorithm making O(k logn) samples runs in time Õ( (\nn k/2\n)\n) [KS06], and it\nis open whether there exists a polynomial time algorithm for learning parities that is attribute-efficient, i.e. it makes poly(k logn) samples. Buhrman, Garćıa-Soriano and Matsliah [BGM10] give the current best tradeoffs between the sample complexity and running time for learning parities in this noiseless setting. Notice that with O(n) samples, it is easy to learn the k-parity in polynomial time using Gaussian elimination."

      "heading" : "1.1 Our Results",
      "text" : "We first study the noiseless setting. Our main technical result is an improved tradeoff between the sample complexity and runtime for learning parities.\nTheorem 1.1. Let k, t : N → N be two functions1 satisfying log logn ≪ k(n) ≪ t(n) ≪ n. For any δ > 0, there is an algorithm that learns the concept class of k-parities on n variables with confidence parameter δ, using O(kn/t + log (\nt k\n) + log(1/δ)) uniformly random examples and e−k/4.01 ( t k )\n· poly(n) · log(1/δ) running time2.\nActually, we prove our result in the mistake-bound model [Lit89] that is stronger than the PAC model discussed above (in fact, strictly stronger assuming the existence of one-way functions [Blu94]). As a consequence, a theorem of the above form also holds when the examples come from an arbitrary distribution. We defer the statement of the result for the mistake-bound model to Section 3.\nFor comparison, let us quote the closely related result of Buhrman et. al.:\nTheorem 1.2 (Theorem 2.1 of [BGM10]). Let k, t : N → N be two functions satisfying k(n) 6 t(n) 6 n. For any δ > 0, there is an algorithm that learns the concept class of k-parities on n variables with confidence parameter δ, using O(kn/t+log (\nt k\n) +log(1/δ)) uniformly random examples and ( t k )\n·poly(n)·log(1/δ) running time.\nThus, in the comparable regime, our Theorem 1.1 improves the runtime complexity of Theorem 3.2 by an exp(k) factor while its sample complexity remains the same upto constant factors. Note that as t approaches k, our algorithm makes O(n) samples and takes poly(n) time which is the complexity of the Gaussian elimination approach. On the other hand, if t = n/ log(n/k), our algorithm makes O(k log(n/k)) samples and takes3 exp(−k) · (\nn/k k\n)\ntime (ignoring polynomial factors), compared to the trivial approach which explicitly keeps track of the subset of all the k-weight parities consistent with examples given so far and which makes O(k log(n/k)) samples and takes O( (\nn k\n)\n) time. We next examine the noisy setting. Here, our contribution is a simple, general observation that does not\nseem to have been explicitly made before.\nTheorem 1.3. Given an algorithm A that learns PAR(k) over the uniform distribution with confidence parameter δ using s(δ) samples and running time t(δ),there is an algorithm A′ that solves the k-LPN problem with noise rate η ∈ (0, 1/3), using O(s(δ/2) log(1/δ)) examples and running time exp(O(H(3η/2) · s(δ/2) · log(1/δ)))) · (t(δ/2) + s(δ/2) log(1/δ)) and with confidence parameter δ.\n1We assume throughout, as in [BGM10], that k and t are constructible in quadratic time. 2The “4.01” can be replaced by any constant more than 4. 3By exp(·), we mean 2O(·).\nIn the above, H : [0, 1] → [0, 1] denotes the binary entropy function H(p) = p log2 1 p + (1 − p) log2 1 1−p . The main conceptual message carried by Theorem 1.3 is that improving the sample complexity for efficient learning of noiseless parity improves the running time for learning of noisy parity. For instance, if we use Spielman’s algorithm as A, reported in [KS06], that learns k-parity using O(k logn) samples and O( (\nn k/2\n)\n)\nrunning time, we immediately get the following:\nCorollary 1.4. For any η ∈ (0, 1/3) and constant confidence parameter, there is an algorithm for k-LPN with sample complexity O(k log n) and running time (\nn k/2 )1+O(H(1.5η)) .\nFor comparison, the current best result of [GRV11] has runtime ( n k/2\n)1+4η2+o(1) and sample complex-\nity ω(k logn). In the regime under consideration, our algorithm’s runtime has a worse exponent but an asymptotically better sample complexity.\nThe result of [GRV11] requires ( n k/2 ) time regardless of how small η is. We show via Theorem 1.3 and\nTheorem 1.1 that it is possible to break the ( n k/2 ) barrier when η is a small enough function of n.\nCorollary 1.5. Suppose k(n) = n/f(n) for some function f : N → N for which f(n) ≪ n/ log logn, and suppose η(n) = o( 1((f(n))α logn) ) for some α ∈ [1/2, 1). Then, for constant confidence parameter, there exists an algorithm for k-LPN with noise rate η with running time e−k/4.01+o(k) · (\nn k )1−α · poly(n) and sample\ncomplexity O(k(f(n))α).\nWe note that because of the results of Feldman et. al. [FGKP09], the above results for k-LPN also extend to the setting where the example source adversarially mislabels examples instead of randomly but with the same rate η."

      "text" : "We first give an algorithm to learn parities in the noiseless setting in the mistake bound model. We use the same approach as that of [BGM10] (which was itself inspired by [APY09]). The idea is to consider a family S of subsets of {0, 1}n such that the hidden k-sparse vector is contained inside one of the elements of S. We maintain this invariant throughout the algorithm. Now, each time an example comes, it specifies a halfspace H of {0, 1}n inside which the hidden vector is lying. So, we can update S by taking the intersection of each of its elements with H . If we can ensure that the set of points covered by the elements of S is decreasing by a constant factor at every round, then after O(log ∑\nS∈S |S|) examples, the hidden vector is learned. The runtime is determined by the number of sets in S times the cost of taking the intersection of each set with a halfspace.\nOne can think of the argument of Buhrman et al. [BGM10] as essentially initializing S to be the set of all (\nn k\n)\nsubspaces spanned by k standard basis vectors. The intersections of these subspaces with a halfspace can be computed efficiently by Gaussian elimination. Our idea is to reduce the number of sets in S. Note that we can afford to make the size of each set in S larger by some factor C because this only increases the sample complexity by an additive logC. Our approach is (essentially) to take S to be a random collection of subspaces spanned by αk standard basis vectors, where α > 1 is a sufficiently large constant. We show that it is sufficient for the size of S to be smaller than (\nn/α k\n)\nby a factor that is exponential in k, so that the running time is also improved by the same factor. Moreover, the sample complexity increases by only a lower-order additive term.\nOur second main contribution is a reduction from noiseless parity learning to noisy parity learning. The algorithm is a simple exhaustive search which guesses the location of the mislabelings, corrects those labels, applies the learner for noiseless parity and then verifies whether the output hypothesis matches the examples by drawing a few more samples. Surprisingly, this seemingly immediate algorithm allows us to devise the first algorithm which has a better running time than (\nn k/2\n)\nin the presence of a non-trivial amount of noise.\nThe lesson seems to be that if we hope to beat ( n k/2 ) for constant noise rates, we should first address the open question of Blum [Blu96] of devising an attribute-efficient algorithm to learn parity without noise."

With each vector f ∈ PAR(k), we associate a parity function f : {0, 1}n → {0, 1} defined by f(a) =\n∑n i=1 xiai (mod 2).\nLet C be a concept class of Boolean functions on n variables, such as PAR(k). We discuss two models of learning in this work. One is Littlestone’s online mistake bound model [Lit89]. Here, learning proceeds in a series of rounds, where in each round, the learner is given an unlabeled boolean example a ∈ {0, 1}n and must predict the value f(a) of an unknown target function f ∈ C. Once the learner predicts the value of f(a), the true value of f(a) is revealed to the learner by the teacher. The mistake bound of a learning algorithm is the worst-case number of mistakes that the algorithm makes over all sequences of examples and all possible target functions f ∈ C.\nThe second model of learning we consider is Valiant’s famous PAC model [Val84] of learning from random examples. Here, for an unknown target function f ∈ C, the learner has access to a source of examples (a, f(a)) where a is chosen independently from a distribution D on {0, 1}n. A learning algorithm is said to PAC-learn C with sample complexity s, running time t, approximation parameter ε and confidence parameter δ if for all distributions D and all target functions f ∈ C, the algorithm draws at most s samples from the example source, runs for time at most t and outputs a function f∗ such that, with a probability at least 1− δ:\nPr a←D\n[f(a) 6= f∗(a)] < ε\nOften in this paper (e.g., all of the Introduction), we consider PAC-learning over the uniform distribution, in which case D is fixed to be uniform on {0, 1}n. Notice that for learning PAR(k) over the uniform distribution, we can take ε = 12 because any two distinct parities differ on half of {0, 1}\nn. There are standard conversion techniques which can be used to transform any mistake-bound algorithm\ninto a PAC learning algorithm (over arbitrary distributions):\nTheorem 2.1 ([Ang88, Hau88, Lit89]). Any algorithm A that learns a concept class C in the mistake-bound model with mistake bound m and running time t per round can be converted into an algorithm A′ that PAClearns C with sample complexity O(1εm+ 1 ε log 1 δ ), running time O( 1 εmt+ t ε log 1 δ ), approximation parameter ε, and confidence parameter δ.\nThe k-LPN problem with noise rate η, introduced in Section 1, corresponds to the problem of PAClearning PAR(k) under the uniform distribution, when the example source can mislabel examples with a rate η ∈ (0, 1/2). More generally, one can study the k-LPN problem over D, an arbitrary distribution. [GRV11] show the following for this problem:\nTheorem 2.2 (Theorem 5 of [GRV11]). For any ε, δ, η ∈ (0, 1/2), and distribution D over {0, 1}n, the k-LPN problem over D with noise rate η can be solved using k log(n/δ)ω(1)ε2(1−2η)2 samples in time 1\nε2(1−2η)2 · (\nn k/2\n)1+( η ε+η−2εη )2+o(1) , where ε and δ are the approximation and confidence parameters respectively."

This holds at initiation by the argument given earlier. After that, obviously, if f ∈ Ni, then f ∈ Ni(a, f(a)) for any a ∈ {0, 1}n, and so the invariant holds. Therefore, if the algorithm terminates, it will find the hidden vector f and return it as the solution. The rate of convergence is precisely captured by the number of mistakes learning algorithm makes, which we describe next.\nMistake Bound. Notice that when the algorithm begins, the sum of the sizes of all the affine spaces, ∑\ni |Ni| 6 Õ\n(\n( Tαk) ( T−kαk−k)\n)\n2(1+o(1))kn/t. Now whenever the learner makes a mistake by predicting ŷ 6= y, the size\nof all affine spaces ∑\ni |Ni| reduces by a factor of at least 2. This is due to the definition of ŷ and the fact that |Ni(a, ŷ)|+ |Ni(a, 1− ŷ)| = |Ni|.\nHence, using Lemma 3.4, after at most\nlog\n(\n∑\ni\n|Ni|\n)\n6 log\n[\nÕ\n(\n(\nT αk\n)\n(\nT−k αk−k\n)\n)\n2(1+o(1))kn/t\n]\n6 (1 + o(1))kn/t+ log\n(\nt\nk\n)\n− Ω(k) + logO\n(\nlog\n(\nt\nk\n))\nmistakes, the size of ∪s∈SNs will decrease to 1, which by the invariant above will imply that ∪s∈SNs = {f}, and hence the learner makes no more mistakes. . Since we assume k ≫ log logn and t ≪ n, we can bound the number of mistakes by: (1 + o(1))kn/t+ log (\nt k\n)\nRunning Time. We analyze the running time of the learner for each round. At each round, for a question a ∈ {0, 1}n, we need to compute |Ni(a, 0)| and |Ni(a, 1)| as well as store a representation of the updated Ni. Now, since for each Ni is spanned by at most ℓ = (1 + o(1))kn/t basis vectors, we can treat each Ni as a linear subspace in {0, 1}ℓ. Ni(a, 0) and Ni(a, 1) can be computed by performing Gaussian elimination on a system of linear equations involving ℓ variables, which takes O(ℓ2) time. Thus, the total running time is O(mℓ2), which using Lemma 3.4 is exactly the bound claimed in Theorem 3.1."

On the other hand, for all xS 6= xT , Prbi [〈xS , bi〉 6= 〈x, bi〉] = 1/2, and so Prbi [〈xS , bi〉 6= mi] = 1/2 as the noise is random. Again, using Chernoff bounds,\nPr[∃S 6= T s.t.|{i ∈ [s′′] : 〈bi, xS〉 6= mi}| 6 5s ′′/12] 6 2H(3η/2)s\n′ · e−s ′′/450 <\nδ\n8\nOn the other hand, for xT itself, Pr[|{i ∈ [s ′′] : 〈bi, xT 〉 6= mi}| > 5s ′′/12] < δ8 by a similar use of Chernoff bounds. So, in all, with probability at least 1− δ, xT will be returned in step 12.\nWhen the noise rate η is more than 1/3, a similar reduction can be given by adjusting the parameters accordingly. Also, when the distribution is arbitrary but the noise rate is less than 1/4, a similar reduction can be made to work. In the latter case, A is invoked with a smaller approximation parameter than the one given to Noisy so that the filtering step in line 10 works."

(We ignore the confidence parameter in this\nsection for simplicity.)\nCorollary 1.4 (recalled) For any η ∈ (0, 1/3) and constant confidence parameter, there is an algorithm for k-LPN with sample complexity O(k logn) and running time (\nn k/2 )1+O(H(1.5η)) .\nProof. Immediate from Theorem 1.3.\nOur next application of Theorem 1.1 uses our improved PAR(k) learning algorithm from Section 3.\nCorollary 1.5 (recalled) Suppose k(n) = n/f(n) for some function f : N → N for which 1 ≪ f(n) ≪ n/ log logn, and suppose η(n) = o(1/((f(n))α logn)) for some α ∈ [1/2, 1). Then, for constant confidence parameter, there exists an algorithm for k-LPN with noise rate η with running time e−k/4.01+o(k) · (\nn k )1−α ·\npoly(n) and sample complexity O(k(f(n))α).\nProof. Let A be the algorithm of Theorem 1.1 with t(n) = ⌈n/(f(n))α⌉. The running time of A is e−k/4.01 · (\nn k )1−α · poly(n) and its sample complexity is O(k · f(n))α). Now, applying Theorem 1.3, we see that since H(1.5η) = o((f(n))−α), the running time for Noisy is only a 2o(k) factor times the running time of A. This yields our desired result.\n4Though a similar algorithm was also proposed by Hopper and Blum [HB01]"

We improve the previous best result of Buhrman et. al. [BGM10] by an exp(k) factor in the time complexity. Second, we consider the problem of learning k-parities in the presence of classification noise of rate η ∈ (0, 1/2). A polynomial time algorithm for this problem (when η > 0 and k = ω(1)) is a longstanding challenge in learning theory. Grigorescu et al. [GRV11] showed an algorithm running in time ( n k/2 )1+4η+o(1) . Note that this algorithm inherently requires time ( n k/2 ) even when the noise rate η is polynomially small. We observe that for sufficiently small noise rate, it is possible to break the ( n k/2 ) barrier. In particular, if for some function f(n) = ω(1) and α ∈ [1/2, 1), k = n/f(n) and η = o(f(n)/ log n), then there is an algorithm for the problem with running time poly(n) · ( n k )1−α · e.",
