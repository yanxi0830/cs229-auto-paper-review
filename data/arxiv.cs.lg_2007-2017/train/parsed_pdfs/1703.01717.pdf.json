However, many exact\n1Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA USA 2Microsoft Research New England, Cambridge, MA USA. Correspondence to: Jackson Gorham <jgorham@stanford.edu>, Lester Mackey <lmackey@microsoft.com>.\nMCMC methods are computationally expensive, and recent years have seen the introduction of biased MCMC procedures (see, e.g., Welling & Teh, 2011; Ahn et al., 2012; Korattikara et al., 2014) that exchange asymptotic correctness for increased sampling speed.\nSince standard MCMC diagnostics, like mean and trace plots, pooled and within-chain variance measures, effective sample size, and asymptotic variance (Brooks et al., 2011), do not account for asymptotic bias, Gorham & Mackey (2015) defined a new family of sample quality measures – the Stein discrepancies – that measure how well EQn approximates EP while avoiding explicit integration under P . Gorham & Mackey (2015); Mackey & Gorham (2016); Gorham et al. (2016) further showed that specific members of this family – the graph Stein discrepancies – were (a) efficiently computable by solving a linear program and (b) convergence-determining for large classes of targets P . Building on the zero mean reproducing kernel theory of Oates et al. (2016b), Chwialkowski et al. (2016) and Liu et al. (2016) later showed that other members of the Stein discrepancy family had a closed-form solution involving the sum of kernel evaluations over pairs of sample points.\nThis closed form represents a significant practical advantage, as no linear program solvers are necessary, and the computation of the discrepancy can be easily parallelized. However, as we will see in Section 3.2, not all kernel Stein discrepancies are suitable for our setting. In particular, in dimension d ≥ 3, the kernel Stein discrepancies previously recommended in the literature fail to detect when a sample is not converging to the target. To address this shortcoming, we develop a theory of weak convergence for the kernel Stein discrepancies analogous to that of (Gorham & Mackey, 2015; Mackey & Gorham, 2016; Gorham et al., 2016) and design a class of kernel Stein discrepancies that provably control weak convergence for a large class of target distributions.\nAfter formally describing our goals for measuring sample quality in Section 2, we outline our strategy, based on Stein’s method, for constructing and analyzing practical quality measures at the start of Section 3. In Section 3.1, we define our family of closed-form quality measures – the kernel Stein discrepancies (KSDs) – and establish several appealing practical properties of these measures. We an-\nar X\niv :1\n70 3.\n01 71\n7v 8\n[ st\nat .M\nL ]\n1 3\nSe p\n20 17\nalyze the convergence properties of KSDs in Sections 3.2 and 3.3, showing that previously proposed KSDs fail to detect non-convergence and proposing practical convergencedetermining alternatives. Section 4 illustrates the value of convergence-determining kernel Stein discrepancies in a variety of applications, including hyperparameter selection, sampler selection, one-sample hypothesis testing, and sample quality improvement. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude with a discussion of related and future work.\nNotation We will use µ to denote a generic probability measure and ⇒ to denote the weak convergence of a sequence of probability measures. We will use ‖·‖r for r ∈ [1,∞] to represent the `r norm on Rd and occasionally refer to a generic norm ‖·‖ with associated dual norm ‖a‖∗ , supb∈Rd,‖b‖=1 〈a, b〉 for vectors a ∈ Rd. We let ej be the j-th standard basis vector. For any function g : Rd → Rd′ , we define M0(g) , supx∈Rd‖g(x)‖2, M1(g) , supx 6=y‖g(x)− g(y)‖2/‖x− y‖2, and ∇g as the gradient with components (∇g(x))jk , ∇xkgj(x). We further let g ∈ Cm indicate that g is m times continuously differentiable and g ∈ Cm0 indicate that g ∈ Cm and ∇lg is vanishing at infinity for all l ∈ {0, . . . ,m}. We define C(m,m) (respectively, C(m,m)b and C (m,m) 0 ) to be the set of functions k : Rd × Rd → R with (x, y) 7→ ∇lx∇lyk(x, y) continuous (respectively, continuous and uniformly bounded, continuous and vanishing at infinity) for all l ∈ {0, . . . ,m}."

      "text" : "Consider a target distribution P with continuously differentiable (Lebesgue) density p supported on all of Rd. We assume that the score function b , ∇ log p can be evaluated1 but that, for most functions of interest, direct integration under P is infeasible. We will therefore approximate integration under P using a weighted sample Qn =∑n i=1 qn(xi)δxi with sample points x1, . . . , xn ∈ Rd and qn a probability mass function. We will make no assumptions about the origins of the sample points; they may be the output of a Markov chain or even deterministically generated. Each Qn offers an approximation EQn [h(X)] =∑n i=1 qn(xi)h(xi) for each intractable expectation EP [h(Z)], and our aim is to effectively compare the quality of the approximation offered by any two samples targeting P . In particular, we wish to produce a quality measure that (i) identifies when a sequence of samples is converging to the target, (ii) determines when a sequence of samples is not converging to the target, and (iii) is efficiently computable. Since our interest is in approximating expectations, we will consider discrepancies\n1No knowledge of the normalizing constant is needed.\nquantifying the maximum expectation error over a class of test functionsH:\ndH(Qn, P ) , sup h∈H |EP [h(Z)]− EQn [h(X)]|.

For example, when H = BL‖·‖2 , {h : Rd → R |M0(h) + M1(h) ≤ 1}, the IPM dBL‖·‖2 is called the bounded Lipschitz or Dudley metric and exactly metrizes convergence in distribution. Alternatively, when H = W‖·‖2 , {h : R\nd → R |M1(h) ≤ 1} is the set of 1-Lipschitz functions, the IPM dW‖·‖ in (1) is known as the Wasserstein metric.\nAn apparent practical problem with using the IPM dH as a sample quality measure is that EP [h(Z)] may not be computable for h ∈ H. However, if H were chosen such that EP [h(Z)] = 0 for all h ∈ H, then no explicit integration under P would be necessary. To generate such a class of test functions and to show that the resulting IPM still satisfies our desiderata, we follow the lead of Gorham & Mackey (2015) and consider Charles Stein’s method for characterizing distributional convergence."

      "text" : "A standard, widely applicable univariate Stein operator is the density method operator (see Stein et al., 2004; Chatterjee & Shao, 2011; Chen et al., 2011; Ley et al., 2017),\n(T g)(x) , 1p(x) d dx (p(x)g(x)) = g(x)b(x) + g ′(x).\nInspired by the generator method of Barbour (1988; 1990) and Götze (1991), Gorham & Mackey (2015) generalized this operator to multiple dimensions. The resulting Langevin Stein operator\n(TP g)(x) , 1p(x) 〈∇, p(x)g(x)〉 = 〈g(x), b(x)〉+ 〈∇, g(x)〉\nfor functions g : Rd → Rd was independently developed, without connection to Stein’s method, by Oates et al. (2016b) for the design of Monte Carlo control functionals. Notably, the Langevin Stein operator depends on P only through its score function b = ∇ log p and hence is computable even when the normalizing constant of p is not. While our work is compatible with other practical Stein operators, like the family of diffusion Stein operators defined in (Gorham et al., 2016), we will focus on the Langevin operator for the sake of brevity.\nHereafter, we will let k : Rd×Rd → R be the reproducing kernel of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) Kk of functions from Rd → R. That is, Kk is a Hilbert space of functions such that, for all x ∈ Rd, k(x, ·) ∈ Kk and f(x) = 〈f, k(x, ·)〉Kk whenever f ∈ Kk. We let ‖·‖Kk be the norm induced from the inner product on Kk.\nWith this definition, we define our kernel Stein set Gk,‖·‖ as the set of vector-valued functions g = (g1, . . . , gd) such that each component function gj belongs toKk and the vector of their norms ‖gj‖Kk belongs to the ‖·‖ ∗ unit ball:2\nGk,‖·‖ , {g = (g1, . . . , gd) | ‖v‖ ∗ ≤ 1 for vj , ‖gj‖Kk}.\nThe following result, proved in Section B, establishes that this is an acceptable domain for TP . Proposition 1 (Zero mean test functions). If k ∈ C(1,1)b and EP [‖∇ log p(Z)‖2] <∞, then EP [(TP g)(Z)] = 0 for all g ∈ Gk,‖·‖.\n2Our analyses and algorithms support each gj belonging to a different RKHS Kkj , but we will not need that flexibility here.\nThe Langevin Stein operator and kernel Stein set together define our quality measure of interest, the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD) S(µ, TP ,Gk,‖·‖). When ‖·‖ = ‖·‖2, this definition recovers the KSD proposed by Chwialkowski et al. (2016) and Liu et al. (2016). Our next result shows that, for any ‖·‖, the KSD admits a closed-form solution. Proposition 2 (KSD closed form). Suppose k ∈ C(1,1), and, for each j ∈ {1, . . . d}, define the Stein kernel\nkj0(x, y) , 1 p(x)p(y)∇xj∇yj (p(x)k(x, y)p(y)) (3)\n= bj(x)bj(y)k(x, y) + bj(x)∇yjk(x, y) + bj(y)∇xjk(x, y) +∇xj∇yjk(x, y).\nIf ∑d j=1 Eµ [ kj0(X,X) 1/2 ] < ∞, then S(µ, TP ,Gk,‖·‖) =\n‖w‖ where wj , √ Eµ×µ[kj0(X, X̃)] with X, X̃ iid∼ µ.\nThe proof is found in Section C. Notably, when µ is the discrete measure Qn = ∑n i=1 qn(xi)δxi , the KSD reduces to evaluating each kj0 at pairs of support points as wj =√∑n i,i′=1 qn(xi)k j 0(xi, xi′)qn(xi′), a computation which is easily parallelized over sample pairs and coordinates j.\nOur Stein set choice was motivated by the work of Oates et al. (2016b) who used the sum of Stein kernels k0 =∑d j=1 k j 0 to develop nonparametric control variates. Each term wj in Proposition 2 can also be viewed as an instance of the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) (Gretton et al., 2012) between µ and P measured with respect to the Stein kernel kj0. In standard uses of MMD, an arbitrary kernel function is selected, and one must be able to compute expectations of the kernel function under P . Here, this requirement is satisfied automatically, since our induced kernels are chosen to have mean zero under P .\nFor clarity we will focus on the specific kernel Stein set choice Gk , Gk,‖·‖2 for the remainder of the paper, but our results extend directly to KSDs based on any ‖·‖, since all KSDs are equivalent in a strong sense: Proposition 3 (Kernel Stein set equivalence). Under the assumptions of Proposition 2, there are constants cd, c′d > 0 depending only on d and ‖·‖ such that cdS(µ, TP ,Gk,‖·‖) ≤ S(µ, TP ,Gk,‖·‖2) ≤ c′dS(µ, TP ,Gk,‖·‖).\nThe short proof is found in Section D."

(2016) showed that the Langevin graph Stein discrepancy dominates convergence in distribution whenever P belongs to the class P of distantly dissipative distributions with Lipschitz score function b:\nDefinition 4 (Distant dissipativity (Eberle, 2015; Gorham et al., 2016)). A distribution P is distantly dissipative if κ0 , lim infr→∞ κ(r) > 0 for\nκ(r) = inf{−2 〈b(x)−b(y),x−y〉‖x−y‖22 : ‖x− y‖2 = r}. (4)\nExamples of distributions in P include finite Gaussian mixtures with common covariance and all distributions strongly log-concave outside of a compact set, including Bayesian linear, logistic, and Huber regression posteriors with Gaussian priors (see Gorham et al., 2016, Section 4). Moreover, when d = 1, membership in P is sufficient to provide a lower bound on the KSD for most common kernels including the Gaussian, Matérn, and inverse multiquadric kernels. Theorem 5 (Univariate KSD detects non-convergence). Suppose that P ∈ P and k(x, y) = Φ(x − y) for Φ ∈ C2 with a non-vanishing generalized Fourier transform. If d = 1, then S(µm, TP ,Gk)→ 0 only if µm ⇒ P .\nThe proof in Section E provides a lower bound on the KSD in terms of an IPM known to dominate weak convergence. However, our next theorem shows that in higher dimensions S(Qn, TP ,Gk) can converge to 0 without the sequence (Qn)n≥1 converging to any probability measure. This deficiency occurs even when the target is Gaussian. Theorem 6 (KSD fails with light kernel tails). Suppose k ∈ C(1,1)b and define the kernel decay rate\nγ(r) , sup{max(|k(x, y)|, ‖∇xk(x, y)‖2, |〈∇x,∇yk(x, y)〉|) : ‖x− y‖2 ≥ r}.\nIf d ≥ 3, P = N (0, Id), and γ(r) = o(r−α) for α , ( 12 − 1 d ) −1, then S(Qn, TP ,Gk)→ 0 does not imply Qn ⇒ P .\nTheorem 6 implies that KSDs based on the commonly used Gaussian kernel, Matérn kernel, and compactly supported kernels of Wendland (2004, Theorem 9.13) all fail to detect non-convergence when d ≥ 3. In addition, KSDs based on the inverse multiquadric kernel (k(x, y) = (c2 + ‖x− y‖22)β) for β < −1 fail to detect non-convergence for any d > 2β/(β + 1). The proof in Section F shows that the violating sample sequences (Qn)n≥1 are simple to construct, and we provide an empirical demonstration of this failure to detect non-convergence in Section 4.\nThe failure of the KSDs in Theorem 6 can be traced to their inability to enforce uniform tightness. A sequence of probability measures (µm)m≥1 is uniformly tight if for every > 0, there is a finite number R( ) such that lim supm µm(‖X‖2 > R( )) ≤ . Uniform tightness implies that no mass in the sequence of probability measures escapes to infinity. When the kernel k decays more rapidly than the score function grows, the KSD ignores excess mass in the tails and hence can be driven to zero by a\nnon-tight sequence of increasingly diffuse probability measures. The following theorem demonstrates uniform tightness is the missing piece to ensure weak convergence. Theorem 7 (KSD detects tight non-convergence). Suppose that P ∈ P and k(x, y) = Φ(x−y) for Φ ∈ C2 with a nonvanishing generalized Fourier transform. If (µm)m≥1 is uniformly tight, then S(µm, TP ,Gk)→ 0 only if µm ⇒ P .\nOur proof in Section G explicitly lower bounds the KSD S(µ, TP ,Gk) in terms of the bounded Lipschitz metric dBL‖·‖(µ, P ), which exactly metrizes weak convergence.\nIdeally, when a sequence of probability measures is not uniformly tight, the KSD would reflect this divergence in its reported value. To achieve this, we consider the inverse multiquadric (IMQ) kernel k(x, y) = (c2 + ‖x− y‖22)β for some β < 0 and c > 0. While KSDs based on IMQ kernels fail to determine convergence when β < −1 (by Theorem 6), our next theorem shows that they automatically enforce tightness and detect non-convergence whenever β ∈ (−1, 0). Theorem 8 (IMQ KSD detects non-convergence). Suppose P ∈ P and k(x, y) = (c2 + ‖x− y‖22)β for c > 0 and β ∈ (−1, 0). If S(µm, TP ,Gk)→ 0, then µm ⇒ P .\nThe proof in Section H provides a lower bound on the KSD in terms of the bounded Lipschitz metric dBL‖·‖(µ, P ). The success of the IMQ kernel over other common characteristic kernels can be attributed to its slow decay rate. When P ∈ P and the IMQ exponent β > −1, the function class TPGk contains unbounded (coercive) functions. These functions ensure that the IMQ KSD S(µm, TP ,Gk) goes to 0 only if (µm)m≥1 is uniformly tight."

We adopt a bimodal Gaussian mixture with p(x) ∝ e− 1 2‖x+∆e1‖ 2 2 + e− 1 2‖x−∆e1‖ 2 2 and ∆ = 1.5 as our target P and generate a first sample point sequence i.i.d. from the target and a second sequence i.i.d. from one component of the mixture, N (−∆e1, Id).

This desirable behavior is closely mirrored by the Wasserstein distance and the graph Stein discrepancy.\nThe middle panel of Figure 1 records the time consumed by the graph and kernel Stein discrepancies applied to the i.i.d. sample points from P . Each method is given access to d cores when working in d dimensions, and we use the released code of Gorham & Mackey (2015) with the default Gurobi 6.0.4 linear program solver for the graph Stein discrepancy. We find that the two methods have nearly identical runtimes when d = 1 but that the KSD is 10 to 1000 times faster when d = 4. In addition, the KSD is straightforwardly parallelized and does not require access to a linear program solver, making it an appealing practical choice for a quality measure.\nFinally, the right panel displays the optimal Stein functions, gj(y) = EQn [bj(X)k(X,y)+∇xj k(X,y)]\nS(Qn,TP ,Gk) , recovered by the IMQ KSD when d = 1 and n = 103.

A standard slice sampler must evaluate the likelihood of all L datapoints to draw each new sample point xi. To reduce this cost, the approximate slice sampler introduces a tuning parameter which determines the number of datapoints that contribute to an approximation of the slice sampling step; an appropriate setting of this parameter is imperative for accurate inference. When is too small, relatively few sample points will be generated in a given amount of sampling time, yielding sample expectations with high Monte Carlo variance. When is too large, the large approximation error will produce biased samples that no longer resemble the target.\nTo assess the suitability of the KSD for tolerance parameter selection, we take as our target P the bimodal Gaussian mixture model posterior of (Welling & Teh, 2011). For an array of values, we generated 50 independent approximate slice sampling chains with batch size 5, each with a\nbudget of 148000 likelihood evaluations, and plotted the median IMQ KSD and effective sample size (ESS, a standard sample quality measure based on asymptotic variance (Brooks et al., 2011)) in Figure 3.

The right panel of Figure 3 shows representative samples produced by several settings of .

In the full version of SGFS (termed SGFS-f), a d× d matrix must be inverted to draw each new sample point. Since this can be costly for large d, the authors developed a second sampler (termed SGFS-d) in which only a diagonal matrix must be inverted to draw each new sample point. Both samplers can be viewed as discrete-time approximations to a continuoustime Markov process that has the target P as its stationary distribution; however, because no Metropolis-Hastings correction is employed, neither sampler has the target as its stationary distribution. Hence we will use the KSD – a quality measure that accounts for asymptotic bias – to evaluate and choose between these samplers.\nSpecifically, we evaluate the SGFS-f and SGFS-d samples produced in (Ahn et al., 2012, Sec. 5.1). The target P is a Bayesian logistic regression with a flat prior, conditioned on a dataset of 104 MNIST handwritten digit images. From each image, the authors extracted 50 random projections of the raw pixel values as covariates and a label indicating whether the image was a 7 or a 9. After discarding the first half of sample points as burn-in, we obtained regression coefficient samples with 5 × 104 points and d = 51 dimensions (including the intercept term). Figure 4 displays the IMQ KSD applied to the first n points in each sample. As external validation, we follow the protocol of Ahn et al. (2012) to find the bivariate marginal means and 95% confidence ellipses of each sample that align best and worst with those of a surrogate ground truth sample obtained from a\nHamiltonian Monte Carlo chain with 105 iterates. Both the KSD and the surrogate ground truth suggest that the moderate speed-up provided by SGFS-d (0.0017s per sample vs. 0.0019s for SGFS-f) is outweighed by the significant loss in inferential accuracy. However, the KSD assessment does not require access to an external trustworthy ground truth sample. The longest KSD computation took 400s using 16 cores."

We recreate their experiment and show that this loss of power can be avoided by using our default IMQ kernel with β = − 12 and c = 1. Following (Chwialkowski et al., 2016, Section 4) we draw zi iid∼ N (0, Id) and ui iid∼ Unif[0, 1] to generate a sample (xi) n i=1 with xi = zi + ui e1 for n = 500 and various dimensions d. Using the authors’ code (modified to include an IMQ kernel), we compare the power of the Gaussian KSD test, the IMQ KSD test, and the standard normality test of Baringhaus & Henze (1988) (B&H) to discern whether the sample (xi)500i=1 came from the null distribution P = N (0, Id). The results, averaged over 400 simula-\ntions, are shown in Table 1. Notably, the IMQ KSD experiences no power degradation over this range of dimensions, thus improving on both the Gaussian KSD and the standard B&H normality tests."

Specifically, given an initial sample Qn supported on x1, . . . , xn, they minimize S(Q̃n, TP ,Gk) over all measures Q̃n supported on the same sample points to obtain a new sample that better approximates P over the class of test functions H = TPGk. In all experiments, Liu & Lee (2016) employ a Gaussian kernel k(x, y) = e− 1 h‖x−y‖ 2 2 with bandwidth h selected to be the median of the squared Euclidean distance between pairs of sample points. Using the authors’ code, we recreate the experiment from (Liu & Lee, 2016, Fig. 2b) and introduce a KSD objective with an IMQ kernel k(x, y) = (1 + 1h‖x− y‖ 2 2) −1/2 with bandwidth selected in the same fashion. The starting sample is given by Qn = 1 n ∑n i=1 δxi for n = 100, various dimensions d, and each sample point drawn i.i.d. from P = N (0, Id). For the initial sample and the optimized samples produced by each KSD, Figure 5 displays the mean squared error (MSE) 1 d‖EP [Z]− EQ̃n [X]‖ 2 2 averaged across 500 independently generated initial samples.

(2006) and the Gibbs sampler convergence criteria of Zellner & Min (1995) detect certain forms of non-convergence but fail to detect others due to the finite number of test functions tested. For example, when P = N (0, 1), the score statistic (Fan et al., 2006) only monitors sample means and variances.\nFor an approximation µ with continuously differentiable density r, Chwialkowski et al. (2016, Thm. 2.1) and Liu et al. (2016, Prop. 3.3) established that if k is C0universal (Carmeli et al., 2010, Defn. 4.1) or integrally strictly positive definite (ISPD, Stewart, 1976, Sec. 6) and Eµ[k0(X,X) + ‖∇ log p(X)r(X)‖ 2 2] < ∞ for k0 , ∑d j=1 k j 0, then S(µ, TP ,Gk) = 0 only if µ = P . However, this property is insufficient to conclude that probability measures with small KSD are close to P in any traditional sense. Indeed, Gaussian and Matérn kernels are C0 universal and ISPD, but, by Theorem 6, their KSDs can be driven to zero by sequences not converging to P . On compact domains,\nwhere tightness is no longer an issue, the combined results of (Oates et al., 2016a, Lem. 4), (Fukumizu et al., 2007, Lem. 1), and (Simon-Gabriel & Schölkopf, 2016, Thm. 55) give conditions for a KSD to dominate weak convergence.\nWhile assessing sample quality was our chief objective, our results may hold benefits for other applications that make use of Stein discrepancies or Stein operators. In particular, our kernel recommendations could be incorporated into the Monte Carlo control functionals framework of Oates et al. (2016b); Oates & Girolami (2015), the variational inference approaches of Liu & Wang (2016); Liu & Feng (2016); Ranganath et al. (2016), and the Stein generative adversarial network approach of Wang & Liu (2016).\nIn the future, we aim to leverage stochastic, low-rank, and sparse approximations of the kernel matrix and score function to produce KSDs that scale better with the number of sample and data points while still guaranteeing control over weak convergence. A reader may also wonder for which distributions outside ofP the KSD dominates weak convergence. The following theorem, proved in Section J, shows that no KSD with aC0 kernel dominates weak convergence when the target has a bounded score function. Theorem 10 (KSD fails for bounded scores). If ∇ log p is bounded and k ∈ C(1,1)0 , then S(Qn, TP ,Gk) → 0 does not imply Qn ⇒ P .\nHowever, Gorham et al. (2016) developed convergencedetermining graph Stein discrepancies for heavy-tailed targets by replacing the Langevin Stein operator TP with diffusion Stein operators of the form (T g)(x) =\n1 p(x) 〈∇, p(x)(a(x) + c(x))g(x)〉. An analogous construction should yield convergence-determining diffusion KSDs for P outside of P . Our results also extend to targets P supported on a convex subset X of Rd by choosing k to satisfy p(x)k(x, ·) ≡ 0 for all x on the boundary of X ."

Our strategy is to define a reference IPM dH for which µm ⇒ P whenever dH(µm, P ) → 0 and then upper bound dH by a function of the KSD S(µm, TP ,Gk). To construct the reference class of test functions H, we choose some integrally strictly positive definite (ISPD) kernel kb : Rd × Rd → R, that is, we select a kernel function kb such that∫\nRd×Rd kb(x, y)dµ(x)dµ(y) > 0\nfor all finite non-zero signed Borel measures µ on Rd (Sriperumbudur et al., 2010, Section 1.2). For this proof, we will choose the Gaussian kernel kb(x, y) = exp ( −‖x− y‖22/2 ) , which is ISPD by (Sriperumbudur et al., 2010, Section 3.1).\nSince r(x) , exp ( −‖x‖22/2 ) is bounded and continuous and never vanishes, the kernel k̃b(x, y) = kb(x, y)r(x)r(y) is\nalso ISPD. Let H , {h ∈ Kk̃b | ‖h‖k̃b ≤ 1}. By (Sriperumbudur, 2016, Thm. 3.2), since k̃b is ISPD with k̃b(x, ·) ∈ C0(Rd) for all x, we know that dH(µm, P ) → 0 only if µm ⇒ P . With H in hand, Theorem 5 will follow from our next theorem which upper bounds the IPM dH(µ, P ) in terms of the KSD S(µ, TP ,Gk). Theorem 11 (Univariate KSD lower bound). Let d = 1, and consider the set of univariate functions H = {h ∈ Kk̃b | ‖h‖k̃b ≤ 1}. Suppose P ∈ P and k(x, y) = Φ(x − y) for Φ ∈ C\n2 with generalized Fourier transform Φ̂ and F (t) , sup‖ω‖∞≤t Φ̂(ω)\n−1 finite for all t > 0.

Remarks An explicit value for the Stein factor MP can be derived from the proof in Section E.1 and the results of Gorham et al. (2016). After optimizing the bound dH(µ, P ) over > 0, the Gaussian, inverse multiquadric, and Matérn (v > 1) kernels achieve rates of O(1/ √ log( 1S(µ,TP ,Gk) )), O(1/ log( 1 S(µ,TP ,Gk) )), and O(S(µ, TP ,Gk) 1/(v+1/2)) respectively as S(µ, TP ,Gk)→ 0.\nIn particular, since Φ̂ is non-vanishing, F (t) is finite for all t. If S(µm, TP ,Gk) → 0, then, for any fixed > 0, we have lim supm→∞ dH(µm, P ) ≤ . Taking → 0 shows that limm→∞ dH(µm, P )→ 0, which implies that µm ⇒ P .\nE.1. Proof of Theorem 11: Univariate KSD lower bound\nFix any probability measure µ and h ∈ H, and define the tilting function Ξ(x) , (1 + ‖x‖22)1/2. The proof will proceed in three steps.\nStep 1: Uniform bounds on M0(h), M1(h) and supx∈Rd‖Ξ(x)∇h(x)‖2 We first bound M0(h), M1(h) and supx∈Rd‖Ξ(x)∇h(x)‖2 uniformly overH. To this end, we define the finite value c0 , supx∈Rd(1+‖x‖ 2 2)r(x) = 2e\n−1/2. For all x ∈ Rd, we have\n|h(x)| = |〈h, k̃b(x, ·)〉Kk̃b | ≤ ‖h‖Kk̃b k̃b(x, x) 1/2 ≤ 1.\nMoreover, we have ∇xkb(x, y) = (y − x)kb(x, y) and ∇r(x) = −xr(x). Thus for any x, by (Steinwart & Christmann, 2008, Corollary 4.36) we have\n‖∇h(x)‖2 ≤ ‖h‖Kk̃b 〈∇x,∇yk̃b(x, x)〉1/2 ≤ [d r(x)2 + ‖x‖22 r(x) 2]1/2kb(x, x) 1/2 ≤ [(d− 1)1/2 + (1 + ‖x‖22) 1/2)]r(x),\nwhere in the last inequality we used the triangle inequality. Hence ‖∇h(x)‖2 ≤ (d − 1)1/2 + 1 and ‖Ξ(x)∇h(x)‖2 ≤ (d− 1)1/2 + c0 for all x, completing our bounding of M0(h), M1(h) and supx∈Rd‖Ξ(x)∇h(x)‖2 uniformly overH.\nStep 2: Uniform bound on ‖gh‖L2 for Stein solution gh We next show that there is a solution to the P Stein equation\n(TP gh)(x) = h(x)− EP [h(Z)] (8)\nwith gh(x) ≤ MP /(1 + ‖x‖22)1/2 for every h ∈ H. When d = 1, this will imply that ‖gh‖L2 is bounded uniformly over H. To proceed, we will define a tilted distribution P̃ ∈ P and a tilted function f , show that a solution g̃f to the P̃ Stein equation is bounded, and construct a solution gh to the Stein equation of P based on g̃f .\nDefine P̃ via the tilted probability density p̃(x) ∝ p(x)/Ξ(x) with score function b̃(x) , ∇ log p̃(x) = b(x) − ξ(x) for ξ(x) , ∇ log Ξ(x) = x/(1 + ‖x‖22). Since b is Lipschitz and ∇ξ(x) = (1 + ‖x‖ 2 2) −1[I − 2 xx >\n1+‖x‖22 ] has its\noperator norm uniformly bounded by 3, b̃ is also Lipschitz. To see that P̃ is also distantly dissipative, note first that |〈ξ(x)− ξ(y), x− y〉| ≤ ‖ξ(x)− ξ(y)‖2 · ‖x− y‖2 ≤ ‖x− y‖2 since supx‖ξ(x)‖2 ≤ 1/2. Because P is distantly dissipative, we know 〈b(x)− b(y), x− y〉 ≤ − 12κ0‖x− y‖ 2 2 for some κ0 > 0 and all ‖x− y‖2 ≥ R for some R > 0. Thus for all ‖x− y‖2 ≥ max(R, 4/κ0), we have\n〈b̃(x)− b̃(y), x− y〉 = 〈b(x)− b(y), x− y〉+ 〈ξ(x)− ξ(y), x− y〉 ≤ −1 2 κ0‖x− y‖22 + ‖x− y‖2 ≤ − 1 2 κ0 2 ‖x− y‖22,\nso P̃ is also distantly dissipative and hence in P .\nLet f(x) , Ξ(x)(h(x) − EP [h(Z)]). Since EP̃ [f(Z)] = EP [h(Z)− EP [h(Z)]] = 0, Thm. 5 and Sec. 4.2 of (Gorham et al., 2016), imply that the P̃ Stein equation (TP̃ g̃f )(x) = f(x) has a solution g̃f with M0(gf ) ≤ M′PM1(f) forM′P a constant independent of f and h. Since∇f(x) = ∇Ξ(x)(h(x)−EP [h(Z)]) + Ξ(x)∇h(x) and ‖∇Ξ(x)‖2 =\n‖x‖2 (1+‖x‖22)1/2\nis bounded by 1, M0(gf ) ≤M′P (2 + (d− 1)1/2 + c0) ,MP , a constant independent of h.\nFinally, we note that gh(x) , g̃f (x)/Ξ(x) is a solution to the P Stein equation (8) satisfying gh(x) ≤ MP /Ξ(x) = MP /(1 + ‖x‖22)1/2. Hence, in the case d = 1, we have ‖gh‖L2 ≤MP √ π.\nStep 3: Approximate TP gh using TPGk In our final step, we will use the following lemma, proved in Section E.2, to show that we can approximate TP gh arbitrarily well by a function in a scaled copy of TPGk. Lemma 12 (Stein approximations with finite RKHS norm). Suppose that g : Rd → Rd is bounded and belongs to L2∩C1 and that h = TP g is Lipschitz. Moreover, suppose k(x, y) = Φ(x− y) for Φ ∈ C2 with generalized Fourier transform Φ̂. Then for every > 0, there is a function g : Rd → Rd such that supx∈Rd |(TP g )(x)− (TP g)(x)| ≤ and\n‖g ‖Kdk ≤ (2π) −d/4F\n( 12d log 2 π (M1(h) +M1(b)M0(g)) −1 )1/2 ‖g‖L2 ,\nwhere F (t) , sup‖ω‖∞≤t Φ̂(ω) −1.\nWhen d = 1, Lemma 12 implies that for every > 0 there is a function g : R → R such that M0(TP g − h) ≤ and ‖g ‖Kk ≤ ( π 2 ) 1/4MPF ( 12 log 2π (M1(h) +M1(b)MP ) −1)1/2. Hence we have\n|EP [h(Z)]− Eµ[h(X)]| ≤ |Eµ[h(X)− (TP g )(X)]|+ |Eµ[(TP g )(X)]| ≤ + ‖g ‖KkS(µ, TP ,Gk)\n≤ + (2π)−1/4MP √ πF ( 12 log 2 π (M1(h) +M1(b)MP ) −1 )1/2 S(µ, TP ,Gk).\nTaking a supremum over h ∈ H yields the advertised result.\nE.2. Proof of Lemma 12: Stein approximations with finite RKHS norm Let us define the function S : Rd → R via the mapping S(x) , ∏d j=1 sin xj xj . Then S ∈ L2 and ∫ Rd‖x‖2S(x)\n4 < ∞. We will then define the density function ρ(x) , Z−1S(x)4, where Z , ∫ Rd S(x)\n4 dx = (2π/3)d is the normalization constant. One can check that ρ̂(ω)2 ≤ (2π)−dI[‖ω‖∞ ≤ 4].\nLet Y be a random variable with density ρ. For each δ > 0, let us define ρδ(x) = δ−dρ(x/δ) and for any function f let us denote fδ(x) , E[f(x+ δY )]. Since h = TP g is assumed Lipschitz, this implies |hδ(x) − h(x)| = |Eρ[h(x+ δY )− h(x)]| ≤ δM1(h)Eρ[‖Y ‖2] for all x ∈ Rd.\nNext, notice that for any δ > 0 and x ∈ Rd,\n(TP gδ)(x) = Eρ[〈b(x), g(x+ δY )〉] + E[〈∇, g(x+ δY )〉], and hδ(x) = Eρ[〈b(x+ δY ), g(x+ δY )〉] + E[〈∇, g(x+ δY )〉].\nThus because we assume b is Lipschitz, we can deduce from above for any x ∈ Rd,\n|(TP gδ)(x)− hδ(x)| = |Eρ[〈b(x)− b(x+ δY ), g(x+ δY )〉]| ≤ Eρ[‖b(x)− b(x+ δY )‖2‖g(x+ δY )‖2] ≤M0(g)M1(b) δ Eρ[‖Y ‖2].\nThus for any > 0, letting ̃ = /((M1(h) +M1(b)M0(g))Eρ[‖Y ‖2]), we have by the triangle inequality\n|(TP g̃)(x)− (TP g)(x)| ≤ |(TP g̃)(x)− h̃(x)|+ |h̃(x)− h(x)| ≤ .\nThus it remains to bound the RKHS norm of gδ . By the Convolution Theorem (Wendland, 2004, Thm. 5.16), we have ĝδ(ω) = (2π) d/2ĝ(ω)ρ̂δ(ω), and so the squared norm of gδ in Kdk is equal to (Wendland, 2004, Thm. 10.21)\n(2π)−d/2 ∫ Rd |ĝδ(ω)|2 Φ̂(ω) dω = (2π)d/2 ∫ Rd |ĝ(ω)|2ρ̂δ(ω)2 Φ̂(ω) dω ≤ (2π)−d/2 { sup ‖ω‖∞≤4δ−1 Φ̂(ω)−1 }∫ Rd |ĝ(ω)|2 dω,\nwhere in the inequality we used the fact that ρ̂δ(ω) = ρ̂(δω). By Plancherel’s theorem (Herb & Sally Jr., 2011, Thm. 1.1), we know that f ∈ L2 implies that ‖f‖L2 = ‖f̂‖L2 . Thus we have ‖gδ‖Kdk ≤ (2π)\n−d/4F (4δ−1)1/2‖g‖L2 . The final result follows from noticing that ∫ R sin\n4(x)/x4 dx = 2π3 and also∫ Rd ‖x‖2 d∏ j=1 sin4 xj x4j dx ≤ ∫ Rd ‖x‖1 d∏ j=1 sin4 xj x4j dx = d∑ j=1 ∫ Rd (sinxj) 4 |xj |3 ∏ k 6=j sin4 xk x4k dx = 2d(log 2) ( 2π 3 )d−1 ,\nwhich implies Eρ[‖Y ‖2] ≤ 3d log 2 π ."

Theorem 13 (KSD tightness lower bound). Suppose P ∈ P and let µ be a probability measure with tightness rate R(µ, ) defined in (10).

(2016). When bounds on R and F are known, the final expression can be optimized over and δ to produce rates of convergence in dBL‖·‖2 .\nConsider now a sequence of probability measures (µm)m≥1 that is uniformly tight. This implies that lim supmR(µm, ) < ∞ for all > 0. Moreover, since Φ̂ is non-vanishing, F (t) is finite for all t. Thus if S(µm, TP ,Gk)→ 0, then for any fixed < 1, lim supm dBL‖·‖2 (µm, P ) ≤ (2 + + δ−1dθd−1 θd MP ). Taking → 0 yields dBL‖·‖2 (µm, P )→ 0.\nG.1. Proof of Theorem 13: KSD tightness lower bound\nFix any h ∈ BL‖·‖2 . By Theorem 5 and Section 4.2 of (Gorham et al., 2016), there exists a g ∈ C 1 which solves the Stein equation TP g = h − E[h(Z)] and satisfies M0(g) ≤ MP forMP a constant independent of h and g. To show that we can approximate TP g arbitrarily well by a function in a scaled copy of TPGk, we will form a truncated version of g using a smoothed indicator function described in the next lemma.\nLemma 14 (Smoothed indicator function). For any compact set K ⊂ Rd and δ > 0, define the set inflation K2δ , {x ∈ Rd | ‖x− y‖2 ≤ 2δ, ∀y ∈ K}. There is a function vK,δ : Rd → [0, 1] such that\nvK,δ(x) = 1 for all x ∈ K and vK,δ(x) = 0 for all x /∈ K2δ, (11) ‖∇vK,δ(x)‖2 ≤ δ−1dθd−1 θd I [ x ∈ K2δ \\K ] , (12)\nwhere θd , d ∫ 1 0 exp ( −1/(1− r2) ) rd−1 dr for d > 0 and θ0 , e−1.\nThis lemma is proved in Section G.2.\nFix any , δ > 0, and let K = B(0, R(µ, )) with R(µ, ) defined in (10). This set is compact since our sequence is uniformly tight. Hence, we may define gK,δ(x) , g(x) vK,δ(x) as a smooth, truncated version of g based on Lemma 14. Since\n(TP g)(x)− (TP gK,δ)(x) = (1− vK,δ(x))[〈b(x), g(x)〉+ 〈∇, g〉(x)] + 〈∇vK,δ(x), g(x)〉 = (1− vK,δ(x))(TP g)(x) + 〈∇vK,δ(x), g(x)〉,\nproperties (11) and (12) imply that (TP g)(x) = (TP gK,δ)(x) for all x ∈ K, (TP gK,δ)(x) = 0 when x /∈ K2δ , and\n|(TP g)(x)− (TP gK,δ)(x)| ≤ |(TP g)(x)|+ ‖∇vK,δ(x)‖2 ‖g(x)‖2 ≤ |(TP g)(x)|+ δ −1dθd−1 θd ‖g(x)‖2 ≤ 1 + δ−1dθd−1 θd MP\nfor x ∈ K2δ \\K by Cauchy-Schwarz.\nMoreover, since vK,δ has compact support and is in C1 by (11), gK,δ ∈ C1 with ‖gK,δ‖L2 ≤ Vol(K 2δ)1/2M0(g) ≤ Vol(K2δ)1/2MP . Therefore, Lemma 12 implies that there is a function g ∈ Kdk such that |(TP g )(x)− (TP gK,δ)(x)| ≤ for all x with norm\n‖g ‖Kdk ≤ (2π) −d/4F ( 12d log 2π (1 +M1(b)MP −1))1/2Vol(K2δ)1/2MP . (13)\nUsing the fact that TP gK,δ and TP g are identical on K, we have |(TP g )(x) − (TP g)(x)| ≤ for all x ∈ K. Moreover, when x /∈ K, the triangle inequality gives\n|(TP g )(x)− (TP g)(x)| ≤ |(TP g )(x)− (TP gK,δ)(x)|+ |(TP gK,δ)(x)− (TP g)(x)| ≤ 1 + + δ −1dθd−1 θd MP .\nBy the triangle inequality and the fact that our choice of K ensures µ(I[X /∈ K]) ≤ min( , 1), we have\n|Eµ[h(X)]− EP [h(Z)]| = |Eµ[(TP g)(X)]| ≤ |E[(TP g)(X)− (TP g )(X)]|+ |Eµ[(TP g )(X)]| ≤ |Eµ[((TP g)(X)− (TP g )(X))I[X ∈ K]]|+ |Eµ[((TP g)(X)− (TP g )(X))I[X /∈ K]]|+ |Eµ[(TP g )(X)]|\n≤ + min( , 1)(1 + + δ −1dθd−1 θd MP ) + ‖g ‖Kdk S(µm, TP ,Gk) ≤ + min( , 1)(1 + + δ −1dθd−1 θd MP )\n+ (2π)−d/4Vol(B(0, R(µ, ) + 2δ))1/2F (\n12d log 2 π (1 +M1(b)MP ) −1 )1/2 MPS(µ, TP ,Gk).\nThe advertised result follows by substituting Vol(B(0, r)) = Vdrd and taking the supremum over all h ∈ BL‖·‖.\nG.2. Proof of Lemma 14: Smoothed indicator function\nFor all x ∈ Rd, define the standard normalized bump function ψ ∈ C∞ as ψ(x) , I−1d exp ( −1/(1− ‖x‖22) ) I[‖x‖2 < 1],\nwhere the normalizing constant is given by\nId = ∫ B(0,1) exp ( −1/(1− ‖x‖22) ) dx = θd Vd\nfor Vd being the volume of the unit Euclidean ball in d dimensions (Baker, 1999). LettingW be a random variable with density ψ, define vK,δ(x) , E [ I [ x+ δW ∈ Kδ ]] as the smoothed approximation of x 7→ I[x ∈ K], where δ > 0 controls the amount of smoothing. Since supp(W ) = B(0, 1), we can immediately conclude (11) and also supp(∇vK,δ) ⊆ K2δ \\K.\nThus to prove (12), it remains to consider x ∈ K2δ \\K. We see ∇vK,δ(x) = δ−d−1 ∫ B(x,δ)∇ψ( x−y δ )I [ y ∈ Kδ ] dy by Leibniz rule. Letting Kδx , δ −1(Kδ − x), then by Jensen’s inequality we have\n‖∇vK,δ(x)‖2 ≤ δ −d−1 ∫ B(x,δ)∩Kδ ∥∥∥∥∇ψ(x− yδ )∥∥∥∥\n2 dy = δ−1 ∫ B(0,1)∩Kδx ‖∇ψ(z)‖2 dz ≤ δ −1 ∫ B(0,1) ‖∇ψ(z)‖2 dz\nwhere we used the substitution z , (x− y)/δ.

Thus taking → 0 yields dBL‖·‖(µm, P ) → 0. Since dBL‖·‖(µm, P )→ 0 only if µm ⇒ P , the statement of Theorem 8 follows.\nH.1. Proof of Theorem 15: IMQ KSD lower bound\nFix any α ∈ (0, 12 (β + 1)) and a > 1 2c. Then there is some g̊ ∈ Gk such that TP g̊ is bounded below by a constant ζ(a, c, α, β) and has a growth rate of ‖x‖2α2 as ‖x‖2 → ∞. Such a function exists by the following lemma, proved in Section H.2.\nLemma 16 (Generalized multiquadric Stein sets yield coercive functions). Suppose P ∈ P and k(x, y) = Φc,β(x − y) for Φc,β(x) , (c2 + ‖x‖22)β , c > 0, and β ∈ R \\N0. Then, for any α ∈ (0, 1 2 (β + 1)) and a > 1 2c, there exists a function g̊ ∈ Gk such that TP g̊ is bounded below by\nζ(a, c, α, β) , −D(a, c, α, β) 1/2\n2α\n[ M1(b)R\n2 0 + ‖b(0)‖2R0 + d a2(1−α)\n] , (17)\nwhere the function D is defined in (20) and R0 , inf{r > 0 |κ(r′) ≥ 0,∀r′ ≥ r}. Moreover, lim inf‖x‖−2α2 (TP g̊)(x) ≥ α D(a,c,α,β)1/2κ0 as ‖x‖2 →∞.\nOur next lemma connects the growth rate of TP g̊ to the tightness rate of a probability measure evaluated with the Stein discrepancy. Its proof is found in Section H.3.\nLemma 17 (Coercive functions yield tightness). Suppose there is a g ∈ G such that TP g is bounded below by ζ ∈ R and lim inf‖x‖2→∞‖x‖ −u 2 (TP g)(x) > η for some η, u > 0. Then for all sufficiently small and any probability measure µ the tightness rate (10) satisfies\nR(µ, ) ≤ [ 1\nη (S(µ, TP ,G)− ζ)\n]1/u .\nIn particular, if lim supm S(µm, TP ,Gk) is finite, (µm)m≥1 is uniformly tight.\nWe can thus plug the tightness rate estimate of Lemma 17 applied to the function g̊ into Theorem 13. Since ‖w‖∞ ≤ t implies ‖w‖2 ≤ √ dt, we can use the formula for the generalized Fourier transform of the IMQ kernel in (18) to see Φ̂(ω) is monotonically decreasing in ‖w‖2 to establish (16). By taking η → α D(a,c,α,β)1/2κ0 we obtain (14). To prove (15), notice that FIMQ(t) = O(e(c √ d+λ)t) as t → ∞ for any λ > 0 by (19). Hence, by choosing = c √ d/ log( 1S(µ,TP ,Gk) ) and δ = 1/\n1/α we obtain the advertised decay rate as S(µ, TP ,Gk) → 0. The uniform tightness conclusion follows from Lemma 17.\nH.2. Proof of Lemma 16: Generalized multiquadric Stein sets yield coercive functions\nBy (Wendland, 2004, Thm. 8.15), Φc,β has a generalized Fourier transform of order max(0, dβe) given by\nΦ̂c,β(ω) = 21+β\nΓ(−β) ( ‖ω‖2 c )−β−d/2 Kβ+d/2(c‖ω‖2), (18)\nwhere Kv(z) is the modified Bessel function of the third kind. Furthermore, by (Wendland, 2004, Cor. 5.12, Lem. 5.13, Lem. 5.14), we have the following bounds on Kv(z) for v ∈ R, z ∈ (0,∞):\nKv(z) ≥ τv e−z√ z\nfor z ≥ 1 where τv = √ π\n2 for |v| ≥ 1 2 and τv =\n√ π3|v|−1/2\n2|v|+1Γ(|v|+ 1/2) for |v| < 1 2 , (19)\nKv(z) ≥ e−1τvz−|v| for z ≤ 1, (since x 7→ xvK−v(x) is non-increasing and Kv = K−v) Kv(z) ≤ √ 2π\nz e−z+v 2/(2z) for z > 0,\nKv(z) ≤ 2|v|−1Γ(|v|)z−|v| for v 6= 0, z > 0.\nNow fix any a > c/2 and α ∈ (0, 12 (β + 1)), and consider the functions gj(x) = ∇xjΦa,α(x) = 2αxj(a 2 + ‖x‖22)α−1. We will show that g = (g1, . . . , gd) ∈ Kdk. Note that ĝj(ω) = (iωj)Φ̂a,α(ω). Using (Wendland, 2004, Thm. 10.21), we\nknow ‖gj‖Kk = ∥∥∥∥ĝj/√Φ̂c,β∥∥∥∥\nL2 , and thus ‖g‖Kdk = ∥∥∥∥ĝ/√Φ̂c,β∥∥∥∥ L2 . Hence\n‖g‖2Kdk = d∑ j=1 ∫ Rd ĝj(ω)ĝj(ω)/Φ̂c,β(ω) dω\n= d∑ j=1 ∫ Rd 22(1+α)/Γ(−α)2 21+β/Γ(−β) a2α+d cβ+d/2 ω2j ‖ω‖ β−2α−d/2 2 Kα+d/2(a‖ω‖2)2 Kβ+d/2(c‖ω‖2) dω\n= c0 ∫ Rd ‖ω‖β−2α−d/2+22 Kα+d/2(a‖ω‖2)2 Kβ+d/2(c‖ω‖2) dω,\nwhere c0 = 22(1+α)/Γ(−α)2 21+β/Γ(−β) a2α+d cβ+d/2 . We can split the integral above into two, with the first integrating over B(0, 1) and the second integrating over B(0, 1)c = Rd \\ B(0, 1). Thus using the inequalities from (19) with v0 , β + d/2, we have∫ B(0,1) ‖ω‖β−2α−d/2+22 Kα+d/2(a‖ω‖2)2 Kβ+d/2(c‖ω‖2) dω ≤ ∫ B(0,1) ‖ω‖β−2α−d/2+22 22α+d−2Γ(α+ d/2)2(a‖w‖2)−2α−d e−1τv0 · ‖cω‖ −β−d/2 2 dω\n= 22α+d−2Γ(α+ d/2)2 e\nτv0\ncβ+d/2\na2α+d ∫ B(0,1) ‖ω‖2β−4α−d+22 e c‖ω‖2 dω\n= d Vd 2 2α+d−2Γ(α+ d/2)2\ne\nτv0\ncβ+d/2\na2α+d ∫ 1 0 r2β−4α+1ecr dr,\nwhere Vd is the volume of the unit ball in d-dimensions and in the last step we used the substitution r = ‖ω‖2 (Baker, 1999). Since α < 12 (β + 1) and the function r 7→ r\nt is integrable around the origin when t > −1, we can bound the integral above by ∫ 1\n0\nr2β−4α+1ecr dr ≤ ec ∫ 1\n0\nr2β−4α+1 dr = ec\n2β − 4α+ 2 .\nWe can apply the technique to the other integral, yielding∫ B(0,1)c ‖ω‖β−2α−d/2+22 Kα+d/2(a‖ω‖2)2 Kβ+d/2(c‖ω‖2) dω ≤ ∫ B(0,1)c ‖ω‖β−2α−d/2+22 2π/(a‖ω‖2) · e−2a‖ω‖2+(α+d/2) 2/(a‖ω‖2) τv0e −c‖ω‖2/ √ c‖ω‖2 dω\n≤ 2π √ c\naτv0 ∫ B(0,1)c ‖ω‖β−2α−d/2+3/22 e (c−2a)‖ω‖2+(α+d/2) 2/(a‖ω‖2) dω\n= d Vd 2π √ c\naτv0 ∫ ∞ 1 rβ−2α+d/2+1/2e(c−2a)r+(α+d/2) 2/(ar) dr\nSince c− 2a < 0, we can upper bound the last integral above by the quantity∫ ∞ 1 rβ−2α+d/2+1/2e(c−2a)r+(α+d/2) 2/(ar) dr\n≤ e(c−2a)+(α+d/2) 2/a ∫ ∞ 1 rβ−2α+d/2+1/2e(c−2a)r dr = e(c−2a)+(α+d/2) 2/a(2a− c)−β+2α−d/2−3/2Γ(β − 2α+ d/2 + 3/2, 2a− c),\nwhere Γ(s, x) , ∫∞ x ts−1e−t dt is the upper incomplete gamma function. Hence, the function g belongs to Kdk with norm upper bounded by D(a, b, α, β)1/2 where\nD(a, c, α, β) , d Vd 21+2α−β a2α+dΓ(−β) cβ+d/2Γ(−α)2\n( 22α+d−2Γ(α+ d/2)2ec+1cβ+d/2\nτv0(2β − 4α+ 2)a2α+d +\n2π √ c\naτv0 e(c−2a)+(α+d/2) 2/a(2a− c)−β+2α−d/2−3/2Γ(β − 2α+ d/2 + 3/2, 2a− c)\n) . (20)\nNow define g̊ = −D(a, c, α, β)−1/2g so that g̊ ∈ Gk. We will lower bound the growth rate of TP g̊ and also construct a uniform lower bound. Note\nD(a, c, α, β)1/2\n2α (TP g̊)(x) = − 〈b(x), x〉 (a2 + ‖x‖22)1−α − d (a2 + ‖x‖22)1−α + 2(1− α)‖x‖22 (a2 + ‖x‖22)2−α . (21)\nThe latter two terms are both uniformly bounded in x. By the distant dissipativity assumption, there is some κ > 0 such that lim sup‖x‖2→∞ 1 ‖x‖22 〈b(x), x〉 ≤ − 12κ. Thus the first term of (21) grows at least at the rate 1 2κ‖x‖ 2α 2 . This assures lim inf‖x‖−2α2 (TP g̊)(x) ≥ α D(a,c,α,β)1/2κ as ‖x‖2 →∞.\nMoreover, because b is Lipschitz, we have\n|〈b(x), x〉| ≤ |〈b(x)− b(0), x− 0〉|+ |〈b(0), x〉| ≤M1(b)‖x‖22 + ‖b(0)‖‖x‖2,\nHence for any x ∈ B(0, R0), we must have−〈b(x), x〉 ≥ −M1(b)R20−‖b(0)‖2R0. By choice ofR0, for all x /∈ B(0, R0), the distant dissipativity assumption implies−〈b(x), x〉 ≥ 0. Hence applying this to (21) shows that TP g̊ is uniformly lower bounded by ζ(a, c, α, β).\nH.3. Proof of Lemma 17: Coercive functions yield tightness\nPick g ∈ Gk such that lim inf‖x‖2→∞‖x‖ −u 2 (TP g)(x) > η and infx∈Rd(TP g)(x) ≥ ζ. Let us define γ(r) , inf{(TP g)(x) − ζ | ‖x‖2 ≥ r} ≥ 0 for all r > 0. Thus for sufficiently large r, we have γ(r) ≥ ηru. Then, for any measure µ by Markov’s inequality,\nµ(‖X‖2 ≥ r) ≤ Eµ[γ(‖X‖2)] γ(r) ≤ Eµ[(TP g)(X)− ζ] γ(r) .\nThus we see that µ(‖X‖2 ≥ r ) ≤ whenever ≥ (S(µ, TP ,Gk)− ζ)/γ(r ). This implies that for sufficiently small , if r ≥ [ 1\nη (S(µ, TP ,Gk)− ζ)\n]1/u ,\nwe must have µ(‖X‖2 ≥ r ) ≤ . Hence whenever lim supm S(µm, TP ,Gk) is bounded, we must have (µm)m≥1 is uniformly tight as lim supmR(µm, ) is finite."

We will show that when M0(b) is finite, S(Qn, TP ,Gk)→ 0 as n→∞.\nWe can express k0(x, y) , ∑d j=1 k j 0(x, y) as\nk0(x, y) = 〈b(x), b(y)〉k(x, y) + 〈b(x),∇yk(x, y)〉+ 〈b(y),∇xk(x, y)〉+ 〈∇x,∇yk(x, y)〉.\nFrom Proposition 2, we have\nS(Qn, TP ,Gk)2 = 1\nn2 n∑ i,i′=1 k0(xi, xi′) = 1 n2 n∑ i=1 k0(xi, xi) + 1 n2 ∑ i 6=i′ k0(xi, xi′). (22)\nLet γ be the kernel decay rate defined in the statement of Theorem 6. Then as k ∈ C(1,1)0 , we must have γ(0) < ∞ and limr→∞ γ(r) = 0. By the triangle inequality\nlim n→∞ ∣∣∣∣∣ 1n2 n∑ i=1 k0(xi, xi) ∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ limn→∞ 1n2 n∑ i=1 |k0(xi, xi)| ≤ lim n→∞ γ(0) n (M0(b) + 1) 2 = 0.\nWe now handle the second term of (22). By repeated use of Cauchy-Schwarz we have\n|k0(xi, xi′)| ≤ |〈b(xi), b(xi′)〉k(xi, xi′)|+ |〈b(xi),∇yk(xi, xi′)〉|+ |〈b(xi′),∇xk(xi, xi′)〉|+ |〈∇x,∇yk(xi, xi′)〉| ≤ ‖b(xi)‖2‖b(xi′)‖2|k(xi, xi′)|+ ‖b(xi)‖2‖∇yk(xi, xi′)‖2 + ‖b(xi′)‖2‖∇xk(xi, xi′)‖2\n+ |〈∇x,∇yk(xi, xi′)〉| ≤ γ(n)(M0(b) + 1)2.\nBy assumption, γ(r) → 0 as r → ∞. Furthermore, since the second term of (22) is upper bounded by the average of the terms k0(xi, x′i) for i 6= i′, we have S(Qn, TP ,Gk) → 0 as n → ∞. However, (Qn)n≥1 is not uniformly tight and hence does not converge to the probability measure P ."

In the full version of SGFS (termed SGFS-f), a d× d matrix must be inverted to draw each new sample point. Since this can be costly for large d, the authors developed a second sampler (termed SGFS-d) in which only a diagonal matrix must be inverted to draw each new sample point. Both samplers can be viewed as discrete-time approximations to a continuoustime Markov process that has the target P as its stationary distribution; however, because no Metropolis-Hastings correction is employed, neither sampler has the target as its stationary distribution. Hence we will use the KSD – a quality measure that accounts for asymptotic bias – to evaluate and choose between these samplers. Specifically, we evaluate the SGFS-f and SGFS-d samples produced in (Ahn et al., 2012, Sec. 5.1). The target P is a Bayesian logistic regression with a flat prior, conditioned on a dataset of 10 MNIST handwritten digit images. From each image, the authors extracted 50 random projections of the raw pixel values as covariates and a label indicating whether the image was a 7 or a 9. After discarding the first half of sample points as burn-in, we obtained regression coefficient samples with 5 × 10 points and d = 51 dimensions (including the intercept term). Figure 4 displays the IMQ KSD applied to the first n points in each sample. As external validation, we follow the protocol of Ahn et al.

A reader may also wonder for which distributions outside ofP the KSD dominates weak convergence. The following theorem, proved in Section J, shows that no KSD with aC0 kernel dominates weak convergence when the target has a bounded score function. Theorem 10 (KSD fails for bounded scores). If ∇ log p is bounded and k ∈ C 0 , then S(Qn, TP ,Gk) → 0 does not imply Qn ⇒ P . However, Gorham et al. (2016) developed convergencedetermining graph Stein discrepancies for heavy-tailed targets by replacing the Langevin Stein operator TP with diffusion Stein operators of the form (T g)(x) = 1 p(x) 〈∇, p(x)(a(x) + c(x))g(x)〉.",

    "abstractText" : "Approximate Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) offers the promise of more rapid sampling at the cost of more biased inference. Since standard MCMC diagnostics fail to detect these biases, researchers have developed computable Stein discrepancy measures that provably determine the convergence of a sample to its target distribution. This approach was recently combined with the theory of reproducing kernels to define a closed-form kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD) computable by summing kernel evaluations across pairs of sample points. We develop a theory of weak convergence for KSDs based on Stein’s method, demonstrate that commonly used KSDs fail to detect non-convergence even for Gaussian targets, and show that kernels with slowly decaying tails provably determine convergence for a large class of target distributions. The resulting convergence-determining KSDs are suitable for comparing biased, exact, and deterministic sample sequences and simpler to compute and parallelize than alternative Stein discrepancies. We use our tools to compare biased samplers, select sampler hyperparameters, and improve upon existing KSD approaches to one-sample hypothesis testing and sample quality improvement.",
