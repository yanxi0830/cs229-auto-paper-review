      "text" : "Regularizing with the ℓ1 norm, when we expect a sparse solution to a regression problem, is often justified by ‖w‖1 being the “convex envelope” of ‖w‖0 (the number of non-zero coordinates of a vectorw ∈ Rd). That is, ‖w‖1 is the tightest convex lower bound on ‖w‖0. But we must be careful with this statement— for sparse vectors with large entries, ‖w‖0 can be small while ‖w‖1 is large. In order to discuss convex lower bounds on ‖w‖0, we must impose some scale constraint. A more accurate statement is that ‖w‖1 ≤ ‖w‖∞‖w‖0, and so, when the magnitudes of entries in w are bounded by 1, then ‖w‖1 ≤ ‖w‖0, and indeed it is the largest such convex lower bound. Viewed as a convex outer relaxation,\nS (∞) k := { w ∣ ∣ ‖w‖0 ≤ k, ‖w‖∞ ≤ 1 } ⊆ { w ∣ ∣ ‖w‖1 ≤ k } .\nIntersecting the right-hand-side with the ℓ∞ unit ball, we get the tightest convex outer bound (convex hull) of S (∞) k :\n{ w ∣ ∣ ‖w‖1 ≤ k, ‖w‖∞ ≤ 1 } = conv(S (∞) k ) .\nHowever, in our view, this relationship between ‖w‖1 and ‖w‖0 yields disappointing learning guarantees, and does not appropriately capture the success of the ℓ1 norm as a surrogate for sparsity. In particular, the sample complexity\n1 of learning a linear predictor with k non-zero entries by empirical risk minimization inside this class (an NP-hard optimization problem) scales as2 O(k log d), but relaxing to the constraint ‖w‖1 ≤ k yields a sample complexity which scales as O(k2 log d), because the sample complexity of ℓ1-regularized learning scales quadratically with the ℓ1 norm [11, 19].\nPerhaps a better reason for the ℓ1 norm being a good surrogate for sparsity is that, not only do we expect the magnitude of each entry of w to be bounded, but we further expect ‖w‖2 to be small. In a regression setting, with a vector of features x, this can be justified when E[(x⊤w)2] is bounded (a reasonable assumption) and the features are not too correlated—see, e.g. [16]. More broadly, especially in the presence of correlations, we might require this as a modeling assumption to aid in robustness and generalization. In any case, we have ‖w‖1 ≤ ‖w‖2 √\n‖w‖0, and so if we are interested in predictors with bounded ℓ2 norm, we can motivate the ℓ1 norm through the following relaxation of sparsity, where the scale is now set by the ℓ2 norm:\n{ w ∣ ∣ ‖w‖0 ≤ k, ‖w‖2 ≤ B } ⊆ { w ∣ ∣ ‖w‖1 ≤ B √ k } .\nThe sample complexity when using the relaxation now scales as3 O(k log d).\nSparse + ℓ2 constraint. Our starting point is then that of combining sparsity and ℓ2 regularization, and learning a sparse predictor with small ℓ2 norm. We are thus interested in classes of the form\nS (2) k := { w ∣ ∣ ‖w‖0 ≤ k, ‖w‖2 ≤ 1 } .\nAs discussed above, the class {‖w‖1 ≤ √ k} (corresponding to the standard Lasso) provides a convex relaxation of S (2) k . But it is clear that we can get a\n1 We define this as the number of observations needed in order to ensure expected prediction error no more than ǫ worse than that of the best k-sparse predictor, for an arbitrary constant ǫ (that is, we suppress the dependence on ǫ and focus on the dependence on the sparsity k and dimensionality d).\n2This is based on bounding the VC-subgraph dimension of this class, which is essentially the effective number of parameters.\n3More precisely, the sample complexity is O(B2k log d), where the dependence on B2 is to be expected. Note that if feature vectors are ℓ∞-bounded (i.e. individual features are bounded), the sample complexity when using only ‖w‖2 ≤ B (without a sparsity or ℓ1 constraint) scales as O(B2d). That is, even after identifying the correct support, we still need a sample complexity that scales with B2.\ntighter convex relaxation by keeping the ℓ2 constraint as well:\nS (2) k ⊆\n{\nw ∣ ∣ ‖w‖1 ≤ √ k, ‖w‖2 ≤ 1 } ( { w ∣ ∣ ‖w‖1 ≤ √ k } . (1)\nConstraining (or equivalently, penalizing) both the ℓ1 and ℓ2 norms, as in (1), is known as the “elastic net” [5, 20] and has indeed been advocated as a better alternative to the Lasso. In this paper, we ask whether the elastic net is the tightest convex relaxation to sparsity plus ℓ2 (that is, to S (2) k ) or whether a tighter, and better, convex relaxation is possible.\nA new norm. We consider the convex hull (tightest convex outer bound) of S (2) k ,\nCk := conv(S (2) k ) = conv { w ∣ ∣ ‖w‖0 ≤ k, ‖w‖2 ≤ 1 } . (2)\nWe study the gauge function associated with this convex set, that is, the norm whose unit ball is given by (2), which we call the k-support norm. We show that, for k > 1, this is indeed a tighter convex relaxation than the elastic net (that is, both inequalities in (1) are in fact strict inequalities), and is therefore a better convex constraint than the elastic net when seeking a sparse, low ℓ2-norm linear predictor. We thus advocate using it as a replacement for the elastic net.\nHowever, we also show that the gap between the elastic net and the k-support norm is at most a factor of √ 2, corresponding to a factor of two difference in the sample complexity. Thus, our work can also be interpreted as justifying the use of the elastic net, viewing it as a fairly good approximation to the tightest possible convex relaxation of sparsity intersected with an ℓ2 constraint. Still, even a factor of two should not necessarily be ignored and, as we show in our experiments, using the tighter k-support norm can indeed be beneficial.\nTo better understand the k-support norm, we show in Section 2 that it can also be described as the group lasso with overlaps norm [10] corresponding to all\n( d k ) subsets of k features. Despite the exponential number of groups in this description, we show that the k-support norm can be calculated efficiently in time O(d log d) and that its dual is given simply by the ℓ2 norm of the k largest entries. We also provide efficient first-order optimization algorithms for learning with the k-support norm.\nRelated Work In many learning problems of interest, Lasso has been observed to shrink too many of the variables of w to zero. In particular, in many applications, when a group of variables is highly correlated, the Lasso may prefer a sparse solution, but we might gain more predictive accuracy by including all the correlated variables in our model. These drawbacks have recently motivated the use of various other regularization methods, such as the elastic net [20], which penalizes the regression coefficients w with a combination of ℓ1 and ℓ2 norms:\nmin\n{ 1\n2 ‖Xw − y‖2 + λ1 ‖w‖1 + λ2 ‖w‖22 : w ∈ Rd\n}\n, (3)\nwhere for a sample of size n, y ∈ Rn is the vector of response values, and X ∈ Rn×d is a matrix with column j containing the values of feature j.\nThe elastic net can be viewed as a trade-off between ℓ1 regularization (the Lasso) and ℓ2 regularization (Ridge regression [9]), depending on the relative values of λ1 and λ2. In particular, when λ2 = 0, (3) is equivalent to the Lasso. This method, and the other methods discussed below, have been observed to significantly outperform Lasso in many real applications.\nThe pairwise elastic net (PEN), proposed by [13], has a penalty function that accounts for similarity among features:\n‖w‖PENR = ‖w‖22 + ‖w‖21 − |w|⊤R|w| ,\nwhere R ∈ [0, 1]p×p is a matrix with Rjk measuring similarity between features Xj and Xk. The trace Lasso [6] is a second method proposed to handle correlations within X , defined by\n‖w‖traceX = ‖Xdiag(w)‖∗ ,\nwhere ‖ · ‖∗ denotes the matrix trace-norm (the sum of the singular values) and promotes a low-rank solution. If the features are orthogonal, then both the PEN and the Trace Lasso are equivalent to the Lasso. If the features are all identical, then both penalties are equivalent to Ridge regression (penalizing ‖w‖2). Another existing penalty is OSCAR [3], given by\n‖w‖OSCARc = ‖w‖1 + c ∑\nj<k\nmax{|wj |, |wk|} .\nLike the elastic net, each one of these three methods also “prefers” averaging similar features over selecting a single feature.\n2 The k-Support Norm\nOne argument for the elastic net has been the flexibility of tuning the cardinality k of the regression vector w. Thus, when groups of correlated variables are present, a larger k may be learned, which corresponds to a higher λ2 in (3). A more natural way to obtain such an effect of tuning the cardinality is to consider the convex hull of cardinality k vectors,\nCk = conv(S (2) k ) = conv{w ∈ Rd ∣ ∣ ‖w‖0 ≤ k, ‖w‖2 ≤ 1}.\nClearly the sets Ck are nested, and C1 and Cd are the unit balls for the ℓ1 and ℓ2 norms, respectively. Consequently we define the k-support norm as the norm whose unit ball equals Ck (the gauge function associated with the Ck ball).\n4 An equivalent definition is the following variational formula:\n4 The gauge function γCk : R d → R∪{+∞} is defined as γCk (x) = inf{λ ∈ R+ : x ∈ λCk}.\nDefinition 2.1. Let k ∈ {1, . . . , d}. The k-support norm ‖ · ‖spk is defined, for every w ∈ Rd, as\n‖w‖spk := min { ∑\nI∈Gk\n‖vI‖2 : supp(vI) ⊆ I, ∑\nI∈Gk\nvI = w\n}\n,\nwhere Gk denotes the set of all subsets of {1, . . . , d} of cardinality at most k.\nThe equivalence is immediate by rewriting vI = µIzI in the above definition, where µI ≥ 0, zI ∈ Ck, ∀I ∈ Gk, ∑\nI∈Gk µI = 1. In addition, this immediately implies that ‖·‖spk is indeed a norm. In fact, the k-support norm is equivalent to the norm used by the group lasso with overlaps [10], when the set of overlapping groups is chosen to be Gk (however, the group lasso has traditionally been used for applications with some specific known group structure, unlike the case considered here).\nAlthough the variational definition 2.1 is not amenable to computation because of the exponential growth of the set of groups Gk, the k-support norm is computationally very tractable, with an O(d log d) algorithm described in Section 2.2.\nAs already mentioned, ‖ ·‖sp1 = ‖ ·‖1 and ‖ ·‖spd = ‖ ·‖2. The unit ball of this new norm in R3 for k = 2 is depicted in Figure 1. We immediately notice several differences between this unit ball and the elastic net unit ball. For example, at points with cardinality k and ℓ2 norm equal to 1, the k-support norm is not differentiable, but unlike the ℓ1 or elastic-net norm, it is differentiable at points with cardinality less than k. Thus, the k-support norm is less “biased” towards sparse vectors than the elastic net and the ℓ1 norm."

      "text" : "It is interesting and useful to compute the dual of the k-support norm.

This parallels the interpolation of the k-support norm between the ℓ1 and ℓ2 norms.\nLike the ℓp norms and elastic net, the k-support norm and its dual are symmetric gauge functions, that is, sign- and permutation-invariant norms. For properties of such norms, see [2]."

      "text" : "In this section, we derive an alternative formula for the k-support norm, which leads to computation of the value of the norm in O(d log d) steps.\nProposition 2.1. For every w ∈ Rd,\n‖w‖spk =\n\n\nk−r−1∑\ni=1\n(|w|↓i )2 + 1\nr + 1\n( d∑\ni=k−r |w|↓i\n)2 \n\n1 2\n,\nwhere, letting |w|↓0 denote +∞, r is the unique integer in {0, . . . , k−1} satisfying\n|w|↓k−r−1 > 1\nr + 1\nd∑\ni=k−r |w|↓i ≥ |w|↓k−r . (4)\nThis result shows that ‖·‖spk trades off between the ℓ1 and ℓ2 norms in a way that favors sparse vectors but allows for cardinality larger than k. It combines the uniform shrinkage of an ℓ2 penalty for the largest components, with the sparse shrinkage of an ℓ1 penalty for the smallest components.\nProof of Proposition 2.1. We will use the inequality 〈w, u〉 ≤ 〈w↓, u↓〉 [7].\nWe have\n1 2 (‖w‖spk )2 = max\n{\n〈u,w〉 − 1 2 (‖u‖(2)(k))2 : u ∈ Rd\n}\n= max\n{ d∑\ni=1\nαi|w|↓i − 1\n2\nk∑\ni=1\nα2i : α1 ≥ · · · ≥ αd ≥ 0 }\n= max\n{ k−1∑\ni=1\nαi|w|↓i + αk d∑\ni=k\n|w|↓i − 1\n2\nk∑\ni=1\nα2i : α1 ≥ · · · ≥ αk ≥ 0 } .\nLet Ar := d∑ i=k−r |w|↓i for r ∈ {0, . . . , k − 1}. If A0 < |w|↓k−1 then the solution α is given by αi = |w|↓i for i = 1, . . . , (k − 1), αi = A0 for i = k, . . . , d. If A0 ≥ |w|↓k−1 then the optimal αk, αk−1 lie between |w| ↓ k−1 and A0, and have to be equal. So, the maximization becomes\nmax\n{ k−2∑\ni=1\nαi|w|↓i − 1\n2\nk−2∑\ni=1\nα2i +A1αk−1 − α2k−1 : α1 ≥ · · · ≥ αk−1 ≥ 0 } .\nIf A0 ≥ |w|↓k−1 and |w| ↓ k−2 > A1 2 then the solution is αi = |w| ↓ i for i = 1, . . . , (k− 2), αi = A1 2 for i = (k− 1), . . . , d. Otherwise we proceed as before and continue this process. At stage r the process terminates if A0 ≥ |w|↓k−1, . . . , Ar−1 r ≥ |w|↓k−r , Arr+1 < |w| ↓ k−r−1 and all but the last two inequalities are redundant. Hence the condition can be rewritten as (4). One optimal solution is αi = |w|↓i for i = 1, . . . , k− r− 1, αi = Arr+1 for i = k− r, . . . , d. This proves the claim.\n2.3 Learning with the k-support norm\nWe thus propose using learning rules with k-support norm regularization. These are appropriate when we would like to learn a sparse predictor that also has low ℓ2 norm, and are especially relevant when features might be correlated (that is, in almost all learning tasks) but the correlation structure is not known in advance. For regression problems with squared error loss, the resulting learning rule is of the form\nmin\n{ 1\n2 ‖Xw − y‖2 + λ 2 (‖w‖spk ) 2 : w ∈ Rd\n}\n(5)\nwith λ > 0 a regularization parameter and k ∈ {1, . . . , d} also a parameter to be tuned. As typical in regularization-based methods, both λ and k can be selected by cross validation [8]. Although we have motivated this norm by considering S (2) k , the set of k-sparse unit vectors, the parameter k does not necessarily correspond to the sparsity level of the fitted vector of coefficients, and should be chosen via cross-validation independently of the desired sparsity level."

(6)\nFor ease of comparison with the k-support norm, we first show that the set of optimal solutions for the elastic net, when the parameters are varied, is the same as for the norm\n‖w‖elk := max { ‖w‖2, ‖w‖1√\nk\n}\n,\nwhen k ∈ [1, d], corresponding to the unit ball in (1) (note that k is not necessarily an integer). To see this, let ŵ be a solution to (6), and let k := (‖ŵ‖1/‖ŵ‖2)2 ∈ [1, d] .\nThen for any w 6= ŵ, if ‖w‖elk ≤ ‖ŵ‖elk , then ‖w‖p ≤ ‖ŵ‖p for p = 1, 2. Since ŵ is a solution to (6), therefore, ‖Xw− y‖22 ≥ ‖Xŵ− y‖22. This proves that, for some constraint parameter B,\nŵ = argmin\n{ 1\nn ‖Xw − y‖22 : ‖w‖elk ≤ B\n}\n.\nLike the k-support norm, the elastic net interpolates between the ℓ1 and ℓ2 norms. In fact, when k is an integer, any k-sparse unit vector w ∈ Rd must lie in the unit ball of ‖ · ‖elk . Since the k-support norm gives the convex hull of all k-sparse unit vectors, this immediately implies that\n‖w‖elk ≤ ‖w‖spk ∀ w ∈ Rd .\nThe two norms are not equal, however. The difference between the two is illustrated in Figure 1, where we see that the k-support norm is more “rounded”.\nTo see an example where the two norms are not equal, we set d = 1+ k2 for some large k, and let w = (k1.5, 1, 1, . . . , 1)⊤ ∈ Rd. Then\n‖w‖elk = max { √ k3 + k2, k1.5 + k2√\nk\n} = k1.5 (\n1 + 1√ k\n)\n.\nTaking u = ( 1√ 2 , 1√ 2k , 1√ 2k , . . . , 1√ 2k )⊤, we have ‖u‖(2)(k) < 1, and recalling this norm is dual to the k-support norm:\n‖w‖spk > 〈w, u〉 = k1.5√ 2 + k2 · 1√ 2k = √ 2 · k1.5 .\nIn this example, we see that the two norms can differ by as much as a factor of√ 2. We now show that this is actually the most by which they can differ. Proposition 3.1. ‖ · ‖elk ≤ ‖ · ‖spk < √ 2 ‖ · ‖elk .\nProof. We show that these bounds hold in the duals of the two norms. First, since ‖ · ‖elk is a maximum over the ℓ1 and ℓ2 norms, its dual is given by\n‖u‖(el) ∗\nk := inf a∈Rd\n{ ‖a‖2 + √ k · ‖u− a‖∞ }\nNow take any u ∈ Rd. First we show ‖u‖(2)(k) ≤ ‖u‖ (el)∗ k . Without loss of generality, we take u1 ≥ · · · ≥ ud ≥ 0. For any a ∈ Rd,\n‖u‖(2)(k) = ‖u1:k‖2 ≤ ‖a1:k‖2 + ‖u1:k − a1:k‖2 ≤ ‖a‖2 + √ k‖u− a‖∞ .\nFinally, we show that ‖u‖(el) ∗ k < √ 2 ‖u‖(2)(k). Taking a = (u1 − uk+1, . . . , uk − uk+1, 0, . . . , 0) ⊤, we have\n‖u‖(el) ∗ k ≤ ‖a‖2 + √ k · ‖u− a‖∞ =\n√ √ √ √ k∑\ni=1\n(ui − uk+1)2 + √ k|uk+1|\n≤\n√ √ √ √ k∑\ni=1\n(u2i − u2k+1) + √ k u2k+1 ≤ √ 2 ·\n√ √ √ √ k∑\ni=1\n(u2i − u2k+1) + k u2k+1\n= √ 2 ‖u‖(2)(k) .\nFurthermore, this yields a strict inequality, because if u1 > uk+1, the nextto-last inequality is strict, while if u1 = · · · = uk+1, then the last inequality is strict."

In our view, this sheds light on the elastic net as a close approximation to this tightest possible convex relaxation, and motivates using the k-support norm when a tighter relaxation is sought. This is also demonstrated in our empirical results.\nWe note that the k-support norm has better prediction properties, but not necessarily better sparsity-inducing properties, as evident from its more rounded unit ball. It is well understood that there is often a tradeoff between sparsity and good prediction, and that even if the population optimal predictor is sparse, a denser predictor often yields better predictive performance [20, 3, 10]. For example, in the presence of correlated features, it is often beneficial to include several highly correlated features rather than a single representative feature. This is exactly the behavior encouraged by ℓ2 norm regularization, and the elastic net is already known to yield less sparse (but more predictive) solutions. The k-support norm goes a step further in this direction, often yielding solutions that are even less sparse (but more predictive) compared to the elastic net.\nNevertheless, it is interesting to consider whether compressed sensing results, where ℓ1 regularization is of course central, can be refined by using the k-support norm, which might be able to handle more correlation structure within the set of features."
