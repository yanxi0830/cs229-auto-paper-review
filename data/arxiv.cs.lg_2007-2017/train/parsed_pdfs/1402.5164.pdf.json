      "text" : "In many learning tasks, one type of error is costlier than other types. For example, when detecting spam messages, an important mail marked as spam (a false positive) is a major problem, whereas false negatives are only a minor nuisance. On the other hand, in settings such as detecting failures in an electric network, false negatives may be very harmful. In yet other settings, it may be better to refrain from making a prediction at all, rather than make a wrong one, e.g., when detecting medical ailments. Following Kalai et al. (2012), we call these kinds of tasks reliable learning. Closely related tasks have been widely studied in the statistics and machine learning literature. We discuss some of this work later; here, we simply note that the work of Kalai et al. and the present work depart from much of the extant literature by emphasizing computational considerations, i.e., by focusing on “fast” algorithms, and guarantees with respect to the zero-one loss.\nKalai et al. (2012) introduced a formal framework to study reliable learning in the agnostic setting, which is a challenging model that captures the problem of learning in the presence of adversarial classification noise. In particular, the goal of an agnostic learning algorithm is to produce a hypothesis that has error that is at most ǫ higher than the best from a certain class. A false positive error occurs when the true label is negative, but the hypothesis predicts positive. Analogously, a false negative error occurs when the true label is positive, but the hypothesis predicts negative.\nThe best positive reliable classifier from a class is one that make no false positive errors and minimizes false negative errors. In the positive reliable learning setting, the goal of a learning algorithm is to output a hypothesis with the following properties: (i) its false positive error rate is at most ǫ, (ii) its false negative error rate is at most ǫ more than that of the best positive reliable classifier from the class. The notion of negative reliable learning is identical with the roles of false positive and false negatives reversed.\nKalai et al. (2012) also introduced the notion of full reliability. A partial classifier is one that is allowed to sometimes predict “?” or unknown. The best partial classifier from a class is one that makes no errors and minimizes the probability of predicting ?. In the fully reliable learning setting, the goal of the learning algorithm is to output a hypothesis h : X → {−1, ?,+1} such that (i) the error of h is at most ǫ, (ii) the probability that h predicts ‘?’ is at most ǫ more than the best partial classifier from the class."

      "text" : "In this work, we focus on distribution-independent reliable learning, and our main technical contribution is to give new reliable learning algorithms for a variety of concept classes. We now place our reliable learning algorithms in the context of prior work on PAC and agnostic learning.\nThe threshold degree of a Boolean function f : {−1, 1}n → {−1, 1} is the least degree of a real polynomial that agrees in sign with f at all inputs x ∈ {−1, 1}n. The approximate degree (with error parameter ǫ) of f is the least degree of a real polynomial that point-wise approximates f to error at most ǫ. It is well-known that concept classes with low threshold degree can be efficiently learned in Valiant’s PAC model under arbitrary distributions; indeed, threshold degree upper bounds underlie the fastest known PAC learning algorithms for a variety of fundamental concept classes, including DNF and read-once formulae (Klivans and Servedio, 2004, Ambainis et al., 2010). Meanwhile, concept classes with low approximate degree can be efficiently learned in the agnostic model, a connection that has yielded the fastest known algorithms for distribution-independent agnostic learning (Kalai et al., 2005).\nWe show that concept classes with low one-sided approximate degree can be efficiently learned in the reliable agnostic model. Here, one-sided approximate degree is an intermediate notion that lies between threshold degree and approximate degree; we defer a formal definition to Section 2.3. One-sided approx-\nimate degree was introduced in its present form by Bun and Thaler (2013a) (see also (Sherstov, 2014)), though equivalent dual formulations had been used in several prior works (Gavinsky and Sherstov, 2010, Sherstov, 2013a, Bun and Thaler, 2013b). Our learning algorithm is similar to the L1 regression algorithm of Kalai et al. (2005); however, the analysis of our algorithm is more delicate. Specifically, due to asymmetry in the type of errors considered in the reliable setting, our analysis requires the use of two loss functions. On one side, we use the hinge loss rather than L1 loss, since one-sided polynomial approximations may be unbounded, and on the other, we use a non-convex Lipschitz approximation to the zero-one loss.\nWe identify important concept classes, such as majorities and intersections of majorities, whose onesided approximate degree is strictly smaller than its approximate degree. Consequently, we obtain reliable (in the case of majorities, even fully reliable) agnostic learning algorithms that are strictly more efficient than the fastest known algorithms in the standard agnostic setting. Our fully reliable learning algorithm for majorities gives the first indication that fully reliable learning may be strictly easier than agnostic learning. Finally, we show how to obtain smooth tradeoffs between sample complexity and runtime of algorithms for agnostically learning conjunctions, and for positive reliably learning DNF formulae.\nIn more detail, we summarize our new algorithmic results as follows (for simplicity, we omit dependence on the error parameter ǫ of the learning algorithm from this overview). We give:\n• A simple poly(n) time algorithm for positive reliable learning of disjunctions.\n• A 2Õ( √ n) time algorithm for fully reliable learning of majorities. In contrast, no 2o(n)-time algorithm\nfor agnostically learning majorities is known in the arbitrary-distribution setting.\n• A 2Õ( √ n logm) time algorithm for positive (respectively, negative) reliable learning of disjunctions\n(respectively, conjunctions) of m majorities.\n• For any d > n1/2, a nO(d)-time algorithm with sample complexity nO(n/d) for agnostically learning conjunctions, and for positive reliably learning poly(n)-term DNFs.\nAll of our algorithms also satisfy very strong attribute-efficiency properties: if the function being learned depends on only k ≪ n of the n input variables, then the sample complexity of the algorithm depends only logarithmically on n, though the dependence on k may be large. We defer a detailed statement of these properties until Section 3.2."

      "text" : "The problem of reliable classification can be expressed as minimizing a loss function with different costs for false negative and false positive errors (see e.g., (Domingos, 1999, Elkan, 2001)). Reliable learning is also related to the Neyman-Pearson criterion from classical statistics — where it has been shown that the optimal strategy to minimize one type of errors, subject to the other type being bounded, is to threshold the ratio of the likelihoods (Neyman and Pearson, 1933). However, the main problem is computational; in general the loss functions with different costs from these prior works are not convex and the resulting optimization problems are intractable. The work of Kalai et al. (2012) and the present work departs from the prior work in that we focus on algorithms with both provable guarantees on their generalization error with respect to the zero-one loss, and bounds on their computational complexity, rather than focusing purely on statistical efficiency.\nKalai et al. (2012) showed that any concept class that is agnostically learnable under a fixed distribution is also learnable in the reliable agnostic learning models under the same distribution. Furthermore, they\nshowed that if a class C is agnostically learnable, the class of disjunctions of concepts in C is positive reliably learnable (and the class of conjunctions of concepts in C is negative reliably learnable). Finally, they showed that if C is both positive and negative reliably learnable, then it is also fully reliably learnable. Using these general reductions, Kalai et al. showed that the class of polynomial-size DNF formulae is positive reliable learnable under the uniform distribution in polynomial time with membership queries (it also follows from their reductions and the agnostic learning algorithm of Kalai et al. (2005) described below that DNF formulae can be positive reliably learned in the distribution-independent setting in time 2Õ( √ n)). Agnostically learning DNFs under the uniform distribution remains a notorious open problem, and thus their work gave the first indication that positive (or negative) reliable learning may be easier than agnostic learning.\nKalai et al. (2005) put forth an algorithm for agnostic learning based on L1-regression. Our reliable learning algorithms based on one-sided approximate degree upper bounds is inspired by and generalizes their work. Klivans and Sherstov (2010) subsequently established strong limitations on the L1-regression approach of Kalai et al. (2005), proving lower bounds on the size of any set of “feature functions” that can point-wise approximate the concept classes of majorities and conjunctions. Their work implies that substantially new ideas will be required to obtain a 2o(n)-time distribution-independent agnostic learning algorithm for majorities, or a 2o( √ n) time algorithm for agnostically learning conjunctions.\nFinally, lower bounds on one-sided approximate degree have recently been used in several works to establish strong limitations on the power of existing algorithms for PAC learning (Bun and Thaler, 2013a, Sherstov, 2014, Bun and Thaler, 2013b, Gavinsky and Sherstov, 2010, Sherstov, 2013a). In this paper, we do the opposite: we use one-sided approximate degree upper bounds to give new, more efficient learning algorithms in the reliable agnostic setting.\nOrganization\nIn Section 2, we review the definitions of agnostic learning, and positive, negative and fully reliable learning. In Section 3, we first give a very simple polynomial time algorithm for positive reliable learning of disjunctions, before showing that appropriate one-sided polynomial approximations for function classes result in efficient reliable learning algorithms. In Section 4, we give constructions of one-sided approximating polynomials for (conjunctions and disjunctions of) low-weight halfspaces, as well as for DNF and CNF formulae. In Section 5, we show how tradeoffs may be obtained for some of our results between sample complexity and running time, and in Section 6, we describe some limitations of our approach. We end with a discussion and directions for future work."

Below we define positive and negative reliable learning. In short, positive reliable learning requires that the learning algorithm produce a hypothesis that makes (almost) no false positive errors, while simultaneously minimizing false negative errors. Likewise, in the case of negative reliable learning, the learning algorithm must output a hypothesis that makes (almost) no false negative errors, while simultaneously minimizing false positive errors. Although the definitions of positive and negative reliable learning are entirely symmetric, we define the two separately for the sake of clarity.\nDefinition 3 (Positive Reliable Learning (Kalai et al., 2012)).

We describe a generic algorithm that positive reliably learns any concept class that can be positive one-sided approximated by degree d and weight W polynomials. The weight W controls the sample complexity of the learning algorithm, and the degree d controls the running time. For many natural classes, the resulting algorithm is has strong attribute-efficient properties, since the weight of the approximating polynomial typically depends only on the number of relevant attributes.\nOur algorithm extends the L1-regression technique of Kalai et al. (2005) for agnostic learning, but we require a more detailed analysis. In the case of positive-reliable learning, it is required that the hypothesis output by the algorithm makes almost no false positive errors — this is enforced as constraints in a linear program. To control the false negative errors of the hypothesis, we have the objective function of the linear program minimize the hinge loss, which is analogous to the L1 loss, but the penalty is only enforced when the prediction disagrees in sign with the true label. To bound the generalization error of the output hypothesis, we use bounds on the Rademacher complexity of the approximating polynomials (see Section 2.5 for details).\nTheorem 5. Let C be a concept class that is positive (negative) one-sided ǫ-approximated by polynomials of degree d and weight W .

This program is similar to one used in the L1-regression algorithm for agnostic learning introduced by Kalai et al. (2005). The variables of the program are the∑d\nj=0 (n j ) = O(nd) coefficients of the polynomial p(x). The above mathematical program is then easily implemented as a linear program. Let p denote an optimal solution to the linear program. The hypothesis output by the algorithm will be a randomized boolean function, defined as follows:\n1. If p(x) ≤ −1, h(x) = −1.\n2. If p(x) ≥ 1, h(x) = +1. 3. If −1 < p(x) < +1, h(x) = { +1 with probability(1 + p(x))/2\n−1 with probability(1− p(x))/2\nRunning Time. Since the above program can be implemented as a linear program with O(nd) variables and O(m+ nd) constraints, the running time to produce the output polynomial p is poly(m,nd). Note that the polynomial p defines the output hypothesis h completely, except for the randomness used by h. For any x, h(x) can be evaluated in time O(nd) by a randomized Turing machine. Remark 1 explains how h can be converted to a deterministic hypothesis.\nGeneralization Error. We will use two loss functions in our analysis. Define ℓ+ : R × {−1, 1} → R+ as follows:\nℓ+(y ′,+1) = 0,\nℓ+(y ′,−1) =    0 y′ ≤ −1 + ǫ 1 ǫ (y\n′ + 1− ǫ) −1 + ǫ < y′ ≤ −1 + 2ǫ 1 −1 + 2ǫ < y′\nClearly ℓ+ is bounded between [0, 1] always and also it is 1/ǫ-Lipschitz. For a function, f : X → R, let L+(f) denote the expected loss of f under D and the loss function ℓ+, and similarly let L̂+(f) denote the empirical loss of f under ℓ+.\nDefine ℓ− : R× {−1, 1} → R+ as follows:\nℓ−(y ′,−1) = 0, ℓ−(y ′,+1) = (1− y′)+\nLet p continue to denote an optimal solution to the linear program. Note that since X = {−1, 1}n, and weight(p) ≤ W , it holds that |p(x)| ≤ W for all x ∈ X. It follows that ℓ−(p(x), b) ≤ W +1 for all x ∈ X and b ∈ {−1,+1}. Moreover, ℓ− is easily seen to be 1-Lipschitz. For a function, f : X → R, let L−(f) and L̂−(f) denote the expected and empirical loss of f respectively under distribution D and loss function ℓ−.\nRecall that C+(D) = {c ∈ C | false+(c) = 0}. Let c∗ ∈ C+(D) be an optimal positive reliable classifier, i.e., false−(c∗) = min\nc∈C+(D) false−(c). Let p∗ ∈ Pd,W be a positive one-sided ǫ-approximating\npolynomial for c∗ whose existence is guaranteed by hypothesis. Note that since p∗(x) ≥ 1 − ǫ for x ∈ (c∗)−1(1) and p∗(x) ∈ [−1− ǫ,−1 + ǫ] for x ∈ (c∗)−1(−1), the following is true:\nL+(p∗) = 0 L−(p∗) ≤ 2 false−(c∗) + ǫ\nHere, the inequality holds because ℓ−(y′, 1) = (1 − y′)+, which is between 2 − ǫ and 2 + ǫ when p∗(x) ∈ [−1− ǫ,−1 + ǫ]. Thus, each x on which c∗ makes a false negative error contributes approximately 2 to L−(p); the extra ǫ accounts for the approximation error.\nFix a δ > 0. Recall that Pd,W is the class of degree d and weight W polynomials. Then the Rademacher complexity, Rm(Pd,W ) ≤ W √ (2d log(2n))/m (see (1) in Section 2.5). Let α = (4/ǫ)Rm(Pd,W )+2(W+\n1)\n√ log(1/δ)\n2m . Recall that p is the polynomial output by running the linear program. Then the following holds with probability 1− δ:\nL−(p) ≤ L̂−(p) + α Using Theorem 2 ≤ L̂−(p∗) + α Since p∗ is a feasible solution ≤ L−(p∗) + 2α Using Theorem 2 ≤ 2 false−(c∗) + 2α+ ǫ. (2)\nSimilarly, using Theorem 2 and the fact that L̂+(p) = 0, we have that L+(p) ≤ α. We have the following:\nfalse+(h) = E(x,y)∼D[I(y = −1)I(h(x) = 1)] = E(x,y)∼D[I(y = −1)Pr(h(x) = 1 | p(x))].\nThe inner probability is only over the randomness used by the hypothesis h. It follows from the definition of the randomized hypothesis h and the loss function ℓ+, that Pr(h(x) = 1 | p(x)) ≤ ℓ+(p(x),−1) + ǫ/2. This together with the fact that ℓ+(p(x),+1) = 0 for all x, and L+(p) ≤ α, gives us\nfalse+(h) ≤ E(x,y)∼D[ǫ/2 + ℓ+(p(x), y)] ≤ ǫ/2 + L+(p) ≤ ǫ/2 + α.\nSimilarly, we have the following:\nfalse−(h) = E(x,y)∼D[I(y = +1)I(h(x) = −1)] = E(x,y)∼D[I(y = +1)Pr(h(x) = −1 | p(x))]\nAgain, the inner probability is only over the randomness of the hypothesis h. From the definitions of ℓ− and h, it follows that Pr(h(x) = −1 | p(x)) ≤ ℓ−(p(x),+1)/2. Using this along with the fact that ℓ−(p(x),−1) = 0 for all x, and (2) we get\nfalse−(h) ≤ E(x,y)∼D[ 1 2 ℓ−(p(x), y)] ≤ false−(c∗) + α+ ǫ/2\nFinally, it is easily verified that for the value of m in the theorem statement, α ≤ ǫ/2. This completes the proof of the theorem.\nRemark 1. The randomized hypothesis h can easily be converted to a deterministic one as follows: let H(x) = chop(p(x)), where chop(a) = a for a ∈ [−1, 1] and chop(a) = sgn(a) for a 6∈ [−1, 1]. Note that E[h(x)] = H(x) for each x. Take a fresh sample of size m = O(1/ǫ2) and construct 〈(H(xi), yi)〉mi=1. For a threshold t, let ht = sgn(H(x)−t). Find the smallest value t∗, such that 1m ∑ yi=−1 I(ht∗(xi) = +1) ≤ ǫ. Then, a simple VC argument implies that ht∗ is a deterministic hypothesis with the required properties.\nTheorem 5 satisfies a strong attribute-efficiency property. The sample complexity depends only logarithmically on n, and polynomially on the weight of the polynomial approximations, which can be much smaller then nd. A similar statement can also be made for agnostic learning; this observation was already implicit in some prior work (see e.g., (Feldman et al., 2013)); we state this as a theorem for completeness. Instead of the mathematical program described in the proof of Theorem 5, to obtain Theorem 6, the L1regression algorithm of Kalai et al. (2005) is directly applied, with the added constraint that the weight of the approximating polynomial is at most W . The rest of the proof is similar, but simpler — we only use ℓ(y′, y) = |y′ − y| as the loss function in the analysis. The proof is omitted since it is essentially a simplification of the proof of Theorem 5.\nTheorem 6. Let C be a concept class of functions from X → {−1, 1}, such that for every c ∈ C , there exists a polynomial p of degree at most d and weight at most W , such that for all x ∈ X, |p(x)− c(x)| ≤ ǫ. Then, C can be agnostically learned with the following properties:\n1. The running time of the learning algorithm is polynomial in nd and 1/ǫ.\n2. The sample complexity is polynomial in W , log(n), log(1/δ) and 1/ǫ.\n3. The hypothesis output by the algorithm can be evaluated at any x ∈ X in time O(nd)."

      "text" : "In this section, we construct both positive and negative one-sided polynomial approximations for low-weight halfspaces, as well as positive (respectively, negative) one-sided approximations for disjunctions (respectively, conjunctions) of low-weight halfspaces. Theorem 7. Let h(x) = sgn(w0 + ∑n\ni=1wixi) denote any halfspace, where wi are integers. Let W =∑n i=0 |wi| denote the weight of h. Both d̃eg+,ǫ(h) and d̃eg−,ǫ(h) are in Õ (√ W log (1/ǫ) ) , with the relevant approximating polynomials having weight at most exp ( Õ (√ W log (1/ǫ) )) . In particular, the majority function MAJ(x) = sgn( ∑n\ni=1 xi) has both positive and negative ǫ-approximating polynomials of\ndegree at most Õ( √ n log (1/ǫ)) and weight at most exp ( Õ( √ n log (1/ǫ)) )\nRemark. By adapting standard symmetrization arguments (cf. Buhrman et al. (1999)), the Õ( √ n log (1/ǫ))\nupper bound on d̃eg+,ǫ(MAJ) is easily seen to be tight up to factors hidden by the Õ notation.\nProof. We begin with the case of constant ǫ; i.e., we first show that for ǫ = 1/4, d̃eg+,ǫ(h) and d̃eg−,ǫ(h) are in O(W 1/2). We use the following standard properties of the Chebyshev polynomials (cf. the standard texts of Cheney (1982) and Rivlin (1981)).\nFact 1. The d’th Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind, Td(t) : R → R has degree d and satisfies\n|Td(t)| ≤ 1 for all − 1 ≤ t ≤ 1. (3) 2 ≤ T⌈a⌉(1 + 1/a2) for all a ≥ 1. (4) Td(t) is non-decreasing on the interval [1,∞]. (5) All coefficients of Td are bounded in absolute value by 3 d. (6)\nLet d = ⌈W 1/2⌉. Consider the univariate polynomial G(t) = Td(2t/W + 1). Then G satisfies the following properties.\nG(t) ∈ [−1, 1] for all t ∈ [−W, 0]. (7) G(t) ≥ 2 for all t ∈ [1,∞]. (8)\nIndeed, Property 7 follows from Property 3, while Property 8 follows from Properties 4 and 5. Now consider the univariate polynomial P (t) = G(t)4/4− 1. It is straightforward to check that\nP (t) ∈ [−3/4, 1] for all t ∈ [−W, 0]. (9) P (t) ≥ 3 for all t ∈ [1,∞]. (10)\nFinally, consider the n-variate polynomial p : {−1, 1}n → R defined via\np(x) = P (w0 +\nn∑\ni=1\nwixi).\nCombining the fact that ∑n\ni=0 |wi| ≤ W with Properties 9 and 10, we see that p is a positive one-sided 1/4- approximation for h. Moreover, deg(p) ≤ deg(P ) = O(W 1/2), and the weight of p is at most WO( √ W ). Similarly, −p(−x) is a negative one-sided 1/4-approximation for h. This completes the proof for ǫ = 1/4. The construction for ǫ = o(1) is somewhat more complicated. For any k ≥ 1 and any W , Kahn et al. (1996) construct a univariate polynomial Sk satisfying the following properties:\ndeg(Sk) ≤ k. (11) Sk(t) ≥ 1 for all t ≥ W. (12) Sk(t) ≤ exp ( −Ω(k2/W logW ) ) for all t ∈ {0, . . . ,W − 1}. (13)\nAll coefficients of Sk(t) are bounded in absolute value by W O(k). (14)\nFor completeness, we give the details of this construction and a proof of Properties 11-14 in Appendix A.\nFor any ǫ > 0, let k = ⌈(W logW log (1/ǫ))1/2⌉, and let q : {−1, 1}n → R denote the n-variate polynomial defined via\nq(x) = Sk ( W +w0 + n∑\ni=1\nwixi\n) .\nIt is then straightforward to check that q is a positive one-sided ǫ-approximation for h of degree at most k =\nÕ (√ W log (1/ǫ) )\nand weight at most W Õ(k). Similarly, −q(−x) is a negative one-sided ǫ-approximation for h. This completes the proof.\nThe concept class of majorities is defined as the collection of the majority functions on each of the 2n\nsubsets of the variables.\nCorollary 1. The concept class of Majorities on n variables can be positive or negative reliably agnostically learned with error parameter ǫ in time 2 Õ (√ n log(1/ǫ) ) .\nProof. Combine Theorems 5 and 7, noting that any majority function is a halfspace of weight at most n.\nBy combining Corollary 1 with Theorem 1, we obtain a fully reliable algorithm for learning low-weight halfspaces.\nCorollary 2. The concept class of Majorities on n variables can be fully reliably learned with error parameter ǫ in time 2 Õ (√ n log(1/ǫ) ) .\nWe now consider significantly more expressive concept classes: disjunctions and conjunctions of majorities.\nTheorem 8. Consider m functions f1 . . . fm. Fix a d > 0, and suppose that each fi has a positive one-sided (ǫ/m)-approximating polynomial of degree at most d and weight at most W . Then ORm(f1, . . . , fm) has a positive one-sided ǫ-approximating polynomial of degree at most d and weight at most m ·W .\nSimilarly, if each fi has a negative one-sided (ǫ/m)-approximating polynomial of degree at most d and weight at most W , then ANDm(f1, . . . , fm) has a negative one-sided ǫ-approximating polynomial of degree at most d and weight at most m ·W .\nProof. We prove the statement about ORm(f1, . . . , fm); the statement about ANDm(f1, . . . , fm) is analogous. Let pi be a positive one-sided (ǫ/m)-approximating polynomial for fi. Then p = −1+ ∑m i=1(1+pi) is a positive one-sided ǫ-approximating polynomial for f . Moreover, the degree of p is at most maxi{deg(pi)} ≤ d, while the weight of p is at most m ·W . This completes the proof.\nCorollary 3. Disjunctions of m Majorities can be positive reliably learned with error parameter ǫ in time 2Õ( √ n log(m/ǫ)). Conjunctions of m Majorities can also be negative reliably learned in the same time bound.\nProof. Combine Theorems 5, 7, and 8."

However, the sample complexity of the algorithm can also be as large as 2Õ( √ n log(1/ǫ)).\nThis result relies on the existence of ǫ-approximating polynomials for the n-variate AND function of degree Õ( √ n log(1/ǫ)).\nTheorem 6 gives an avenue for obtaining better sample complexity, at the cost of increased runtime: if we can show that any conjunction on n variables can be ǫ-approximated by a degree d polynomial of weight W ≪ 2 √\nn log(1/ǫ), then the L1-regression algorithm will have sample complexity only poly(d,W ) and runtime nO(d). Thus, in order to obtain tradeoffs between runtime and sample complexity for algorithms that agnostically learn conjunctions, it suffices to understand what are the achievable tradeoffs between degree and weight of ǫ-approximating polynomials for the AND function.\nIn fact, this question is already well-understood in the case of constant ǫ: letting ANDn denote the AND function on n variables, Servedio et al. (2012) implicitly showed that for any √ n < d and any ǫ = Θ(1), there exists an ǫ-approximating polynomial for the ANDn function of degree d and weight poly(n)·2Õ(n/d). In fact, this construction is essentially optimal, matching a lower bound for constant ǫ proved in the same paper (see also (Bun and Thaler, 2013a, Lemma 20)). We now extend the ideas of Servedio et al. (2012) to handle subconstant values of ǫ. Theorem 9. Fix a d > Ω̃ (√ n log n log(1/ǫ) ) . There exists an (explicit) ǫ-approximating polynomial for\nANDn of degree d and weight 2Õ(n log(1/ǫ)/d).\nProof. We write ANDn as an “and-of-ands”, where the outer AND has fan-in t, and the inner ANDs each have fan-in n/t, where we choose t such that t/ log t = n2 log(1/ǫ)/d2. That is, we write ANDn(x) = ANDt(ANDn/t(x (1)), . . . ,ANDn/t(x (t))), where x(i) = (xn·(i−1)/t+1, . . . , xn·i/t) denotes the ith “block” of variables in x. Note that t ≤ n by the assumption that d > Ω̃ (√ n log n log(1/ǫ) ) .\nWe obtain an ǫ-approximating polynomial p for ANDn as follows. Kahn et al. (1996) gave an explicit ǫapproximating polynomial pt for ANDt of degree d′ = O( √ t log t log(1/ǫ)). It is an immediate consequent of Parseval’s inequality that pt has weight at most td ′/2. We will also need the following standard fact. Fact 2. The real polynomial q : {−1, 1}n/t → {−1, 1} defined via q(y1, . . . yn/t) = 2 ∏n/t i=1 1+yi 2 − 1 computes ANDn/t(x). Moreover, q has degree at most n/t and weight at most 3.\nFinally, we define p(x) = pt(q(x(1)), . . . q(x(t))). Notice that p has degree at most d′ · n/t = O (√ t log t log(1/ǫ) · n/t ) =O ( n √ log t log(1/ǫ)/t ) = O(d) and weight at most tO(d ′) = 2Õ(n log(1/ǫ)/d)\nas claimed.\nWe obtain the following learning result that holds even for ǫ = o(1).\nCorollary 4. For any d > Ω̃ (√ n log n log(1/ǫ) ) and ǫ, the class of conjunctions on n variables can be\nagnostically learned to error ǫ in time nO(d), with sample complexity 2Õ(n log(1/ǫ)/d)."

Here, we give an algorithm for positive reliable learning of DNFs that has smaller sample complexity, at the cost of larger runtime.\nTheorem 10. For any DNF F of size m and width (i.e., maximum term length) at most w, and any d > Ω̃ (√ w logw log(1/ǫ) ) , there exists an (explicit) positive one-sided ǫ-approximating polynomial for F of\ndegree d and weight 2Õ(w log(m/ǫ)/d).

      "text" : "We have shown that concept classes with low one-sided approximate degree can be efficiently learned in the reliable agnostic model. As we have seen, one-sided approximate degree is an intermediate notion that lies between threshold degree and approximate degree; we have identified important concept classes, such as majorities and intersections of majorities, whose one-sided approximate degree is strictly smaller than its approximate degree. Consequently, we have obtained reliable (in some cases, even fully reliable) agnostic learning algorithms that are strictly more efficient than the fastest known agnostic ones. We have thereby given the first evidence that even fully reliable agnostic learning may be strictly easier than agnostic learning.\nThe notion of one-sided polynomial approximation has only been introduced very recently (Bun and Thaler (2013a)), and previously had only been used to prove lower bounds. By giving the first algorithmic application of one-sided polynomial approximations, our work lends further credence to the notion that these approximations are fundamental objects worthy of further study in their own right. Just as threshold degree and approximate degree have found applications (both positive and negative) in many domains outside of learning theory, we hope that one-sided approximate degree will as well. Identifying such applications is a significant direction for further work.\nOur work does raise several open questions specific to one-sided polynomial approximations. Here we highlight two. We have shown that halfspaces of weight at most W have one-sided approximate degree Õ(W 1/2), and yet there exist halfspaces with one-sided approximate degree Ω(n). However, the (nonexplicit) halfspace from Sherstov (2013b) that we used to demonstrate the Ω(n) lower bound has weight 2Ω(n). Is it possible that all halfspaces of weight 2O(n\n1−δ) for some δ > 0 always have one-sided approximate degree o(n)?

Kalai et al. (2012) introduced a formal framework to study reliable learning in the agnostic setting, which is a challenging model that captures the problem of learning in the presence of adversarial classification noise. In particular, the goal of an agnostic learning algorithm is to produce a hypothesis that has error that is at most ǫ higher than the best from a certain class. A false positive error occurs when the true label is negative, but the hypothesis predicts positive. Analogously, a false negative error occurs when the true label is positive, but the hypothesis predicts negative. The best positive reliable classifier from a class is one that make no false positive errors and minimizes false negative errors. In the positive reliable learning setting, the goal of a learning algorithm is to output a hypothesis with the following properties: (i) its false positive error rate is at most ǫ, (ii) its false negative error rate is at most ǫ more than that of the best positive reliable classifier from the class. The notion of negative reliable learning is identical with the roles of false positive and false negatives reversed. Kalai et al. (2012) also introduced the notion of full reliability.",

By giving the first algorithmic application of one-sided polynomial approximations, our work lends further credence to the notion that these approximations are fundamental objects worthy of further study in their own right. Just as threshold degree and approximate degree have found applications (both positive and negative) in many domains outside of learning theory, we hope that one-sided approximate degree will as well. Identifying such applications is a significant direction for further work. Our work does raise several open questions specific to one-sided polynomial approximations. Here we highlight two. We have shown that halfspaces of weight at most W have one-sided approximate degree Õ(W 1/2), and yet there exist halfspaces with one-sided approximate degree Ω(n). However, the (nonexplicit) halfspace from Sherstov (2013b) that we used to demonstrate the Ω(n) lower bound has weight 2Ω(n).",

    "abstractText" : "We study several questions in the reliable agnostic learning framework of Kalai et al. (2009), which captures learning tasks in which one type of error is costlier than other types. A positive reliable classifier is one that makes no false positive errors. The goal in the positive reliable agnostic framework is to output a hypothesis with the following properties: (i) its false positive error rate is at most ǫ, (ii) its false negative error rate is at most ǫ more than that of the best positive reliable classifier from the class. A closely related notion is fully reliable agnostic learning, which considers partial classifiers that are allowed to predict “unknown” on some inputs. The best fully reliable partial classifier is one that makes no errors and minimizes the probability of predicting “unknown”, and the goal in fully reliable learning is to output a hypothesis that is almost as good as the best fully reliable partial classifier from a class. For distribution-independent learning, the best known algorithms for PAC learning typically utilize polynomial threshold representations, while the state of the art agnostic learning algorithms use pointwise polynomial approximations. We show that one-sided polynomial approximations, an intermediate notion between polynomial threshold representations and point-wise polynomial approximations, suffice for learning in the reliable agnostic settings. We then show that majorities can be fully reliably learned and disjunctions of majorities can be positive reliably learned, through constructions of appropriate onesided polynomial approximations. Our fully reliable algorithm for majorities provides the first evidence that fully reliable learning may be strictly easier than agnostic learning. Our algorithms also satisfy strong attribute-efficiency properties, and in many cases they provide smooth tradeoffs between sample complexity and running time. University of California, Berkeley.
