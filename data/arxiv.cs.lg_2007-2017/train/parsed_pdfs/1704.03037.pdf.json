      "heading" : "1 INTRODUCTION",
      "text" : "With the ability to access massive amounts of heterogeneous data from multiple sources, multi-view data have become prevalent in many real-world applications. For instance, in recommender systems, online review sites (like Amazon and Yelp) have access to contextual information of shopping histories of users, the reviews wri en by the users, the categorizations of the items, as well as the friends of the users. Each view may exhibit pairwise interactions (e.g., the friendships between users) or even higher-order interactions (e.g., a customer write a review for a product) among entities (such as customers, products, and reviews), and can be represented in a multi-way data structure, i.e., tensor. Since di erent views usually provide complementary information [4, 5, 17], how to effectively incorporate information frommultiple structural views is critical to good prediction performance for various machine learning tasks.\nTypically, a predictivemodel is de ned as a function of predictor variables (e.g., the customer id, the product id, and the categories of the product) to some target (e.g., the rating). e most common approach in predictive modeling for multi-view structural data is to describe samples with feature vectors that are a ened and concatenated from structural views, and apply a machine learning method, such as linear regression (LR) and support vectormachines (SVMs), to learn the target function from observed samples. Recent works have shown that linear models fail for tasks with very sparse data [21, 22]. A variety of methods have been proposed to address the data sparsity issue by factorizing the monomials (or feature interactions) with kernel tricks, such as the ANOVA kernels used in FMs [2, 21] and polynominal kernels used in polynominal networks [3, 16]. However, the disadvantages of this approach are that (1) the important structural information of each view will be discarded which may lead to the degraded prediction performance and (2) the feature vectors can grow very large which can make learning and prediction very slow or even infeasible, especially if each view involves relations of high cardinality. For example, including the relation “friends of a user” in the feature vector (represented by their IDs) can result in a very long feature vector. Further, it will repeatedly appear in many samples that involve the given user.\nMatrix/tensor factorization models have been a topic of interest in the areas of structural data analysis, such as community detection [10], collaborative ltering [13, 24], and neuroimage analysis [9]. Assuming multi-view data have the same underlying lowrank structure (at least in one mode), coupled data analysis such as collective matrix factorization (CMF) [25] and coupled matrix and tensor factorization (CMTF) [1] that jointly factorize multiple matrices (or tensors) has been applied to applications such as clustering and missing data recovery. However, since existing coupled factorizationmodels are unsupervised, the importance of each structural view in modeling the target value cannot be automatically learned. Furthermore, when applying these models to data with rich meta information (e.g., friendships) but extremely sparse target values (e.g., ratings), it is very likely the learning process will be dominated by the meta information without manual tuning some hyperparameters, e.g., the weights of the ing error of each matrix/tensor in the objective function [25], the weights of di erent types of latent factors in the predictive models [14], or the regularization hyperparamters of latent factor alignment [18].\nIn this paper, we propose a general and exible framework for learning the predictive structure from the complex relationships within the multi-view structural data. Each view of an instance in this framework is represented by a tensor that describes the multi-way interactions of subsets of entities, and di erent views have some entities in common. Constructing the tensors for each instance may not be realistic for real-world applications in terms of space and computational complexity, and the model parameters can have exponential growth and tend to be over ing. In order to preserve the structural information of multi-view data without physically constructing the tensors, we introduce structural factorization machines (SFMs) that can learn the consistent representations in the latent feature spaces shared in the multi-view tensors while automatically adjust the contribution of each view in the predictive model. Furthermore, we provide an e cient method to avoid redundant computing on repeating pa erns stemming from the relational structure of the data, such that SFMs can make the same predictions but with largely speed up computation.\ne contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n• We introduce a novel multi-tensor framework for mining\ndata from heterogeneous domains, which can explore the high order correlations underlying multi-view structural data in a generic predictive model. • We develop structural factorization machines (SFMs) tai-\nlored for learning the common latent spaces shared inmultiview tensors and automatically adjusting the importance of each view in the predictive model. e complexity of SFMs is linear in the number of features, which makes SFMs suitable to large-scale problems.\n• Extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets are per-\nformed along with comparisons to existing state-of-theart factorization models to demonstrate its advantages.\ne rest of this paper is organized as follows. We introduce the problem de nition and some preliminary works in Section 2. We then propose the framework for learning multi-view structural data, and develop the structural factorizationmachines (SFMs), and\nprovide an e cient computing method in Section 3. e experimental results and parameter analysis are reported in Section 4. Section 5 concludes this paper."

      "text" : "Tensor is a mathematical representation of a multi-way array. e order of a tensor is the number of modes (or ways). A zero-order tensor is a scalar, a rst-order tensor is a vector, a second-order tensor is a matrix and a tensor of order three or higher is called a higher-order tensor. To facilitate the distinction between scalars, vectors, matrices and higher-order tensors, the type of a quantity will be re ected by its representation: scalars are denoted by lowercase le ers, vectors by boldfaced lowercase le ers, matrices by boldface uppercase le ers, and tensors are denoted by calligraphic le ers. An element of a vector x, a matrix X, or a tensor X is denoted by xi , xi, j , xi, j,k , etc., depending on the number of modes. All vectors are column vectors unless otherwise speci ed. For an arbitrary matrix X ∈ RI×J , its i-th row and j-th column vector are denoted by xi and xj , respectively. Given two matrices X,Y ∈ RI×J , X ∗ Y denotes the element-wise (Hadamard) product between X and Y, de ned as the matrix in RI×J . For each integer M > 1, [1 : M] denotes all integers from 1 to M . An overview of the basic symbols used in this paper can be found in Table 1.\nDe nition 2.1 (Inner product). e inner product of two samesized tensors X,Y ∈ RI1×I2×···×IM is de ned as the sum of the products of their entries:\n〈X,Y〉 = I1∑ i1=1 I2∑ i2=1 · · · IM∑ iM=1 xi1,i2, ...,iMyi1,i2, ...,iM . (1)\nDe nition 2.2 (Outer product). e outer product of two tensors\nX ∈ RI1×I2×···×IN and Y ∈ RI ′ 1×I ′ 2×···×I ′ M is a (N + M)th-order tensor denoted by X ◦ Y, and the elements are de ned by\n(X ◦ Y)i1,i2, ...,iN ,i ′1,i ′ 2, ...,i ′ M = xi1,i2, · · · ,iNyi ′1,i ′ 2, · · · ,i ′ M (2)\nfor all values of the indices.\nNotice that for rank-one tensors X = x(1) ◦ x(2) ◦ · · · ◦ x(M) and\nY = y(1) ◦ y(2) ◦ · · · ◦ y(M), it holds that\n〈X,Y〉 = 〈 x(1), y(1) 〉 〈 x(2), y(2) 〉 · · · 〈 x(M), y(M) 〉 .

Given a tensorX ∈ RI1×I2×···×IM\nand an integer R, the CP factorization is de ned by factor matrices X(m) ∈ RIm×R form ∈ [1 : M], respectively, such that\nX = R∑ r=1 x (1) r ◦ x (2) r ◦ · · · ◦ x (M) r = JX (1),X(2), · · · ,X(M)K , (4)\nwhere x (m) r ∈ R Im is the r -th column of the factor matrixX(m), and J·K is used for shorthand notation of the sum of rank-one tensors."

      "heading" : "2.2 Problem Formulation",
      "text" : "Our problem is di erent from conventional multi-view learning approaches where multiple views of data are assumed independent and disjoint, and each view is described by a vector. We formulate the multi-view learning problem using coupled analysis of multiview features in the form of multiple tensors.\nSuppose that the problem includes V views where each view consists of a collection of subsets of entities (such as person, company, location, product) and di erent views have some entities in common. We denote a view as a tuple (x(1), x(2), · · · , x(M)),M ≥ 2, where x(m) ∈ RIm is a feature vector associated with the entitym. Inspired by [5], we construct tensor representation for each view over its entities by\nX̃ = x̃(1) ◦ x̃(2) ◦ · · · ◦ x̃(M) ∈ R(1+I1)×···×(1+IM ),\nwhere x̃(m) = [1;x(m)] ∈ R1+Im and ◦ is the outer product operator. In this manner, the full-order interactions 1 between entities are embeddedwithin the tensor structure, which not only provides a uni ed and compact representation for each view, but also facilitate e cient design methods. Fig. 1 shows an example of two structural views, where the rst view consists of the full-order interactions among the rst three modes (e.g., review text, item ID, and user ID), and the second view consists of the full-order interactions among the last two modes (e.g., user ID and friend IDs).\n1Full-order interactions range from the rst-order interactions (i.e., contributions of single entity features) to the highest-order interactions (i.e., contributions of the outer product of features from all entities).\nA er generating the tensor representation for each view, we de ne the multi-view learning problem as follows. Given a train-\ning set D = {({ X̃ (1) n , X̃ (2) n , · · · , X̃ (V ) n } , yn ) | n ∈ [1 : N ] } , where X̃ (v) n ∈ R (1+I1)×···×(1+IMv ) is the tensor representation in the vth view for the n-th instance, yn is the response of the n-th instance, Mv is the number of the constitutive modes in the v-th view, and N is the number of labeled instances. We assume different views have common entities, thus the resulting tensors will share common modes, e.g., the third mode in Fig 1. As we are concerned with predicting unknown values of multiple coupled tensors, our goal is to leverage the relational information from all the views to help predict the unlabeled instances, as well as to use the complementary among di erent views to improve the performance. Speci cally, we are interested in nding a predictive function f : X(1) × X(2) · · · × X(V ) → Y that minimizes the expected loss, where X(v),v ∈ [1 : V ] is the input space in thev-th view and Y is the output space."

      "text" : "Without loss of generality, we take two views as an example to introduce our basic design of the predictive models. Speci cally, we consider coupled analysis of a third-order tensor and a matrix with\none mode in common. Given an input instance ({ X̃(1), X̃(2) } , y ) , where X̃(1) = x̃(1) ◦ x̃(2) ◦ x̃(3) ∈ R(1+I )×(1+J )×(1+K ) and X̃(2) = x̃(3) ◦ x̃(4) ∈ R(1+K )×(1+L). An intuitive solution is to build the following multiple linear model:\nf ({ X̃(1), X̃(2) }) = 〈 W̃(1), X̃(1) 〉 + 〈 W̃(2), X̃(2) 〉 (5)\nwhere W̃(1) ∈ R(1+I )×(1+J )×(1+K ) and W̃(2) ∈ R(1+K )×(1+L) are the weights for each view to be learned.\nHowever, in this case it does not take into account the relations and di erences between two views. In order to incorporate the relations between two views and also discriminate the importance\nof each view, we introduce an indicator vector ev ∈ R V for each view v as\nev = [0, · · · , 0︸ ︷︷ ︸ v-1 , 1, 0, · · · , 0]T,\nand transform the predictive model in Eq. (5) into\nf ({ X̃(1), X̃(2) }) = 〈 Ŵ(1), X̃(1) ◦ e1 〉 + 〈 Ŵ(2), X̃(2) ◦ e2 〉 , (6)\nwhere Ŵ(1) ∈ R(1+I )×(1+J )×(1+K )×2 and Ŵ(2) ∈ R(1+K )×(1+L)×2.\nDirectly learning the weight tensors Ŵs leads to two drawbacks. First, the weight parameters are learned independently for di erent modes and di erent views. When the feature interactions rarely (or even never) appear during training, it is unlikely to learn the associated parameters appropriately. Second, the number of parameters in Eq. (6) is exponential to the number of features, which can make the model prone to over ing and ine ective on sparse data. Here, we assume that each weight tensor has a low-rank approximation, and Ŵ(1) and Ŵ(2) can be decomposed by CP factorization as\nŴ(1) = JΘ̂(1,1), Θ̂(1,2), Θ̂(1,3),ΦK\n= J[b(1,1);Θ(1)], [b(1,2);Θ(2)], [b(1,3);Θ(3)],ΦK,\nand\nŴ(2) = JΘ̂(2,3), Θ̂(2,4),ΦK = J[b(2,3);Θ(3)], [b(2,4);Θ(4)],ΦK,\nwhere Θ(m) ∈ RIm×R is the factor matrix for the features in the m-th mode. It is worth noting that Θ(3) is shared in the two views. Φ ∈ R2×R is the factor matrix for the view indicator, and b(v,m) ∈ R 1×R , which is always associated with the constant one in x̃(m) = [1; x(m)], represents the bias factors of them-th mode in the v-th view. rough b(v,m), the lower-order interactions (the interactions excluding the features from them-th mode) in the v-th view are explored in the predictive function.\nen we can transform Eq. (6) into〈 Ŵ(1), X̃(1) ◦ e1 〉 + 〈 Ŵ(2), X̃(2) ◦ e2 〉\n= R∑ r=1 〈 θ̂ (1,1) r ◦ θ̂ (1,2) r ◦ θ̂ (1,3) r ◦ ϕr , x̃ (1) ◦ x̃(2) ◦ x̃(3) ◦ e1 〉\n+ R∑ r=1 〈 θ̂ (2,3) r ◦ θ̂ (2,4) r ◦ ϕr , x̃ (3) ◦ x̃(4) ◦ e2 〉\n=ϕ1\n( 3∏\nm=1\n∗ ( x̃(m) T Θ̂ (1,m) ))T +ϕ2 ( 4∏\nm=3\n∗ ( x̃(m) T Θ̂ (2,m)\n))T\n=ϕ1\n( 3∏\nm=1\n∗ ( x(m) T Θ (m) + b(1,m) ))T +ϕ2 ( 4∏\nm=3\n∗ ( x(m) T Θ (m) + b(2,m)\n))T\n(7)\nwhere ∗ is the Hadamard (elementwise) product and ϕv ∈ R1×R is the v-th row of the factor matrix Φ.\nFor convenience, we let h(m) = Θ(m) T x(m), SM (v) denote the\nset of modes in thev-th views, π (v) = ∏ m∈SM (v) ∗ ( h(m) + b(v,m) T ) ,\nand π (v,−m) = ∏ m′∈SM (v),m′,m ∗ ( h(m ′) + b(v,m ′)T ) . It is worth noting that h(m) can be regarded as the latent representation of the feature x(m) in m-th mode, and π (v) can be regarded as the joint representation of all the modes in the v-th view, which can be easily computed through the Hadamard product. Moreover, the contribution of the latent factors in π (v) is automatically adjusted by the weight vectorϕv . An graphical illustration of the computational procedure in Eq. (7) is shown in Fig. 2.\ne predictive model for the general cases is given as follows\nf ({X̃(v)}) = V∑ v=1 〈 Ŵ(v), X̃(v) ◦ ev 〉\n= V∑ v=1 ϕv ∏\nm∈SM (v)\n∗ ( x(m) T Θ (m) + b(v,m) )T\n= V∑ v=1 ϕv ∏\nm∈SM (v)\n∗ ( h(m) + b(v,m) T )\n(8)\nWe name this model as structural factorization machines (SFMs). Clearly, the parameters are jointly factorized, which bene ts parameter estimation under sparsity since dependencies exist when\nthe interactions share the same features. erefore, the model parameters can be e ectively learned without direct observations of such interactions especially in highly sparse data. More importantly, a er factorizing the weight tensor Ŵs, there is no need to construct the input tensor physically. Furthermore, the model complexity is linear in the number of original features. In partic-\nular, the model complexity is O(R(V + I + ∑ v Mv )), where Mv is the number of modes in the v-th view."

Consider Fig. 3(a) as an example, where the parts highlighted in yellow in the forth mode (which represents the friends of the user) are repeatedly appear in the rst three columns.

      "text" : "e experimental results are shown in Table 3. e best method of each dataset is in bold. For clarity, on the right of the tables we show the percentage improvement of the proposed SFM method over a variety of methods. From these results, we can observe that SFM consistently outperforms all the comparison methods. We also make a few comparisons and summarize our ndings as follows.\n6h ps://github.com/kevin-luc/SFM\nCompared with MF, SFM performs be er with an average improvement of nearly 50%. MF usually performswell in practice [15, 22], while in datasets which are extremely sparse, as is shown in our case, MF is unable to learn an accurate representation of users/items. us MF under-performs other methods which takes the meta information into consideration.\nIn both FM and PolyNet methods, the feature vectors from all the modes are concatenated as a single input feature vector. e major di erence between these twomethods is the choice of kernel applied [2]. e polynomial kernel used in PolyNet considers all monomials (the products of features), i.e., all combinations of features with replacement. e ANOVA kernel used in FM considers only monomials composed of distinct features, i.e., feature combinations without replacement. Compared with the best results obtained from FM methods and from PolyNet methods, SFM leads to an average improvement of 3.3% and 2.4% in MSE, respectively.\ne primary reason behind the results is how the latent factors of each feature are learned. For any factorization based method, the latent factors of a feature are essentially learned from its interactions with other features observed in the data, as can be observed from its update rule. In FM and PolyNet, all the feature interactions are taken into consideration without distinguishing the features from di erent modes. As a result, important feature interactions (e.g., the interactions between the given user and her friend) would be easily buried in irrelevant feature interactions\nfrom the same modes (e.g., the interactions between the friends of the same user). Hence, the learned latent factors are less representative in FM and PolyNet, compared with the proposed SFM. Besides, we can nd that including higher-order interactions in FM and PolyNet (i.e., FM-3 and PolyNet-3) does not always improve the performance. Instead, it may even degrade the performance, as shown in Cloth, Yelp, and BX datasets. is is probably due to over ing, as they need to include more parameters to model the interactions in higher orders while the datasets are extremely sparse such that the parameters cannot be properly learned.\nCompared to the MVMmethod, which models the full-order interactions among all the modes, our proposed SFM leads to an average improvement of 5.87%. is is because not all the modes are relevant, and some irrelevant features interactions may introduce unexpected noise to the learning task. e irrelevant information can even be exaggerated a er combinations, thereby degrading performance. is suggests that preserving the nature of relational structure is important in building predictive models."

      "text" : "Next, we investigate the computational cost for comparison methods. e training time (seconds per epoch) required for each datasets are shown in Fig. 5. We can easily nd that the proposed SFM requires much less computational cost on all the datasets, especially for the Yelp dataset (roughly 11% of computational cost required for training FM-3). e e ciency comes from the use of relational structure representation. As shown in Table 2, the number of nonzeros of the feature matrix Nz (X) is much larger than the number of non-zeros of the relational structure representation Nz (B). e amount of repeating pa erns is much higher for the Yelp dataset than for the other dataset, because adding all the friends of a user signi cantly increases results in large repeating blocks in the plain feature matrix. Standard ML algorithms like the compared methods have typically at best a linear complexity inNz (X), while using the relational structure representation for SFM have a linear complexity in Nz (B). is experiment substantiates the e ciency of the proposed SFM for large datasets."

      "text" : "We proceed by further studying the impact of data sparsity on di erent methods. As can be found in the experimental results,\nthe improvement of SFM over the traditional collaborative ltering methods (e.g., MF) is signi cant for datasets that are sparse, mainly because the number of samples is too scarce to model the items and users adequately. We verify this nding by comparing the performance of comparison methods with MF on users with limited training data. Shown in Fig. 6 is the gain of each method compared with MF for users with limited training samples, where G1, G2, and G3 are groups of users with [1, 3], [4, 6], and [7, 10] observed samples in the training set. Due to space limit, we only report the results from two Amazon datasets (Sport and Health) while the observations still hold for the rest datasets. It can be seen that the proposed SFM gains the most in group G1, in which the users have extremely few training items. e performance gain starts to decrease with the number of training items available for each user. e results indicate that including meta information can be valuable information especially when limited information available."

We analyze di erent values of R and report the results in Fig. 7. e results again demo that SFM consistently outperforms other methods with a various values of R. In contrast to ndings in other related models based on latent factors [26]where prediction error can steadily get reducedwith larger R, we observe that the performance of each method is rather stable even with the increasing of R. It is reasonable in a general sense, as the expressiveness of the model is enough to describe the information embedded in data. Although larger R renders the model with greater expressiveness, when the available observations regarding the target values are too sparse but the meta information is rich, only a few number of factors is required to t the data well."

We develop structural factorization machines (SFMs) that learn the common latent spaces shared in the multi-view tensors while automatically adjust the contribution of each view in the predictive model. With the help of relational structure representation, we further provide an e cient approach to avoid unnecessary computation costs on repeating pa erns of the multi-view data. It was shown that the proposed SFMs outperform state-of-the-art factorization models on eight large-scale datasets in terms of prediction accuracy and computational cost."

    "abstractText" : "Real-world relations among entities can oen be observed and determined by dierent perspectives/views. For example, the decision made by a user on whether to adopt an item relies on multiple aspects such as the contextual information of the decision, the item’s aributes, the user’s prole and the reviews given by other users. Dierent views may exhibit multi-way interactions among entities and provide complementary information. In this paper, we introduce a multi-tensor-based approach that can preserve the underlying structure of multi-view data in a generic predictive model. Specically, we propose structural factorization machines (SFMs) that learn the common latent spaces shared by multi-view tensors and automatically adjust the importance of each view in the predictive model. Furthermore, the complexity of SFMs is linear in the number of parameters, which make SFMs suitable to large-scale problems. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed SFMs outperform several state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy and computational cost.",
