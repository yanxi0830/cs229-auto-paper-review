Generative models such as deep recurrent networks for the language modeling, in conjunction with deep convolutional neural networks on the image side have shown remarkable success in the image captioning task Karpathy & Li (2015); Mao et al. (2014); Vinyals et al. (2015); Socher et al. (2011). Image and Text retrieval has been the focus of many recent works. Fang et al. (2015); Klein et al. (2015); Lebret et al. (2015); Kiros et al.

Given an image and sentence embeddings the goal is to design a multimodal representation that captures the correlation between the two modalities, and allows for bidirectional search in a joint embedding space. In this paper we address the bidirectional retrieval problem and show that an asymmetric task dependent embedding of the images and sentences yields better performance on both retrieval tasks. Key to our representation is the careful analysis and usage of Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) in bidirectional retrieval, and the development of an efficient model selection for the regularized CCA embedding. We report our retrieval results on the COCO benchmark Lin et al. (2014)."

Asymmetric and task dependent Correlation Weighting for CCA: We cast the bidirectional retrieval problem as a least squares problem and motivate the retrieval in the CCA weighted space. We theoretically and experimentally show that asymmetrically weighting the canonical weights with the canonical correlations in a task dependent way, solves each task optimally in the least squares sense (See Table 1). This improves the performance of each task and achieves state of the art on the COCO benchmark with off the shelf unsupervised features.\n2. Efficient Tikhonov/Truncated SVD Regularization Path for CCA : While CCA is an old and widely studied problem that has been used as a multimodal data representation in many machine learning applications, we found that a computationally efficient cross-validation for regularized CCA has been less studied. Model selection is not only important to the numerical stability of CCA it also improves the generalization ability of this simple yet powerful multimodal representation. To this end we present two regularization algorithms for the batch CCA problem based on the Bjork Golub Algorithm Golub et al. (1973) (Algorithm 1), that make the computation of the full regularization path for CCA efficient. We present our cross validation algorithms within two regularization frameworks: Tikhonov Regularization (Algorithm 2) and truncated SVD regularization (Algorithm 3) . While Tikhonov regularization is more popular for regularized CCAVinod (1976), we also derive the regularization path for CCA using truncated SVD covariances. Truncated SVD is a popular regularizer for least squares regression problems Hansen (1986), but to our knowledge has not been utilized before in the CCA Context. We show that the truncated SVD CCA regularization path can be computed more efficiently and competes favorably with Tikhonov regularization.\nNotation. Given a multimodal training set S = {(xi, yi)|xi ∈ X ⊂ Rmx , yi ∈ Y ⊂ Rmy , i = 1 . . . n}, (n > max(mx,my)), let X ∈ Rn×mx , and Y ∈ Rn×my be the two data matrices corresponding to each modality. Define µX , µY to be the means of X and Y respectively. Let CXX = (X − µX) ⊤ (X − µX) ∈ R mx×mx , and CY Y = (Y − µY ) ⊤ (Y − µY ) ∈ R\nmy×my be the covariances matrices of X and Y respectively. Let CXY = (X − µX) ⊤ (Y − µY ) ∈ R mx×my be the correlation matrix. Define Ik to be the identity matrix in k dimensions. SVD stands for the thin singular value decomposition. A validation set Sv is given for model selection. Our goal is to index a test set S∗ = {(x∗i , y ∗ i )|x ∗ i ∈ S ∗ x ⊂ X , y ∗ i ∈ S ∗ y ⊂ Y, i = 1 . . . n\n∗} for bidirectional search. X and Y are assumed to be centered."

Given pairs of high dimensional points (xi, yi) ∈ X × Y where xi corresponds to the feature representation of an image given by a deep convolutional neural network, and yi a sentence embedding of an associated caption. Our goal is to index this multimodal data in a way that enables bidirectional retrieval. Enabling the image annotation task which consists of retrieving for an image query x ∈ X the associated caption in the set Y . Whereas the image search task consists of retrieving for a caption query y ∈ Y the associated image x ∈ X .\nIn this Section we cast the retrieval tasks as a simple least squares problem. In order to reduce the variance of our estimators we put ourselves in the whitened space of the data in X , and Y , i.e we consider the bidirectional mapping between the whitened data spaces. Assuming for the moment\nthat both covariances are non singular, we can write the whitened data as XC −\n1 2\nXX , and Y C −\n1 2\nY Y . We will show later how Tikhonov/Truncated SVD regularization alleviates this issue of non singular covariances. Hence for the image search task we can minimize the following problem:\nmin T∈Rmx×my\n∥ ∥ ∥ XC − 1 2\nXXT − Y C −\n1 2 Y Y\n∥ ∥ ∥\n2 F , (1)\nThis defines a linear transform which maps the image set to the query caption. We follow this general principle of mapping the space of the search to the space of the query rather than the converse as found in Socher et al. (2013). The solution of Problem (1) is given simply by T = C − 1 2 ,⊤\nXX CXY C − 1 2\nY Y , hence for a query test sentence y∗ we can find its corresponding image by finding :\nargmin x∗∈S∗x\n∥ ∥ ∥ C − 1 2 ,⊤\nY Y y ∗ − T⊤C\n− 1\n2 ,⊤\nXX x ∗\n∥ ∥ ∥\n2\n, (2)\nWe define the image to caption mapping as follows:\nfi→c(x ∗) = T⊤C\n− 1\n2 ,⊤\nXX x ∗.

We define the caption to image mapping:\nfc→i(y ∗) = TC\n− 1 2 ,⊤ Y Y y ∗, (4)\ntherefore the image annotation problem reduces to transforming the caption set via the mapping fc→i, and then finding the nearest neighbor of the query image represented by the whitened vector C − 1 2 ,⊤\nXX x ∗ in the transformed caption set:\nargmin y∗∈S∗y\n∥ ∥ ∥ C − 1 2 ,⊤\nXX x ∗ − TC\n− 1\n2 ,⊤\nY Y y ∗\n∥ ∥ ∥\n2\n.

Intuitively CCA finds the directions that are maximally correlated and that are orthonormal in the metric defined by each covariance matrix, respectively. The following Lemma due to Bjork and Golub shows that the canonical correlation weights can be computed using the singular value decomposition of the data matrices X and Y , and the correlation matrix in the whitened space T defined in Section 1.3:\nLemma 1 (Golub et al.

(2014) in exposing the algorithm fully with SVD. Note that both U and V correspond to a whitening step followed by a projection to a common space of dimension k. The total computational complexity of this algorithm assuming my < mx is O(nm2x+nm 2 y+mxm 2 y).

Turning back to the image to caption mapping given in equation (7), using the expressions of the whitened data points in Equation (6) and the SVD of T given in Equation (11), we obtain:\nfi→c(x ∗) = T⊤u∗x = PyΣP ⊤ x Σ −1 x V ⊤ x x ∗ = PyΣU ⊤x∗,\nwhere U is the canonical weight for X and Σ the canonical correlation matrix.

On the other hand: P⊤y uy∗ = P⊤y Σ −1 y V ⊤ y y ∗ = V ⊤y∗ ∈ Rk, where V is the canonical correlation weight for Y .\nFor the image search problem, we can therefore perform the nearest neighbor search given in equation (8), in the k-dimensional reduced space defined by\n(P⊤y fi→c(x ∗), P⊤y uy∗) = (ΣU ⊤x∗, V ⊤y∗).\nIt follows that the image search problem can be written using the canonical weights U, V and the canonical correlation Σ. Note that the correlation matrix is weighting the canonical weight in an asymmetric way. Cosine similarities are usually used for retrieval with CCA, hence we use cosine similarity between the two embeddings. The image search problem reduces to finding for a query caption y∗, the image x∗ solving:\nargmax x∗∈S∗x\n〈 ΣU⊤x∗, V ⊤y∗ 〉\n‖ΣU⊤x∗‖ ‖V ⊤y∗‖ . (12)\nSimilarly the caption to image mapping can be expressed for a caption y∗ as: fc→i(y∗) = PxΣV ⊤y∗, and we can perform the search in the k-dimensional column space of Px:\n(P⊤x ux∗ , P ⊤ x fc→i(y ∗)) = (U⊤x∗,ΣV ⊤y∗).\nUsing a cosine similarity the image annotation problem reduces to finding for a query image x∗, the caption y∗ solving:\nargmax y∗∈S∗y\n〈 U⊤x∗,ΣV ⊤y∗ 〉\n‖U⊤x∗‖ ‖ΣV ⊤y∗‖ . (13)\nNote that using the canonical weights and correlations in the image search and annotation given in Equations (12) and (13), the search is done in a space of dimension k = min(mx,my), rather than a space of dimensions mx for image search as in Equation (8) and my for image annotation as in Equation (10). This results in a much more efficient search than the least squares formulation. Note that Σ appears in an asymmetric way in the embedding of the points depending on the task. Hence we call our method asymmetrically weighted CCA. Asymmetrically weighted CCA (Table 1) performs approximately1 the optimal nearest neighbor search in the least square sense for each task."

      "text" : "While CCA is a powerful statistical tool less attention has been brought to the efficient computation of the full regularization path of CCA in a learning context where we need to do model selection on a validation set. For now we have assumed that the covariances CXX and CY Y are non-singular, and we presented an SVD version of the Bjork Golub Algorithm in this context. Regularizing CCA does not only allow for numerical stability in the non singular case, efficient model selection on a validation set allows for better generalization properties and avoids overfitting. Tikhonov regularization is the most common regularization used in CCA and consists in replacing the covariances by CXX + γxImx and CY Y + γyImy , where γx, γy > 0 are the regularization parameters subject to cross-validation. We specialize the Bjork Golub algorithm in Section 3.1 for handling efficiently a grid of parameters γx, γy . One main contribution of this paper is in introducing the truncated SVD regularization to the covariances in the CCA problem. We emphasize that our truncation is applied to the SVD of the data matrices X and Y , not the SVD of the whitened correlation matrix T in the Bjork Golub Algorithm. Truncating the SVD of T and choosing an embedding dimension k < min(mx,my) is sometimes referred as the truncated SVD CCA, hence our clarification. We replace the covariance CXX by its best kx-rank approximation given by the SVD of X , and CY Y by its best ky-rank approximation given by the SVD of Y , where kx, ky ∈ N, kx ≤ mx, and ky ≤ my . In this framework kx ky are the regularization parameters and are subject to cross-validation.

Klein et al. (2015), and Gong et al. (2014) used CCA to build a joint representation using the cosine similarity. In both works a symmetric weighting of the CCA canonical weights was used, i.e for an image caption pair (x∗, y∗), a joint embedding of the form (ΣαU⊤x∗,ΣαV ⊤y∗), was used, where α = 0, in Klein et al.

Indeed our experimental results show that asymmetric weighting gives higher performance and makes the image search and the image annotation on par in term of performance. A discussion of the optimality of the asymmetric weighting and an empirical study is given in Appendix C. Skip thought vectors introduced in Kiros et al. (2015) for representing sentences were used for bidirectional search in conjunction with VGG features Simonyan & Zisserman (2015) on the image side, with linear embeddings learned with a discriminative triplets loss, instead of a CCA loss. A similar discriminative loss was used for building a joint image and text representation in Lebret et al. (2015). One advantage of CCA over the discriminative losses is that the batch solution can be found efficiently and does not need stochastic optimization, as well as the efficient model selection introduced in this paper providing a means to select the dimension of the joint embedding leading to better generalization properties."

We report for both tasks the recall rate at one result, five results, or ten first results (r@1,5,10), as well as the median rank of the first ground truth retrieval. Cross validation was performed using the Asymetrically Weighted Truncated SVD CCA (AWT-CCA) Algorithm 3 to select the model corresponding to the minimum median rank (regularization paths are given in Appendix D).\nFor feature extraction we follow Klein et al.

The mean intensity of each crop is subtracted in each color channel, and then encoded by VGG19 (the final FC -4096 layer). The average of the resulting 10 feature vectors corresponding to each crop is used as the image representation. On the text side, we use two sentence embeddings: the first one proposed by Klein et al. (2015) consisting in averaging the word2vec Mikolov et al. (2013) representation of words in each sentence. Word2vec representations are available on code.google.com/p/word2vec/, we followed the recommendation of Klein et al.

The second embedding we used are skip thought vectors introduced in Kiros et al. (2015), which encodes sentences to vectors using an LSTM. Image and text features were centered before learning CCA.\nWe see in Table 2 that using off the shelf unsupervised features (VGG, word2vec, skip thoughts vectors), AWT-CCA achieves state of the art results at both image search and annotation, and competes with supervised features extraction such as GMM+HGLMM of Klein et al.

While the exposition of this paper was on image and caption retrieval, our methods are generic and can be applied to any multimodal setting. We solved in this paper CCA in its batch formulation, for handling larger scale datasets we can use the randomized SVD of Halko et al. (2011) or the subsampled CCA of Avron et al. (2014). Stochastic Gradient Descent CCA Ma et al. (2015); Wang et al. (2015), SGDCCA (Linear and Deep CCA) was proposed recently and can be applied to our problem. It would be interesting to study an efficient model selection for the SGD-CCA such as early stopping and truncated SVD for a finer model selection. A simple extension to kernel CCA regularization of this present paper would be to leverage random Fourier features for approximating Kernel CCA Lopez-Paz et al. (2014). Truncated SVD-CCA would be particularly interesting in this setting since kx, ky would be balancing the regularization and the estimation error of the kernel by means of random features.\n2Note that the 1K results on Mean Vec (ICA +CCA) of Klein et al. (2015) and the skip thought of Kiros et al. (2015) are not comparable to ours since they are reported on only 1K test set, we report the mean of 25 splits 1K test sets."

The proof of this Lemma is elementary we give it here for completion.\n[Ux,Σx, Vx] = SVD(X) Ux ∈ R n×mx ,Σx ∈ R mx×mx , Vx ∈ R mx×mx X = UxΣxV ⊤ x .\n[Uy,Σy, Vy] = SVD(Y ) Uy ∈ R n×my ,Σx ∈ R my×my , Vx ∈ R my×my Y = UyΣyV ⊤ y .\nX⊤X + γxI = Vx ( Σ2x + γxI ) V ⊤x . Y ⊤Y + γyI = Vy ( Σ2y + γyI ) V ⊤y .\nLet Px = √ Σ2x + γxIV ⊤ x U ∈ R mx×k equivalently U = Vx ( Σ2x + γxI )−\n1\n2 Px. Let Py = √\nΣ2y + γyIV ⊤ y V ∈ R my×k equivalently V = Vy ( Σ2y + γyI )− 1 2 Py . Hence we obtain by this\nchange of variable:\nU⊤X⊤Y V = P⊤x ( Σ2x + γxI )−\n1 2 V ⊤x VxΣxU ⊤ x UyΣyV ⊤ y Vy ( Σ2y + γyI )− 1 2 Py\n= P⊤x ( Σ2x + γxI )− 1 2 Σx ( U⊤x Uy ) Σy ( Σ2y + γyI )− 1 2 Py.\nLet T = (\nΣ2x + γxI )−\n1 2 Σx ( U⊤x Uy ) Σy ( Σ2y + γyI )− 1 2 .\nHence we obtain that: [Px,Σ, Py] = SVD(T ).\nProof of Lemma 3. Let\nPkx = ΣkxV ⊤ kx U ∈ Rkx×k, equivalently U = VkxΣ −1 kx Pkx ∈ R mx×k, k = min(kx, ky)\nPky = ΣkyV ⊤ ky V ∈ Rky×k, equivalently V = VkyΣ −1 ky Pky ∈ R my×k, k = min(kx, ky)\nHence we obtain by this change of variable:\nU⊤X⊤Y V = P⊤kxΣ −1 kx V ⊤kxVxΣxU ⊤ x UyΣyV ⊤ y VKyΣ −1 ky Pky ,\nNow we turn to:\nΣ−1kx (V ⊤ kx Vx)ΣxU ⊤ x = Σ −1 kx [Ikx×kx0kx×(mx−kx)]ΣxU ⊤ x\n= Σ−1kx [Σkx0kx×(mx−kx)]U ⊤ x\n= [Ikx×kx0kx×(mx−kx)]U ⊤ x\n= U⊤kx\nHence we keep the first kx columns of Ux, that is Ukx . The same argument hold for Uky . It follows that using truncated SVD, we have:\nU⊤X⊤Y V = P⊤kxU ⊤ kx UkyPky .\nHence truncated SVD-CCA can be solved finding:\n[Pkx ,Σ kx,ky , Pky ] = SV D(U ⊤ kx Uky ).\nTurning now to U⊤kxUky this can be computed efficiently by precomputing T = U ⊤ x Uy ∈ R mx×my and then extracting the submatrix consisting of kx rows and ky columns. we return therefore U = VkxΣ −1 kx Pkx , V = VkyΣ −1 ky Pky ."

A multimodal data representation allowing for bidirectional retrieval of images by sentences and vice versa is a key aspect of this modeling. In this paper we show that canonical correlation analysis (CCA) can be adapted to bidirectional retrieval by a simple task dependent asymmetric weighting, which solves optimally the retrieval problem in a least squares sense. While regularizing CCA is known to improve numerical stability as well as generalization performance, less attention has been brought to the efficient computation of the regularization path of CCA, which is key to model selection. In this paper we develop efficient algorithms to compute the full regularization path of CCA within the classical Tikhonov and the truncated SVD (T-SVD CCA) regularization frameworks. T-SVD CCA is new to the best of our knowledge, and its regularization path can be computed more efficiently than its Tikhonov counterpart.",
