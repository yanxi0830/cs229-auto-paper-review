      "text" : "Random utility theory models an agent’s preferences on alternatives by drawing a real-valued score on each alternative (typically independently) from a parameterized distribution, and then ranking the alternatives according to scores. A special case that has received significant attention is the Plackett-Luce model, for which fast inference methods for maximum likelihood estimators are available. This paper develops conditions on general random utility models that enable fast inference within a Bayesian framework through MC-EM, providing concave loglikelihood functions and bounded sets of global maxima solutions. Results on both real-world and simulated data provide support for the scalability of the approach and capability for model selection among general random utility models including Plackett-Luce."

      "text" : "Problems of learning with rank-based error metrics [16] and the adoption of learning for the purpose of rank aggregation in social choice [7, 8, 23, 25, 29, 30] are gaining in prominence in recent years. In part, this is due to the explosion of socio-economic platforms, where opinions of users need to be aggregated; e.g., judges in crowd-sourcing contests, ranking of movies or user-generated content.\nIn the problem of social choice, users submit ordinal preferences consisting of partial or total ranks on the alternatives and a single rank order must be selected to be representative of the reports. Since Condorcet [6], one approach to this problem is to formulate social choice as the problem of estimating a true underlying world state (e.g., a true quality ranking of alternatives), where the individual reports are viewed as noisy data in regard to the true state. In this way, social choice can be framed as a problem of inference.\nIn particular, Condorcet assumed the existence of a true ranking over alternatives, with a voter’s preference between any pair of alternatives a, b generated to agree with the true ranking with probability p > 1/2 and disagree otherwise. Condorcet proposed to choose as the outcome of social choice the ranking that maximizes the likelihood of observing the voters’ preferences. Later, Kemeny’s rule was shown to provide the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for this model [32].\nBut Condorcet’s probabilistic model assumes identical and independent distributions on pairwise comparisons. This ignores the strength in agents’ preferences (the same probability p is adopted for all pairwise comparisons), and allows for cyclic preferences. In addition, computing the winner through the Kemeny rule is ΘP2 -complete [13].\nTo overcome the first criticism, a more recent literature adopts the random utility model (RUM) from economics [26]. Consider C = {c1, .., cm} alternatives. In RUM, there is a ground truth utility (or score) associated with each alternative. These are real-valued parameters, denoted by ~θ = (θ1, . . . , θm). Given this, an agent independently samples a random utility (Xj) for each alternative cj with conditional distribution µj(·|θj).\nar X\niv :1\n21 1.\n24 76\nv1 [\ncs .M\nA ]\n1 1\nN ov\n2 01\nUsually θj is the mean of µj(·|θj).1 Let π denote a permutation of {1, . . . ,m}, which naturally corresponds to a linear order: [cπ(1) cπ(2) · · · cπ(m)]. Slightly abusing notation, we also use π to denote this linear order. Random utility (X1, . . . , Xm) generates a distribution on preference orders, as\nPr(π | ~θ) = Pr(Xπ(1) > Xπ(2) > . . . > Xπ(m)) (1)\nThe generative process is illustrated in Figure 1.\nAdopting RUMs rules out cyclic preferences, because each agent’s outcome corresponds to an order on real numbers, and it also captures the strength of preference, and thus overcomes the second criticism, by assigning a different parameter (θj) to each alternative.\nA popular RUM is Plackett-Luce (P-L) [18, 21], where the random utility terms are generated according to Gumbel distributions with fixed shape parameter [2,31]. For P-L, the likelihood function has a simple analytical solution, making MLE inference tractable. P-L has been extensively applied in econometrics [1, 19], and more recently in machine learning and information retrieval (see [16] for an overview). Efficient methods of EM inference [5, 14], and more recently expectation propagation [12], have been developed for P-L and its variants.\nIn application to social choice, the P-L model has been used to analyze political elections [10]. EM algorithm has also been used to learn the Mallows model, which is closely related to the Condorcet’s probabilistic model [17].\nAlthough P-L overcomes the two difficulties of the Condorcet-Kemeny approach, it is still quite restricted, by assuming that the random utility terms are distributed as Gumbel, with each alternative is characterized by one parameter, which is the mean of its corresponding distribution. In fact, little is known about inference in RUMs beyond P-L. Specifically, we are not aware of either an analytical solution or an efficient algorithm for MLE inference for one of the most natural models proposed by Thurstone [26], where each Xj is normally distributed."

      "text" : "In this paper we focus on RUMs in which the random utilities are independently generated with respect to distributions in the exponential family (EF) [20]. This extends the P-L model, since the Gumbel distribution with fixed shape parameters belonging to the EF. Our main theoretical contributions are Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, which propose conditions such that the log-likelihood function is concave and the set of global maxima solutions is bounded for the location family, which are RUMs where the shape of each distribution µj is fixed and the only latent variables are the locations, i.e., the means of µj’s. These results hold for existing special cases, such as the P-L model, and many other RUMs, for example the ones where each µj is chosen from Normal, Gumbel, Laplace and Cauchy.\n1µj(·|θj) might be parameterized by other parameters, for example variance.\nWe also propose a novel application of MC-EM. We treat the random utilities ( ~X) as latent variables, and adopt the Expectation Maximization (EM) method to estimate parameters ~θ. The E-step for this problem is not analytically tractable, and for this we adopt a Monte Carlo approximation. We establish through experiments that the Monte-Carlo error in the E-step is controllable and does not affect inference, as long as numerical parameterizations are chosen carefully. In addition, for the Estep we suggest a parallelization over the agents and alternatives and a Rao-Blackwellized method, which further increases the scalability of our method.\nWe generally assume that the data provides total orders on alternatives from voters, but comment on how to extend the method and theory to the case where the input preferences are partial orders.\nWe evaluate our approach on synthetic data as well as two real-world datasets, a public election dataset and one involving rank preferences on sushi. The experimental results suggest that the approach is scalable despite providing significantly improved modeling flexibility over existing approaches.\nFor the two real-world datasets we have studied, we compare RUMs with normal distributions and P-L in terms of four criteria: log-likelihood, predictive log-likelihood, Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). We observe that when the amount of data is not too small, RUMs with normal distributions fit better than P-L. Specifically, for the log-likelihood, predictive log-likelihood, and AIC criteria, RUMs with normal distributions outperform P-L with 95% confidence in both datasets."

      "text" : "In social choice, each agent i ∈ {1, . . . , n} has a strict preference order on alternatives. This provides the data for an inferential approach to social choice. In particular. let L(C) denote the set of all linear orders on C. Then, a preference-profile, D, is a set of n preference orders, one from each agent, so that D ∈ L(C)n. A voting rule r is a mapping that assigns to each preference-profile a set of winning rankings, r : L(C)n 7→ (2L(C) \\ ∅). In particular, in the case of ties the set of winning rankings may include more than a singleton ranking. In the maximum likelihood (MLE) approach to social choice, the preference profile is viewed as data, D = {π1, . . . , πn}.\nGiven this, the probability (likelihood) of the data given ground truth ~θ (and for a particular ~µ) is Pr(D | ~θ) = ∏n i=1 Pr(π i | ~θ), where,\nP (π|~θ)= ∫ ∞ xπ(n)=−∞ ∫ ∞ xπ(n−1)=xπ(n) .. ∫ ∞ xπ(1)=xπ(2) µπ(n)(xπ(n))..µπ(1)(xπ(1))dxπ(1)dxπ(2)..dxπ(n) (2)\nThe MLE approach to social choice selects as the winning ranking that which corresponds to the ~θ that maximizes Pr(D | ~θ). In the case of multiple parameters that maximize the likelihood then the MLE approach returns a set of rankings, one ranking corresponding to each parameterization.\nIn this paper, we focus on probabilistic models where each µj belongs to the exponential family (EF). The density function for each µ in EF has the following format:\nPr(X = x) = µ(x) = eη(θ)T (x)−A(θ)+B(x), (3)\nwhere η(·) and A(·) are functions of θ, B(·) is a function of x, and T (x) denotes the sufficient statistics for x, which could be multidimensional. Example 1 (Plackett-Luce as an RUM [2]) In the RUM, let µj’s be Gumbel distributions. That is, for alternative j ∈ {1, . . . ,m} we have µj(xj |θj) = e−(xj−θj)e−e\n−(xj−θj) . Then, we have: Pr(π | ~λ) = Pr(xπ(1) > xπ(2) > .. > xπ(m)) = ∏m j=1 λπ(j)∑m j′=j λπ(j′) , where η(θj) = λj = eθj , T (xj) = −e−xj , B(xj) = −xj and A(θj) = −θj .This gives us the Plackett-Luce model."

      "text" : "In this section, we provide a condition on distributions that guarantees that the likelihood function (2) is log-concave in parameters ~θ. We also provide a condition under which the set of MLE solutions\nis bounded when any one latent parameter is fixed. Together, this guarantees the convergence of our MC-EM approach to a global mode with an accurate enough E-step. We focus on the location family, which is a subset of RUMs where the shapes of all µj’s are fixed, and the only parameters are the means of the distributions. For the location family, we can writeXj = θj+ζj , whereXj ∼ µj(·|θj) and ζj = Xj − θj is a random variable whose mean is 0 and models an agent’s subjective noise. The random variables ζj’s do not need to be identically distributed for all alternatives j; e.g., they can be normal with different fixed variances.\nWe focus on computing solutions (~θ) to maximize the log-likelihood function,\nl(~θ;D) = n∑ i=1 log Pr(πi | ~θ) (4)\nTheorem 1 For the location family, if for every j ≤ m the probability density function for ζj is log-concave, then l(~θ;D) is concave.\nProof sketch: The theorem is proved by applying the following lemma, which is Theorem 9 in [22].\nLemma 1 Suppose g1(~θ, ~ζ), ..., gR(~θ, ~ζ) are concave functions in R2m where ~θ is the vector of m parameters and ~ζ is a vector ofm real numbers that are generated according to a distribution whose pdf is logarithmic concave in Rm. Then the following function is log-concave in Rm.\nLi(~θ,G) = Pr(g1(~θ, ~ζ) ≥ 0, ..., gR(~θ, ~ζ) ≥ 0), ~θ ∈ Rm (5)\nTo apply Lemma 1, we define a setGi of function gi’s that is equivalent to an order πi in the sense of inequalities implied by RUM for πi and Gi (the joint probability in (5) for Gi to be the same as the probity of πi in RUM with parameters ~θ). Suppose gir(~θ, ~ζ) = θπi(r) + ζ i πi(r)− θπi(r+1)− ζ i πi(r+1) for r = 1, ..,m− 1. Then considering that the length of order πi is R+ 1, we have:\nLi(~θ, π i) = Li(~θ,G i) = Pr(gi1( ~θ, ~ζ) ≥ 0, ..., giR(~θ, ~ζ) ≥ 0), ~θ ∈ Rm (6)\nThis is because gir(~θ, ~ζ) ≥ 0 is equivalent to that in πi alternative πi(r) is preferred to alternative πi(r + 1) in the RUM sense.\nTo see how this extends to the case where preferences are specified as partial orders, we consider in particular an interpretation where an agent’s report for the ranking of mi alternatives implies that all other alternatives are worse for the agent, in some undefined order. Given this, define gir(~θ, ~ζ) = θπi(r) + ζ i πi(r) − θπi(r+1) − ζ i πi(r+1) for r = 1, ..,mi − 1 and g i r( ~θ, ~ζ) = θπi(mi) + ζ i πi(mi)\n− θπi(r+1) − ζiπi(r+1) for r = mi, ..,m − 1. Considering that g i r(·)s are linear (hence, concave) and using log concavity of the distributions of ~ζi = (ζi1, ζ i 2, .., ζ i m)’s, we can apply Lemma 1 and prove log-concavity of the likelihood function.\nIt is not hard to verify that pdfs for normal and Gumbel are log-concave under reasonable conditions for their parameters, made explicit in the following corollary. Corollary 1 For the location family where each ζj is a normal distribution with mean zero and with fixed variance, or Gumbel distribution with mean zeros and fixed shape parameter, l(~θ;D) is concave. Specifically, the log-likelihood function for P-L is concave.\nThe concavity of log-likelihood of P-L has been proved [9] using a different technique. Using Fact 3.5. in [24], the set of global maxima solutions to the likelihood function, denoted by SD, is convex since the likelihood function is log-concave. However, we also need that SD is bounded, and would further like that it provides one unique order as the estimation for the ground truth.\nFor P-L, Ford, Jr. [9] proposed the following necessary and sufficient condition for the set of global maxima solutions to be bounded (more precisely, unique) when ∑m j=1 e θj = 1.\nCondition 1 Given the data D, in every partition of the alternatives C into two nonempty subsets C1 ∪C2, there exists c1 ∈ C1 and c2 ∈ C2 such that there is at least one ranking in D where c1 c2.\nWe next show that Condition 1 is also a necessary and sufficient condition for the set of global maxima solutions SD to be bounded in location families, when we set one of the values θj to be 0 (w.l.o.g., let θ1 = 0). If we do not bound any parameter, then SD is unbounded, because for any ~θ, any D, and any number s ∈ R, l(~θ;D) = l(~θ + s;D). Theorem 2 Suppose we fix θ1 = 0. Then, the set SD of global maxima solutions to l(θ;D) is bounded if and only if the data D satisfies Condition 1. Proof sketch:\nIf Condition 1 does not hold, then SD is unbounded because the parameters for all alternatives in C1 can be increased simultaneously to improve the log-likelihood. For sufficiency, we first present the following lemma. Lemma 2 If alternative j is preferred to alternative j′ in at least in one ranking then the difference of their mean parameters θj′ − θj is bounded from above (∃Q where θj′ − θj < Q) for all the ~θ that maximize the likelihood function. Proof: Suppose that j j′ in rank i, then for any ~θ ∈ Rm:\nLi(~θ, π i) = Li(~θ,G i) = Pr(g1(~θ, ~ζ) ≥ 0, ..., gR(~θ, ~ζ) ≥ 0)\n≤Pr(gπi(r)(~θ, ~ζ) ≥ 0, gπi(r+1)(~θ, ~ζ) ≥ 0, . . . , gπi(r′)(~θ, ~ζ) ≥ 0) ≤ Pr(ζj − ζj′ ≥ θj′ − θj), (7) where j = πi(r) and j′ = πi(r′).\nLet K = l(~0;D). Since the log-likelihood is always smaller than 0, it follows that for any ~θ ∈ SD and any i ≤ n, Li(~θ;πi) ≥ K. Hence, Pr(ζj − ζj′ ≥ θj′ − θj) ≥ K. Therefore, there exists K ′ such that θj′ − θj < K ′, where K ′ depends on the fixed ζj′ and ζj . Now consider a directed graph GD, where the nodes are the alternatives, and there is an edge between cj to cj′ if in at least one ranking cj cj′ . By Condition 1, for any pair j 6= j′, there is a path from cj to cj′ (and conversely, a path from cj′ to cj). To see this, consider building a path between j and j′ by starting from a partition with C1 = {j} and following an edge from j to j1 in the graph where j1 is an alternatives in C2 for which there must be such an edge, by Condition 1. Consider the partition with C1 = {j, j1}, and repeat until an edge can be followed to vertex j′ ∈ C2. It follows from Lemma 2 that for any ~θ ∈ SD we have |θj − θj′ | < Qm, using the telescopic sum of bounded values of the difference of mean parameters along the edges of the path, since the length of the path is no more than m (and tracing the path from j to j′ and j′ to j), meaning that SD is bounded.\nNow that we have the log concavity and bounded property, we need to declare conditions under which the bounded convex space of estimated parameters corresponds to a unique order. The next theorem provides a necessary and sufficient condition for all global maxima to correspond to the same order on alternatives. Suppose that we order the alternatives based on estimated θ’s (meaning that cj is ranked higher than cj′ iff θj > θj′ ).\nTheorem 3 The order over parameters is strict and is the same across all ~θ ∈ SD if, for all ~θ ∈ SD and all alternatives j 6= j′, θj 6= θj′ . Proof: Suppose for the sake of contradiction there exist two maxima, ~θ, ~θ∗ ∈ SD and a pair of alternatives j 6= j′ such that θj > θj′ and θ∗j′ > θ∗j . Then, there exists an α < 1 such that the jth and j′th components of α~θ + (1− α)~θ∗ are equal, which contradicts the assumption.\nHence, if there is never a tie in the scores in any ~θ ∈ SD, then any vector in SD will reveal the unique order."

In order to control the error of approximation in the MC-E step we can increase the number of samples with the iterations [28]. However, in our application, we are not concerned with the exact estimation of ~θ, as we are only interested in their orders relative to each-other. Therefore, as long as the approximation error remains relatively small, such that the differences of θjs are much larger than the error, we are safe to stop.\nA known problem with Gibbs sampling is that it can introduce correlation among samples. To address this, we sub-sample the samples to reduce the correlation, and call the ratio of sub-sampling the thinning factor (0 < F ≤ 1).

When we let the variances to be part of parametrization we lose the theoretical guarantees. However, the EM algorithm can still be applied, and since the variances are now parameters (rather than being fixed to 1), the model fits better in terms of log-likelihood.\nFor this reason, we adopt RUMs with normal distributions in which the variance is a parameter that is fit by EM along with the mean. We call this model a normal model. We compute the difference between the normal model and P-L in terms of four criteria: log-likelihood (LL), predictive loglikelihood (predictive LL), AIC, and BIC. For (predictive) log-likelihood, a positive value means that normal model fits better than P-L, whereas for AIC and BIC, a negative number means that normal model fits better than P-L. Predictive likelihood is different from likelihood in the sense that we compute the likelihood of the estimated parameters for a part of the data that is not used for parameter estimation.3 In particular, we compute predictive likelihood for a randomly chosen subset of 100 votes. The results and standard deviations for n = 10, 50 are summarized in Table 1.\nWhen n is small (n = 10), the variance is high and we are unable to obtain statistically significant results in comparing fitness.

A special case that has received significant attention is the Plackett-Luce model, for which fast inference methods for maximum likelihood estimators are available. This paper develops conditions on general random utility models that enable fast inference within a Bayesian framework through MC-EM, providing concave loglikelihood functions and bounded sets of global maxima solutions. Results on both real-world and simulated data provide support for the scalability of the approach and capability for model selection among general random utility models including Plackett-Luce.",
