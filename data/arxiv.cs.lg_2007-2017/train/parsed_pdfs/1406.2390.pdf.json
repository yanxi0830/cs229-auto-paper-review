      "text" : "The curse of high-dimensional learning results from the huge space volume. A uniform sampling requires a number of examples which increases exponentially with the dimension. Scattering transforms reduce the space volume by iteratively applying contractive operators, with a deep convolution network architecture [2, 5]. These contractions compute invariants and progressively decrease the space dimension to circumvent the curse of dimensionality. We introduce a deep scattering architecture implemented with a standard multirate filter bank, where learning is introduced with permutation operators. It rotates the space with orthogonal wavelet transforms and implements directional contractions with modulus operators. It provides a simple deep convolution network model, whose properties can be analyzed mathematically, because filter coefficients do not need to be modified.\nSection 2 begins by introducing scattering transforms with a non-linear multirate filter bank. It computes wavelet transform convolutions and modulus non-linearities. Section 3 describes adapted scattering transforms, which optimize contraction directions with permutations. For Haar wavelets, it amounts to a pair matching problem, as explained in Section 4, which yields hierachical invariants over multiscale groups. The scattering transform is then calculated with a cascade of additions and subtractions over pairs of points.\nBy adapting contractions with simple operators, a goal of this paper is to highlight important principles which govern the structure of deep convolution networks, and relate them to standard signal processing tools. Contractions are potentially dangerous because they can strongly reduce distance along certain directions and hence the discriminability of elements in different classes. Supervised data provides information to evaluate distances across classes, and thus adapt contractions to avoid reducing them too much.\nThe authors’ names are in alphabetical order.

We show that such optimizations amounts to computing sparse signal representations, similarly to sparse auto-encoders [4]. These results are illustrated by numerical experiments on modified MNIST digit images in Section 5.

      "text" : "A multirate filter bank computes convolutions of x ∈ Rd with a low-pass filter h and a high-pass filter g, and subsamples the output by a factor 2:\nHx(n) = x ? h(2n) and Gx(n) = x ? g(2n) .\nTo avoid boundary issues, we consider x as a d-periodic signal, where d is a power of 2. The low-pass filter h is real but g may be complex valued. Both filters have a finite impulse response of size K. We write Wx = (Hx,Gx) the resulting multirate filtering. In the following, we shall impose that\n∀x ∈ Rd , ‖Wx‖2 = ‖Hx‖2 + ‖Gx‖2 = ‖x‖2.\nA fast wavelet transform iteratively applies W to the low-pass output Hx, as illustrated in Figure 1(a). The resulting orthogonal wavelet transform at the scale 2J is\nWJx = (H Jx,GHjx)0≤j<J .\nThe first component is the averaged signal\nHJx = x ? φJ(2 jn),\nwhere φJ is a low-pass filter of support K2J . The wavelet coefficients are\nGHjx = x ? ψj(2 jn),\nwhere ψj is a dilated band-pass filter whose support is of size K2j .\nComplex nearly analytic wavelet transforms are implemented with a nearly analytic complex filters g. It however requires to slightly modify the filter bank by first extending the dimension of x from d to 2d with a linear interpolation [6]. Real orthogonal wavelet transforms are implemented with real conjugate mirror filters (h, g) which satisfy\n|ĥ(ω)|2 + |ĥ(ω + π)|2 = 2 with ĥ(0) = ∑ n h(n) = √ 2. (1)\nThe high pass filter is g(n) = (−1)nh(1−n), and ∑ n g(n) = 0. One can prove thatW = (H,G) is then an orthogonal operator in Rd and that {φJ(n − k2J), ψj(n − k2j)}0≤k≤d2−j is a wavelet orthonormal basis of Rd [1].\nHaar filters are simple examples defined by h(n) = 2−1/2(δ(n) + δ(n − 1)) and g(n) = 2−1/2(δ(n) − δ(n − 1)). The resulting Haar scaling filter is φJ = 2−J/21[0,2J−1] and the Haar wavelet is ψj = 2−j/2(1[0,2j−1−1] − 1[2j−1,2j−1]). A modulus filter bank inserts a contraction with a modulus operator applied to the high frequency component Gx of x:\n|G|x(n) = |x ? g(2n)| .\nSuppressing the phase or the sign performs a non-linear demodulation which shifts part of the signal energy towards the lower frequencies. This modulus is not applied to Hx which is already a low frequency signal. With an abuse of notation, we denote by |x| the vector obtained by applying the entry-wise modulus operator to a vector x ∈ Rd, that is, |x| = {|x(n)|}1≤n≤d, and we write |W |x = (Hx, |G|x). If x is real positive, which is the case in a scattering cascade, then Hx is positive real so Hx = |Hx|. It is thus as if the modulus was also applied to Hx.\nA modulus is contractive in the sense that ||a|−|b|| ≤ |a−b|, for any (a, b) ∈ C2. Since ‖Wx−Wx′‖ = ‖x− x′‖, it results that |W | is contractive\n‖|W |x− |W |x′‖ ≤ ‖x− x′‖, and it preserves the norm ‖|W |x‖ = ‖x‖. It is important to realize that a modulus strongly contracts the signal space. Indeed, Gx is an oscillatory signal whose sign or phase changes rapidly. For real signals, a modulus reduces by 2 the range of variation of its coefficients."

(2) Since |W | is contractive and preserves the norm, it results that SJ = |W |J is also contractive and preserves the norm:\n‖SJx− SJx′‖ ≤ ‖x− x′‖ and ‖SJx‖ = ‖x‖ . (3)\nThe operator product (2) iteratively computes Sjx = |W |Sj−1x for 1 ≤ j ≤ J , with S0x = x. Each time, |W | splits Sj−1x in two vectors (HSjx, |G|Sjx). It resuts that Sjx is a concatenation of 2j vectors {Sj,kx}0≤k<2j of dimension 2−jd each, with\nSj,2kx = H Sj−1,kx and Sj,2k+1x = |G|Sj−1,kx . (4)\nThis tree subdecomposition is illustrated in Figure 1(b). Each SJ,k can thus be written a product of 2J operators equal to H or |G|. Since h and g have a size K, the scattering operator SJ has a support of size K2J . Each SJx(n) is computed from K2J consecutive values of x. If we supress the modulus nonlineary and replace |G| by G then SJ has totally different properties. It is then a linear wavelet packet orthogonal transform introduced in [7].\nA scattering operator is implemented as a product of multirate filtering modulus, but its properties depend upon the underlying wavelet transform. A wavelet transform modulus at the scale 2l is defined by\n|Wl|x = (H lx, |G|Hjx)0≤j<l .\nThe modulus is applied only to the output of G:\n|G|Hjx = |x ? ψj(2jn)| .\nThe modulus suppresses the wavelet tranform phase and hence computes an envelop which is approximatively invariant to translations smaller than 2j .\nA scattering transform SJ can be factorized as a product of wavelet transform modulus:\nSJ = |W1| ...|WJ−1| |WJ | .\nIndeed, for each 0 ≤ k < 2J there exists 0 ≤ m(k) ≤ J such that\nSJ,k = H J−\n∑ l jl m(k)∏ l=1 |G|Hjl with ∑ l jl ≤ J .\nEach |G|Hjl is calculated by the wavelet transform modulus |Wjl |. Figure 1(b) illustrates the factorization of the scattering operator SJ into the modulus of wavelet transforms |Wj |, for J = 3.\nThe index m(k) is the number of times that |G| appears in the calculation of SJ,k. There are ( J m ) vectors SJ,k of orderm. Since the contraction is produced by |G|, the indexm can be interpreted as a contraction factor. It plays an essential role to analyze the properties of these deep network coefficients. For a random vector X in Rd, we define σ2m = ∑ k,m(k)=m Var(SJ,kX) as the total variance of all coefficients of order m. Each modulus is applied to the output of a filter G which produces a zero-mean random vector. It thus strongly reduces the variance, and σ2m typically decreases exponentially with m. Table 1 gives its value for a Gaussian white random vector, which is an average measure of volume reduction in the signal space. One can show that σ2m ≈ (1− 2π ) m · ( J m ) , which is verified numericaly in Table 1. Beyond m = 4 the variance of coefficients becomes negligible and the corresponding scattering coefficients thus carry little information. Eliminating coefficients of order m > 4 reduces the number of scattering coefficients from d to about (log42 d)/24."

      "text" : "Scattering transforms are computed by deep convolution network, where the network weights are specified by the filters h and g. Learning network weights in convolution networks can thus be interpreted as a filter adaptation. As long as h remains an averaging filter and g is a high pass filter, modifying the filter values has marginal effects. Cascading such subsampled filtering still defines a wavelet transform. The number of vanishing moments or the wavelet regularity may be modified [1], but it does not modify much the wavelet coefficient properties. Major modifications of wavelet coefficients are however obtained by modifying the orbit (ordering of coefficients) along which convolutions are performed. For example, rotation invariant scattering transforms are calculated by also computing convolutions along rotation parameters in a deep scattering network [8]. This suggests to adapt wavelet transforms with permutations of the network variables before applying convolution operators. Let π be a permutation of {1, ..., d}. It acts on x ∈ Rd as a linear orthogonal operator, written z = πx ∈ Rd, with z(n) = x(π(n)). An adapted scattering inserts a permutation πj of {1, ..., d}, before each multirate modulus convolution:\nSjx = |W |πjSj−1x,\nwhere πj makes a permutation of the d coordinates of Sj−1x before applying |W |. It results that"

(5)\nGeometrically, Wπj is a rotation of the signal space. It depends on πj , which thus modifies the “directions” in which the modulus contractions are acting. The group of permutations is a group of rotations among which we shall search for particular rotations which optimize the contraction directions for learning. Optimizing permutations are typically NP -hard problems. However, the problem is not as bad as it seems because |W | computes convolutions with filters h and g of small support K. The output values thus depend on local ordering properties. For Haar filters, Section 4.1 shows that the ordering reduces to a pairing problem.\nA scattering SJ operators is not invertible because the modulus looses a complex phase or a sign. In the real case, for almost all pairs of unitary operators (A,B) it has been proved [11] that the operator (|A|, |B|) is invertible on Rd. If W is real, one can thus expect that (|Wπ0|, |Wπ1|) are invertible for “sufficiently different” permutations π0 and π0. A necessary and sufficient condition is given on π0 and π1 for this result to hold for a Haar filtering."

Property (2) is proved by applying (1) recursively to (|W |π0Sjx, |W |π1Sjx) for J − 1 ≥ j ≥ 0.\nTo prove (1), notice that if n1, n2, n3 is a triplet where (n1, n2) is a pair in π0 and (n1, n3) a pair in π1 then the values x(n1), x(n2), x(n3) are uniquely determined from (|W |π0x, |W |π1x), unless x(n1) 6= x(n2) and x(n2) = x(n3). The interlacing condition implies that π1 pairs n2 to an index n4 which can not be n3 or n1. Moreover, the four values of x(n1), x(n2), x(n3), x(x4) are specified unless x(n4) = x(n1) 6= x(n2) = x(n3). This interlacing argument can be used to extend to {1, . . . , d} the set of all indices ni for which x(ni) is specified, unless x takes only two values.

      "text" : "A contraction can reduce too much the distance between two points which do not belong to the same class, and thus strongly reduce their discriminability. In general, this can not be fully avoided with unsupervised data. However, one can optimize contractions by maximizing the average distance between training samples, so that this loss of discriminability becomes less likely. We show that it implies computing sparse signal representations.\nA scattering progressively contracts the scattering metric ‖Sj−1x − Sj−1x′‖, by applying |W |πj for 1 ≤ j ≤ J . We consider unlabeled examples as realizations of a random vector X ∈ Rd, which is an unknown mixture of different classes. The operator |W |πj strongly contracts the signal space but it should reduce as little as possible the average Euclidean distance between realizations of Sj−1X , to avoid confusing elements of different unknown classes. We thus want to maximize the variance σ2(SjX) of SjX . Since σ2(SjX) = E‖SjX‖2 − ‖E(SjX)‖2 and E‖SjX‖2 = E‖Sj−1X‖2, this is equivalent to finding a permutation πj which minimizes\n‖E(SjX)‖2 = ‖E(|W |πjSj−1X)‖2. From q realizations {xi}i≤q , we estimate ‖E(SjX)‖ with the empirical sum ‖ ∑q i=1 Sjxi‖. It is a mixed l1 norm along realizations xi and an l2 norm across the scattering coordinates. This is a sparsity norm which is optimized so that WπjSj−1X has a sparse representation. Sparsity appears in this optimization because the distance between two vectors having many zero coordinates is not much reduced by applying a modulus on the coordinate of these vectors. Indeed, ||a| − |b|| = |a− b| if a or b is zero. The mixed l2 and l1 norm can also be replaced by a simpler l1 sparsity norm.\nFor a Haar scattering transform, the sparsity norm is an additive cost on the pairing pπj :\n‖ q∑ i=1 Sjxi‖2 = C(pπj ) = d/2∑ p=1 c(πj(2p), πj(2n+ 1)),\nwith\nc(k, k′) = ( q∑ i=1 Sj−1xi(k) + Sj−1x(k ′) )2 + ( q∑ i=1 |Sj−1xi(k)− Sj−1x(k′)| )2 .\nIt is solved with the Blossom algorithm with O(d3) operations. The unsupervised learning algorithm iteratively computes an optimized pairing pπj for j going from 1 to J . One can also impose constraints on the pairing to reduce computations and incorporate some prior information. An inner-node pairing in the filter bank tree imposes that πj pairs coefficients within each vector Sj,kx, and performs the same pairing for all 0 ≤ k < 2j . There is typically not a unique pairing which minimizes the unsupervised contraction cost. Let us consider for example a random vector X which is stationary and has a period d. Any translation of the pairing yields the same cost because of the stationarity. These pairing being equally valid, one can reduce the classification variance by using them all. We thus use a bagging algorithm which estimates several ordered scattering from several training sets, and aggregates these multiple scattering vectors to compute a linear SVM classification."

These experiments tests several aspect of the algorithm: the ability to recover spatial neighborhood information and the classification accuracy without location information.\nThe permutation learning is first performed with inner-node pairing optimizations, which means that for each level j, the same pairing function is used to associate the coefficients of each Sj,kx for 0 ≤ k < 2j . These pairings perform a multiscale estimation of relative spatial locations. We say that two coefficients Sj,k(n) and Sj,k(n′) are spatially connected if they are computed with operators whose supports of size 2j are spatially connected in the original image domain. We only consider coefficients whose amplitude are non-negligible and thus play a role in the classification. Over the first three levels 1 ≤ j ≤ 3, a 100% of the pairs are connected, which shows that all pairing are spatialy connected. For j = 4 and j = 5 the proportion of connected pairs are respectively 85% and 67%. The connectivity ratio decreases with the scale because long range correlations are weaker and spatially non-connected pairs may become more similar than spatially connected ones.\nMNIST images have d ≤ 210 pixels so scattering operators can be computed at scales 2J ≤ 210. The classification error decreases when J increases and the best accuracy is obtained for J = 10, which corresponds to a maximally invariant representation. We compute N adapted scattering operators with unsupervised pairing overN different subsets of training samples. TheN different scattering vectors SJx are aggregated and fed into a linear SVM. The energy of scattering coefficients decrease exponentially with m, as shown by Table 1 for a Gaussian process. Table 2b shows that best classification results are obtained by keeping only coefficients of order m ≤ 4. Since 2J = d, we thus keep about (log2 d)4/24 scattering coefficients as opposed to d. These figures are computed with an aggregation of N = 10\ndifferent scattering vectors, but the optimum for m = 4 does not depend upon N . Table 2c gives the classification error rate as a function of N . The performance increases slowsly for N ≥ 10, and does not improve beyond N = 50, which is much smaller than 2J .\nAlmost all MNIST classification algorithms use prior information on the spatial location of pixels to build spatially localized descriptors, and deep convolution networks as well as translation invariant scattering transforms further use prior information on translation invariance. State of the art results, without making any modification of training vectors, is achieved by deep convolutional neural networks (0.53%, [5]), and scattering networks with Gabor wavelet (0.43% [2]). This unsupervised learning, uses no prior information on pixel location or on translation invariance. It reaches an error of 0.9% by optimizing inner-node pairing. If no constraint is imposed on the pairing algorithm, which may thus associates coefficients computed across different nodes in the filter bank tree, then the error increases to 1%. Indeed, for MNIST, intra-class variabilities are mostly due to translations and deformations. Appropriate invariants can be thus computed with inner-node pairing. Providing more flexibiilty increases the pairing variance, which explains the slight error increase. This flexibility can however produce useful invariants for non-translation invariants."

Each digit is projected on a 3D sphere sampled over d = 4096 points, and randomly rotated on the sphere, with a rotation variance σ2 = 0.2 [3].\nTranslations in the plane are now replaced by rotations over the sphere, on which one can not define convolution operators after sampling. The classification algorithms in [3] introduces an elegant solution which replaces convolution operators (diagonal in Fourier) by operators which are diagonal over the Laplacian eigenvectors on a graph. These algorithms use the 3D neighborhood of points on the sphere to define the graph connectivity. Table 2 gives the results reported in [3], with 19% error for a nearest neighbor algorithm, 5.6% for a two-layer fully connected neural network, and 6% for two best locally connected network algorithms. The adapted Haar scattering algorithm yields a smaller error of 2.2%, when computed at the maximum scale 2J = d, by aggregating N = 10 scattering transforms, up the order m = 4. The Haar scattering thus reduces the error by an important factor although it uses no prior information on the 3D connectivity of points, which illustrates the learning abilities of this deep network structure."
