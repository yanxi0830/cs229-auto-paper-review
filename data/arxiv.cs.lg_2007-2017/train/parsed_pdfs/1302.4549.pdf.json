Based on this result, we further devise an iterative algorithm to recover almost all clusters via a “peeling strategy”, i.e., recover large clusters first, leading to a reduced problem, and repeat this procedure. These results are extended to the partial observation setting, in which only a (chosen) part of the graph is observed. The peeling strategy gives rise to an active learning algorithm, in which edges adjacent to smaller clusters are queried more often as large clusters are learned (and removed).\nFrom a high level, this paper sheds novel insights on high-dimensional statistics and learning structured data, by presenting a structured matrix learning problem for which a one shot convex relaxation approach necessarily fails, but a carefully constructed sequence of convex relaxations does the job."

      "text" : "This paper considers a classic problem in machine learning and theoretical computer science, namely graph clustering, i.e., given an undirected unweighted graph, partition the nodes into disjoint clusters, so that the density of edges within one cluster is higher than those across clusters. Graph clustering arises naturally in many application across science and engineering. Some prominent examples include community detection in social network Mishra et al. [2007], submarket identification in E-commerce and sponsored search Yahoo!-Inc [2009], and co-authorship analysis in analyzing document database Ester et al. [1995], among others. From a purely binary classification theoretical point of view, the edges of the graph are (noisy) labels of similarity or affinity between pairs of objects, and the concept class consists of clusterings of the objects (encoded graphically by identifying clusters with cliques).\nMany theoretical results in graph clustering [e.g., Boppana, 1987, Chen et al., 2012, McSherry, 2001] consider the planted partition model, in which the edges are generated randomly; see Section 1.1 for more details. While numerous different methods have been proposed, their performance guarantees all share the following manner – under certain condition of the density of edges (within clusters and across clusters), the proposed method succeeds to recover the correct clusters exactly if all clusters are larger than a threshold size, typically Ω̃( √ n).\n∗Department of Computer Science, Technion Israel Institute of Technology. nailon@cs.technion.ac.il †Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, The University of Texas at Austin. ydchen@utexas.edu ‡Department of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore. mpexuh@nus.edu.sg\nar X\niv :1\n30 2.\n45 49\nv2 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 0\nFe b\nIn this paper, we aim to break this small cluster barrier of graph clustering. Correctly identifying extremely small clusters is inherently hard as they are easily confused with “fake” clusters generated by noisy edges1, and is not the focus of this paper. Instead, in this paper we investigate a question that has not been addressed before: Can we still recover large clusters in the presence of small clusters? Intuitively, this should be doable. To illustrate, consider an extreme example where the given graph G consists two disjoint subgraphs G1 and G2, where G1 is a graph that can be correctly clustered using some existing method, and G2 is a small-size clique. G certainly violates the minimum cluster size requirement of previous results, but why should G2 spoil our ability to cluster G1?\nOur main result confirms this intuition. We show that the cluster size barrier arising in previous work [e.g., Chaudhuri et al., 2012, Bollobás and Scott, 2004, Chen et al., 2012, McSherry, 2001] is not really a restriction, but rather an artifact of the attempt to solve the problem in a single shot using convex relaxation techniques. Using a more careful analysis, we prove that the mixed trace-norm and `1 based convex formulation, initially proposed in Jalali et al. [2011], can recover clusters of size Ω̃( √ n) even in the presence of smaller clusters. That is, small clusters do not interfere with recovery of the big clusters.\nThe main implication of this result is that one can apply an iterative “peeling” strategy, recovering smaller and smaller clusters. The intuition is simple – suppose the number of clusters is limited, then either all clusters are large, or the sizes of the clusters vary significantly. The first case is obviously easy. The second one is equally easy: use the aforementioned convex formulation, the larger clusters can be correctly identified. If we remove all nodes from these larger clusters, the remaining subgraph contains significantly fewer nodes than the original graph, which leads to a much lower threshold on the size of the cluster for correct recovery, making it possible for correctly clustering some smaller clusters. By repeating this procedure, indeed, we can recover the cluster structure for almost all nodes with no lower bound on the minimal cluster size. We summarize our main contributions and techniques:\n(1) We provide a refined analysis of the mixed trace norm and `1 convex relaxation approach for exact recovery of clusters proposed in Jalali et al. [2011] and Chen et al. [2012], focusing on the case where small clusters exist. We show that in the classical planted partition settings Boppana [1987], if each cluster is either large (more precisely, of size at least x ≈ √ n log2 n) or small (of size at most x/ log2 n), then with high probability, this convex relaxation approach correctly identifies all big clusters while “ignoring” the small ones. Notice that the multiplicative gap between the two thresholds is logarithmic w.r.t. n. In addition, it is possible to arbitrarily increase x, thus turning a “knob” in quest of an interval (x/ log2 n, x) that is disjoint from the set of cluster sizes. The analysis is done by identifying a certain feasible solution to the convex program and proving its almost sure optimality using a careful construction of a dual certificate. This feasible solution easily identifies the big clusters. This method has been performed before only in the case where all clusters are of size ≥ x.\n(2) We provide a converse of the result just described. More precisely, we show that if for some value of the knob x an optimal solution appears to look as if the interval (x/ log2 n, x) were indeed free of cluster sizes, then the solution is useful (in the sense that it correctly identifies big clusters) even if this weren’t the case.\n(3) The last two points imply that if some interval of the form (x/ log2 n, x) is free of cluster sizes, then an exhaustive search of this interval will constructively find big clusters (though not necessarily for that particular interval). This gives rise to an iterative algorithm, using a “peeling strategy”, to recover smaller and smaller clusters that are otherwise impossible to recover. Using the “knob”, we prove that as long as the number of clusters is bounded by Ω(log n/ log log n), regardless of the cluster sizes, we can correctly recover the cluster structure for an overwhelming fraction of nodes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result of provably correct graph clustering without any assumptions on the cluster sizes.\n1Indeed, even in a more lenient setup where one clique (i.e., a perfect cluster) of size K is embedded in an Erdos-Renyi graph of n nodes and 0.5 probability of forming an edge, to recover this clique, the best known polynomial method requires K = Ω( √ n) and it has been a long standing open problem to relax this requirement.\n(4) We extend the result to the partial observation case, where only a faction of similarity labels (i.e., edge/no edge) is known. As expected, smaller observation rates allow identification of larger clusters. Hence, the observation rate serves as the “knob”. This gives rise to an active learning algorithm for graph clustering based on adaptively increasing the rate of sampling in order to hit a “forbidden interval” free of cluster sizes, and concentrating on smaller inputs as we identify big clusters and peel them off.\nBeside these technical contributions, this paper provides novel insights into low-rank matrix recovery and more generally high-dimensional statistics, where data are typically assumed to obey certain low-dimensional structure. Numerous methods have been developed to exploit this a priori information so that a consistent estimator is possible even when the dimensionality of data is larger than the number of samples. Our result shows that one may combine these methods with a “peeling strategy” to further push the envelope of learning structured data – By iteratively recovering the easier structure and then reducing the problem size, it is possible to learn structures that are otherwise difficult using previous approaches."

      "text" : "The literature of graph clustering is too vast for a detailed survey here; we concentrate on the most related work, and in specific those provide theoretical guarantees on cluster recovery.\nPlanted partition model: The setup we study is the classical planted partition model Boppana [1987], also known as the stochastic block model Rohe et al. [2011]. Here, n nodes are partitioned into subsets, referred as the “true clusters”, and a graph is randomly generated as follows: for each pair of nodes, depending on whether they belong to a same subset, an edge connecting them is generated with a probability p or q respectively. The goal is to correctly recover the clusters given the random graph. The planted partition model has been studied as early as 1980’s Boppana [1987]. Earlier work focused on the 2-partition or more generally l-partition case, i.e., the minimal cluster size is Θ(n) Boppana [1987], Condon and Karp [2001], Carson and Impagliazzo [2001], Bollobás and Scott [2004]. Recently, several works have proposed methods to handle sublinear cluster sizes. These works can be roughly classified into three approaches: randomized algorithms [e.g., Shamir and Tsur, 2007], spectral clustering [e.g., McSherry, 2001, Giesen and Mitsche, 2005, Chaudhuri et al., 2012, Rohe et al., 2011]), and low-rank matrix decomposition Jalali et al. [2011], Chen et al. [2012], Ames and Vavasis [2011], Oymak and Hassibi [2011]. While these work differs in the methodology, they all impose constraints on the size of the minimum true cluster – the best result up-to-date requires it to be Ω̃( √ n).\nCorrelation Clustering This problem, originally defined by Bansal, Blum and Chawla Bansal et al. [2004], also considers graph clustering but in an adversarial noise setting. The goal there is to find the clustering minimizing the total disagreement (intercluster edges plus intracluster nonedges), without there being necessarily a notion of true clustering (and hence no “exact recovery”). This problem is usually studied in the combinatorial optimization framework and is known to be NP-Hard to approximate to within some constant factor. Prominent work includes Demaine et al. [2006], Ailon et al. [2008], Charikar et al. [2005]. A PTAS is known in case the number of clusters is fixed Giotis and Guruswami [2006].\nLow rank matrix decomposition via trace norm: Motivated from robust PCA, it has recently been shown Chandrasekaran et al. [2011], Candès et al. [2011], that it is possible to recover a low-rank matrix from sparse errors of arbitrary magnitude, where the key ingredient is using trace norm (aka nuclear norm) as a convex surrogate of the rank. A similar result is also obtained when the low rank matrix is corrupted by other types of noise Xu et al. [2012].\nOf particular relevance to this paper is Jalali et al. [2011] and Chen et al. [2012], where the authors apply this approach to graph clustering, and specifically to the planted partition model. Indeed, Chen et al. [2012] achieve state-of-art performance guarantees for the planted partition problem. However, they don’t overcome the Ω̃( √ n) minimal cluster size lower bound.\nActive learning/Active clustering Another line of work that motivates this paper is study of active learning algorithms (a settings in which labeled instances are chosen by the learner, rather than by nature), and in particular active learning for clustering. The most related work is Ailon et al. [2012], who investigated active learning for correlation clustering. The authors obtain a (1 + ε)-approximate solution with respect to the optimal, while (actively) querying no more than O(npoly(log n, k, ε−1)) edges. The result imposed no restriction on cluster sizes and hence inspired this work, but differs in at least two major ways. First, Ailon et al. [2012] did not consider exact recovery as we do. Second, their guarantees fall in the ERM (Empirical Risk Minimization) framework, with no running time guarantees. Our work recovers true cluster exactly using a convex relaxation algorithm, and is hence computationally efficient. The problem of active learning has also been investigated in other clustering setups including clustering based on distance matrix Voevodski et al. [2012], Shamir and Tishby [2011], and hierarchical clustering Eriksson et al. [2011], Krishnamurthy et al. [2012]. These setups differ from ours and cannot be easily compared."

We assume a true ground truth clustering of V given by a pairwise disjoint covering V1, . . . , Vk, where k is the number of clusters. We say i ∼ j if i, j ∈ Va for some a ∈ [k], otherwise i 6∼ j. We let ni = |Vi| for all i ∈ [k]. For any i ∈ [n], 〈i〉 is the unique index satisfying i ∈ V〈i〉.\nFor a matrix X ∈ Rn×n and a subset S ⊆ [n] of size m, the matrix X[S] ∈ Rm×m is the principal minor of X corresponding to the set of indexes S. For a matrix M , Γ(M) denotes the support of M , namely, the set of index pairs (i, j) such that M(i, j) 6= 0.\nThe ground truth clustering matrix, denoted K∗, is defined so that K∗(i, j) = 1 is i ∼ j, otherwise 0. This is a block diagonal matrix, each block consisting of 1’s only. Its rank is k. The input is a symmetric matrix A, a noisy version of K∗. It is generated using the well known planted clustering model, as follows. There are two fixed edge probabilities, p > q. We think of A as the adjacency matrix of an undirected random graph, where edge (i, j) is in the graph for i > j with probability p if i ∼ j, otherwise with probability q, independent of other choices. The error matrix is denoted by B∗ := A−K∗. We let Ω := Γ(B∗) denote the noise locations.\nNote that our results apply to the more practical case in which the edge probability of (i, j) is pij for each i ∼ j and qij for i 6∼ j, as long as (min pij) =: p > q := (max qij)."

The proof is based on Chen et al. [2012] and is deferred to the supplemental material due to lack of space. The main novelty in this work compared to previous work is the treatment of small clusters of size at most `[, whereas in previous work only large clusters were treated, and the existence of small clusters did not allow recovery of the big clusters.\nDefinition 2. An n×n matrix K is a partial clustering matrix if there exists a collection of pairwise disjoint sets U1, . . . , Ur ⊆ [n] (the induced clusters) such that K(i, j) = 1 if and only if i, j ∈ Us for some s ∈ [r], otherwise 0. If K is a partial clustering matrix then σmin(K) is defined as min r i=1 |Ui|.\nThe definition is depicted in Figure 1. Theorem 1 tells us that by choosing κ (and hence c1, c2) properly such that no cluster size falls in the range (`[, `]), the unique optimal solution (K̂, B̂) to convex program (CP1) is such that K̂ is a partial clustering induced by big ground truth clusters.\nIn order for this fact to be useful algorithmically, we also need a type of converse: there exists an event with high probability (in the random process generating the input), such that for all values of κ, if an optimal solution to the corresponding (CP1) looks like the solution (K̂, B̂) defined in Theorem 1, then the blocks of K̂ correspond to actual clusters.\nTheorem 3. There exists constants C1, C2 > 0 such that with probability at least 1 − n−2, the following holds. For all κ ≥ 1 and t ∈ [ 34q + 1 4p, 1 4q + 3 4p], if (K,B) is an optimal solution to (CP1) with c1, c2 as defined in Theorem 1, and additionally K is a partial clustering induced by U1, . . . , Ur ⊆ V , and also\nσmin(K) ≥ max\n{ C1k log n\n(p− q)2 , C2κ √ p(1− q)n log n p− q } , (3)\nthen U1, . . . , Ur are actual ground truth clusters, namely, there exists an injection φ : [r] 7→ [k] such that Ui = Vφ(i) for all i ∈ [r].\n(Note: Our proof of Theorem 3 uses Hoeffding tail bounds for simplicity, which are tight for p, q bounded away from 0 and 1. Bernstein tail bounds can be used to strengthen the result for other classes of p, q. We elaborate on this in Section 3.1.)\nThe combination of Theorems 1 and 3 implies that, as long as there exists a relatively small interval which is disjoint from the set of cluster sizes, and such that at least one cluster size is larger than this interval (and large enough), we can recover at least one (large) cluster using (CP1). This is made clear in the following. Corollary 4. Assume we have a guarantee that there exists a number α ≥ b4 √ p(1−q)n p−q , such that no cluster size falls in the interval (α, b3b4α log 2 n) and at least one cluster size is of size at least s := max{ b3b4α log\n2 n, (C1k log n)/(p− q)2, C2 √ p(1− q)n log n/(p− q)}. Then with probability at least 1− n−2, we can recover at least one cluster\nof size at least s efficiently by solving (CP1) with κ = α/ ( b4 √ p(1−q)n p−q ) .\nOf course we do not know what α (and hence κ) is. We could exhaustively search for a κ ≥ 1 and hope to recover at least one large cluster. A more interesting question is, when is such a κ guaranteed to exist? Let g = b3b b4 log\n2 n. The number g is the (multiplicative) gap size, equaling the ratio between `] and `[ (for any κ). If the number of clusters k is a priori bounded by some k0, we both ensure that there is at least one cluster of size n/k0, and by the pigeonhole principle, that one of the intervals in the sequence (n/gk0, n/k0), (n/g 2k0, n/gk0), . . . , (n/g k0+1k0, n/g\nk0k0). is disjoint of cluster sizes. If, in addition, the smallest interval in the sequence is not too small and n/k0 is not too small so that Corollary 4 holds, then we are guaranteed to recover at least one cluster using Algorithm 1. We find this condition difficult to work with. An elegant, useful version of the idea is obtained if we assume p, q are some fixed constants.2 As the following lemma shows, it turns our that in this regime, k0 can be assumed to be almost logarithmic in n to ensure recovery of at least one cluster. 3 In what follows, notation such as C(p, q), C3(p, q), . . . denotes universal positive functions that depend on p, q only.\nLemma 5. There exists C3(p, q), C4(p, q), C5 > 0 such that the following holds. Assume that n > C4(p, q), and that we are guaranteed that k ≤ k0, where k0 = C3(p,q) lognlog logn . Then with probability at least 1 − n −2 Algorithm 1 will recover at least one cluster in at most C5k0 iterations.\nThe proof is deferred to the supplemental material section. Lemma 5 ensures that by trying at most a logarithmic number of values of κ, we can recover at least one large cluster, assuming the number of clusters is roughly logarithmic in n. The next proposition tells us that as long as this step recovers the clusters covering at most all but a vanishing fraction of elements, the step can be repeated.\nProposition 6. A pair of numbers (n′, k′) is called good if n′ ≤ n, k′ ≤ k and k′ ≤ C3(p,q) logn ′\nlog logn . If (n ′, k′)\nis good, then (n′′, k′′) is good for all n′′, k′′ satisfying n′ ≥ n′′ ≥ n′/(log n)1/C3(p,q) and k′ − 1 ≥ k′′ ≥ 1.\nThe proof is trivial. The proposition implies an inductive process in which at least one big (with respect to the current unrecovered size) cluster can be efficiently removed as long as the previous step recovered at most a (1− (log n)−1/C3(p,q))-fraction of its input. Combining, we proved the following:\nTheorem 7. Assume n, k satisfy the requirements of Lemma 5. Then with probability at least 1 − 2n−2 Algorithm 2 recovers clusters covering all but at most a ((log n)−1/C3(p−q)) fraction of the input in the full observation case, without any restriction of the minimal cluster size. Moreover, if we assume that k is bounded by a constant k0, then the algorithm will recover clusters covering all but a constant number of input elements.\n2In fact, we need only fix (p− q), but we wish to keep this exposition simple. 3In comparison, Ailon et al. [2012] require k0 to be constant for their guarantees, as do the Correlation Clustering PTAS\nGiotis and Guruswami [2006]."

The theorem is proven using a\nsimple pigeonhole principle, noting that one of the intervals (`[(ρ), `](ρ)) must be disjoint from the set of cluster sizes, and there is at least one cluster of size at least n/k0. The theorem, together with Corollary 8 and Theorem 9 ensures the following. On one end of the spectrum, if k0 is a constant (and n is large enough), then with high probability we can recover at least one large cluster (of size at least n/k0) after querying no more than\nO ( nk20 ( b3(p ′, q′)\nb4(p′, q′) log2 n\n)2k0 log4 n ) (5)\nvalues of A(i, j). On the other end of the spectrum, if k0 ≤ δ(log n)/(log log n) and n is large enough (exponential in 1/δ), then we can recover at least one large cluster after querying no more than n1+O(δ) values of A(i, j). (We omit the details of the last fact from this version.) This is summarized in the following:\nTheorem 11. Assume an upper bound k0 on the number of clusters k. As long as n is larger than some function of k0, p\n′, q′, Algorithm 4 will recover, with probability at least 1 − n−1, at least one cluster of size at least n/k0, regardless of the size of other (small) clusters. Moreover, if k0 is a constant, then clusters covering all but a constant number of elements will be recovered with probability at least 1 − n−1, and the total number of observation queries is (5), hence almost linear.\nNote that unlike previous results for this problem, the recovery guarantee does not impose any lower bound on the size of the smallest cluster. Also note that the underlying algorithm is an active learning one, because more observations fall in smaller clusters which survive deeper in the recursion of Algorithm 4."

Here we did not make an effort to compute the various constants defining the algorithms in this work, creating a difficulty in exact implementation. Instead, for Algorithm 1, we increase κ by a multiplicative factor of 1.1 in each iteration until a partial clustering matrix is found. Similarly, in Algorithm 3, ρ is increased by an additive factor of 0.025. Still, it is obvious that our experiments support our theoretical findings. A more practical “user’s guide” for this method with actual constants is subject to future work.\nIn all experiment reports below, we use a variant of the Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier (ALM) method Lin et al. [2009] to solve the semi-definite program (CP1). Whenever we say that “clusters {Vi1 , Vi2 , . . . } were recovered”, we mean that a corresponding instantiation of (CP1) resulted in an optimal solution (K,B) for which K was a partial clustering matrix induced by {Vi1 , Vi2 , . . . }.\nExperiment 1 (Full Observation) Consider n = 1100 nodes partitioned into 4 clusters V1, . . . , V4, of sizes 800, 200, 80, 20, respectively. The graph is generated according to the planted partition model with p = 0.5, q = 0.2, and we assume the full observation setting. We apply a simplified version of Algorithm 2, which terminates in 4 steps. The recovered clusters at each step are detailed in Table 1.\nExperiment 2 (Partial Observation - Fixed Sample Rate) We have n = 1100 with clusters V1, . . . , V4 of sizes 800, 200, 50, 50.

We repeatedly solved (CP1) with c1, c2 as in Corollary 8. At each iteration, at least one large cluster (compared to the input size at that iteration) was recovered exactly and removed. This terminated in exactly 3 iterations. Results are shown in Table 1.\nExperiment 3 (Partial Observation - Incremental Sampling Rate) We tried a simplified version of Algorithm 4. We have n = 1100 with clusters V1, . . . , V4 of sizes 800, 200, 50, 50. The observed graph is generated with p′ = 0.7, q′ = 0.3, and an observation rate ρ which we now specify. We start with ρ = 0 and increase it by 0.025 incrementally until we recover (and then remove) at least one cluster, then repeat. The algorithm terminates in 3 steps. Results are shown in Table 1.\nExperiment 3A We repeat the experiment with a larger instance: n = 4500 with clusters V1, . . . , V6 of sizes 3200, 800, 200, 200, 50, 50, and p′ = 0.8, q′ = 0.2. Results are shown in Table 1. Note that we recover the smallest clusters, whose size is below √ n.\nExperiment 4 (Mid-Size Clusters) Our current theoretical results do not say anything about the midsize clusters – those with sizes between `[ and `]. It is interesting to study the behavior of (CP1) in the presence of mid-size clusters. We generated an instance with n = 750, {|V1|, |V2|, |V3|, |V4|} = {500, 150, 70, 30}, p = 0.8, q = 0.2, and ρ = 0.12. We then solved (CP1) with a fixed κ = 1. The low-rank part K̂ of the solution is shown in Fig. 2. The large cluster V1 is completely recovered in K̂, while the small clusters V3 and V4 are entirely ignored. The mid-size cluster V2, however, exhibits a pattern we find difficult to characterize. This shows that the polylog gap in our theorems is a real phenomenon and not an artifact of our proof technique. Nevertheless, the large cluster appears clean, and might allow recovery using a simple combinatorial procedure. If this is true in general, it might not be necessary to search for a gap free of cluster sizes. Perhaps for any κ, (CP1) identifies all large clusters above `] after a possible simple mid-size cleanup procedure. Understanding this phenomenon and its algorithmic implications is of much interest."

      "heading" : "5 Discussion",
      "text" : "An immediate future research is to better understand the “mid-size crisis”. Our current results say nothing about clusters that are neither big nor small, falling in the interval (`[, `]). Our numerical experiments confirm that the mid-size phenomenon is real: they are neither completely recovered nor entirely ignored by the optimal K̂. The part of K̂ restricted to these clusters does not seem to have an obvious pattern.Proving whether we can still efficiently recover large clusters in the presence of mid-size clusters is an interesting open problem.\nOur study was mainly theoretical, focusing on the planted partition model. As such, our experiments focused on confirming the theoretical findings with data generated exactly according to the distribution we could provide provable guarantees for. It would be interesting to apply the presented methodology to real applications, particularly big data sets merged from web application and social networks.\nAnother interesting direction is extending the “peeling strategy” to other high-dimensional learning problems. This requires understanding when such a strategy may work. One intuitive explanation of the small cluster barrier encountered in previous work is ambiguity – when viewing the input at the “big cluster resolution”, a small cluster is both a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. Only when “zooming in” (after recovering big clusters), small clusters patterns emerge. There are other formulations with similar property. For example, in Xu et al. [2012], the authors propose to decompose a matrix into the sum of a low rank one and a column sparse one to solve an outlier-resistant PCA task. Notice that a column sparse matrix is also a low rank matrix. We hope the “peeling strategy” may also help with that problem."

      "text" : "We use the following notation and conventions throughout the supplement. For a real n× n matrix M , we use the unadorned norm ‖M‖ to denote its spectral norm. The notation ‖M‖F refers to the Frobenius norm, ‖M‖1 is ∑ i,j |M(i, j)| and ‖M‖∞ is maxij |M(i, j)|.\nWe will also study operators on the space of matrices. To distinguish them from the matrices studied in this work, we will simply call these objects “operators”, and will denote them using a calligraphic font, e.g. P. The norm ‖P‖ of an operator is defined as\n‖P‖ = sup M :‖M‖F =1 ‖PM‖F ,\nwhere the supremum is over matrices M .\nFor a fixed, real n× n matrix M , we define the matrix linear subspace T (M) as follows:\nT (M) := {YM +MX : X,Y ∈ Rn×n} .\nIn words, this subspace is the set of matrices spanned by matrices each row of which is in the row space of M , and matrices each column of which is in the column space of M .\nFor any given subspace of matrices S ⊆ Rn×n, we let PS denote the orthogonal projection onto S with respect to the the inner product 〈X,Y 〉 = ∑n i,j=1X(i, j)Y (i, j) = trX\ntY .

Note that PT (X)⊥M = M − PT (X)M = (I − PC(X))M(I − PR(X)) .\nFor a matrix M , sgnM is defined as the matrix satisfying:\n(sgnM)(i, j) =  1 M(i, j) > 0\n−1 M(i, j) < 0 0 otherwise ."

The projection P[ is defined as follows:\n(P[M)(i, j) = { M(i, j) max{n〈i〉, n〈j〉} ≤ `[ 0 otherwise .\nIn words, P[ projects onto the set of matrices supported on V[ × V[.

We will show that this solution will have strictly higher objective value than 〈 K̂, B̂ 〉 if ∆ 6= 0.\nFor this ∆, let G∆ be a matrix in T ⊥ ∩ Range(P[) satisfying ‖G‖ = 1 and 〈G∆,∆〉 = ‖PT⊥P[∆‖∗ ;\nsuch a matrix always exists because RangeP[ ⊆ T⊥. Suppose ‖Q‖ = b. Clearly, PT⊥Q+ (1− b)G ∈ T⊥ and, due to desideratum 1, we have ‖PT⊥Q+ (1− b)G∆‖ ≤ ‖Q‖ + (1 − b) ‖G∆‖ = b + (1 − b) = 1. Therefore, UU> + PT⊥Q + (1 − b)G∆ is a subgradient of f(K) = ‖K‖∗ at K = K̂. On the other hand, define the matrix F∆ = −PΓcsgn(∆). We have F∆ ∈ Γc and ‖F∆‖∞ ≤ 1.

We show that all four terms are upperbounded by 14 .\n(a) P[Q∼ is a block diagonal matrix with each block having size at most `[. Moreover, P[Q∼ is the sum of a deterministic matrix Q∼,d with all non-zero entries equal to\nb1√ n logn p−t√ t(1−t) and a random matrix\nQ∼,r whose entries are i.i.d., bounded almost surely by max{c1, c2} and have zero mean with variance\nb21 n logn · p(1−p) t(1−t) .

      "text" : "Fix κ ≥ 1 and t in the allowed range, let (K,B) be an optimal solution to (CP1) , and assume K is a partial clustering induced by U1, . . . , Ur for some integer r, and also assume σmin(K) = mini∈[r] |Ui| satisfies (3). Let M = σmin(K).\nWe need a few helpful facts. First, note that any value of t in the allowed range [ 14p + 3 4q, 3 4p + 1 4q]\nsatisfies q + 14 (p− q) ≤ t ≤ p− 1 4 (p− q). Also note that from the definition of t, c1, c2,\nq + 1 4 (p− q) ≤ c2 c1 + c2 = t ≤ p− 1 4 (p− q) . (7)\nWe say that a pair of sets Y ⊆ V,Z ⊆ V is cluster separated if there is no pair (y, z) ∈ Y ×Z satisfying y ∼ z.\nAssumption 13. There exists a constant C ′ > 0 such that for all pairs of cluster-separated sets Y,Z of size at least m := C ′ logn\n(p−q)2 each,\n|d̂Y,Z − q| < 1\n4 (p− q) , (8)\nwhere d̂Y,Z := |(Y×Z)∩Ω| |Y |·|Z| .\nThis is proven by a Hoeffding tail bound and a union bound to hold with probability at least 1− n−4. To see why, fix the sizes mY ,mZ of |Y |, |Z|, assume mY ≤ mZ w.l.o.g. For each such choice, there are at most exp{C(mY + mZ) log n} ≤ exp{2CmZ log n} possibilities for the choice of sets Y,Z, for some C > 0. For each such choice, the probability that (8) does not hold is\nexp{−C ′′mYmZ(p− q)2} (9)\nusing Hoeffding inequality, for some C ′′ > 0. Hence, as long as mY ≥ m as defined above, for properly chosen C ′, using union bound (over all possibilities of mY ,mZ and of Y,Z) we obtain (8) uniformly.\nIf we assume also , say, that M ≥ 3m , (10)\n(which can be done by setting C1 ≥ 3C ′) the implication of the assumption is that it cannot be the case that some Ui contains a subset U ′ i of size in the range [m, |Ui| −m] such that U ′i = Vg ∩Ui for some g. Indeed, if such a set existed, then we would find a strictly better solution to (CP1), call it (K ′, B′), which is defined so that K ′ is obtained from K by splitting the block corresponding to Ui into two blocks, one corresponding to U ′i and the other to Ui \\U ′i . The difference ∆ between the cost of (K,B) and (K ′, B′) is (renaming Y := U ′i and Z := U \\U ′i) ∆ = c1|(Y ×Z) ∩Ω| − c2|(Y ×Z) ∩Ωc| = (c1 + c2)d̂Y,Z |Y | |Z| − c2|Y | |Z|. But the sign of ∆ is exactly the sign of d̂Y,Z − c2c1+c2 which is strictly negative by (8) and (7). (We also used the fact that the trace norm part of the utility function is equal for both solutions: ‖K ′‖∗ = ‖K‖∗).\nThe conclusion is that for each i, the sets (Ui ∩ V1), . . . , (Ui ∩ Vk) must all be of size at most m, except maybe for at most one set of size at least |Ui| −m. If we now also assume that\nM > km = (kC ′ log n)/(p− q)2 , (11)\nthen we conclude that not all these sets can be of size at most m. Hence exactly one of these sets must have size at least |Ui| −m. From this we conclude that there is a function φ : [r] 7→ [k] such that for all i ∈ [r],\n|Ui ∩ Vφ(i)| ≥ |Ui| −m .\nWe now claim that this function is an injection. We will need the following assumption:\nAssumption 14. For any 4 pairwise disjoint subsets (Y, Y ′, Z, Z ′) such that (Y ∪ Y ′) ⊆ Vi for some i, (Z ∪ Z ′) ⊆ [n] \\ Vi, max{|Z|, |Z ′|} ≤ m, min{|Y |, |Y ′|} ≥M −m:\n|Y | · |Y ′| d̂Y,Y ′ − |Y | · |Z| d̂Y,Z − |Y ′| · |Z ′| d̂Y ′,Z′ > c2\nc1 + c2 (|Y | · |Y ′| − |Y | · |Z| − |Y ′| · |Z ′|) (12)\nThe assumption holds with probability at least 1− n−4 by using Hoeffding inequality, union bounding over all possible sets Y, Y ′, Z, Z ′ as above. Indeed, notice that for fixed mY ,mY ′ ,mZ ,mZ′ (with, say, mY ≥ mY ′), and for each tuple Y, Y ′, Z, Z ′ such that |Y | = mY , |Y ′| = mY ′ , |Z| = mZ , |Z ′| = mZ′ , the probability that (12) is violated is at most\nexp{−C(p− q)2(mYmY ′ +mYmZ +mY ′mZ′)} (13)\nfor some C > 0. Using (10), this is at most\nexp{−C ′′(p− q)2(mYmY ′)} , (14)\nfor some global C ′′ > 0. Now notice that the number of possibilities to choose such a 4 tuple of sets is bounded above by exp{C ′′′mY log n}, for some global C ′′′ > 0. Assuming\nM ≥ Ĉ log n (p− q)2\n(15)\nfor some Ĉ, and applying a union bound over all possible combinations Y, Y ′, Z, Z ′ of sizes mY ,mY ′ ,mZ ,mZ′ respectively, of which there are at most exp{C◦mY log n} for some C◦ > 0, we conclude that (12) is violated for some combination with probability at most\nexp{−C ′′(p− q)2mYmY ′/2} (16)\nwhich is at most exp{−20 log n} if\nM ≥ Ĉ ′ log n\n(p− q)2 . (17)\nfor some Ĉ ′ > 0. Apply a union bound now over the possible combinations of the tuple (mY ,mY ′ ,mZ ,mZ′) , of which there are at most exp{4 log n} to conclude that (12) holds uniformly for all possibilities of Y, Y ′, Z, Z ′ with probability at least 1− n−4.\nNow assume by contradiction that φ is not an injection, so φ(i) = φ(i′) =: j for some distinct i, i′ ∈ [r]. Set Y = Ui∩Vj , Y ′ = Ui′ ∩Vj , Z = Ui \\Y, Z ′ = Ui′ \\Y ′. Note that max{|Z|, |Z ′|} ≤ m and min{|Y |, |Y ′|} ≥ M−m. Consider the solution (K ′, B′) whereK ′ is obtained fromK by replacing the two blocks corresponding to Ui, Ui′ with four blocks: Y, Y\n′, Z, Z ′. Inequality (12) guarantees that the cost of (K ′, B′) is strictly lower than that of (K,B), contradicting optimality of the latter. (Note that ‖K‖∗ = ‖K ′‖∗.)\nWe can now also conclude that r ≤ k. Fix i ∈ [r]. We show that not too many elements of Vφ(i) can be contained in V \\ {U1 ∪ · · · ∪ Ur}. We need the following assumption.\nAssumption 15. For all pairwise disjoint sets Y,X,Z ⊆ V such that |Y | ≥M −m, |X| ≥ m, (Y ∪X) ⊆ Vj for some j ∈ [k], |Z| ≤ m, Z ∩ Vj = ∅:\n|X| · |Y |d̂X,Y + ( |X| 2 ) d̂x,x − |Y | · |Z|d̂Y,Z >\nc2 c1 + c2 (|X| · |Y |+ ( |X| 2 ) − |Y | · |Z|) + |X| c1 + c2 . (18)\nThe assumption holds with probability at least 1 − n−4. To see why, first notice that |X|/(c1 + c2) ≤ 1 8 (p− q)|X| · |Y | by (3), as long as C2 is large enough. This implies that the RHS of (18) is upper bounded by (\np− 1 8\n(p− q) ) |X| · |Y |+ c2\nc1 + c ( ( |X| 2 ) − |Y | · |Z|) (19)\nProving that the LHS of (18) (denoted f(X,Y, Z)) is larger than (19) (denoted g(X,Y, Z)) uniformly w.h.p. can now be easily done as follows. By fixing mY = |Y |,mX = |X|, the number of combinations for Y,X,Z is at most exp{C(mY + mX) log n} for some global C > 0. On the other hand, the probability that f(X,Y, Z) ≤ g(X,Y, Z) for any such option is at most\nexp{−C ′′(p− q)2mYmX} (20)\nfor some C ′ > 0. Hence, by union bounding, the probability that some tuple Y,X,Z of sizes mY ,mX ,mZ respectively satisfies f(X,Y, Z) ≤ g(X,Y, Z) is at most\nexp{−C ′′(p− q)2mY /2} , (21)\nwhich is at most exp{−10 log n} assuming\nM ≥ C̄(log n)/(p− q)2 , (22)\nfor some C̄ > 0. Another union bound over the possible choices of mY ,mX ,mZ proves that (18) holds uniformly with probability at least 1− n−4.\nNow for some i ∈ [r] set X := Vφ(i) ∩ (V \\ {U1 ∪ · · · ∪ Ur}) and assume by contradiction that |X| > m. Set Y := Vφ(i)∩Ui and Z = Ui \\Vφ(i). Define the solution (K ′, B′) where K ′ is obtained from K by replacing the block corresponding to Ui in K with two blocks: Vφ(i) and Ui \\ Vφ(i). Assumption 15 tells us that the cost of (K ′, B′) is strictly lower than that of (K,B). Note that the expression |X|c1+c2 in the RHS of (18) accounts for the trace norm difference ‖K ′‖∗ − ‖K‖∗ = |X|.\nWe are prepared to perform the final “cleanup” step. At this point we know that for each i ∈ [r], the set Ti = Ui ∩ Vφ(i) satisfies\n|Ti| ≥ |Ui| −m |Ti| ≥ |Vj | − rm .\n(The second inequality is implied by the fact that at most m elements of Vφ(i) may be contained in Ui′ for i′ 6= i, and another at most m elements in V \\ (U1 ∪ · · · ∪ Ur). We are now going to conclude from this that Ui = Vφ(i) for all i. To that end, let (K\n′, B′) be the feasible solution to (CP1) defined so that K ′ is a partial clustering induced by Vφ(1), . . . , Vφ(r). We would like to argue that if K 6= K ′ then the cost of (K ′, B′) is strictly smaller than that of (K,B). Fix the value of the collection\nY := ((r, φ(1), . . . , φ(r),( mij := |Vφ(i) ∩ Uj |) ) i,j∈[r],i6=j ,(\nm′i := |Vφ(i) ∩ (V \\ (U1 ∪ · · · ∪ Ur)) ) i∈[r])\nLet β(Y) denote the number of i 6= j such that mij > 0 plus the number of i ∈ [r] such that mi > 0. We can assume β(Y) > 0, otherwise Ui = Vφ(i) for all i ∈ [r] as required. The number of possibilities for K and K ′ giving rise to Y is exp{C( ∑ i6=jmij + ∑ imi) log n} for some C > 0. (Note that K ′ depends on r, φ(1), . . . , φ(r) only, while K depends on all elements of Y). For each such possibility, the probability that the cost of (K,B) is lower than that of (K ′, B′) is at most\nexp{−C ′′(p− q)2M( ∑ ij mij + ∑ i mi)} (23)\nusing Hoeffding inequalities, for some C ′′ > 0. (Note that special care needs to be made to account for the difference ‖K‖∗ − ‖K ′‖∗ = ∑r i=1mi - this is similar to what we did above .) As long as\nM ≥ Ĉ†k(log n)/(p− q)2 (24)\nfor some Ĉ† > 0, we conclude that the cost of (K ′, B′) is at least that of (K,B) for some K giving rise to Y with probability at most exp{−10(k log n)β(Y)}. The number of combinations of Y for a fixed value of β(Y) is at most exp{5(k+ β(Y) log n}. By union bounding, we conclude that for fixed β(Y), the probability that some (K,B) has cost at most that of (K ′, B′) is at most exp{−10(k log n)β(Y)}. Finally union bound over all possibilities for β(Y), of which there are at most n2.\nTaking C1, C2 large enough to satisfy the requirements above concludes the proof."

Traditional results dictate that for an algorithm to provably correctly recover the clusters, all clusters must be sufficiently large (in particular, Ω̃( √ n) where n is the number of nodes of the graph). We show that this is not really a restriction: by a more refined analysis of the trace-norm based matrix recovery approach proposed in Jalali et al. [2011] and Chen et al. [2012], we prove that small clusters, under certain mild assumptions, do not hinder recovery of large ones. Based on this result, we further devise an iterative algorithm to recover almost all clusters via a “peeling strategy”, i.e., recover large clusters first, leading to a reduced problem, and repeat this procedure. These results are extended to the partial observation setting, in which only a (chosen) part of the graph is observed. The peeling strategy gives rise to an active learning algorithm, in which edges adjacent to smaller clusters are queried more often as large clusters are learned (and removed). From a high level, this paper sheds novel insights on high-dimensional statistics and learning structured data, by presenting a structured matrix learning problem for which a one shot convex relaxation approach necessarily fails, but a carefully constructed sequence of convex relaxations does the job.",
