This paper addresses the problem of learning a finite linear combination of infinite-dimensional operator-valued kernels which are suitable for extending functional data analysis methods to nonlinear contexts. We study this problem in the case of kernel ridge regression for functional responses with an ℓr-norm constraint on the combination coefficients (r ≥ 1). The resulting optimization problem is more involved than those of multiple scalar-valued kernel learning since operator-valued kernels pose more technical and theoretical issues. We propose a multiple operator-valued kernel learning algorithm based on solving a system of linear operator equations by using a block coordinatedescent procedure. We experimentally validate our approach on a functional regression task in the context of finger movement prediction in brain-computer interfaces.\nKey-words: Operator-valued kernels, multiple kernel learning, nonparametric functional data analysis, function-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.\n∗ Sequel Team, INRIA Lille.

      "text" : "During the past decades, a large number of algorithms have been proposed to deal with learning problems in the case of single-valued functions (e.g., binaryoutput function for classification or real output for regression). Recently, there has been considerable interest in estimating vector-valued functions [20, 5, 7]. Much of this interest has arisen from the need to learn tasks where the target is a complex entity, not a scalar variable. Typical learning situations include multi-task learning [11], functional regression [12], and structured output prediction [4].\nIn this paper, we are interested in the problem of functional regression with functional responses in the context of brain-computer interface (BCI) design. More precisely, we are interested in finger movement prediction from electrocorticographic signals [27]. Indeed, from a set of signals measuring brain surface electrical activity on d channels during a given period of time, we want to predict, for any instant of that period whether a finger is moving or not and the amplitude of the finger flexion. Formally, the problem consists in learning a functional dependency between a set of d signals and a sequence of labels (a step function indicating whether a finger is moving or not) and between the same set of signals and vector of real values (the amplitude function). While, it is clear that this problem can be formalized as functional regression problem, from our point of view, such problem can benefit from the multiple operator-valued kernel learning framework. Indeed, for these problems, one of the difficulties arises from the unknown latency between the signal related to the finger movement and the actual movement [22]. Hence, instead of fixing in advance some value for this latency in the regression model, our framework allows to learn it from the data by means of several operator-valued kernels.\nIf we wish to address functional regression problem in the principled framework of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we have to consider RKHSs whose elements are operators that map a function to another function space, possibly source and target function spaces being different. Working in such RKHSs, we are able to draw on the important core of work that has been performed on scalar-valued and vector-valued RKHSs [29, 20]. Such a functional RKHS framework and associated operator-valued kernels have been introduced recently [12, 13]. A basic question with reproducing kernels is how to build these kernels and what is the optimal kernel choice for a given application. In order to overcome the need for choosing a kernel before the learning process, several works have tried to address the problem of learning the scalar-valued kernel jointly with the decision function [17, 30]. Since these seminal works, many efforts have been carried out in order to theoretically analyze the kernel learning framework [9, 3] or in order to provide efficient algorithms [23, 1, 14]. While many works have been devoted to multiple scalar-valued kernel learning, this problem of kernel learning have been barely investigated for operator-valued kernels. One motivation of this work is to bridge the gap between multiple kernel learning (MKL) and operator-valued kernels by proposing a framework and an algorithm for learning a finite linear combination of operator-valued kernels. While each step of the scalar-valued MKL framework can be extended without major difficulties to operator-valued kernels, technical challenges arise at all stages because we deal with infinite dimensional spaces. It should be pointed out that in a recent work [10], the problem of learning the output kernel was\nRR n° 7900"

A problem encountered when working with operator-valued kernels in infinite-dimensional spaces is that of solving the system of linear operator equations (8). In the following we show how to solve this problem for two cases of operator-valued kernel combinations.\nCase 1: multiple scalar-valued kernels and one operator. This is the simpler case where the combination of operator-valued kernels has the following form\nK(w, z) =\nM∑\nk=1\ndkGk(w, z)T, (11)\nwhere Gk is a scalar-valued kernel, T is an operator in L(Gy), and dk are the combination coefficients.

Thus we can compute an analytic solution of the system of equations (8) by inverting K+ λI using the eigendecompositions of G and T as in [13].\nCase 2: multiple scalar-valued kernels and multiple operators.

Inverting the associated block operator kernel matrix K is not feasible in this case, that is why we propose a Gauss-Seidel iterative procedure (see Algorithm 2) to solve the system of linear operator equations (8).

The finger flexion of the subject was recorded at 25Hz and up-sampled to 1KHz by means of a data glove which measures the finger movement amplitude. Due to the acquisition process, a delay appears between the finger movement and the measured ECoG signal [21]. One of our hopes is that this time-lag can be properly learnt by means of multiple operator-valued kernels. Features from the ECoG signals are built by computing some band-specific amplitude modulation features, which is defined as the sum of the square of the band-specific filtered ECoG signal samples during a fixed time window.\nFor our finger movement prediction task, we have kept 5 channels that have been manually selected and split ECoG signals in portions of 200 samples.

      "text" : "lytically. While the inverses of the identity and the multiplication operators are easily and directly computable from the analytic expressions of the operators, the inverse of the integral operator is computed from its spectral decomposition as in [13]. The number of eigenfunctions as well as the regularization parameter λ are fixed using “one-curve-leave-out cross-validation” [26] with the aim of minimizing the residual sum of squares error.\nEmpirical results on the BCI dataset are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 . The dataset was randomly partitioned into 65% training and 35% test sets. We compare our approach in the case of ℓ1 and ℓ2-norm constraint on the combination coefficients with: (1) the baseline scalar-valued kernel ridge regression algorithm by considering each output independently of the others, (2) functional response ridge regression using an integral operator-valued kernel [13], (3) kernel ridge regression with an evenly-weighted sum of operator-valued kernels, which we denote by ℓ∞-norm MovKL.\nAs in the scalar case, using multiple operator-valued kernels leads to better results. By directly combining kernels constructed from identity, multiplication and integral operators we could reduce the residual sum of squares error and enhance the label classification accuracy. Best results are obtained using the MovKL algorithm with ℓ2-norm constraint on the combination coefficients. RSSE and LCR of the baseline kernel ridge regression are significantly outperformed by the operator-valued kernel based functional response regression. These results confirm that by taking into account the relationship between outputs we can improve performance. This is due to the fact that an operatorvalued kernel induces a similarity measure between two pairs of input/output."

Suppose h : C 7→ R is a proper lower semi-continuous function. Then h is bounded from below and has a minimizer on C.\nCorollary 3 Let H be a Hilbert space and h : H 7→ R is a strongly lower semicontinuous, convex and coercive function.

It is easy to note that h is continuous and convex. Besides, h is coercive for λ > 0 since ‖f‖2F is coercive and the sum involves only positive terms.

Gx and Gy are the Hilbert space L 2(Ω) which consists of all equivalence classes of square integrable functions on a finite set Ω, and F is a RKHS whose elements are continuous linear operators on Gx with values in Gy . K is the L(Gy)-valued reproducing kernel of F .\nSince Gx and Gy are functional spaces, to derive a “dual version” of problem (16) we use the method of Lagrange multipliers on Banach spaces which is suitable to solve certain infinite-dimensional constrained optimization problems. The method is a generalization of the classical method of Lagrange multipliers. The existence of Lagrangian multipliers for the problem (16) which involves an equality constraint is guaranteed by Theorem 4.1 1 in [15]. As consequence, the Lagrangian function associated to (16) is well defined and Fréchet-differentiable. Let α = (αi)i=1,...,n ∈ G n y the vector of functions containing the Lagrange multipliers, the Lagrangian function is given by\nL(f, α, ξ) = 1\n2 ‖f‖2F +\n1\n2nλ ‖ξ‖2Gny + 〈α, y − f(x)− ξ〉Gny , (17)\nwhere α = (α1, . . . , αn) ∈ G n y , y = (y1, . . . , yn) ∈ G n y , ξ = (ξ1, . . . , ξn) ∈ G n y ,\nf(x) = (f(x1), . . . , f(xn)) ∈ G n y , and ∀a, b ∈ G n y , 〈a, b〉Gny = n∑ i=1 〈ai, bi〉Gy .\nNow, we compute L′(f) the derivative of L(f, α, ξ) with respect to f using the Gâteaux derivative (generalization of the directional derivative) which can be defined for the direction h ∈ F by:\nDhL(f) = lim τ−→0\nL(f + τh) − L(f)\nτ 1This theorem considers only equality constraint, but it is a particular case of Theorem 3.1\nin [15] which deals with more general context.\nINRIA"

Thus, S(f) admits a unique minimizer.\nNow let us define the function g by:\ng(f) = min u {R(u, d(f))}.\nThe function g is continuous. This comes from the fact that the function:\nG(d) = min u {R(u, d)}\nis continuous. Indeed, G is the minimal of value of a functional response kernel ridge regression problem in a function-valued RKHS associated to an operatorvalued kernel K. So, G(d) = R(d, u∗) with u∗ = ( K(d) + λI )−1 y (see Equation (8)). u∗ is continuous, and hence G(d) is also continuous. By definition we have S(f) = R(f, d(f)), and since d(f) minimizes R(f, ·), we obtain that: S(f (n+1)) ≤ g(f (n)) ≤ S(f (n))\nwhere n is the number of iteration. So, the sequence {S(f (n)), n ∈ N} is nonincreasing and then it is bounded since L is bounded from below. Thus, as n −→ ∞, S(f (n)) converges to a number which we denote by S∗. {S(f (n))} is convergent and S is a coercive function, then the sequence {‖f (n)‖, n ∈ N} is bounded. Consequently, the sequence {f (n), n ∈ N} is bounded.\nNext we show the following subsequence convergence property which underlies the convergence of Algorithm 1.\nProposition 4 If F is a RKHS associated to a compact-operator-valued kernel, the sequence {f (n) ∈ F , n ∈ N}, since it is bounded, has a convergent subsequence.\nProof. The analogue of the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem2 in Hilbert spaces states that there exists a weakly convergent subsequence {f (nl), l ∈ N} of the bounded sequence {f (n)} which (weakly) converges to f ∈ F . By definition of weakly convergence, we have ∀g ∈ F (F is a RKHS with the operator-valued kernel K):\nlim nl→∞\n〈f (nl)(·), g〉F = 〈f(·), g〉F (21)\nLet g = K(x, ·)β. Using the reproducing property, we obtain\nlim nl→∞ 〈f (nl)(·), g〉F = lim nl→∞ 〈f (nl)(x), β〉Gy and 〈f(·), g〉F = 〈f(x), β〉Gy\n⇒ lim nl→∞\n〈f (nl)(x), β〉Gy = 〈f(x), β〉Gy using (21)\nThus the subsequence {f (nl)(·)} is (weakly) pointwise convergent. Now we show that:\nlim nl→∞\n‖f (nl)(·)‖F = ‖f(·)‖F (∗)\n2The Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem states that each bounded sequence in Rn has a convergent subsequence. For infinite-dimensional spaces, strong convergence of the subsequence is not reached and only weak convergence is obtained. Proposition 4 shows that strong convergence can be reached for the sequence {f(n), n ∈ N} solution of our MovKL optimization problem in Hilbert spaces with reproducing compact operator-valued kernels.\nINRIA"

This paper addresses the problem of learning a finite linear combination of infinite-dimensional operator-valued kernels which are suitable for extending functional data analysis methods to nonlinear contexts. We study this problem in the case of kernel ridge regression for functional responses with an lr-norm constraint on the combination coefficients (r ≥ 1). The resulting optimization problem is more involved than those of multiple scalar-valued kernel learning since operator-valued kernels pose more technical and theoretical issues. We propose a multiple operator-valued kernel learning algorithm based on solving a system of linear operator equations by using a block coordinatedescent procedure. We experimentally validate our approach on a functional regression task in the context of finger movement prediction in brain-computer interfaces. Key-words: Operator-valued kernels, multiple kernel learning, nonparametric functional data analysis, function-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. ∗ Sequel Team, INRIA Lille.

Notre méthode est basée sur la résolution d’un système d’équations linéaires d’opérateurs en utilisant une procédure de type Iterative Coordinate Descent. Nous validons expérimentalement notre approche sur un problème de prédiction de mouvement de doigt dans un contexte d’Interface Cerveau-Machine. Mots-clés : noyaux à valeurs opérateurs, apprentissage de noyaux multiples, analyse des données fonctionnelles, espace de Hilbert à noyau reproduisant Multiple Operator-valued Kernel Learning 3",
