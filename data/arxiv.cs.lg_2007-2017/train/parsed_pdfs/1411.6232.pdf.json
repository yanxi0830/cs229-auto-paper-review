      "text" : "IN many computer vision and pattern recognitionapplications, dimension of data representation is normally very high. Recent studies have claimed that not all features in the high-dimensional feature space are discriminative and informative, since many features are often noisy or correlated to each other, which will deteriorate the performances of subsequent data analysing tasks [1] [2] [3]. Consequently, feature selection is utilized to select a subset of features from the original high dimensional feature space [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]. It has twofold functions in enhancing performances of learning tasks. First, feature selection eliminates noisy and redundant information to get a better representation, thus facilitating classification and clustering tasks. Second, dimension of selected feature space becomes much lower, which makes the subsequent computation more efficient. Inspired by the motivations, much progress has been made to feature selection during last few years. According to availability of class labels of training data, feature selection algorithms fall into two\nXiaojun Chang and Yi Yang are with School of Information Technology and Electric Engineering, The University of Queensland, Australia.(email: cxj273@gmail.com, yi.yang@uq.edu.au).\ngroups, i.e. supervised feature selection and unsupervised feature selection. Supervised feature selection algorithms, for example, Fisher Score [9], only use labeled training data for feature selection. With sufficient labeled training samples, supervised feature selection is reliable to train appropriate feature selection functions because of utilization of class labels. However, labeling a large amount of training samples manually is unrealistic in real-world applications. Recent works on semi-supervised learning have indicated that it is beneficial to leverage both labeled and unlabeled training data for data analysis. Motivated by the progress of semi-supervised learning, much research attention has been paid to semi-supervised feature selection. For example, Zhao et al. propose a semi-supervised feature selection algorithm based on spectral analysis. A common limitation of the existing supervised and semi-supervised feature selection algorithms is that they evaluate the importance of each feature individually, ignoring correlations between different features. To address this problem, some stateof-the-art algorithms are proposed to take feature correlations into consideration for feature selection. For example, [10] and [3] implement their methods in a supervised way and Ma et al. design their approach in a semi-supervise way in [5]. Another limitation of current feature selection algorithms is that they select features for each task individually, which fails to mine correlations among multiple related tasks. Recent researches have indicated that it is beneficial to learn multiple related tasks jointly [11] [12] [13]. Motivated by this fact, multi-task learning has been introduced to the field of multimedia. For instance, Yang et al. present a novel feature selection algorithm which leverages shared information from related tasks in [6]. Nevertheless, they design their algorithm in a supervised way. The semi-supervised algorithm proposed in this paper combines the strengths of semi-supervised feature selection and multi-task learning. Both labeled and unlabeled training data are utilized for feature selection. Meanwhile, correlations between different features are taken into consideration to improve the performance of feature selection.\nWe illustrate how the proposed algorithm works for video classification in Figure 1. First, we represent all the training and testing videos as feature vectors. Then, sparse coefficients are learnt by exploiting relationships among different features and levearging knowledge frommultiple related tasks. After selecting the most representative features, we can apply the sparse coefficients to the feature vectors of the testing videos for classification.\nWe name our proposed algorithm Semi-supervised Feature selection by Mining Correlations among multiple tasks (SFMC). The main contributions of our work can be summarized as follows:\n1) We combine semi-supervised feature selection and multi-task learning into a single framework, which can select the most representative features with an insufficient amount of labeled training data per task. 2) To explore correlations among multimedia data, we leverage the benefit of manifold learning into our framework. 3) Since the objective function is non-smooth and difficult to solve, a fast iterative algorithm to obtain the optimal solution is proposed. Experimental results on convergence demonstrate that the proposed algorithm converges within very few iterations.\nThe rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the overview of the related work. A novel Semi-supervised Feature Selection by Mining Correlations among multiple tasks is proposed in section 3. We present our experimental results in section 4. The conclusion of our work is discussed in section 5."

      "text" : "Previous works have claimed that feature selection is capable of selecting the most representative features, thus facilitating subsequent data analysing tasks [14] [15] [16]. Existing feature selection algorithms are designed in various ways. Classical feature selection algorithms, such as Fisher Score [9], evaluate the weights of all features, rank them accordingly and select the most discriminating features one by one [17]. Although these classical feature selection algorithms gain good performances in different applications, they have three main limitations. First, they only use labeled\n3 training data to exploit the correlations between features and labels for feature selection. Labeling a large amount of training data consumes a lot of human labor in real-world applications. Second, the most representative features are selected one by one, thus ignoring the correlations among different features. Third, they select features for each task independently, which fails to leverage the knowledge shared by multiple related tasks. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, researchers have proposed multiple feature selection algorithms. l2,1-norm regularization has been widely used in feature selection algorithms for its capability of selecting features across all data points with joint sparsity. For example, Zhao et al. propose an algorithm which selects features jointly based on spectral regression with l2,1-norm constraint in [18]. Nie et al. adopt l2,1-norm on both regularization term and loss function in [10]. Yang et al. propose to select features by leveraging shared knowledge from multiple related tasks in [6]. However, their algorithms are all designed in a supervised way."

With semi-supervised learning, unlabeled training data can be exploited to learn data structure, which can save human labor cost for labeling a large amount of training data [25], [26], [27], [28]. Hence, semi-supervised learning is beneficial in terms of both the human laboring cost and data analysis performance. Graph Laplacian based semi-supervised learning has gained increasing interest for its simplicity and efficiency. Nie et al. propose a manifold learning framework based on graph Laplacian and compared its performance with other state-of-the-art semi-supervised algorithms in [29]. Ma et al. propose a semi-supervised feature selection algorithm built upon manifold learning in [5]. In [30], Yang et al. propose a new semisupervised algorithm based on a robust Laplacian matrix for relevance feedback. Their algorithm has demonstrated its prominent performance. Therefore, we propose to leverage it in our feature selection framework. These previous works, however, independently select features for each task, which fails to consider correlations among multiple related tasks."

      "heading" : "3.1 Problem Formulation",
      "text" : "Suppose we are going to select features for t tasks. The l-th task contains nl training data with ml data labeled. We can formulate the regularized framework for feature selection as follows:\nmin Wl\nt∑\nl=1\n(loss(Wl) + αg(Wl)) + γΩ(W ), (1)\nwhere Wl is feature selection matrix for the l-th task, W = [W1, · · · ,Wt], loss(Wl) is the loss function which evaluates consistency between features and labels, g(Wl) is a regularization function, Ω(W ) is a regularization term which is used to encode the common components of different feature selection functions, α and γ are regularization parameters. To step further, we first give the definitions of Frobenius norm and trace norm. Given an arbitrary matrix M ∈ Ra×b where a and b are arbitrary numbers, its Frobenius norm is defined as ‖M‖F . The definition of its l2,1-norm is:\n‖M‖2,1 = a∑\ni=1\n√√√√ b∑\nj=1\nM2ij , (2)\nand the definition of its trace norm is:\n‖M‖∗ = Tr(MM T )\n1 2 , (3)\nwhere Tr(·) denotes the trace operator. In the literature, there are many approaches to define the loss function. Following the works in [5] [6], we adopt the least square loss function for its simplicity and efficiency. Recent works [10] [17] claim that minimizing the regularization term ‖Wl‖2,1 makes Wl sparse, which demonstrates that Wl is especially suitable for feature selection. Motivated by the works in [32] [6], we propose to leverage shared knowledge among multiple related tasks by minimizing the trace norm of W . The objective function is given by:\n4 min Wl t∑\nl=1\n(loss(Wl) + α‖Wl‖2,1) + γ‖W‖∗ (4)\nState-of-the-art feature selection algorithms are implemented through supervised learning and select features for each task independently. In our work, we want to incorporate multi-task learning and semisupervised learning into (1). We propose to leverage semi-supervised learning by adopting the Laplacian proposed in [30]. We adopt this Laplacian because it exploits both manifold structure and local discriminant information of multimedia data, thus resulting in better performance. To begin with, let us define Xl = [x 1 l , · · · , x nl l ] as the training data matrix of the l-th task where ml data are labeled and nl is the total number of the training data of the l-th task. xil ∈ R\nd is the i-th datum of the l-th task. Yl = [y 1 l , · · · , y ml l , y ml+1 l , · · · , y nl l ] T ∈ {0, 1}nl×cl is the label matrix and cl denotes class number of the l-th task. yil | nl i=1 ∈ R\ncl is the label vector with cl classes. Yli,j = 1 if x i l is in the j-th class of the l-th task while Yli,j = 0 otherwise. For unlabeled datum x i l , y i l is set to a zero vector. For any d, we define 1d ∈ Rd as a column vector with all the elements equal to 1, Hd = I − 1d1d1 T d ∈ R\nd×d as a matrix for centering the data by subtracting the mean of the data. Note that Hd = HTd = HdHd. For each data point x i l of the l-th task, we construct a local clique Nlk containing xil and its k− 1 nearest neighbors. Euclidean distance is used to determine whether two given data points are within k nearest neighbors in the original feature space. Gil = {i0l , i 1 l , · · · , i k−1 l } is index set of samples in Nlk. Sli denotes selection matrix with its elements (Sli)pq = 1 if p = Gil{q} and (Sli)pq = 0 otherwise. Inspired by [30], we construct the Laplacian matrix by exploiting both manifold structure and local discriminant information. Denoting Lli = Hk(X T l Xl + λI)−1Hk, we compute the Laplacian matrix L as follows:\nLl =\nnl∑\ni=1\nSliLliS T li\n= [Sl1, · · · , Slnl ]\n  Ll1\n· · · Llnl\n  [Sl1, · · · , Slnl ]T .\n(5) Note that Manifold Regularization is able to explore the manifold structure possessed by multimedia data [29] [33] [34]. By applying Manifold Regularization to the loss function in (1), we have\nargmin W,b\nt∑\nl=1\nTr(WTXlLlX T l W ) + α(‖Wl‖2,1\n+β‖XTlLWl + 1nlb T l − YlL‖ 2 F )) + γ‖W‖∗,\n(6)\nwhere Tr(·) denotes trace operator, XlL and YlL are\nlabeled training data and corresponding ground truth labels of the l-th task. To make all labels of training data contribute to the optimization of Wl, we introduce a predicted label matrix Fl = [fl1, · · · , fln l ] ∈ Rnl×cl for the training data of the l-th task. fli ∈ Rcl is the predicted label vector of xli. According to [19] [5], Fl can be obtained as follows:\nargmin Fl\nTr(FTl LlFl) + Tr((Fl − Yl) TUl(Fl − Yl)), (7)\nwhere Ul is the selection diagonal matrix of the l-th task. The diagonal element Ulii = ∞ if xli is labeled and Ulii = 1 otherwise. In the experiments, 10\n6 is used to approximate ∞. Following the work in [5], we incorporate (7) into (6). At the same time, all the training data and corresponding labels are taken into consideration. Therefore, the objective function finally arrives at:\nmin Fl,Wl,bl\nt∑\nl=1\n(Tr[(Fl − Yl) TUl(Fl − Yl)] + Tr(F T l LlFl)\n+α(‖Wl‖2,1 + β‖X T l Wl + 1nlb T l − Fl‖ 2 F )) + γ‖W‖∗ (8) From (8) we can see that the proposed algorithm is capable of evaluating the informativeness of all features jointly for each task with the l2,1-norm and the information from different tasks can be transferred from one to another with the trace norm."

These categories can be categorized into five groups: 1) General facial actions, 2) Facial actions with object manipulation, 3) General body movements, 4) Body movements with object interaction, 5) Body movements for human interaction. Therefore, in this experiment, the five groups are considered as five different tasks. Heng et al. claim that motion boundary histograms (MBH) is an efficient way to suppress camera motion in [40] and thus it is used to process the videos. A 2000 dimension Bag-of-Words feature is generated to represent the original data. We set the number of selected features as {1000, 1200, · · · , 1800, 2000} for all the algorithms and report the best results. Table 4 shows the experiment results of human motion recognition. From Table 4, we observe that our method outperforms other compared algorithms. This experiment can further provide evidence that our algorithm is more advantageous with insufficient number of labeled training data."

There are five different types of actions in this database, including boxing, gesturing, walking, throw-catch and jogging. Following the work in [41] [42], we randomly select 10, 000 samples of two subjects (5, 000 per subject). We encode each action as a collection of 16 joint coordinates in 3D space and obtain a 48-dimensional feature vector. Joint Relative Features between different joints are computed on top of that, resulting a feature vector with 120 dimensions. We combine the two kinds of feature vectors and get a 168-dimensional feature. In this experiment, we consider the two subjects as two different tasks. The number of selected features are tuned from {100, 110, · · · , 160}. The experiment results are shown in Table 5. Table 5 gives detailed results when 1%, 5% and 10% training\n8\ndata are labeled.

Following the above experiments, 1%, 5%, 10%, 25%, 50% and 100% training data are labeled in this experiment. We show the experiment results in Figure 2. We can observe that our method consistently outperforms\nboth LSDF and SFSS. Visible advantages are gained when only few training data are labeled, such as 1% or 5% labeled training data. From this result, we can conclude that it is beneficial to leverage shared information from other related tasks when insufficient number of training data are labeled."

It can be seen that the performance\n9\nof our algorithm varies when the parameters (α and β) change. More specifically, MAP is higher when α and β are comparable. Then, α and β are fixed. Figure 4 shows the parameter sensitivity results. Note that the shared information among multiple feature selection functions {W1, · · · ,Wt} by the parameter γ. From this figure, we can see that mining correlations between multiple related tasks is beneficial to improve the performance. We can also notice that better performances are gained when the number of features is around 3500 and 4000."

      "text" : "In this paper, we have proposed a new semisupervised feature analysis method. This method is able to mine correlations between different features and leverage shared information between multiple related tasks. Since the proposed objective function is non-smooth and difficult to solve, we propose an\n10\niterative and effective algorithm. To evaluate performances of the proposed method, we apply it to different applications, including video classification, image annotation, human motion recognition and 3D motion data analysis. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the other compared algorithms for different applications."

Instead of independently computing the importance of features for each task, our algorithm leverages shared knowledge from multiple related tasks, thus, improving the performance of feature selection. Note that we build our algorithm on assumption that different tasks share common structures. The proposed algorithm selects features in a batch mode, by which the correlations between different features are taken into consideration. Besides, considering the fact that labeling a large amount of training data in real world is both time-consuming and tedious, we adopt manifold learning which exploits both labeled and unlabeled training data for feature space analysis. Since the objective function is non-smooth and difficult to solve, we propose an iterative algorithm with fast convergence. Extensive experiments on different applications demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms other state-of-the-art feature selection algorithms.",
