      "text" : "Essential to the success of machine learning on a new domain is determining a good “similarity function” between objects (or alternatively defining good object “features”). With such a “kernel,” one can perform a number of interesting tasks, e.g. binary classification using Support Vector Machines, clustering, interactive database search, or any of a number of other off-the-shelf kernelized applications. Since this step of determining a kernel is most often the step that is still not routinized, effective systems for achieving this step\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 28 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Bellevue, WA, USA, 2011. Copyright 2011 by the author(s)/owner(s).\nare desirable as they hold the potential for completely removing the machine learning researcher from “the loop.” Such systems could allow practitioners with no machine learning expertise to employ learning on their domain. In many domains, people have a good sense of what similarity is, and in these cases the similarity function may be determined based upon crowdsourced human responses alone.\nThe problem of capturing and extrapolating a human notion of perceptual similarity has received increasing attention in recent years including areas such as vision (Agarwal et al., 2007), audition (McFee & Lanckriet, 2009), information retrieval (Schultz & Joachims, 2003) and a variety of others represented in the UCI Datasets (Xing et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2010). Concretely, the goal of these approaches is to estimate a similarity matrix K over all pairs of n objects given a (potentially exhaustive) subset of human perceptual measurements on tuples of objects. In some cases the set of human measurements represents ‘side information’ to computed descriptors (MFCC, SIFT, etc.), while in other cases – the present work included – one proceeds exclusively with human reported data. When K is a positive semidefinite matrix induced purely from distributed human measurements, we refer to it as the crowd kernel for the set of objects.\nGiven such a Kernel, one can exploit it for a variety of purposes including exploratory data analysis or embedding visualization (as in Multidimensional Scaling) and relevance-feedback based interactive search. As discussed in the above works and (Kendall & Gibbons, 1990), using a triplet based representation of relative similarity, in which a subject is asked “is object\nar X\niv :1\n10 5.\n10 33\nv2 [\ncs .L\nG ]\n2 5\na more similar to b or to c,” has a number of desirable properties over the classical approach employed in Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), i.e., asking for a numerical estimate of “how similar is object a to b.” These advantages include reducing fatigue on human subjects and alleviating the need to reconcile individuals’ scales of similarity. The obvious drawback with the triplet based method, however, is the potential O(n3) complexity. It is therefore expedient to seek methods of obtaining high quality approximations of K from as small a subset of human measurements as possible. Accordingly, the primary contribution of this paper is an efficient method for estimating K via an information theoretic adaptive sampling approach.\nAt the heart of our approach is a new scale-invariant Kernel approximation model. The choice of model is shown to be crucial in terms of the adaptive triples that are produced, and the new model produces effective triples to label. Although this model is nonconvex, we prove that it can be optimized under certain assumptions.\nWe construct an end-to-end system for interactive visual search and browsing using our Kernel acquisition algorithm. The input to this system is a set of images of objects, such as products available in an online store. The system automatically crowdsources1 the\n1Crowdsourcing was done on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, http://mturk.com.\nkernel acquisition and then uses this kernel to produce a visual interface for searching or browsing the set of products.

      "text" : "The bulk of work in Machine Learning focuses on “Machine Kernels” that are computed by computer from the raw data (e.g., pixels) themselves. Additional work employs human experiments to try to learn kernels based upon machine features, i.e., to approximate the human similarity assessments based upon features that can be derived by machine. In contrast, when a kernel is learned from human subjects alone (whether it be data from an individual or a crowd) one requires no machine features whatsoever. To the computer, the objects are recognized by ID’s only – the images themselves are hidden from our system and are only presented to humans.\nThe primary advantage of machine kernels is that they can generalize immediately to new data, whereas each additional object needs to be added to our system, for a cost of approximately $0.15.2 On the other hand, working with a human kernel has two primary advantages. First, it does not require any domain expertise. While for any particular domain, such as music or images of faces, cars, or sofas, decades of research may have provided high-quality features, one does not have to find, implement, and tune these sophisticated feature detectors.\nSecond, human kernels contain features that are simply not available with state-of-the-art feature detectors, because of knowledge and experience that humans possess. For example, from images of celebrities, human similarity may be partly based on whether the two celebrities are both from the same profession, such as politicians, actors, and so forth. Until the longstanding goal of bridging the semantic gap is achieved, humans will be far better than machines at interpreting certain features, such as “does a couch look comfortable,” “can a shoe be worn to an informal occasion,” or “is a joke funny.”\nWe give a simple demonstration of external knowledge through experiments on 26 images of the lower-case Roman alphabet. Here, the learned Kernel is shown to capture features such as “is a letter a vowel versus consonant,” which uses external knowledge beyond the pixels. Note that this experiment is interesting in itself\n2This price was empirically observed to yield “good performance” across a number of domains. See the experimental results section for evaluation criteria.\nbecause it is not at first clear if people can meaningfully answer the question: “is the letter e more similar to i or p.” Our experiments show statistically significant consistency with 58%3(±2%, with 95% confidence) agreement between users on a random triple of letters. (For random image triples from an online tie store, 68% agreement is observed, and 65% is observed for floor tile images)."

      "text" : "We first give high-level intuition for why adaptively choosing triples may yield better kernel approximations than randomly chosen triples. Consider n objects organized in a rooted tree with ` n leaves, inspired by, say, phylogenic trees involving animal species.4 Say the similarity between objects is decreasing in their distance in the tree graph and, furthermore, that objects are drawn uniformly at random from the classes represented by the leaves of the tree. Ignoring the details of how one would identify that two objects are in the same leaf or subtree, it is clear that a nonadaptive method would have to ask Ω(n`) questions to determine the leaves to which n objects belong (or at least to determine which objects are in the same leaves), because an expected Ω(`) queries are required per object until just a second object is chosen from the same leaf. On the other hand, in an ideal setting, an adaptive approach might determine such matters using O(n log `) queries in a balanced binary tree, proceeding from the root down, assuming a constant number of comparisons can determine to which subtree of a node an object belongs, hence an exponential savings."

Their particular fitting algorithm differs in\n3While this fraction of agreement seems small, it corresponds to about 25% “noise,” e.g., if 75% of people would say that a is more like b then c, then two random people would agree with probability 0.752 = 0.56.\n4This example is based upon a tree metric rather than a Euclidean one. However, note that any tree with ` leaves can be embedded in `-dimensional Euclidean space, where squared Euclidean distance equals tree distance.\nthat it is based on a max-margin approach, which is more common in the kernel learning literature.\nThere is a wealth of work in active learning for classification, where a learner selects examples from a pool of unlabeled examples to label. A number of approaches have been employed, and our work is in the same spirit as those that employ probabilistic models and information-theoretic measures to maximize information. Other work often labels examples based on those that are closest to the margin or closest to 50% probability of being positive or negative. To see why this latter approach may be problematic in our setting, one could imagine a set of triples where we have accurately learned that the answer is 50/50, e.g., as may be the case if a, b, and c bear no relation to each other or if they are identical. One may not want to focus on such triples."

For a, b, c ∈ [n], a comparison or triple is of the form, “is a more similar to b or to c.” We refer to a as the head of the triple. We write pabc for the probability that a random crowd member rates a as more similar to b, so pabc + p a cb = 1. The n objects are assumed to have d-dimensional Euclidean representation, and hence the data can be viewed as a matrix M ∈ Rn×d, where Ma denotes the row corresponding to a, and the similarity matrix K ∈ Rn×n is defined by Kab = Ma ·Mb, or equivalently K = MMT . The goal is to learn M or, equivalently, learn K. (It is easy to go back and forth between positive semidefinite (PSD) K and M , though M is only unique up to change of basis.) Also equivalent is the representation in terms of distances, d2(a, b) = Kaa − 2Kab +Kbb.\nIn our setting, an MDS algorithm takes as input m comparisons (a1b1c1, y1) . . .

Unless explicitly stated, we will often omit yi and assume that the bi and ci have been permuted, if necessary, so that ai was rated as more similar to bi than ci. The MDS algorithm outputs an embedding M ∈ Rn×d for some d ≥ 1. A probabilistic MDS model predicts p̂abc based on Ma, Mb, and Mc. The empirical log-loss of a model that predicts p̂aibici is 1/m ∑ i log 1/p̂ ai bici\n. Our probabilistic MDS model attempts to minimize empirical log loss subject to some regularization constraint. We choose a probabilistic model due to its suitability for use in combination with our information-gain criteria for selecting adaptive triples, and also due to the fact that the same triple may elicit different answers from different peo-\nple (or the same person on different occasions).\nAn active MDS algorithm chooses each triple, aibici, adaptively based upon previous labels (a1b1c1, y1),. . .,(ai−1bi−1ci−1, yi−1).

      "text" : "The relative similarity model is motivated by the scaleinvariance observed in many perceptual systems (see,\ne.g., Chater & Brown, 1999). Let δab = ‖Ma−Mb‖2 = Kaa + Kbb − 2Kab. A simple scale-invariant proposal takes p̂abc = δac δab+δac . Such a model must also be regularized or else it would have Θ(n2) degrees of freedom. One may regularize by the rank of K or by setting Kii = 1. Due to the scale-invariance of the model, however, this latter constraint does not have reduced complexity. In particular, note that halving or doubling the matrix M doesn’t change any probabilities. Hence, descent algorithms may lead to very small, large, or numerically unstable solutions. To address this, we modify the model as follows, for distinct a, b, c:\np̂abc = µ+ δac\n2µ+ δab + δac and Kii = 1, (1)\nfor some parameter µ > 0. Alternatively, this change may be viewed as an additional assumption imposed on the previous model – we suppose each object possesses a minimal amount of “uniqueness,” µ > 0, such that K = µI + T , where T 0. We fit the model by local optimization performed directly on M (with random initialization), and high-quality adaptive triples are produced even for low dimensions.5 Here µ serves a purpose similar to a margin constraint.\nThere are two interesting points to make about our choice of model. First, the loss is not convex in K, so there is a concern that local optimization may be susceptible to local minima. In Section 6.1, we state a theorem which explains why this does not seem to be a significant problem. Second, in Section 6.2, we discuss a simple convex alternative based on logistic regression, and we explain why this model, in combination with our adaptive selection criterion, gives rise to poor adaptively-selected triples."

      "text" : "The idea is to capture the uncertainty about the location of an object through a probability distribution over points in Rd, and then to ask the question that maximizes information gain. Given a set of previous comparisons of n objects, we generate, for each object a = 1, 2, . . . , n, a new triple to compare a to, as follows. First, we embed the objects into Rd as described above, using the available comparisons. Initially, we use a seed of randomly selected triples for this purpose. Later, we use all available comparisons - the initial random ones and those acquired adaptively.\n5For high-dimensional problems, we perform a gradient projection descent on K. In particular, starting with K0 = I, we compute Kt+1 = ΠB(K\nt − η∇L(K)) for step-size η (see Preliminaries for the definition of ΠB).\nNow, say the crowd has previously rated a as more similar to bi than ci, for i = 1, 2, . . . , j−1, and we want to generate the jth query, (a, bj , cj) (this is a slight abuse of notation because we don’t know which of bj or cj will be rated as closer to a). These observations imply a posterior distribution of τ(x) ∝ π(x) ∏ i p̂ x bici over x ∈ Rd, where x is the embedding of a, and π(x) is a prior distribution, to be described shortly.\nGiven any candidate query for objects in the database b and c, the model predicts that the crowd will rate a as more similar to b than c with probability\np ∝ ∫ x δ(x,c) δ(x,b)+δ(x,c)τ(x)dx. If it rates a more similar to b than c then x has a posterior distribution of τb(x) ∝ τ(x) δ(x,c)δ(x,b)+δ(x,c) , and τc(x) (of similar form) otherwise. The information gain of this query is defined to be H(τ)− pH(τb)− (1− p)H(τa), where H(·) is the entropy of a distribution. This is equal to the mutual information between the crowd’s selection and x. The algorithm greedily selects a query, among all pairs b, c 6= a, which maximizes information gain. This can be somewhat computationally intensive (seconds per object in our datasets), so for efficiency we take the best pair from a sample of random pairs.\nIt remains to explain how we generate the prior π. We take π to be the uniform distribution over the set of points in M . Hence, the process can be viewed as follows. For the purpose of generating a new triple, we pretend the coordinates of all other objects are perfectly known, and we pretend that the object in question, a, is a uniformly random one of these other objects. The chosen pair is designed to maximize the information we receive about which object it is, given the observations we already have about a. The hope is that, for sufficiently large data sets, such a data-driven prior is a reasonable approximation to the actual distribution over data. Another natural alternative prior would be a multinormal distribution fit to M ."

However, empirically it performs poorly in terms of deciding which triples to ask. Note that the logistic model (and any generalized linear model) will select extreme comparisons, where the inner products are as large as possible. To give an intuitive understanding, suppose that hair length was a single feature and one wanted to determine whether a person has hair length x or x+1. The logistic model would compare that person to a bald person (x = 0) and a person with hair length 2x+1, while the relative model would ideally compare him to people with hair lengths x and x+ 1."

On the one hand, it seems purest in form to give the users carte blanche and ask only, “is a more similar to b than c.” On the other hand, in feedback users complained about these tasks and often asked what we meant by similarity. Moreover, different users will inevitably weigh different features differently when performing comparisons.\nFor example, consider a comparisons of face images, where a is a white male, b is a black male, and c is a white female. Some users will consider gender more important in determining skin color, and others may feel the opposite is true. Others may feel that the question is impossible to answer. Consider phrasing the question as follows, “At a distance, who would you be more likely to mistake for a: b or c?” For any two people, there is presumably some distance at which one might be mistaken for the other, so the question may seem more possible to answer for some people. Second, users may more often agree that skin color is more important than gender, because both are easily identified close up by skin color may be identifiable even at a great distance. While we haven’t done experiments to determine the importance of question phrasing, anecdotal evidence suggests that users enjoy the tasks more when more specific definitions of similarity are given.\nTwo natural goals of question phrasing might be: (1) to align users in their ranking of the importance of different features and (2) to align user similarity notions with the goals of the task at hand. For example, if the task is to find a certain person, the question, “which two people are most likely to be (genealogically) related to one another,” may be poor because\nusers may overlook features such as gender and age. In our experiments on neckties, for example, the task was titled “Which ties are most similar?” and the complete instructions were: “Someone went shopping at a tie store and wanted to buy the item on top, but it was not available.

For the 20 Questions (20Q) metric, two independent parts of the system are employed, an evaluator and a guesser. First, the evaluator randomly and secretly selects an object in the database, x. The guesser is aware of the database but not of which item x has been selected. The guesser is allowed to query 20 triples (as in the game “20 Questions”) with head x, after which it produces a ranking of items in the database, from most to least likely. Then the evaluator reveals the identity of x and hence its position in the ordered ranking, as well. The metric is the average log of the position of the random target item in this list. The log reflects the idea that the position of lower-ranked objects is less import – it weights moving an object from position 2 to 4 as important as moving an object from position 20 to 40. This metric is meant to roughly capture performance, but of course in a real system users may not have the patience to click on twenty pairs of images and may prefer to have fewer clicks but use larger comparison sets.

Following the analysis of Zinkevich (Zinkevich, 2003) we consider the potential equal to the squared distance (wt−w∗)2 and argue that it decreases whenever we have substantial error. Let ∇t = ∇`t(wt) ∈ Rd, which is,\n∇t = xt + x\n′ t\nwt · xt + wt · x′t − yt xt wt · xt\n− (1− yt) x′t\nwt · x′t .\nBy the triangle inequality ‖∇t‖ ≤ G for G = 2α . Now, as Zinkevich points out, due to convexity of W , (w − ΠW (v))\n2 ≤ (w − v)2 for any v ∈ Rd and w ∈ W . Hence,\n(w∗ − wt+1)2 ≤ (w∗ − wt + η∇t)2.\nThus the decrease in potential, call it ∆t = (w ∗ − wt) 2 − (w∗ − wt+1)2, is at least:\n∆t ≥ (w∗ − wt)2 − (w∗ − wt + η∇t)2\n= 2η∇t · (wt − w∗)− η2∇2t .\nNext, we consider the quantity, E[∆t · w∗], where the expectation is taken over the random yt (fixing y1, y2, . . . , yt−1). By expansion, the expectations is:\nw∗ · xt + w∗ · x′t w · xt + w · x′t −pt(w∗) w∗ · xt wt · xt −(1−pt(w∗)) w∗ · x′t wt · x′t .\nAfter simple algebraic manipulation, which is difficult to show in two-column format, we have,\nE[∆t · w∗] = −Zt(pt(w∗)− pt(wt))2 where\nZt = (wt · xt + wt · x′t)(w∗ · xt + w∗ · x′t)\n(wt · xt)(wt · x′t) .\nAlso note that ∆t · wt = 0 regardless of yt. Hence, E[∆t ·wt] = 0. Combining these with the fact that we have shown that ∆t ≥ 2η∇t · (wt −w∗)− η2G2, gives,\nE[∆t] ≥ 2ηZt(pt(w∗)− pt(wt))2 − η2G2\n≥ 2ηw ∗ · xt + w∗ · x′t wt · xt + wt · x′t (pt(wt)− pt(w∗))2 pt(wt)(1− pt(wt)) − η2G ≥ 2ηα (pt(wt)− pt(w ∗))2\npt(wt)(1− pt(wt)) − η2G.\nIn the last line we have used the fact that w ·x ∈ [α, 1] for w ∈ W,x ∈ X. Now, by Lemma 2 which follows this proof,\n`t(wt)− `t(w∗) ≤ (pt(wt)− pt(w∗))2\npt(wt)(1− pt(wt)) .\nCombining the previous two displayed equations gives,\nE[∆t] ≥ 2ηα(`t(wt)− `t(w∗))− η2G.\nFinally, since the potential (wt − w∗)2 > 0, we have∑ ∆t ≤ (w0 − w∗)2 ≤ 4. Hence,∑\nt\n`t(wt)− `t(w∗) ≤ Tη2G+ 4\n2ηα .\nSubstituting G = 2/α gives the lemma.\nLemma 2. Let p+ q = 1 and p∗ + q∗ = 1 for p, p∗ ∈ [0, 1]. Then,\np∗ log p∗\np + q∗ log\nq∗ q ≤ (p− p ∗)2 pq .\nProof. By concavity of log, Jensen’s inequality implies,\np∗ log p∗\np + q∗ log\nq∗\nq ≤ log (p\n∗)2 p + (q∗)2 q .\nSimple algebraic manipulation shows that,\n(p∗)2\np +\n(q∗)2\nq = 1 +\n(p− p∗)2\npq .\nFinally, the fact that log 1 + x ≤ x completes the lemma.\nA.3. Proof\nTo prove theorem 1, map matrix S ∈ Rn×n to a vector w(S) ∈ R1+n2 consisting of the constant µ + 2 in the first coordinate followed by the n2 entries of S. Taken over the set of symmetric S 0 such that Sii = 1,\nthe vectors w(S) for a compact convex set of radius√ n2 + (2 + µ)2. Also,\npatbtct = µ+ 2−Kac −Kca\n2µ+ 4−Kab −Kba −Kac −Kca ,\nis our relative regression model for w = w(S), x ∈ R1+n2 being the vector with a 1 is the first position and -1’s in the positions corresponding to the ac and ca entries of S (and zero elsewhere), and x′ having a 1 in the first position and -1’s in the positions corresponding to ab and ba (and zero elsewhere). The inner product of w(S) and x is µ + δab and hence is bounded. To apply Lemma 1, one must scale w(S) and x, x′ down. However, it is clear that for any and T sufficiently large, setting η = 1/ √ T in Lemma 1 gives the necessary bound."
