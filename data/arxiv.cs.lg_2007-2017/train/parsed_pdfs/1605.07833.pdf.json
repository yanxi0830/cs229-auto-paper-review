      "text" : "Blind Source Separation (BSS) is a well-known and well-studied field in the adaptive signal processing and machine learning [6,7,10,5,16,20]. The problem is to recover original and unknown sources from a set of mixtures recorded in an unknown environment. The term blind refers to the fact that both the sources and the mixing environment are unknown.\nSeveral well-performing approaches exist when the mixing environment is instantaneous [7,3], while some problems still arise in convolutive environments [2,4,17]. Different approaches were proposed to solve BSS in linear and instantaneous environment. Some of these approaches perform separation by using high order statistics (HOS) while others exploit information theoretic (IT) measures [6]. One of the well-know algorithms in this latter class is the InfoMax one proposed by Bell and Sejnowski in [3]. The InfoMax algorithm is based on the maximization of the joint entropy of the output of a single layer neural network and it is very efficient and easy to implement since the gradient of the joint entropy can be evaluated simply in a closed form. Moreover, in order to avoid numerical instability, a natural gradient modification to InfoMax algorithm has also been proposed [1,6]. ar X iv :1\n60 5.\n07 83\n3v 2\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\n6 Se\np 20\nUnfortunately, all these solutions perform slowly when the number of the original sources to be separated is high and/or bad scaled. The separation becomes impossible if the number of sources is equal or greater than ten. In addition, the convergence speed problem worsen in the case of additive sensor noise to mixtures or when the mixing matrix is close to be ill-conditioned. However, specially when working with speech and audio signals, fast convergence speed is an important task to be performed. Many authors have tried to overcome this problem: some solutions consist in incorporating a momentum term in the learning rule [13], in a self-adjusting variable step-size [18] or in a scaled natural gradient algorithm [8].\nRecently, a novel algorithm for gradient based optimization of stochastic cost functions has been proposed by Kingma and Ba in [12]. This algorithm is based on the adaptive estimates of the first and second order moments of the gradient, and for this reason has been called the Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) algorithm. The authors have demonstrated in [12] that Adam is easy to implement, computationally efficient, invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients and well suited for problems with large data and parameters.\nThe Adam algorithm combines the advantages of other state-of-the-art optimization algorithms, like AdaGrad [9] and RMSProp [19], outperforming the limitations of these algorithms. In addition, Adam can be related to the natural gradient (NG) adaptation [1], employing a preconditioning that adapts to the geometry of data.\nIn this paper we propose a modified InfoMax algorithm based on the Adam algorithm [12] for the solution of BSS problems. We derive the proposed modified algorithm by using the Adam algorithm instead of the standard stochastic gradient ascent rule. It is shown that the novel algorithm has a faster convergence speed with respect to the standard InfoMax algorithm and usually also reaches a better separation. Some experimental results, evaluated in terms of the Amari Performance index (PI) [6], show the effectiveness of the proposed idea.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we briefly introduce the problem of BSS. Then, we give some details on the Adam algorithm in Section 3. The main novelty of this paper, the extension of InfoMax algorithm with Adam is provided in Section 4. Finally, we validate our approach in Section 5. We conclude with some final remarks in Section 6."

      "text" : "Let us consider a set of N unknown and statistically independent sources denoted as s[n] = [s1[n], . . . ,sN [n]]T , such that the components si[n] are zero-mean and mutually independent. Signals received by an array of M sensors are denoted by x[n] = [x1[n], . . . ,xM[n]]\nT and are called mixtures. For simplicity, here we consider the case of N = M.\nIn the case of a linear and instantaneous mixing environment, the mixture can be described in a matrix form as\nx[n] = As[n]+v[n], (1)\nwhere the matrix A = (ai j) collects the mixing coefficients ai j, i, j = 1,2, . . . ,N and v[n] = [v1[n], . . . ,vN [n]]T is a noise vector, with correlation matrix Rv = σ2v I and noise variance σ2v .\nThe separated signals u[n] are obtained by a separating matrix W = (wi j) as described by the following equation\nu[n] = Wx[n]. (2)\nThe transformation in (2) is such that u[n] = [u1[n], . . . ,uN [n]]T has components uk[n], k = 1,2, . . . ,N, that are as independent as possible.\nMoreover, due to the well-known permutation and scaling ambiguity of the BSS problem, the output signals u[n] can be expressed as\nu[n] = PDs[n], (3)\nwhere P is an N×N permutation matrix and D is an N×N diagonal scaling matrix.\nThe weights wi j can be adapted by maximizing or minimizing some suitable cost function [6,5]. A particularly good approach is to maximize the joint entropy of a single layer neural network [3], as shown in Figure 1, leading to the Bell and Sejnowski InfoMax algorithm. In this network each output yi[n] is a nonlinear transformation of each signal ui[n]:\nyi[n] = hi (ui[n]) . (4)\nEach function hi(·) is known as activation function (AF). With reference to Figure 1, using the equation relating the probability density function (pdf) of a random variable px (x) and nonlinear transformation of it py (y) [14], the joint entropy H (y) of the network output y[n] can be evaluated as\nH (y)≡−E {ln py (y)}= H (x)+ lndetW+ N\n∑ i=1\nln ∣∣h′i∣∣ , (5)\nwhere h′i is the first derivative of the i-th AF with respect its input ui[n]. Evaluating the gradient of (5) with respect to the separating parameters W, after some not too complicated manipulations, leads to\n∇WH (y) = W−T +ΨxT [n], (6)\nwhere (·)−T denotes the transpose of the inverse and Ψ = [Ψ1, . . . ,ΨN ]T is a vector collecting the terms Ψk = h′′k/h ′ k, defined as the ratio of the second and the first derivatives of the AFs. In order to avoid the numerical problems of the matrix inversion in (6) and the possibility to remain blocked in a local minimum, Amari has introduced the Natural Gradient (NG) adaptation [1] that overcomes such problems. The NG adaptation rule, can be obtained simply by right multiplying the stochastic gradient for the term WT W. Hence, after multiplying (6) for this term, the NG InfoMax is simply\n∇WH (y) = ( I+ΨuT [n] ) W. (7)\nRegarding the selection of the AFs shape, there are several alternatives. However, especially in the case of audio and speech signals, a good nonlinearity is represented by the tanh(·) function. With this choice, the vector Ψ in (6) and (7) is simply evaluated as −2y[n].\nIn summary, using the tanh(·) AF, the InfoMax and natural gradient InfoMax algorithms are described by the following learning rules:\nWt = Wt−1 +µ ( W−Tt−1−y[n]x T [n] ) , (8)\nWt = Wt−1 +µ ( I−y[n]uT [n] ) Wt−1, (9)\nwhere µ is the learning rate or step-size."

The problem is considered stochastic for the random nature of data samples or for inherent function noise. In the following, the noisy gradient vector at time t of the cost function f (θ) with respect to the parameters θ , will be denoted with gt = ∇θ ft (θ).\nThe Adam algorithm performs the gradient descent (or ascent) optimization by evaluating the moving averages of the noisy gradient mt and the square gradient vt [12]. These moment vectors are updated by using two scalar coefficients β1 and β2 that control the exponential decay rates:\nmt = β1mt−1 +(1−β1)gt , (10) vt = β2vt−1 +(1−β2)gt gt , (11)\nwhere β1,β2 ∈ [0,1) and denotes the element-wise multiplication, while m0 and v0 are initialized as zero vectors. These vectors represent the mean and the uncentered\nvariance of the gradient vector gt .

In the gradient ascent, the minus sign in (14) is substituted with the plus sign."

The gradient vector is evaluated on a number of blocks NB extracted from the signals.\nAt this point, the mean and variance vectors are evaluated from the knowledge of the gradient wt at time t by using equations (10)–(13).

      "heading" : "5 Experimental Results",
      "text" : "In this section, we propose some experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed idea. We perform separation of mixtures of both synthetic and realworld data. The results are evaluated in terms of the Amari Performance Index (PI) [6], defined as\nPI = 1\nN (N−1)\nN\n∑ i=1  N∑ k=1 |qik| max\nj\n∣∣qi j∣∣ −1 +  N∑ k=1 |qki| max\nj\n∣∣q ji∣∣ −1  , (18)\nwhere qi j are the elements of the matrix Q = WA. This index is close to zero if the matrix Q is close to the product of a permutation matrix and a diagonal scaling matrix.\nThe performances of the proposed algorithm were also compared with the standard InfoMax algorithm [3] and the Momentum InfoMax described in [13]. In this last algorithm, the α parameter is set to 0.5 in all experiments.\nIn a first experiment, we perform the separation of five mixtures obtained as linear combination of the following bad-scaled independent sources\ns1[n] = 10−6 · sin(350n)sin(60n) , s2[n] = 10−5 · tri(70n) , s3[n] = 10−4 · sin(800n)sin(80n) , s4[n] = 10−5 · cos(400n+4cos(60n)) , s5[n] = ξ [n],\nwhere tri(·) denotes a triangular waveform and ξ [n] is a uniform noise in the range [−1,1]. Each signal is composed of L = 30,000 samples. The mixing matrix is a 5×5 Hilbert matrix, which is extremely ill-conditioned. All simulations have been performed by MATLAB 2015a, on an Intel Core i7 3.10 GHz processor at 64 bit with 8 GB of RAM. Parameters of the algorithms have been found heuristically.\nWe perform separation by the Adam modification of the standard InfoMax algorithm, with gradient in (6). We use a block length of B = 30 samples (hence NB = bL/Bc= 1,000), while the other parameters are set as: Nep = 200, β1 = 0.5, β2 = 0.75, ε = 10−8, η = 0.001 and the learning rate of the standard InfoMax and the Momentum InfoMax to µ = 5 ·10−5. Performance in terms of the PI in (18) is reported in Figure 2, that clearly shows the effectiveness of the proposed idea.\nA second and third experiments are performed on speech audio signals sampled at 8 kHz. Each signal is composed of L = 30,000 samples. In the second experiment a male and a female speech are mixed with a 2×2 random matrix with entries uniformly distributed in the interval [−1,1] while in the third one, two male and two female speeches are mixed with a 4× 4 ill-conditioned Hilbert matrix. In addition, an additive white noise with 30 dB of SNR is added to the mixtures in both cases.\nWe perform separation by the Adam modification of the NG InfoMax algorithm, with gradient in (7). We use a block length of B = 30 samples, while the other parameters are set as: Nep = 100, β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, ε = 10−8, η = 0.001 and the learning rate of the standard InfoMax and the Momentum InfoMax to µ = 0.001. Performances in terms of the PI, for the second and third experiments, are reported in Figures 3a and 3b, respectively, that clearly show also in these cases the effectiveness of the proposed idea. In particular, Figure 3b confirms that the separation obtained by using the Adam InfoMax algorithm in the third experiment is quite satisfactory, while the standard and the Momentum InfoMax give worse solutions.\nFinally, a last experiment is performed on real data. We used an EEG signal recorded according the 10-20 system, consisting of 19 signals with artifacts. ICA is a common approach to deal with the problem of artifact removal from EEG [11]. We use a block length of B = 30 samples, while the other parameters are set as: Nep = 270, β1 = 0.9,\nβ2 = 0.999, ε = 10−8, η = 0.01 and the learning rate of the standard InfoMax and the Momentum InfoMax to µ = 10−6. Since we used real data and the mixing matrix A is not available, the PI cannot be evaluated. Hence, we decided to evaluate the performance by the norm of the gradient of the cost function. As it can be seen from Figure 4, also in this case the Adam InfoMax algorithm achieves better results in a smaller number of iterations with respect to the compared algorithms."
