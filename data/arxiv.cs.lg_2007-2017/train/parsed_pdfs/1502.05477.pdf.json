      "text" : "Most algorithms for policy optimization can be classified into three broad categories: policy iteration methods, which alternate between estimating the value function under the current policy and improving the policy (Bertsekas, 2005); policy gradient methods, which use an estimator of the gradient of the expected cost obtained from sample trajectories (Peters & Schaal, 2008a) (and which, as we later discuss, have a close connection to policy iteration); and derivative-free optimization methods, such as the cross-entropy method (CEM) and covariance matrix adaptation (CMA), which treat the cost as a black box function to be optimized in terms of the policy parameters (Fu et al., 2005; Szita & Lörincz, 2006).\nGeneral derivative-free stochastic optimization methods such as CEM and CMA are preferred on many problems, because they achieve good results while being simple to understand and implement. For example, while Tetris is a classic benchmark problem for approximate dynamic programming (ADP) methods,\nstochastic optimization methods are difficult to beat on this task (Gabillon et al., 2013). For continuous control problems, methods like CMA have been successful at learning control policies for challenging tasks like locomotion when provided with hand-engineered policy classes with low-dimensional parameterizations (Wampler & Popović, 2009). The inability of ADP and gradient-based methods to consistently beat gradientfree random search is unsatisfying, since gradientbased optimization algorithms enjoy much better sample complexity guarantees than gradient-free methods (Nemirovski, 2005). Continuous gradient-based optimization has been very successful at learning function approximators for supervised learning tasks with huge numbers of parameters, and extending their success to reinforcement learning would allow for efficient training of complex and powerful policies.\nIn this paper, we propose a family of trust region policy optimization (TRPO) algorithms. TRPO methods are motivated by theoretical results that show that minimizing a certain surrogate loss function guarantees policy improvement with non-trivial step sizes. A practical approximation to this policy improvement procedure can efficiently optimize nonlinear policies with tens of thousands of parameters, which have previously posed a major challenge for model-free policy search (Deisenroth et al., 2013). In our experiments, we show that the same TRPO method can learn complex policies for swimming, hopping, and walking, as well as playing Atari games directly from raw images."

      "text" : "Consider an infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision process (MDP), defined by the tuple (S,A, P, c, ρ0, γ), where S is a finite set of states, A is a finite set of actions, P : S × A × S → R is the transition probability distribution, c : S → R is the cost function, ρ0 : S → R is the distribution of the initial state s0, and γ ∈ (0, 1) is the discount factor.\nar X\niv :1\n50 2.\n05 47\n7v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n9 Fe\nb 20\nLet π denote a stochastic policy π : S × A → [0, 1], and let η(π) denote its expected discounted cost:\nη(π) = Es0,a0,... [ ∞∑ t=0 γtc(st) ] , where s0 ∼ ρ0(s0), at ∼ π(·|st), st+1 ∼ P (st+1|st, at).\nWe will use the following standard definitions of the state-action value function Qπ, the value function Vπ, and the advantage function Aπ:\nQπ(st, at) = Est+1,at+1,... [ ∞∑ l=0 γlc(st+l) ] ,\nVπ(st) = Eat,st+1,... [ ∞∑ l=0 γlc(st+l) ] , Aπ(s, a) = Qπ(s, a)− Vπ(s), where at ∼ π(·|st), st+1 ∼ P (st+1|st, at) for t ≥ 0.\nThe following useful identity expresses the expected cost of another policy π̃ in terms of the advantage over π, accumulated over timesteps (see Kakade & Langford (2002) for the proof, which we also reprise in Appendix A using the notation in this paper):\nη(π̃) = η(π) + Es0,a0,s1,a1,... [ ∞∑ t=0 γtAπ(st, at) ] , where\ns0 ∼ρ0(s0), at ∼ π̃(·|st), st+1 ∼P (st+1|st, at). (1)\nLet ρπ be the (unnormalized) discounted visitation frequencies\nρπ(s)=(P (s0 = s)+γP (s1 = s)+γ 2P (s2 = s)+. . . ),\nwhere s0 ∼ ρ0 and the actions are chosen according to π. Rearranging Equation (1) to sum over states instead of timesteps, we obtain\nη(π̃) = η(π) + ∑ s ρπ̃(s) ∑ a π̃(a|s)Aπ(s, a). (2)\nThis equation implies that any policy update π → π̃ that has a non-positive expected advantage at every state s, i.e., ∑ a π̃(a|s)Aπ(s, a) ≤ 0, is guaranteed to reduce η, or leave it constant in the case that the expected advantage is zero everywhere. This implies the classic result that the update performed by exact policy iteration, which uses the deterministic policy π̃(s) = arg minaAπ(s, a), improves the policy if there is at least one state-action pair with a negative advantage value and nonzero state visitation probability (otherwise it has converged). However, in the approximate setting, it will typically be unavoidable, due to estimation and approximation error, that there will be\nsome states s for which the expected advantage is positive (i.e., bad), that is, ∑ a π̃(a|s)Aπ(s, a) > 0. The complex dependency of ρπ̃(s) on π̃ makes Equation (2) difficult to optimize directly. Instead, we introduce the following local approximation to η:\nLπ(π̃) = η(π) + ∑ s ρπ(s) ∑ a π̃(a|s)Aπ(s, a). (3)\nNote that Lπ uses the visitation frequency ρπ rather than ρπ̃, ignoring changes in state visitation density due to changes in the policy. However, if we have a parameterized policy πθ, where πθ(a|s) is a differentiable function of the parameter vector θ, then Lπ matches η to first order. That is, for any parameter value θ0,\nLπθ0 (πθ0) = η(πθ0), ∇θLπθ0 (πθ) ∣∣ θ=θ0 = ∇θη(πθ) ∣∣ θ=θ0 . (4)\nEquation (4) implies that a sufficiently small step πθ0 → π̃ that reduces Lπθold will also reduce η, but does not give us any guidance on how big of a step to take. To address this issue, Kakade & Langford (2002) proposed a policy updating scheme called conservative policy iteration, for which they could provide explicit lower bounds on the improvement of η.\nTo define the conservative policy iteration update, let πold denote the current policy, and assume that we can solve π′ = arg minπ′ Lπold(π\n′). The new policy πnew is taken to be the following mixture policy:\nπnew(a|s) = (1− α)πold(a|s) + απ′(a|s) (5)\nKakade and Langford proved the following result for this update:\nη(πnew)≤Lπold(πnew)+ 2 γ\n(1− γ(1− α))(1− γ) α2, (6)\nwhere is the maximum advantage (positive or negative) of π′ relative to π:\n= max s |Ea∼π′(a|s) [Aπ(s, a)]| (7)\nSince α, γ ∈ [0, 1], Equation (6) implies the following simpler bound, which we refer to in the next section:\nη(πnew) ≤ Lπold(πnew) + 2 γ\n(1− γ)2 α2. (8)\nThis bound is only slightly weaker when α 1, which is typically the case in the conservative policy iteration method of Kakade & Langford (2002). Note, however, that so far this bound only applies to mixture policies generated by Equation (5). This policy class is unwieldy and restrictive in practice, and it is desirable for a practical policy update scheme to be applicable to all general stochastic policy classes."

      "text" : "Equation (6), which applies to conservative policy iteration, implies that a policy update that improves the right-hand side is guaranteed to improve the true expected cost objective η. Our principal theoretical result is that the policy improvement bound in Equation (6) can be extended to general stochastic policies, rather than just mixture polices, by replacing α with a distance measure between π and π̃. Since mixture policies are rarely used in practice, this result is crucial for extending the improvement guarantee to practical problems. The particular distance measure we use is the total variation divergence, which is defined by DTV (p ‖ q) = 12 ∑ i|pi − qi| for discrete probability distributions p, q.1 Define DmaxTV (π, π̃) as\nDmaxTV (π, π̃) = max s DTV (π(·|s) ‖ π̃(·|s)). (9)\nTheorem 1. Let α = DmaxTV (πold, πnew), and let = maxs maxa|Aπ(s, a)|. Then Equation (8) holds.\nWe provide two proofs in the appendix. The first proof extends Kakade and Langford’s result using the fact that the random variables from two distributions with total variation divergence less than α can be coupled, so that they are equal with probability 1−α. The second proof uses perturbation theory to prove a slightly stronger version of Equation (8), with a more favorable definition of that depends on π̃.\nNext, we note the following relationship between the total variation divergence and the KL divergence (Pollard (2000), Ch. 3): DTV (p ‖ q)2 ≤ DKL(p ‖ q). Let DmaxKL (π, π̃) = maxsDKL(π(·|s) ‖ π̃(·|s)). The following bound then follows directly from Equation (8):\nη(π̃) ≤ Lπ(π̃) + CDmaxKL (π, π̃), where C = 2 γ\n(1− γ)2 .\n(10)\nAlgorithm 1 describes an approximate policy iteration scheme based on the policy improvement bound in Equation (10). Note that for now, we assume exact evaluation of the advantage values Aπ.\nIt follows from Equation (10) that Algorithm 1 is guaranteed to generate a sequence of monotonically improving policies η(π0) ≥ η(π1) ≥ η(π2) ≥ . . . . To see this, let Mi(π) = Lπi(π) + CD max KL (πi, π). Then\nη(πi+1) ≤Mi(πi+1) by Equation (10) η(πi) = Mi(πi), therefore,\nη(πi+1)− η(πi) ≤Mi(πi+1)−M(πi).

This algorithm is a type of majorization-minimization algorithm (Hunter & Lange, 2004), which is a class of methods that also includes expectation maximization. In the terminology of MM algorithms, Mi is the surrogate function that majorizes η with equality at πi. This algorithm is also reminiscent of proximal gradient methods and mirror descent.\nTrust region policy optimization, which we propose in the following section, is an approximation to Algorithm 1, which uses a constraint on the KL divergence rather than a penalty to robustly allow large updates."

      "text" : "In the previous section, we considered the policy optimization problem independently of the parameterization of π and under the assumption that the policy can be evaluated at all states. We now describe how to derive a practical algorithm from these theoretical foundations, under finite sample counts and arbitrary parameterizations.\nSince we consider parameterized policies πθ(a|s) with parameter vector θ, we will overload our previous notation to use functions of θ rather than π, e.g. η(θ) := η(πθ), Lθ(θ̃) := Lπθ (πθ̃), and DKL(θ ‖ θ̃) := DKL(πθ ‖ πθ̃). We will use θold to denote the previous policy parameters that we wish to improve upon.\nThe preceding section shows that η(θ) ≤ Lθold(θ) + CDmaxKL (θold, θ), with equality at θ = θold. Thus, by performing the following minimization, we are guaranteed to improve the true objective η:\nminimize θ\n[CDmaxKL (θold, θ) + Lθold(θ)] .\nIn practice, if we used the penalty coefficient C recommended by the theory above, the step sizes would be very small. One way to take larger steps in a robust way is to use a constraint on the KL divergence between the new policy and the old policy, i.e., a trust region constraint:\nminimize θ Lθold(θ) (12)\nsubject to DmaxKL (θold, θ) ≤ δ.\nThis problem imposes a constraint that the KL divergence is bounded at every point in the state space. While it is motivated by the theory, this problem is impractical to solve due to the large number of constraints. Instead, we can use a heuristic approximation which considers the average KL divergence:\nD ρ\nKL(θ1, θ2) := Es∼ρ [DKL(πθ1(·|s) ‖ πθ2(·|s))] .\nWe therefore propose solving the following optimization problem to generate a policy update:\nminimize θ Lθold(θ) (13)\nsubject to D ρθold KL (θold, θ) ≤ δ.\nSimilar policy updates have been proposed in prior work (Bagnell & Schneider, 2003; Peters & Schaal, 2008b; Peters et al., 2010), and we compare our approach to prior methods in Section 7 and in the experiments in Section 8. Our experiments also show that this type of constrained update has similar empirical performance to the maximum KL divergence constraint in Equation (12)."

The following sections describe two different schemes for performing this estimation.\nThe first sampling scheme, which we call single path, is the one that is typically used for policy gradient estimation (Bartlett & Baxter, 2011), and is based on sampling individual trajectories. The second scheme, which we call vine, involves constructing a rollout set and then performing multiple actions from each state in the rollout set. This method has mostly been explored in the context of policy iteration methods (Lagoudakis & Parr, 2003; Gabillon et al., 2013)."

We then choose a subset of N states along these trajectories, denoted s1, s2, . . . , sN , which we call the “rollout set”. For each state sn in the rollout set, we sample K actions according to an,k ∼ q(·|sn). Any choice of q(·|sn) with a support that includes the support of πθi(·|sn) will produce a consistent estimator. In practice, we found that q(·|sn) = πθi(·|sn) works well on continuous problems, such as robotic locomotion,\nwhile the uniform distribution works well on discrete tasks, such as the Atari games, where it can sometimes achieve better exploration.\nFor each action an,k sampled at each state sn, we estimate Q̂θi(sn, an,k) by performing a rollout (i.e., a short trajectory) starting with state sn and action an,k. We can greatly reduce the variance of the Q-value differences between rollouts by using the same random number sequence for the noise in each of the K rollouts, i.e., common random numbers. See (Bertsekas, 2005) for additional discussion on Monte Carlo estimation of Q-values and (Ng & Jordan, 2000) for a discussion of common random numbers in reinforcement learning.\nIn small, finite action spaces, we can generate a rollout for every possible action from a given state. The contribution to Lθold from a single state sn is as follows:\nLn(θ) = K∑ k=1 πθ(ak|sn)Q̂(sn, ak), (16)\nwhere the action space is A = {a1, a2, . . . , aK}. In large or continuous state spaces, we can construct an estimator of the surrogate loss using importance sampling. The self-normalized estimator (Owen (2013), Chapter 8) of Lθold obtained at a single state sn is\nLn(θ) =\n∑K k=1\nπθ(an,k|sn) πθold (an,k|sn) Q̂(sn, an,k)∑K k=1\nπθ(an,k|sn) πθold (an,k|sn)\n, (17)\nassuming that we performed K actions an,1, an,2, . . . , an,K from state sn. This self-normalized estimator removes the need to use a baseline for the Q-values (note that the gradient is unchanged by adding a constant to the Q-values). Averaging over sn ∼ ρ(π), we obtain an estimator for Lθold , as well as its gradient.\nThe vine and single path methods are illustrated in Figure 1. We use the term vine, since the trajectories used for sampling can be likened to the stems of vines, which branch at various points (the rollout set) into several short offshoots (the rollout trajectories).\nThe benefit of the vine method over the single path method that is our local estimate of the objective has much lower variance given the same number of Q-value samples in the surrogate loss. That is, the vine method gives much better estimates of the advantage values. The downside of the vine method is that we must perform far more calls to the simulator for each of these advantage estimates. Furthermore, the vine method requires us to generate multiple trajectories from each state in the rollout set, which limits this algorithm to settings where the system can be reset to an arbitrary state. In contrast, the single path algorithm requires no state resets and can be directly implemented on a physical system (Peters & Schaal, 2008b)."

The natural policy gradient (Kakade, 2002) can be obtained as a special case of the update in Equation (13) by using a linear approximation to L and a quadratic approximation to the DKL constraint, resulting in the following problem:\nminimize θ\n[ ∇θLθold(θ) ∣∣ θ=θold · (θ − θold) ]\n(18)\nsubject to 1\n2 (θold − θ)TA(θold)(θold − θ) ≤ δ,\nwhere A(θold)ij =\n∂\n∂θi\n∂\n∂θj Es∼ρπ [DKL(π(·|s, θold) ‖ π(·|s, θ))]\n∣∣ θ=θold .\nThe update is θnew = θold − λA(θold)−1∇θL(θ) ∣∣ θ=θold , where the Lagrange multiplier λ is typically treated as an algorithm parameter. This differs from our approach, which enforces the constraint at each update. Though this difference might seem subtle, our experiments demonstrate that it significantly improves the algorithm’s performance on larger problems.\nWe can also obtain the standard policy gradient update by using an `2 constraint or penalty:\nminimize θ\n[ ∇θLθold(θ) ∣∣ θ=θold · (θ − θold) ]\n(19)\nsubject to 1\n2 ‖θ − θold‖2 ≤ δ.\nThe policy iteration update can also be obtained by solving the unconstrained problem minimizeπ Lπold(π), using L as defined in Equation (3).\nSeveral other methods employ an update similar to Equation (13). Relative entropy policy search (REPS) (Peters et al., 2010) constrains the stateaction marginals p(s, a), while TRPO constraints the conditionals p(a|s). Unlike REPS, our approach does not require a costly nonlinear optimization in the inner loop.

The parameters used in the experiments are provided in Appendix E. For the natural gradient method, we swept through the possible values of the penalty coefficient (i.e. the step size) in factors of three, and took the best coefficient according to the final performance.\nLearning curves showing the cost averaged across five runs of each algorithm are shown in Figure 4. Single path and vine TRPO solved all of the problems, yielding the best solutions. Natural gradient performed well on the two easier problems, but was unable to generate hopping and walking gaits that made forward progress. These results provide empirical evidence that constraining the KL divergence is a more robust way to choose step sizes and make fast, consistent progress, compared to using a fixed penalty. CEM and CMA are derivative-free algorithms, hence their sample complexity scales unfavorably with the number of parameters, and they performed poorly on the larger problems. The max KL method learned somewhat slower than our final method, due to the more restrictive form of the constraint, but overall the result suggests that the average KL divergence constraint has a similar effect as the theorecally justified maximum KL divergence. Videos of the policies learned by TRPO may be viewed on the project website: http://sites.google.com/site/trpopaper/.\nNote that TRPO learned all of the gaits with generalpurpose policies and simple cost functions, using minimal prior knowledge. This is in contrast with most prior methods for learning locomotion, which typically rely on hand-architected policy classes that explicitly encode notions of balance and stepping (Tedrake et al., 2004; Geng et al., 2006; Wampler & Popović, 2009)."

We proved monotonic improvement for an algorithm that repeatedly optimizes a local approximation to the expected cost of the policy with a KL divergence penalty, and\nwe showed that an approximation to this method that incorporates a KL divergence constraint achieves good empirical results on a range of challenging policy learning tasks, outperforming prior methods. Our analysis also provides a perspective that unifies policy gradient and policy iteration methods, and shows them to be special limiting cases of an algorithm that optimizes a certain objective subject to a trust region constraint.\nIn the domain of robotic locomotion, we successfully learned controllers for swimming, walking and hopping in a physics simulator, using general purpose neural networks and minimally informative costs. To our knowledge, no prior work has learned controllers from scratch for all of these tasks, using a generic policy search method and non-engineered, general-purpose policy representations. In the game-playing domain, we learned convolutional neural network policies that used raw images as inputs. This requires optimizing extremely high-dimensional policies, and only two prior methods report successful results on this task.\nSince the method we proposed is scalable and has strong theoretical foundations, we hope that it will serve as a jumping-off point for future work on training large, rich function approximators for a range of challenging problems. At the intersection of the two experimental domains we explored, there is the possibility of learning robotic control policies that use vision and raw sensory data as input, providing a unified scheme for training robotic controllers that perform both perception and control. The use of more sophisticated policies, including recurrent policies with hidden state, could further make it possible to roll state estimation and control into the same policy in the partially-observed setting. By combining our method with model learning, it would also be possible to substantially reduce its sample complexity, making it applicable to real-world settings where samples are expensive."

      "heading" : "A. Proof of Policy Improvement Bound",
      "text" : "We will adapt Kakade and Langford’s proof to the more general setting considered in this paper. First, we review the Kakade and Langford proof, using our own notation. Recall the useful identity introduced in Section 3, which expresses the policy improvement as an accumulation of expected advantages over time:\nη(πnew) = η(πold)+Es0,a0,s1,a1,... [ ∞∑ t=0 γtAπold(st, at) ] where s0 ∼ ρ0(s0), at ∼ πnew(·|st), st+1 ∼ P (st+1|st, at). (20)\nThis equation can be derived as follows. First note that Aπold(s, a) = Es′∼P (s′|s,a) [c(s) + γVπold(s′)− Vπold(s)]. Therefore,\nEs0,a0,s1,a1,... [ ∞∑ t=0 γtAπold(st, at) ] (21)\n= Es0,a0,s1,a1,... [ ∞∑ t=0 γt(c(st) + γVπold(st+1)− Vπold(st)) ] (22)\n= Es0,a0,s1,a1,... [ −Vπold(s0) + ∞∑ t=0 γtc(st) ] (23)\n= −Es0 [Vπold(s0)] + Es0,a0,s1,a1,... [ ∞∑ t=0 γtc(st) ] (24) = −η(πold) + η(πnew) (25)\nDefine Ā(s) as the expected advantage of π̃ at state s, averaged over actions: Ā(s) = ∑ a Aπold(s, a)πnew(a|s) (26)\nThen Equation (20) can be rewritten as follows η(πnew) = η(πold) + ∑ t γtEs∼P (st|πnew) [ Ā(s) ] . (27)\nRecall that in conservative policy iteration, the new policy πnew is taken to be a mixture of the old policy πold and an increment π′, i.e., πnew(a|s) = πold(a|s) + π′(a|s). In other words, to sample from πnew, we first draw a Bernoulli random variable, which tells us to choose πold with probability (1− α) and choose π′ with probability α. Let ct be the random variable that indicates the number of times π\n′ was chosen for t′ < t. We can condition on the value of ct to break the probability distribution P (st = s) into two pieces. Let us consider the expected advantage at timestep t. All expectations over st are taken assuming that the policy πnew was executed for t = 0, 1, . . . , t− 1.\nEst [ Ā(st) ] = P (ct = 0)Est [ Ā(s)|ct = 0 ] + P (ct > 0)Est [ Ā(s)|ct > 0 ] (28)\n= P (ct = 0)Est [ Ā(st)|ct > 0 ] + P (ct > 0)Est [ Ā(st)|ct > 0 ] = (1− P (ct ≥ 1))Est [ Ā(st) ] + P (st|ct ≥ 1)Est [ Ā(st)|ct < 0\n] = Est|ct<0 [ Ā(st) ] + P (ct ≥ 1) ( Est [ Ā(st)|ct = 0 ] − Est [ Ā(st)|ct > 0\n]) Next, note that\nEst [ Ā(s)|ct = 0 ] ≤ ,\n−Est [ Ā(s)|ct > 0 ] ≤ ,\nP (ct ≥ 1) = 1− (1− α)t. (29)\nHence, we can bound the second term in Equation (28): P (ct ≥ 1) ( Es∼P (st|ct≥1) [ Ā(s) ] − Es∼P (ct=0) [ Ā(s) ]) ≤ 2 (1− (1− α)t). (30)\nReturning to Equation (27), we get η(πnew) = η(πold) + ∑ t γt [ P (ct = 0)Est [ Ā(s)|ct = 0 ] + P (ct > 0)Est [ Ā(s)|ct > 0 ]] ≤ η(πold) +\n∑ t γt ( Es∼P (st|πnew,ct=0) [ Ā(s) ] + 2 (1− (1− α)t) ) = η(πold) + Lπold(πnew) +\n∑ t γt · 2 (1− (1− α)t)\n= η(πold) + Lπold(πnew) + 2 · ( 1\n1− γ − 1 1− γ(1− α) ) = η(πold) + Lπold(πnew) + 2 γ\n(1− γ)(1− (1− α)γ) (31)\nThat concludes Kakade and Langford’s proof.\nNow we will adapt their proof to the case that πnew is not necessarily a mixture involving πold, but the total variation divergence DmaxTV (πold, πnew) is bounded. The basic idea is to couple the old and new policies so that they choose the same action with probability 1− α. Then the same line of reasoning will be applied.\nSee (Levin et al., 2009) for an exposition on couplings. We will use the following fundamental result:\nSuppose pX and pY are distributions with DTV (pX ‖ pY ) = α. Then there exists a joint distribution (X,Y ) whose marginals are pX , pY , for which X = Y with probability 1− α.\nSee (Levin et al., 2009), Proposition 4.7. This joint distribution is constructed as follows:\n(i) With probability 1− α, we sample X = Y from the distribution min(pX , pY )/(1− α). (ii) With probability α, we sample X from max(pX − pY , 0)/α and sample Y from max(pY − pX , 0)/α.\nProof of 1. Let aπold,t, aπnew,t be random variables which represent the actions chosen by policies πold and πnew at time t. By the preceding results, we can define aπold,t, aπnew,t on a common probability space so that P (aπold,t 6= aπnew,t) = DTV (πold(·|st) ‖ πnew(·|st)) ≤ α.\nNow consider sampling a trajectory from the MDP as follows. At each timestep, draw the actions aπold,t, aπnew,t from the coupled distribution described above. Perform the action aπnew,t. Define ct as the number of times t′ < t where case (ii) is chosen, i.e., aπold,t, aπnew,t. Next we redefine := maxs maxa|Aπ(s, a)| in a slightly weaker way. (See Appendix B for an stronger definition.) Then Equations (29), (30), (31) imply the result."

Note that η(π) = cGρ0, and η(π̃) = cG̃ρ0. Let ∆ = Pπ̃ − Pπ. We wish to bound η(π̃)− η(π) = c(G̃−G)ρ0.

      "heading" : "C. Efficiently Solving the Trust-Region Constrained Optimization Problem",
      "text" : "This section describes how to efficiently approximately solve the following constrained optimization problem, which we must solve at each iteration of TRPO:\nminimizeL(θ) subject to DKL(θold, θ) ≤ δ. (43)\nThe method we will describe involves two steps: (1) compute a search direction, using a linear approximation to objective and quadratic approximation to the constraint; and (2) perform a line search in that direction, ensuring that we improve the nonlinear objective while satisfying the nonlinear constraint.\nThe search direction is computed by approximately solving the equation Ax = −g, where A is the Fisher information matrix, i.e., the quadratic approximation to the KL divergence constraint: DKL(θold, θ) ≈ 12 (θ − θold)\nTA(θ−θold), where Aij = ∂∂θi ∂ ∂θj DKL(θold, θ). In large-scale problems, it is prohibitively costly (with respect to computation and memory) to form the full matrix A (or A−1). However, the conjugate gradient algorithm allows us to approximately solve the equation Ax = b without forming this full matrix, when we merely have access to a function that computes matrix-vector products y → Ay. Appendix C.1 describes the most efficient way to compute matrix-vector products with the Fisher information matrix. For additional exposition on the use of Hessian-vector products for optimizing neural network objectives, see (Martens & Sutskever, 2012) and (Pascanu & Bengio, 2013).\nHaving computed the search direction s ≈ A−1g, we next need to compute the maximal step length β such that θ+βs will satisfy the KL divergence constraint. To do this, let δ = DKL ≈ 12 (βs) TA(βs) = 12β 2sTAs. From this,\nwe obtain β = √\n2δ/sTAs, where δ is the desired KL divergence. The term sTAs can be computed through a single Hessian vector product, and it is also an intermediate result produced by the conjugate gradient algorithm.\nLast, we use a line search to ensure improvement of the surrogate objective and satisfaction of the KL divergence constraint, both of which are nonlinear in the parameter vector θ (and thus depart from the linear and quadratic approximations used to compute the step). We perform the line search on the objective Lθold(θ) + X [DmaxKL (θold, θ) ≤ δ], where X [. . . ] equals zero when its argument is true and +∞ when it is false. Starting with the maximal value of the step length β computed in the previous paragraph, we shrink β exponentially until the objective improves. Without this line search, the algorithm occasionally computes large steps that cause a catastrophic degradation of performance.\nC.1. Computing the Fisher-Vector Product\nHere we will describe how to compute the matrix-vector product between the averaged Fisher information matrix and arbitrary vectors. This matrix-vector product enables us to perform the conjugate gradient algorithm. Suppose that the parameterized policy maps from the input x to “distribution parameter” vector µθ(x), which parameterizes the distribution π(u|x). Now the KL divergence for a given input x can be written as follows:\nDKL(πθold(·|x) ‖ πθ(·|x)) = kl(µθ(x), µold) (44)\nwhere kl is the KL divergence between the distributions corresponding to the two mean parameter vectors. Differentiating kl twice with respect to θ, we obtain\n∂µa(x)\n∂θi\n∂µb(x)\n∂θj kl′′ab(µθ(x), µold) +\n∂2µa(x)\n∂θi∂θj kl′a(µθ(x), µold) (45)\nwhere the primes (′) indicate differentiation with respect to the first argument, and there is an implied summation over indices a, b. The second term vanishes, leaving just the first term. Let J := ∂µa(x)∂θi (the Jacobian), then the Fisher information matrix can be written in matrix form as JTMJ , where M = kl′′ab(µθ(x), µold) is the Fisher information matrix of the distribution in terms of the mean parameter µ (as opposed to the parameter θ). This has a simple form for most parameterized distributions of interest.\nThe Fisher-vector product can now be written as a function y → JTMJy. Multiplication by JT and J can be performed by most automatic differentiation and neural network packages (multiplication by JT is the wellknown backprop operation), and the operation for multiplication by M can be derived for the distribution of interest. Note that this Fisher-vector product is straightforward to average over a set of datapoints, i.e., inputs x to µ.\nOne could alternatively use a generic method for calculating Hessian-vector products using reverse mode automatic differentiation ((Wright & Nocedal, 1999), chapter 8), computing the Hessian of DKL with respect to θ. This method would be slightly less efficient as it does not exploit the fact that the second derivatives of µ(x) (i.e., the second term in Equation (45)) can be ignored, but may be substantially easier to implement.\nWe have described a procedure for computing the Fisher-vector product y → Ay, where the Fisher information matrix is averaged over a set of inputs to the function µ. Computing the Fisher-vector product is typically about as expensive as computing the gradient of an objective that depends on µ(x) (Wright & Nocedal, 1999). Furthermore, we need to compute k of these Fisher-vector products per gradient, where k is the number of iterations of the conjugate gradient algorithm we perform. We found k = 10 to be quite effective, and using higher k did not result in faster policy improvement. Hence, a näıve implementation would spend more than 90% of the computational effort on these Fisher-vector products. However, we can greatly reduce this burden by subsampling the data for the computation of Fisher-vector product. Since the Fisher information matrix merely acts as a metric, it can be computed on a subset of the data without severely degrading the quality of the final step. Hence, we can compute it on 10% of the data, and the total cost of Hessian-vector products will be about the same as computing the gradient. With this optimization, the computation of a natural gradient step A−1g does not incur a significant extra computational cost beyond computing the gradient g."

      "text" : "The policy, which is a conditional probability distribution πθ(a|s), can be parameterized with a neural network. The most straightforward way to do so is to have the neural network map (deterministically) from the state vector s to a vector µ that specifies a distribution over action space. Then we can compute the likelihood p(a|µ) and sample a ∼ p(a|µ).\nFor our experiments with continuous state and action spaces, we used a Gaussian distribution, where the covariance matrix was diagonal and independent of the state. A neural network with several fully-connected (dense) layers maps from the input features to the mean of a Gaussian distribution. A separate set of parameters specifies the log standard deviation of each element. More concretely, the parameters include a set of weights and biases for the neural network computing the mean, {Wi, bi}Li=1, and a vector r (log standard deviation) with the same dimension as a. Then, the policy is defined by the normal distribution\nN ( mean = NeuralNet ( s; {Wi, bi}Li=1 ) , stdev = exp(r) ) . Here, µ = [mean, stdev].\nFor the experiments with discrete actions (Atari), we use a factored discrete action space, where each factor is parameterized as a categorical distribution. That is, the action consists of a tuple (a1, a2, . . . , aK) of integers ak ∈ {1, 2, . . . , Nk}, and each of these components is assumed to have a categorical distribution, which is specified by a vector µk = [p1, p2, . . . , pNk ]. Hence, µ is defined to be the concatenation of the factors’ parameters:\nµ = [µ1, µ2, . . . , µK ] and has dimension dimµ = ∑K k=1Nk. The components of µ are computed by taking\napplying a neural network to the input s and then applying the softmax operator to each slice, yielding normalized probabilities for each factor.\nE.
