We introduce a review-based recommendation approach that obtains contextual information by mining user reviews. The proposed approach relate to features obtained by analyzing textual reviews using methods developed in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and information retrieval discipline to compute a utility function over a given item. An item utility is a measure that shows how much it is preferred according to user’s current context.\nIn our system, the context inference is modeled as similarity between the users reviews history and the item reviews history. As an example application, we used our method to mine contextual data from customers’ reviews of movies and use it to produce review-based rating prediction. The predicted ratings can generate recommendations that are item-based and should appear at the recommended items list in the product page. Our evaluations (surprisingly) suggest that our system can help produce better prediction rating scores in comparison to the standard prediction methods.\nIntroduction In recent years, recommendation systems (RecSys) have been extensively used in various domains to recommend items of interest to users based on their profiles. RecSys are an integral part of many online stores such as Alibaba.com, Amazon.com, etc. One of the most famous examples of a recommendation system is Amazon [? ]. This system contains movie ratings for over 100,000 movies.\nA user’s profile is a reflection of the user’s previous selections and preferences that can be captured as rating scores or textual review given to different items in the system. Using preference data, different systems have been developed to produce personalized recommendations based on collaborative filtering, content-based or a hybrid approach.\nDespite the broad used of such recommendation systems, they fail to consider the users’ latent preferences, thus may result in performance degradation. For example, a customer who has once viewed a movie with his friend’s child may repeatedly receive suggestions to view kid’s movies as the recommendation algorithm select base on the whole history in user’s profile without prioritizing his interests. To address this issue, review-based recommendation systems has been introduced.\nContextual information about a user preference can be explicit or implicit and can be inferred in different ways such as user score ratings or textual reviews. We concentrate on deriving context from textual reviews.\nAs an example application of our approach, we have used our method to mine contextual data from customers’ reviews of movies domain.\nIn order to evaluate our method, we have used Amazon movies reviews [? ]. The reason for choosing this dataset is that users usually provide some contextual cues in their comments. For example, they may mention that they are very fond of a specific actor or director, or they may express their opinions about the\n1\nar X\niv :1\n60 7.\n00 02\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.I R\n] 3\n0 Ju\nn 20\n16\nmovie subject or genre that are important to them. In this dataset each review contains an overall rating, and textual comment.\nMethod We assume that user reviews have contextual data about the user preferences, thus comparing the similarity with the item reviews can infer similarity between the two (user preference and item). Moreover, similarity between two users’ reviews can infer similarity between the two users’ preferences. We use this approach to predict the rating score that a user will rate an item."

Second, for each possible rating r (r ∈{1,2,3,4,5}) compare the similarity between u and i reviews who has been rated r. Finally, return the value of r which produced maximum similarity, as the predicted rating for i by u. We present a pseudo code for this process in algorithm 2, and a graphic representation in figure 2.\nAlgorithm 2 User-Item Rating Prediction Process 1: procedure PREDICT(userID, itemID) 2: userReviews← list of userID’s reviews 3: for each review RVu ∈ userReviews do 4: RVu ← normalized text of RVu 5: end for 6: itemReviews← list of itemID’s reviews 7: for each review RVi ∈ itemReviews do 8: RVi ← normalized text of RVi 9: end for 10: for each possible rating value r ∈{1,2,3,4,5} do 11: userReviewsr ←reviews whose rated r in userReviews 12: itemReviewsr ←reviews whose rated r in itemReviews 13: similarityr ←similarity value between userReviewsr and itemReviewsr 14: end for 15: return maxr(similarityr) 16: end procedure\nSimilarity of two textual collections (user and item reviews with same rating score) can be computed in several ways, for that we need to answer two question: (1) what to compare, e.g. each user review to each item review or concatenated text of all reviews in each side; and (2) how to compare and aggregate, information retrieval discipline have a lot of functions to offer in this subject, e.g. cosine similarity.\nBen-Gurion University of the Negev, Faculty of Engineering Science Department of Information Systems Engineering\nFor user-item based approach we experimented with three different comparison methods, that are different answers to the mentioned questions, proposed (and argued) by this study authors.

CF is a method of making automatic predictions (filtering) about the interests of a user by collecting preferences or taste information from many users (collaborating).\nThe prediction process is as follow: First, we extract and normalize reviews that was written by u. Second, for all users ui that rated item i, we extract and normalize reviews that was written by ui. Third, for each user ui, and for each possible rating r (r ∈{1,2,3,4,5}), we compute cosine similarity between u and ui reviews that been rated r, as presented in figure 5.

Moreover, due to time limits we could not execute our methods over the ∼8 million reviews, thus we used 100,000 reviews randomly selected from the Amazon dataset. We used two datasets: (1) imbalanced dataset that contains 55% 5-star reviews, 21% 4-star reviews, 10% 3- stars reviews. 6% 2-stars reviews and 8% 1-star reviews; and (2) balanced dataset that contains 33% 5-star reviews, 31% 4-star reviews, 15% 3-stars reviews. 9% 2-stars reviews and 12% 1-star reviews. Each dataset was splitted into two parts: (1) 80% training dataset and (2) 20% testing dataset, for evaluation purposes.\nIn previous chapter, we introduced a review-based recommendation system that produce recommendations for a user based on a utility function that depends both the user’s context and also the predicted rating for that item.

In our proposed methods, the context inference is modeled in two ways: (1) cosine similarity between user and item textual reviews; and (2) cosine similarity between user and other users textual reviews.
