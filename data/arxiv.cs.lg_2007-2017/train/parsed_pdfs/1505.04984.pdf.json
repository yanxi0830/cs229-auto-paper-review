The first is that they allow for the representation of greater uncertainty by placing “hyperpriors” on\nProceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Machine Learning, Lille, France, 2015. JMLR: W&CP volume 37. Copyright 2015 by the author(s).\nthe hyperparameters of the prior distribution (Berger, 1985; Bernardo & Smith, 2000; Gelman et al., 2013). By explicitly modeling the additional uncertainty, there is greater “robustness” to misspecification and unexpected data. The second is that hierarchical models permit the “sharing of statistical strength” between related observations or cohorts (Gelman et al., 2013). For example, take the recent “Big Bayes Stories” special issue of the journal Statistical Science, which was comprised of short articles describing successful applications of Bayesian models to a diverse range of problems, including political science, astronomy, and public health (Mengersen & Robert, 2014). Most of the Bayesian models were hierarchical, and the need for robustness and sharing of statistical strength because of limited data were commonly cited reasons by the practitioners for choosing a hierarchical Bayesian approach. Gelman & Hill (2006) and Gelman et al. (2013) both contain further examples of problems in which hierarchical modeling is critical to obtaining high-quality inferences.\nWithin the machine learning and vision literature, Salakhutdinov et al. (2011) offers an illustrative case study in the benefits and the pitfalls of employing a hierarchical model. The motivation of Salakhutdinov et al. (2011) was that, for image classification tasks, some categories of objects (e.g., “car” or “dog”) have many labeled positive and negative examples while other, visually related, categories (e.g., “bus” or “anteater”) have only a few labeled examples. Fig. 1(right, a) shows the distribution of training examples for the 200 object categories used while Fig. 1(right, b) shows the same distribution, but now objects are grouped with those with similar appearances. In both cases, the distributions are fat-tailed: there are a few categories with many training examples and many categories with a few training examples. It was hypothesized that by using a hierarchical Bayesian model, the classes with large amounts of labeled data could be used to construct better classifiers for the classes with small amounts of labeled data.\nThe model used by Salakhutdinov et al. (2011), which\nar X\niv :1\n50 5.\n04 98\n4v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n9 M\nay 2\n01 5\nRisk and Regret of Hierarchical Bayesian Learners\nwe will analyze in Section 4.2, consisted of a hierarchical Gaussian prior with a logistic regression likelihood. Twolevel, one-level, and flat priors were all tested. The purpose of using the two-level prior was that it was able to encode information about which object classes had visually similar objects (e.g., car and track, dog and horse). Fig. 1(left) compares the predictive performance of this two-level hierarchical prior with the two more impoverished priors. Observe that the one-level and two-level priors both improve performance on most object classes compared to the flat prior, but not all. Furthermore, the two-level prior always leads to greater improvement than the one-level prior on object classes where a hierarchical model helps, but also almost always leads to a greater degradation in performance on object classes where the hierarchical models decrease performance. Why the different performance characteristics for the two hierarchical models? Why do some categories have improved accuracy while others decreased accuracy? In a post-hoc analysis, Salakhutdinov et al. (2011) note that the “objects with the largest improvement...borrow visual appearance from other frequent objects” while “objects with the largest decrease [such as ‘umbrella’ and ‘merchandise’] are abstract, and their visual appearance is very different from other object categories.”\nThe results just described lead to numerous theoretical questions of practical consequence:\nQ1 Can we formalize why for some object classes there was a beneficial sharing of statistical strength, while for other classes the sharing was detrimental?\nQ2 Can we understand when a flat model should be preferred to a hierarchical one to avoid unfavorable sharing?\nQ3 More generally, can we obtain guidance on the best type of prior for the problem at hand? Perhaps a different hierarchical prior would have been better suited to learning the image classifiers. For example, could placing hyperpriors on the variance parameters lead to greater “robustness” for object categories such as ‘umbrella’ and ‘merchandise,’ whose visual appearance differs from other object categories?\nQ4 Once the form of the prior has been chosen, how should hyperparameters be set to maximize learning? The settings of the variance hyperparameters was left unspecified by Salakhutdinov et al. (2011), and it is not clear a priori how they should be set, or how much effect their choice will have on learning.\nWhile we have primarily framed these questions in terms of a single model from one paper, this focus was simply for concreteness. Similar results leading to the same types of questions can be found in the numerous articles that make\nLearning to Share Visual Appearance for Multiclass Object Detection\nRuslan Salakhutdinov, Antonio Torralba, Josh Tenenbaum Massachusetts Institute of Technology rsalakhu@mit.edu, torralba@csail.mit.edu, jbt@mit.edu\nAbstract\nWe present a hierarchical classification model that allows rare objects to borrow statistical strength from related objects that have many training examples. Unlike many of the existing object detection and recognition systems that treat different classes as unrelated entities, our model learns both a hierarchy for sharing visual appearance across 200 object categories and hierarchical parameters. Our experimental results on the challenging object localization and detection task demonstrate that the proposed model substantially improves the accuracy of the standard single object detectors that ignore hierarchical structure altogether.\n1. Introduction\nAs we move around the world, some objects are encountered very frequently (everyday, we see many different people, cars, trees, buildings, chairs, etc.), other objects are less frequent (encountering only a few different instances per day, such as televisions or mugs), other objects are quite rare (e.g., speakers, teapots, suitcases, docks), or extremely rare (seen only a few times each year or less, such as elephants, or aircraft carriers). This distribution of learning data is very different to the distributions generally used whe training object r cognition algorithms. Current work on learning from few examples generally creates a setting in which there are N object classes, with M training examples available per class, with M being small. This setting is artificial as it is becoming increasingly easy to collect large amounts of training data [23, 18], at least for a subset of the object classes. In addition, this artificial distribution of training data is likely to be quite different to the distribution of data encountered by humans, or by the mobile agents, moving around the world.\nIn this work we focus on the more realistic setting in which we have some classes containing lots of training data and many classes containing little data. Our goal is to use frequent classes to help to learn rare classes for which it is harder to collect the training data. This biased distribution is quite frequent and emerges in most natural training domains. One of the most common examples is when look-\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\nN u\nm b\ne r\no f tr\na in\nin g\ne xa\nm p\nle s\n0\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\nw a ll tr e e b u il d in g s k y fl o o

In this plot clusters (denoted by different colors) are sorted by the cluster mass (sum of all the samples available) and, within each cluster, objects are sorted by decreasing amount of data.

A distribution similar to Zipf’s law also has been found in several large object databases (e.g., what and where [26], labelme [23]). Other datasets have a uniform distribution over available data per class (e.g. Caltech 101, ImageNet [18], by making a big effort during the collection process in order to keep a uniform distribution over the object samples).\nFig. 1.a shows the distribution of amount of annotated data available for 200 object categories from the database\n1481\nb)\na)\n0 50 100 150 200 Sorted Object Index\n4\n2\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\nIn cr\ne m\ne n t\nA P o\nv e r\nfl a t\np ri\no r Flat prior\nOne-level prior Two-level prior\nFigure 1.

For example, one\nmight instead consider the hierarchical models have been\nused in political science for analyzing polling and census data to predict election outcomes (Ghitza & Gelman, 2013) and in demography for predicting population growth, life expectancy, and fertility rates (Raftery et al., 2013; 2012; Alkema et al., 2011).\nIn this paper we seek to answer the questions just posed in terms of two learning-theoretic quantities: regret (in online learning) and statistical risk (in batch learning). The online learning setting applies, for example, to the demography applications and election prediction while the batch setting is relevant to the image classification problem as well as election prediction (whether the online or batch analysis applies to election prediction depends on how the problem is formulated).\nIn the online learning framework (Dawid & Vovk, 1999; Cesa-Bianchi & Lugosi, 2006), no assumptions are made about the data-generating mechanism. Inputs are presented to the learner one by one. After receiving each input the learner predicts the output, then suffers a loss after observing the true output. The goal of the learner is to not do much worse (i.e., have large regret) compared to a fixed class of predictors. Online learning guarantees are attractive for the analysis of hierarchical Bayesian models because such models are so often used in exactly those circumstances when orthodox Bayesian justifications do not apply: typically the modeler does not think that her model reflects the true data generating process, but is instead employing hierarchical methods either to increase robustness against a poor choice of hyperparameters or to speed learning by allowing for the sharing of statistical strength between populations.\nRegret bounds, however, do not themselves give any generalization guarantees about how the learner will perform on future data. Statistical risk bounds provide guarantees\nabout the learner’s expected loss on unseen examples by making assumptions about how the data are generated — for example, from an i.i.d. or strongly mixing process. Although there is a stochastic assumption, risk bounds also do not assume that the data is generated according to the model used. We derive a general result for transferring Bayesian regret bounds to risk bounds for bounded losses.\nRegret bound for a number of Bayesian models have previously been developed (Vovk, 2001; Kakade & Ng, 2004; Kakade et al., 2005; Banerjee, 2006; 2007; Seeger et al., 2008), with a particular focus on regression and simple priors such as independent Gaussian distributions for each regression coefficient. For a discussion of more general (but asymptotic) Bayesian regret bounds for exponential families and other sufficiently “regular” model classes, see Grünwald (2007, Chapter 8). We follow the approach originally taken in Kakade & Ng (2004), and further explored in Kakade et al. (2005), Banerjee (2006), and Seeger et al. (2008), which applies to a large class of Bayesian generalized linear models (GLMs). We extend the technique to apply to certain non-GLM likelihoods as well, including to multi-class logistic regression. All proofs are deferred to the Appendices.\nWe answer Questions Q1-Q4 in some important cases by deriving regret bounds for three types of hierarchical priors. First, we consider the use of an inverse gamma hyperprior for the Gaussian prior’s variance parameter and demonstrate that the hyperprior leads to greater robustness to data that is well-explained by setting the GLM parameter vector to have very large `2 norm. Next, we analyze hierarchical Gaussian models that allow for the sharing of statistical strength. Our results, which complement existing work on transfer and multitask learning theory (Baxter, 1997; Ben-David & Schuller, 2003; Pentina & Lampert, 2014), show that when the parameters with small regret for a collection of related tasks are either (a) similar or (b) not unexpected under the prior, then the hierarchical model has a smaller regret bound than assuming the tasks are independent. Finally, we show that spike-and-slab priors can exploit sparse parameters with small regret."

      "text" : "In online learning, the learner must predict (a distribution over) y ∈ Y ⊆ R after observing x ∈ X ⊆ Rn. In this paper, we assume the prediction is made according to a generalized linear model (GLM) p(y |x,θ) = p(y |θ · x), where θ ∈ Θ ⊆ Rn is a parameter vector to be chosen. GLMs provide significant modeling flexibility, and the class of GLM models and priors we analyze include a range of models used in real-world scientific applications (Gelman & Hill, 2006; Gelman et al., 2013). Two widely\nused GLMs are the logistic regression likelihood\np(y |θ,x) = 1 1 + exp(yθ · x) , y ∈ {−1, 1}, (1)\nand the Gaussian linear regression likelihood p(y |θ,x) = N(y |θ · x, σ2), y ∈ R. Since we are taking a Bayesian approach, we place a prior density p0(θ) on Θ, with corresponding distribution P0.1 At time step t, the learner observes xt, outputs a distribution over Y , then observes yt ∈ Y . The Bayesian (model average) learner predicts p(y |xt, Zt−1), where Zt , {(x1, y1), . . . , (xt, yt)}, and then suffers the log-loss − ln p(yt |xt, Zt−1). Hence, the cumulative loss incurred is\nLBayes(ZT ) , ∑T t=1− ln p(yt |xt, Zt−1).\nIf Q is a distribution over θ, then using Q for prediction leads to loss on example t of `t(Q) , EQ[− ln p(yt |xt,θ)] and hence cumulative loss\nLQ(ZT ) , EQ [∑T t=1− ln p(yt |xt,θ) ] .\nIf Q = δθ, then we write Lθ instead of LQ, so LQ(ZT ) = EQ[Lθ(ZT )]. Our objective is to derive regret bounds of the form\nR(ZT ,θ) , LBayes(ZT )− Lθ(ZT ) ≤ B(θ) + C(T ), (2)\nwhere R(ZT ,θ) is the regret and B(θ) + C(T ) is a regret bound depending on the choice of prior P0. We aim for C(T ) = o(T ), so that for a fixed θ, the average loss T−1LBayes(ZT ) is bounded by T−1Lθ(ZT ) + o(1).\nOur approach to bounding LBayes(ZT ) follows that of previous work on Bayesian GLM regret bounds with logloss (Kakade & Ng, 2004; Kakade et al., 2005; Seeger et al., 2008), relying on the following well-known result:\nProposition 2.1 (Kakade & Ng (2004); Banerjee (2006)). The Bayesian cumulative loss is bounded as\nLBayes(ZT ) ≤ LQ(ZT ) + KL(Q||P0). (3)\nFor the GLM model p(y |θ · x), define fy(z) , − ln p(y |θ ·x = z). We make two assumptions throughout the remainder of the paper (they will usually not be stated explicitly):\n|f ′′y (z)| ≤ c for all y, z (A1) ‖xt‖2 ≤ 1 for all t. (A2)\nThe first assumption can be understood as requiring the likelihood to be sufficiently smooth. The second assumption sets the scale of the problem, which is necessary since\n1Throughout, we use lowercase letters for densities and uppercase letters to denote the corresponding measures.\nscaling xt up requires scaling θ down, and vice-versa: p(y |C−1θ · Cx) = p(y |θ · x) for any C 6= 0. Note that for the Gaussian linear regression model with variance σ2 and the logistic regression model, (A1) holds with c = 1/σ2 and c = 1/2, respectively. Proposition 2.1 leads to the following theorem for obtaining regret bounds for the Bayesian model average learner.\nTheorem 2.2 (Bayesian regret meta-theorem). Let Qθ∗,φ be a distribution with parameter φ ∈ Φ ⊆ Rd (written φ if d = 1) and mean θ∗. If (A1) and (A2) hold, then for all φ,\nR(Z,θ∗) ≤ Tc 2 ‖VarQθ∗,φ [θ]‖+ KL(Qθ∗,φ||P0),\nwhere ‖ · ‖ is the spectral norm. In particular, if the components of θ∗ are uncorrelated, then ‖VarQθ∗,φ [θ]‖ = supi VarQθ∗,φ [θi]\nTheorem 2.2 is our first main result and will be repeatedly applied in Section 4 by choosing an appropriate Qθ∗,φ and then optimizingφ. Although the bound appears to be linear in T , typicallyφ can be chosen such that ‖VarQθ∗,φ [θ]‖ = Θ(T−1) and KL(Qθ∗,φ||P0) = Θ(lnT ), leading to a logarithmic regret bound. Theorem 2.2 provides an attractive approach to deriving regret bounds because there is no need to work directly with the posterior, which is often analytically intractable. For example, there is no closed-form expression for the posterior of the Bayesian logistic regression model. The theorem generalizes the approach originally taken in Kakade & Ng (2004), in which a Gaussian prior for θ was considered:\nTheorem 2.3 (Gaussian regret (Kakade & Ng, 2004)).

      "text" : "While online regret bounds are attractive because they make no assumptions about the data-generating process, it is also desirable to have risk bounds in the batch setting since risk bounds provide generalization guarantees for unseen data. We now develop a connection between regret and risk bounds via a PAC-Bayesian analysis (McAllester, 2003; Audibert & Bousquet, 2007; Catoni, 2007). Such bounds also have the benefit of applying to any bounded loss (e.g., the 0-1 loss for binary classification), which may be more task-relevant than the log-loss. In the batch setting, the data ZT are received all at once by the learner and are assumed to be distributed i.i.d. according to some distribution D over X × Y: (xt, yt)\ni.i.d.∼ D, t = 1, . . . , T . Let ` be a bounded loss function taking a probability distribution over Y and an element of Y as arguments. Without loss of generality assume ` ∈ [0, 1].

(5)\nCombining the PAC-Bayesian risk bound with Bayesian regret bounds leads to our second main result: Theorem 3.2. Assume that (2) holds and fix κ > 1/2. For any distributionD, with probability at least 1−δ over samples (xt, yt) i.i.d.∼ D,\n|L(PT )− L̂(PT , ZT )|\n≤ T−1/2 √ κ √ B(θ̂) + C(T ) + lnκ′/δ ,\n(6)\nwhere θ̂ , arg minθ Lθ(ZT ).\nAn attractive feature of Theorem 3.2 is that the bound does not rely on understanding the posterior PT , as is required by a direct application of a PAC-Bayesian bound such as that given in Theorem 3.1, which requires calculating KL(PT ||P0). Yet the PAC-Bayesian regret bound remains data-dependent due to its dependence on the empirical risk minimizer (ERM) p(y |x, θ̂).\nExamining the proof of Theorem 3.2, it is easily seen that in fact any θ̃ such that Lθ̃(ZT ) < LPT (ZT ) can be chosen in place of θ̂. Such alternative choices may lead to significantly tighter bounds and are particularly important, for example, in the application of the theorem to the spike-andslab prior (cf. Section 4.3), as the ERM parameter will in almost all circumstances satisfy ‖θ̂‖0 = n, which would lead to a poor generalization bound when n is large.\nIn words, Theorem 3.2 can be understood as stating that if the Bayesian (model average) learner has small log-loss regret compared to the ERM, then with high probability the Bayesian Gibbs predictor will generalize well if the loss function is bounded. Or, as a slogan, the theorem shows that “small regret in the online learning setting implies good generalization bounds in the batch setting.” The theorem thus connects PAC-Bayesian bounds, Bayesian regret bounds, and empirical risk minimization."

      "text" : "In this section we answer questions Q2-Q4 as they relate to hierarchical priors for robust inference, demonstrating how, with a proper choice of hyperparameters, a hierarchical prior can lead to increased robustness compared to a flat\nprior. Specifically, we analyze a canonical use of a hierarchical prior — to capture greater uncertainty in the value of a parameter by placing a hyperprior on the variance of the Gaussian prior on that parameter (Berger, 1985; Bishop, 2006; Gelman et al., 2013):\nσ20 |α, β ∼ Γ−1(α, β) and θi |µ0, σ20 ∼ N(µ0, σ20),\nwhere Γ−1(α, β) is the inverse gamma distribution with shape α and scale β. Let ν , 2α and σ2 , β/α. Then the marginal distribution of θ follows the multivariate tdistribution with location µ01, scale matrix σ2I , and ν degrees of freedom:\nθ |µ0, σ2, ν ∼ Tν(µ01, σ2I),\nwhere 1 is the all-ones vector. The multivariate tdistribution density is\npT(θ |µ,Σ, ν)\n= Γ(ν+n2 )\n( 1 + 1ν (θ − µ) >Σ−1(θ − µ) )− ν+n2\nΓ(ν2 )π n/2νn/2|Σ|1/2\n.\nWhen ν is finite, the multivariate t-distribution is heavytailed: the probability of ‖θ‖ decreases at a polynomial rate as ‖θ‖ → ∞, compared to the exponential rate for a multivariate Gaussian. For example ν = σ2 = 1 and Σ = σ2 gives the multivariate Cauchy distribution. A multivariate Gaussian with covariance matrix Σ is recovered by taking ν → ∞. Placing a multivariate t-distribution prior on θ yields the following regret bound:\nTheorem 4.1 (Multivariate t-distribution regret). If θ ∼ Tν(0, σ 2I), thenR(Z,θ∗) is bounded by\nRmvtBayes(Z,θ ∗) ,\nν + n\n2 ln\n( 1 + ‖θ∗‖2\nνσ2 ) + n\n2 ln\n( (ν + 1)(ν + n)\nν2 + Tc(ν + 1)σ2 νn\n) .\n(7)\nTheorem 2.3 can be obtained as a special case of Theorem 4.1 by taking ν →∞.\nAssume ν ≥ 1. If ‖θ ∗‖2 νσ2 is small, then\nF (‖θ‖) , ν + n 2 ln\n( 1 + ‖θ∗‖2\nνσ2\n) ≈ n+ ν\nν\n‖θ∗‖2\nσ2 ,\nso for “small” values of ‖θ∗‖2 (relative to νσ2) the regret bound behaves similarly to having a Gaussian prior on θ. However, if ‖θ\n∗‖2 νσ2 1, then the regret bound grows only\nlogarithmically with ‖θ‖, as we would expect given that the multivariate t-distribution has heavy tails. Roughly speaking, F (x) can be thought of as switching from quadratic to logarithmic behavior when x2 = νσ2, since this is the value at which F switches from being convex to concave.\nIn general, the regret bound is large when the choice of θ∗ with small loss has large magnitude. If a Gaussian prior is used, the possibility of ‖θ∗‖ being large can be ameliorated by choosing σ2 large, since there is only a logarithmic regret penalty in σ. However, without a priori knowledge of how large the optimal θ∗ might be, choosing a multivariate t-distribution prior with a small value for ν and a moderate value for σ2 allows for guaranteed logarithmic regret in the magnitude of θ∗ no matter how large ‖θ∗‖ is. Hence, the use of the hierarchical (multivariate tdistribution) prior does in fact yield greater robustness than the non-hierarchical (Gaussian) prior.2\nWe can, in fact, develop more specific guidance on the choice of hyperparameters for the t-distribution. Our goal is to choose ν such that we obtain a t-distribution regret bound that is essentially as good as the Gaussian prior regret bound RGBayes = ‖θ∗‖2 2σ2 + n 2 ln ( 1 + Tcσ 2 n ) for small ‖θ∗‖ and better when ‖θ∗‖ is large. If we choose ν equal to a constant, then for n much larger than ν, we have RmvtBayes ≈ n2 ln ( 1 + ‖θ ∗‖2 νσ2 ) + n2 ln ( n ν + Tcσ2 n ) . In the case of ‖θ∗‖ small, we therefore have that the first term of RmvtBayes is approximately n ν ‖θ∗‖2 2σ2 , and thus larger than the first term of RGBayes by a factor of n/ν. Furthermore, for small T ncσ2 and any θ\n∗, the second term of RmvtBayes is approximately n2 ln(n/ν) whereas the second term of RGBayes is approximately Tcσ\n2 n. Thus, RmvtBayes with constant ν is not competitive with RGBayes in the large n and small T regimes. Instead consider the choice ν = Cn for constant C > 0, so\nRmvtBayes\n≈ (C + 1)n 2 ln\n( 1 + ‖θ∗‖2\nCnσ2\n) + n\n2 ln\n( C + 1\nC + Tcσ2 n ) ≤ C + 1\nC\n‖θ∗‖2\n2σ2 + n 2 ln\n( C + 1\nC + Tcσ2 n\n) .\nIn this case, by choosing a moderate value of C, we see that a multivariate t-distribution prior with ν = Cn has a competitive regret bound with a Gaussian prior in the small ‖θ∗‖ regime, and exponentially smaller regret bound as ‖θ∗‖ becomes large. Furthermore, the t-distribution prior remains competitive with the Gaussian prior when T is small.\n2A more rigorous version of this statement can be obtained for the Gaussian regression likelihood by using the fact that there is a matching lower bound on the regret for the Gaussian prior/Gaussian regression model (Kakade & Ng, 2004)."

A number of theoretical investigations of MTL and LTL haven been carried out, beginning with a series of papers by Baxter (cf. Baxter, 1997; 2000). Generically, such MTL and LTL frameworks involve two or more learning problems that are related to each other in some manner. The learning properties are investigated as the number of tasks and/or the number of examples from each task is increased. Baxter (2000) and Ben-David & Schuller (2003) give sample complexity bounds based on classical ideas from statistical and PAC learning theory. Baxter (1997) examines the asymptotic learning properties of hierarchical Bayesian models. Pentina & Lampert (2014) take a PAC-Bayesian approach while Hassan Mahmud & Ray (2007); Hassan Mahmud (2009), and Juba (2006) develop notions of task-relatedness from an (algorithmic) information-theoretic perspective.\nTypically, tasks are equated with probability distributions over examples (e.g., (x, y) pairs). It is assumed that the tasks are drawn i.i.d. from an unknown task distribution. The goal is to learn the individual tasks and learn about the task distribution. Alternatively, a notion of similarity can be used to relate the tasks: the more similar the tasks, the greater the advantage of learning them using multitask algorithms. In the online learning framework no assumptions are made about the distribution of examples, so we consider two MTL scenarios in line with the latter setting. In the first scenario, one example from one task is received at each time step. In the second, which is described in the Appendix E.1, at each time step an example for each task is received simultaneously."

(12)\nOf particular interest is the “one-shot learning” scenario, in which only one observation (or a small number of observations) from a source are made while many observations are made from some other sources. This setting is exactly that of the image classification problem of Salakhutdinov et al. (2011). For concreteness, consider a “large data” task with T (1) ncs2 and a “small data” task T (2) = 2, so that\nln ( 4 3n+T (1)cs2\nn+T (1)cs2\n) ≈ 0 and (12) becomes (approximately)\n4‖θ∗(1) − θ∗(2)‖2 + 3s2n ln ( 4n+ 6cs2\n3n+ 6cs2 ) ≤ ‖θ∗(1)‖2 + ‖θ∗(2)‖2 + 0.863s2n.\nBut even for n = 1, 3 ln ( 4n+6cs2\n3n+6cs2\n) < 0.863, so the\nhierarchical model has smaller regret bound as long as 4‖θ∗(1)−θ∗(2)‖2 ≤ ‖θ∗(1)‖2 +‖θ∗(2)‖2 +Cs2n for some constant 0 < C < 0.863.\nHierarchical models for one-shot learning are designed with the goal of providing good predictive power on the new problem (the second data source) even with a small number of examples from that problem. To see if this is in fact the case for the hierarchical prior considered here, we can investigate how much greater the regret bound is for T (2) > 0 than for T (2) = 0 with T (1) ncs2 fixed. With σ20 = σ\n2, (11) is greater in the former (K = 2) than the latter (K = 1) scenario by at most\n− ‖θ ∗(1)‖2 6s2 + ‖θ∗(2)‖2 3s2 + 2‖θ∗(1) − θ∗(2)‖2 3s2 + 3T (2)cs2 8 .\nSo if ‖θ∗(2)‖ is small and θ∗(2) and θ∗(1) are close in `2 distance, the regret bound for the second source is small.\nThe regret bound for the two-level prior in Salakhutdinov et al. (2011) is quite similar to that for the one-level prior. Let sk ∈ {1, . . . , S} denote the superclass of class k. In the case of image classification, object classes that have similar visual appearance would have a common superclass. The two-level prior consistes of an overall parameter prior β ∼ N(0, σ20I), superclass parameter priors µ\n(s) ∼ N(β, σ21I), and class parameter priors θ(k) ∼ N(µ(sk), σ22I). The regret bound for the two-level prior is\nc0 ∑K k=1 ‖θ ∗(k)‖2 + ∑ k<` ck`‖θ ∗(k) − θ∗(`)‖2\n+ n\n2\n∑K k=1O(ln(c1 + c2T (k))) +O(1), (13)\nwhere c0, c1, c2 > 0 are constants, ck` = c̃sk if sk = s` and ck` = c̃sks` if sk 6= s`. Furthermore, c̃s > c̃s′s′′ for all s, s′, s′′ ∈ {1, . . . , S}. Hence, the regret bound’s being small depends more on the parameter vectors in the same superclass being close to each other than on parameter vectors from different superclasses being close to each other. See Appendix E.2 for details. The two-level regret bound well-explains the results of Salakhutdinov et al. (2011). The poor performance on image classes with very different visual appearance from the other classes is unsurprising since the parameter vectors that predict these classes well are going to have large `2 distance from the parameter vectors of other object classes."

      "heading" : "4.3. Hierarchical Priors for Feature Selection",
      "text" : "A shortcoming of the priors investigated so far is the poor dependence on the feature space dimension n. For example, the Gaussian prior regret bound is (approximately)\nLBayes(Z) ≤ inf θ∗ Lθ∗(Z) +\n1 2σ2 ‖θ∗‖2 + Tcσ\n2\n2 ,\nwhen Tcσ2 n, so the regret may grow linearly in this regime.4 In the infinite-dimensional case, Gaussian processes can be used while still obtaining meaningful regret bounds (Kakade et al., 2005; Seeger et al., 2008). However, methods that are applicable to high-dimensional problems for which n T but n is still finite are of great general interest. For example, in the image classification example from the introduction, the feature vector has n ≈ 5000, whereas most object classes have fewer than 200 training examples. In high-dimensional problems it is desirable to use feature selection or sparse methods to reduce the effective dimension of the problem, with the aim of achieving better generalization performance and increasing interpretability of the model. A popular non-Bayesian approach for inducing sparsity is `1 regularization, such as the lasso for linear regression (Tibshirani, 1996). A Bayesian approach is the Bayesian lasso: the `1 regularizer of the lasso is converted into a prior, which amounts to placing a Laplace prior on θ (Park & Casella, 2008). However, the Bayesian lasso still seems to lead to a linear dependence on the dimension because the model puts zero prior mass on a component being exactly zero. A regret bound for the Bayesian lasso can be found in the Appendix F.1 (we suspect that our bound is essentially tight, though we have been unable to obtain a matching lower bound).\nAnother common Bayesian approach to inducing sparsity is to use a hierarchical “spike and slab” prior, which places positive probability on a component being exactly zero (Ishwaran & Rao, 2005; Narisetty & He, 2014). One version of the spike and slab prior is\nzi | p ∼ Bern(p) and θi | zi ∼ ziδ0 + (1− zi)N(0, σ2).\nSo with probability p component i is zero and with probability 1 − p it is Gaussian-distributed. Integrating out zi yields prior density p0(θi) = pδ0(θi)+(1−p)N(θi | 0, σ2). Let ‖v‖0 denote the `0 norm of the vector v. Theorem 4.3. For the spike-and-slab prior, if m = ‖θ∗‖0, thenR(Z,θ∗) is bounded by\nRSSBayes(Z,θ ∗) ,\n1 2σ2 ‖θ∗‖2 +m ln 1 1− p (14)\n+ (n−m) ln 1 p + m 2 ln\n( 1 + Tcσ2\nm\n) .\n4Dimension-independent regret bounds for the priors already considered can be obtained, but at the price of a constant greater than one front of the Lθ∗(Z) term. See, e.g., Banerjee (2007).\nIn particular, if p , q1/n for some constant 0 < q < 1, then RSSBayes(Z,θ ∗) is at most\n‖θ∗‖2\n2σ2 +m ln\nn\n1− q + ln\n1 q + m 2 ln ( 1 + Tcσ2 m ) . (15)\nThe theorem shows the importance of properly scaling p with the dimension of the problem. If p is kept fixed, then the regret has linear dependence on n. However, by scaling p to be q1/n, we increase the probability of a component being zero as the dimension increases and thus are able to ensure that the regret is only logarithmic in nwhile simultaneously maintaining the appropriate linear dependence on m. The constant q turns out to be the prior probability that all of the components are set to zero. More generally, ( n k ) q(n−k)/n(1 − q1/n)k n→∞→ q ln k q−1\nk! , the limiting prior probability of choosing exactly k components to be non-zero. Hence, as n → ∞, the prior over the number of non-zero components converges to a Poisson distribution with rate parameter ln q−1. So when n is large the expected number of non-zero components is≈ ln q−1. The choice of p close to 1 for large n is in notable contrast to the common practice of setting p = 1/2 or some other constant independent of n (Schneider & Corcoran, 2004; Ishwaran & Rao, 2005). Our results strongly recommend against this practice. See Narisetty & He (2014) for a discussion of purely statistical reasons to scale p with the dimension."

In Section 4, we used first our main result, Theorem 2.2, to analyze three specific hierarchical priors that, particularly when combined with a logistic or Gaussian regression likelihood, are widely used in practice. Indeed, these prior-likelihood combinations have often been used with substantial success even in situations when they are known to be rather poor models for the data generating mechanism. Our analysis offers an explanation for this success. The priors we analyzed are representative of the variety of ways in which hierarchical models are employed: representing uncertainty in hyperparameters, tying together related groups of observations, and creating more complicated distributions from simpler ones. Thus, our results answer Questions Q1-Q4 in some important cases and exemplify a learning-theoretic analysis technique that can be applied to other hierarchical models. In addition, using our second main result, Theorem 3.2, all of the insights gained in Section 4 for the log-loss regret setting apply equally well to the batch setting of statistical risk with bounded loss, further extending the applicability of our conclusions."

Second, even if the previous condition does not hold, the difference in ‖θ∗(1) − θ∗(2)‖ must be significantly larger than the expected magnitudes of ‖θ∗(1)‖2 and ‖θ∗(2)‖2 for the hierarchical model to have a larger regret bound than the non-hierarchical model. Thus, the use of the hierarchical model has potentially significantly reduced regret compared to the non-hierarchical model.\n5 For clarity, we have replaced 3 ln(4/3) with the bound 0.863."

In both cases, the distributions are fat-tailed: there are a few categories with many training examples and many categories with a few training examples. It was hypothesized that by using a hierarchical Bayesian model, the classes with large amounts of labeled data could be used to construct better classifiers for the classes with small amounts of labeled data.

Q2 Can we understand when a flat model should be preferred to a hierarchical one to avoid unfavorable sharing? Q3 More generally, can we obtain guidance on the best type of prior for the problem at hand? Perhaps a different hierarchical prior would have been better suited to learning the image classifiers. For example, could placing hyperpriors on the variance parameters lead to greater “robustness” for object categories such as ‘umbrella’ and ‘merchandise,’ whose visual appearance differs from other object categories? Q4 Once the form of the prior has been chosen, how should hyperparameters be set to maximize learning? The settings of the variance hyperparameters was left unspecified by Salakhutdinov et al.

We present a set of analytical tools for understanding hierarchical priors in both the online and batch learning settings. We provide regret bounds under log-loss, which show how certain hierarchical models compare, in retrospect, to the best single model in the model class. We also show how to convert a Bayesian log-loss regret bound into a Bayesian risk bound for any bounded loss, a result which may be of independent interest. Risk and regret bounds for Student’s t and hierarchical Gaussian priors allow us to formalize the concepts of “robustness” and “sharing statistical strength.” Priors for feature selection are investigated as well. Our results suggest that the learning-theoretic benefits of using hierarchical priors can often come at little cost on practical problems.",
