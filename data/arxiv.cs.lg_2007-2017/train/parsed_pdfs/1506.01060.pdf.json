      "text" : "Subspace learning is becoming more and more popular thanks to its capabilities of good interpretation. However, existing approaches do not adapt both local structure and self reconstruction very well. We propose local-structure adaptive sparse subspace learning (ASSL) model for unsupervised feature selection. In this paper, we formulate the feature selection process as a subspace learning problem and incorporate a regularization term to preserve the local structure of the data. Furthermore, we develop a greedy algorithm to establish the basic model and an iterative strategy based on an accelerated block coordinate descent is used to solve the local-structure ASSL problem. We also provide the global convergence analysis of the proposed ASSL algorithm.

      "text" : "With the advances in data processing, the dimensionality of the data also increases and can be extremely high in many fields such as computer vision, machine learning and image processing. The high dimensionality of the data not only greatly increases the time and storage space required to realize data analysis but also introduces much redundancy and noise which can decrease the accuracy of the ensuing method. Hence, dimensionality reduction is an important and often necessary preprocessing step to facilitate clustering and classification. There are two widely used dimensionality reduction approaches, namely: subspace learning and feature selection. Subspace learning aims to learn a projection which can map the original features into a lower-dimensional subspace by some transformation forming new features [1, 2]. Feature selection aims to select a subset of the features following a certain criterion [3]. Both the two approaches can successfully address the problems we mentioned at the beginning of the discussion [4, 5].\nEmail addresses: nzhouuestc@gmai.com (Nan Zhou), yangyang.xu@uwaterloo.ca (Yangyang Xu), hcheng@uestc.edu.cn (Hong Cheng), JunFang@uestc.edu.cn (Jun Fang), wpedrycz@ualberta.ca (Witold Pedrycz) Preprint submitted to Elsevier October 11, 2017\nar X\niv :1\n50 6.\n01 06\n0v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 2\nJ un\n2 01\nIn general, subspace learning methods can be categorized into two classes: supervised and unsupervised subspace learning, depending on whether the subspace learning process is supplied with class labels. The most classic subspace learning method is Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [6] which considers the global structures of the data. Its goal is to find a set of mutually orthogonal basis function which can capture the directions of maximum variance in the data. The local structure always has more discriminative information for specific tasks for both supervised and unsupervised situation, hence many subspace learning methods are proposed by preserving the local structure of the data by graph embeding. Some popular ones include Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) [7], Neighborhood Preserving Embedding [8], Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [9] and Sparsity Preserving Projections [10]. However, all these models only consider the local structure or global structure.\nFeature selection methods also can be categorized into supervised and unsupervised ones. The labels of the data contain essential discriminative information which can guide the feature selection process. Hence, the supervised feature selection methods can often efficiently select useful features. Commonly used supervised feature selection methods include Fisher score [11], Pearson correlation coefficient [12], and mutual information [13]. For some data mining tasks, however, we do not have label information, and this calls for unsupervised feature selection. Without label information to guide, unsupervised feature selection methods have to explore the hidden structure in the data. The intrinsic structure information that is often used includes samples similarity [14, 7], local structure [15, 16], and global structure [17, 18].\nThe blessing of dimensionality tells that the high dimensional data always has a lower dimensional structure that inspires us to pursue a small subset of the possibly overwhelmingly large number of features. In recent years, sparsity regularized methods have been widely used in many fields such as computer vision [19, 20], image processing [21], signal recovery [22] and so on. Group sparsity which is used in multi-task learning [23] and joint representation [24] is also widely used in feature selection tasks [25, 26, 27]. It models the feature selection process as a regression problem and imposes the group sparsity on the weight matrix to select the useful features.\nThe paper comes with the following contributions:\n1. We propose a novel unsupervised subspace learning model, which considers both global reconstruction information and local structure information of the data. Because of the group sparsity regularization term, this model is suitable for feature selection tasks. The model is derived by relaxing an existing combinatorial model with its 0-1 variables relaxed to nonnegative ones, and since the solution of the original model is extremely sparse, it further employs a group sparsity regularization term to promote sparsity of the solution.\n2. Due to the combinatorial characteristics of the original model, we, for the first time, propose a greedy algorithm to solve the problem. The relaxed model results in a continuous but nonconvex program. Among various continuous optimization methods, we choose an accelerated block coordinate descent (BCD) method. The BCD method utilizes the bi-convexity structure of the problem and has been found to be efficient for our purposes.\n3. We establish a global convergence result of the BCD method for our problem by assuming the existence of a full rank limit point. Because of the peculiarity of the formulated problem, the result is new and not implied by any existing convergence results of BCD.\n4. We conduct extensive experimental studies. The proposed methods are tested on six realworld datasets coming from different areas and compared to five state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection algorithms. The results demonstrate the superiority of our methods,\nin particular the second one, over all the other compared methods. In addition, we study the sensitivity of the second method to model parameters and observe that it can perform in a stable manner well within a large range of the parameters.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we give a brief review of recent related studies on feature selection. Sect. 3 reviews two local structure preservation methods and presents a local structure preserved sparse subspace learning model. In Sect. 4, we present an algorithms leading to the solution of the problem. Convergence results are also shown. Experimental results are reported in Sect. 5. Finally, we conclude this paper in Sect. 6."

      "text" : "The well-known subspace learning method is PCA [6], which maximizes the global data structure information in the principal space and hence it is optimal for data reconstruction. Data reconstruction capturing the discriminative information plays a crucial role in pattern recognition [28]. Local structure always contains important discriminative information [29]. Therefore, many subspace learning methods preserve different local structures of the data for different problems and can get better performance than traditional PCA. Many of these methods use the linear extension of graph embeding (LGE) methods to preserve the local structure. With different choices of the graph adjoint matrix, LGE framework will lead to many subspace learning methods. Some popular ones include Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) [6], Locality Preserving Projection (LPP) [7] and Neighborhood Preserving Embedding (NPE) [8]. LDA is a supervised subspace learning method. It determines the linear projection which can maximally separate the data between different classes and clusters the data in the same class. LPP can be used in both supervised and unsupervised scenarios by adding or without the label information in the graph. It is used to find the projection which can preserve the nearest neighbors information. NPE is suitable for both supervised and unsupervised scenarios. It finds the linear projection which can best preserve the nearest neighbors’ reconstruction property. However, all these locality preservation methods involve dense matrices eigen-decomposition which is very expensive in both time and memory. Considering the drawback, Cai et al. [30] proposed a two-step Spectral Regression (SR) method to transform the eigen-decomposition problem into two steps regression problem which is very efficient and flexible to add the regularization term in the regression step. However, this method only considers the local structure.\nThe blessing of dimensionality tells us the high dimensional data always has the redundancy, hence sparsity as a useful tool to reduce the redundancy has been widely used in many areas, such as computer vision, data processing and machine learning. Considering the redundancy of the subspace learning, Zou et al. [31] proposed an elegant sparse PCA method (SPCA), which transforms the traditional PCA problem into regression problem and uses the “Elastic Net” framework to solve `1 regularization problem. However, sometimes, the samples in the subspace learning might be outliers, especially in the problem of background modeling or face recognition. To overcome this problem, Wang et al. [2] proposed a robust elastic net model (REN) which adds the M-estimator in the least square term of the SPCA model and improves the robustness of the SPCA. Both the SPCA and REN only consider the reconstruction information for the learned subspace. Considering the locality preservation, Moghaddam et al. [32] proposed a spectral bounds framework for sparse subspace learning. However, the greedy algorithm they proposed has very high computation complexity in backward elimination step, hence it is not suitable for high dimensional data. Cai et al. [33] proposed a unified sparse subspace learning method\nbased on spectral regression model, which adds the `1 regularization term in the regression step. However, all these sparse subspace learning methods only consider one type of information: local information or global reconstruction information.\nBecause of the connections between subspace learning and feature selection, recently, some feature selection methods that combine the feature selection process with subspace learning have been proposed. Cai et al. [5] combined the sparse subspace learning with feature selection and proposed the Multi-Cluster Feature Selection (MCFS) method. In the feature selection process, the transformation matrix can be seen as the weight matrix for feature selection. However, MCFS method uses the `1 regularization term to control the weight matrix. However, as mentioned by Gu et al. in [4], `1 term is not quite suitable for feature selection, and they used the `2,1 regularization term in the regression step of the subspace learning process to control the weight matrix and improve the feature selection result. However, both of these methods only use the local structure information in subspace learning. Considering the global reconstruction information, Wang et al. [34] proposed an unsupervised feature selection framework, which used the global reconstruction information in subspace learning and used the orthogonality to constrain the weight matrix for a specific feature selection task. However, in general, such a requirement cannot be satisfied since feature weight vectors are not necessarily orthogonal with each other in practice. In addition, it only considers the reconstruction information and does not take local structure of the data into consideration. In practical application, the local structure often contains essential discriminative information as demonstrated in [29]. Instead of enforcing the feature weight matrix to be orthogonal, our model uses a regularization term to encourage row group sparsity, which is more reasonable [4] and in addition, it includes a local structure preserving term to adapt the local structure of the data.\nTo facilitate the presentation of the material, Table 1 contains the notation used in this study."

The first model is of combinatorial nature, only allowing 0-1 valued variables. The modelling idea is intuitive, but it is not easy to find a good approximate solution to the problem. The second model relaxes the first one and becomes its continuous counterpart. Various optimization methods can be utilized to determine its solution. More importantly, we find that the relaxed model can most times give better practical performance than the original one; refer the numerical results reported in Section 5."

      "text" : "Given n data samples {pi}ni=1 located in the d-dimensional space, the objective of feature selection is to find a small set of features that can capture most useful information of the data and better serve for classification or clustering purpose. One natural way to measure the information content is to see how close the original data samples are to the learned subspace spanned by the selected features. Mathematically, the distance of a vector x to a subspace X can be represented as ‖x − PX(x)‖2, where PX denotes the projection onto X and ‖ · ‖2 is the Euclidean 2-norm. Hence, the feature selection problem can be described as follows\nmin W,H 1 2 ‖X − XWH‖2F s.t. W ∈ {0, 1}d×K , W>1d×1 = 1K×1, ‖W1K×1‖0 = K.\n(1)\nwhere X = [p1,p2, . . . ,pn]> ∈ Rn×d. Concerning the proposed model, we make a few remarks:\n1. Given W, the optimal H produces the coefficients of all d features projected on the subspace spanned by the selected features. Hence, the (1) expresses the distance of X to the learned subspace. 2. The matrix W is the selection matrix with the entries of “0” or “1”. The constraint W>1d×1 = 1K×1 enforces that each column of W has only one “1”. Therefore, at most K features are selected.\n3. The constraint ‖W1K×1‖0 = K guarantees that no feature will be selected more than once, and thus exactly K features will be chosen.\nThe recent work [34] mentions to use the 0-1 feature selection matrix, but it does not explicitly formulate an optimization model like the (1). As shown in [29], a local structure of the data can often include important discriminative information to distinguish different samples. To make the learned subspace preserve local structure, one can add a regularization term to the objective to promote such structural information, namely, to solve the regularized model\nmin W,H 1 2 ‖X − XWH‖2F + µLoc(W) s.t. W ∈ {0, 1}d×K , W>1d×1 = 1K×1, ‖W1K×1‖`0 = K,\n(2)\nwhere Loc(W) is a local structure promoting regularization term, and µ is a parameter to balance the data fitting and regularization. In the next subsection, we introduce different forms of Loc(W)."

      "text" : "The problem (2) is of combinatorial nature, and we do not have many choices to directly solve it. In the next section, we develop a greedy algorithm, which chooses K features one by one, with each selection decreasing the objective the most among all the remaining features. Although the greedy method can sometimes produce a satisfactory solution, it does not perform reliably. For\nthis reason, we seek an alternative way to select features by first relaxing (2) to a continuous problem and then employing a reliable optimization method to solve the relaxed problem. As observed in our tests, the relaxed method can perform comparably well with and most of times much better than the original one.\nAs remarked at the end of Section 3.1, any feasible solution W is nonnegative and has at most K non-zero rows. If K d (that usually is satisfied), then W has lots of zero rows. Based on these observations, we relax the 0-1 constraint to nonnegativity constraint and the hard constraints WT 1d×1 = 1K×1, ‖W1K×1‖`0 = K to g(W) ≤ K, where g(W) measures the row-sparsity of W. One choice of g(W) is group Lasso [37], i.e.,\ng(W) = d∑\ni=1\n‖Wi.‖2, (9)\nwhere Wi. denotes the i-th row of W. Some other alternatives of g can also be used for promoting row-sparsity, such as group infinity norm used in [38, 39] for multi-class support vector machine. Hence, we relax (2) to read as follows\nmin W,H 1 2 ‖X − XWH‖2F + µLoc(W)\ns.t. W ≥ 0, g(W) ≤ K, (10)\nor equivalently\nmin W,H 1 2 ‖X − XWH‖2F + µLoc(W) + βg(W)\ns.t. W ≥ 0, (11)\nwhere β is a parameter corresponding to K. We focus on (11) only because it is easier to solve than (10). The drawback of using (11) instead of (10) is that we need to pay more attention to choose the parameter β. However, as shown in Section 5, a wide range of values of β can give satisfactory practical performance.\nBefore completing this section, let us make some remarks on the relaxed model. Originally, W is restricted to have exactly K non-zeros, so it should be extremely sparse. One can consider to include a sparsity-promoting term (e.g., `1-norm) in the objective of (11). However, doing so is not necessary since both g(W) and the nonnegativity constraint encourage sparsity of W, and numerically we notice that W output by our algorithm is indeed very sparse. Another point worth mentioning is that the elements of W given by (11) are real numbers and do not automatically select K features. For the purpose of feature selection, after obtaining a solution W, we choose the features corresponding to the K rows of W that have the largest norms because larger values imply more important roles played by the features.\nOur model is similar to the Matrix Factorization Feature Selection (MFFS) model proposed in [34]. The difference is that the MFFS model restricts the matrix W to be orthogonal while we only encourage the sparsity of W. Although orthogonal W makes their model closer to the original model (1), it increases difficulty of solving their problem. In addition, MFFS does not utilize local structure preserving term as we do and thus may lose some important local information. The numerical tests in Sec. 5 demonstrate that the proposed model along with an iterative method can produce better results than those obtained by using the MFFS method."

      "heading" : "4.1. Its Greedy Strategy",
      "text" : "In this subsection, a greedy algorithm is developed for selecting K out of d features based on (2). The idea is as follows: each time, we select one from the remaining unselected features such that the objective value is decreased the most. We begin the design of the algorithm by making the following observation.\nObservation 1. Let I1 and I2 be two index sets of features. Assume I1 ⊆ I2, and XI1 and XI2 are submatrices of X with columns indexed by I1 and I2 respectively. Then\nmin H1 ‖X − XI1 H1‖2F ≥ minH2 ‖X − XI2 H2‖2F . (12)\nFrom the above observation, if the current index set of selected features is I, the data fitting will become better if we enlarge I by adding more features. Below we describe in details on how to choose such additional features. Assume X is normalized such that\n‖x j‖2 = 1, j = 1, . . . , d, (13)\nwhere x j denotes the j-th column of X. Let I be the current index set of selected features. The optimal H to minH ‖X − XIH‖F is given by\nH∗ = (X>IXI) †X>IX, (14)\nwhere † denotes the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of a matrix. Now consider to add one more feature into I, say the j-th one. Then the lowest data fitting error is\nmin h ‖X − XIH∗ − x jh‖2F\n= min h ‖h‖2F − 2〈h, x>j (X − XIH∗)〉 + ‖X − XIH∗‖2F = − ‖x>j (X − XIH∗)‖22 + ‖X − XIH∗‖2F ,\nwhere the last equality is achieved at h = x>j (X − XIH∗). Hence, we can choose j such that ‖x>j (X − XIH∗)‖2 is the largest among all features not present in I.\nCarrying out a comparison using ‖x>j (X − XIH∗)‖2, we find that ‖x>j (X − XIH∗)‖1 can serve better. It turns out that the latter is exactly the correlation between x j and the residual X − XIH∗. Denote the correlation between xi and X as\nCor(xi, X) = d∑\ns=1\n|x>i xs|.\nAs shown in [40], if Cor(xi, X) is large, then the columns of X can be better linearly represented by xi. To preserve local structure, we need also incorporate Loc(W). If the set of selected features is I, then\nLoc(W) = Tr(W>X>LXW) = ∑ i∈I x>i Lxi.\nAssuming L = D − S , i.e., using the LPP method in section 3.2.2 (that is used throughout our tests), we have from (13) that\nmin j<I x>j Lx j ⇔ maxj<I x > j S x j.\nTherefore, we can enlarge I by adding one more feature index j∗ such that\nj∗ = argmax j<I Cor(x j, X − XIH∗) + x>j S x j,\nwhere H∗ is given in (14), and we have set µ = 1 in (2) for simplicity.

Compared to traditional optimization methods such as gradient descent and the interior-point method, BCU can have much lower computational complexity and also maintain fast convergence.

For i < I, we must have x∗i = 0 because if x∗i > 0, setting the i-th component to zero and keeping all others unchanged will simultaneously decrease (xi − yi)2 and ‖x‖2. Hence, we can reduce (22) to the following form\nmin xI≥0 1 2 ‖xI − yI‖22 + λ‖xI‖2. (23)\nWithout nonnegativity constraint on xI, the minimizer of (23) is given by item 2 of Theorem 1 (for example, see [44]). Note that the given x∗I is nonnegative. Hence, it solves (23), and this completes the proof.\nThe above proof gives a way to find the solution of (22). Using this method, we can explicitly form the solution of (17a) by the subroutine Prox-NGL in Algorithm 2, where Y ∈ Rd×K and λ > 0 are inputs, and W is the output. Arranging the above discusstion together, we have the pseudocode see Algorithm 3 for solving (11).\nAlgorithm 3 Local-Structure Adaptive Sparse Subspace Learning (ASSL) 1: Input: Data matrix X ∈ Rn×d, the number of selected features K and parameter β, µ. 2: Output: Index set of selected features I ⊆ {1, . . . , d} with |I| = K 3: Initialize W0, H0, choose a positive number δω < 1; set k = 1. 4: while Not convergence do 5: Compute Lkw and ωk according to (20) and (21) respectively. 6: Let Ŵk = Wk + ωk(Wk −Wk−1). 7: Update Wk+1 ← Prox-NGL(Ŵk − 1Lkw∇W f (Ŵ\nk,Hk), βLkw ). 8: Update Hk+1 ← (19). 9: if F(Wk+1,Hk+1) ≥ F(Wk,Hk) then\n10: Set Ŵk = Wk. 11: else 12: Let k ← k + 1. 13: end if 14: end while 15: Normalize each column of W. 16: Sort ‖Wi.‖2, i = 1, . . . , d and select features correspondting to the largest K one."

Any finite limit point of {(Wk,Hk)}∞k=1 is a critical point.\nDue to the coercivity of g(W) and the nonincreasing monotonicity of the objective value, {Wk} must be bounded. However, in general, we cannot guarantee the boundedness of {Hk} because XWk may be rank-degenerate (i.e., not full rank). As shown in the next theorem, if we have rank-nondegeneracy of XWk in the limit, a stronger convergence result can be established.\nTheorem 3 (Global sequence convergence). Let {(Wk,Hk)}∞k=1 be the sequence generated from Algorithm ASSL.

LS: Laplacian score (LS) method uses the Laplacian score to evaluate effectiveness of the features. It selects the features individually that retain the samples’ local similarity specified by a similarity matrix. [7].\n2. MCFS: Multi-cluster feature selection (MCFS) is two-step method, and it formulates the feature selection process as a spectral information regression problem with `1-norm regularization term [5].\n2http://featureselection.asu.edu/datasets.php 3http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/Data/data.html\n3. UDFS: Unsupervised discriminative feature selection (UDFS) method combines the data’s local discriminative property and the `2,1-norm sparse constraint in one convex model to select the features which have the highest power of local discriminative property [15]. 4. RSR: Regularized self-representation (RSR) feature selection method uses the `2,1-norm to measure the fitting error and also `2,1-norm to promote sparsity [25]. Specifically, it solves the following problem:\nmin W ‖X − XW‖2,1 + β‖W‖2,1.\n5. MFFS: Matrix factorization feature selection (MFFS) method [34] is similar to ours. It performs the subspace learning and feature selection process simultaneously with the orthogonality constraint on the feature selection matrix W. Specifically, it solves the following problem:\nmin W,H 1 2 ‖X − XWH‖2F\ns.t. W ≥ 0, H ≥ 0, W>W = I. (25)\nThere are some parameters we need to set in advance. The number of selected features is taken from {20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100} for all datasets. We use the LPP method in section 3.2.2 to preserve local structure of the data in ASSL because both MCFS and LS use the Laplacian graph, and we set the number of nearest neighbors to m = 5 for LS, MCFS, UDFS and ASSL. The parameter m is required by LS, MCFS and ASSL to build a similarity matrix and UDFS to build the local total scatter and between-class scatter matrices. For simplicity, the parameter of local structure preserving term is fixed to be µ = 1 in ASSL for all the tests discussed in Sections 5.3.1 and 5.3.2. We study the sensitivity of ASSL to µ in Section 5.3.3. The sparsity parameter for UDFS, RSR, and ASSL is tuned from {0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 40, 70, 100}. After completing the feature selection process, we use the K-means algorithm [47] to cluster the samples using the selected features. Because the performance of K-means depends on the initial point, we run it 20 times with different random starting points and report the average value.\nThe compared algorithms are evaluated based on their clustering results. For each sample of all datasets, we set its class number as the cluster number. To measure the clustering performance, we use clustering accuracy (ACC) and normalized mutual information (NMI), which are defined below. Let pi and qi be the predicted and true labels of the i−th sample, respectively. The ACC is computed as\nACC = ∑n\ni=1 δ(qi,map(pi)) n , (26)\nwhere δ(a, b) = 1 if a = b and δ(a, b) = 0 otherwise, and map(·) is a permutation mapping that maps each predicted label to the equivalent true label. We use the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm [48] to realize such a mapping. High value of ACC indicates the predicted labels are close to the true ones, and thus the higher ACC is, the better the clustering results are. The NMI is used to measure the similarity of two clustering results. For two label vectors P and Q, it is defined as\nNMI(P,Q) = I(P,Q)\n√ H(P)H(Q) , (27)\nwhere I(P,Q) is the mutual information of P and Q, H(P) and H(Q) are the entropies of P and Q [49]. In our experiments, P contains the clustering labels using the selected features and Q the true labels of samples in the dataset. Higher value of NMI(P,Q) implies that P better predicts Q."

From the figures, we see that in most cases, the proposed ASSL method gives the best results, and selecting reasonably many features (but far less than the total number of features), it can give comparable and even better clustering results than those by using all features. Hence, the feature selection eliminates the redundancy of the data for clustering purpose.

However, existing approaches do not adapt both local structure and self reconstruction very well. We propose local-structure adaptive sparse subspace learning (ASSL) model for unsupervised feature selection. In this paper, we formulate the feature selection process as a subspace learning problem and incorporate a regularization term to preserve the local structure of the data. Furthermore, we develop a greedy algorithm to establish the basic model and an iterative strategy based on an accelerated block coordinate descent is used to solve the local-structure ASSL problem. We also provide the global convergence analysis of the proposed ASSL algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world datasets to show the superiority of the proposed approach over several state-of-the-art unsupervised feature selection approaches.",
