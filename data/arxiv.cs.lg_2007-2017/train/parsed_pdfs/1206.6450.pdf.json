      "text" : "Sparse coding, also called dictionary learning, is an approach to approximating a collection of signals by sparse linear combinations of a codewords chosen from a shared, learned dictionary. The method was proposed by Olshausen & Field (1996) for encoding natural images, with the motivation of developing a simple computational model of neural coding in the visual cortex. Through the use of sparsity and a large learned\nAppearing in Proceedings of the 29 th International Conference on Machine Learning, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK, 2012. Copyright 2012 by the author(s)/owner(s).\ndictionary of codewords, sparse coding is able to efficiently capture a rich collection of features that are common to a population of signals. Variants of sparse coding have enjoyed considerable success in computer vision (Elad & Aharon, 2006; Lee et al., 2007; Mairal et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2010; Bengio et al., 2009).\nIn this paper we apply the intuition behind sparse coding to design a new procedure for multivariate regression with data that fall into possibly overlapping groups or tasks. In traditional multivariate regression, the data consist of a set of response vectors Y ∈ Rq, and for each Y , a corresponding covariate vector X ∈ Rp. In a vector autoregressive time series model, for instance, Y = Zt is a vector at time t, and X = Zt−1 is the vector at the previous step. In predicting brain activation patterns in neuroscience, Y might be the neural activations in different regions of the brain with X a vector of external stimuli. Under a linear model, Y = BX + ǫ, where B ∈ Rq×p is a matrix of parameters and ǫ ∈ Rq is a random, mean zero error vector.\nIn many applications, the data naturally occur in groups or tasks, and assuming the same model Y = BX + ǫ for each group may be unjustified. For instance, in a non-stationary time series, the distribution of Y = Zt varies over time. In the neuroscience example, different people may have different neuronal activation patterns. In both cases it may be natural to place the data into possibly overlapping groups. More generally, the groups could be determined by any factor in the data or experimental design.\nIn settings where the input and output dimensions p and q are high, the number of parameters in B may be be too large to estimate accurately from limited data. One approach to estimating reduced complexity models is to perform a least squares regression with a rank constraint on the coefficient matrix B. The nuclear norm serves as a convex surrogate for low rank\nconstraints, and has be recently studied in the context of multivariate regression (Yuan et al., 2007; Negahban & Wainwright, 2011). For grouped data, a different model could be estimated for each group using this approach; however, carrying out separate regressions ignores commonality between the groups, and worsens the problem of limited data.\nOur approach is to estimate the parameter matrices as\nB̂(g) = K∑\nk=1\nα (g) k Dk\nwhere each dictionary entry Dk is a low rank matrix, and α(g) = (α (g) 1 , . . . , α (g) K ) is a sparse vector; both {Dk} and {α(g)} are learned from data. The coefficients α\n(g) k are estimated for each group g, but the\n“codewords” or “dictionary elements” Dk are shared across groups. This exploits the same intuition behind sparse coding for image analysis. Sparsity allows the dictionary entries Dk to specialize and capture predictive aspects of the data shared by many groups, while the coefficients α(g) tailor the model to the specific group g. Allowing the size K of the dictionary to be large enables a rich class of parameter matrices to be modeled, while a low rank condition on the individual codeword matrices Dk allows them to be estimated from limited data.\nWe perform both a “pessimistic” and “optimistic” analysis of our method. In the pessimistic analysis, the model may not be correct; that is, we do not assume any underlying common structure among the groups. In this case the model cannot achieve lower risk than the alternative of separate low rank regressions within each group. However, our analysis shows that the method suffers little excess risk relative to separate regressions. In the optimistic analysis, when the learned dictionary has captured common structure between the groups, the method produces an accurate estimator with much lower sample complexity than required by low rank regression. In both analyses, we measure statistical accuracy through non-asymptotic bounds on the excess risk R(D,α(g)) − R(B∗). We show that the new procedure is effective and practical with experiments on simulated data and brain imaging data, reported in Section 6."

      "text" : "Mairal et al. (2010) have studied a different way of using dictionary learning for supervised tasks; in this approach one first encodes data X and then uses the encoding to perform classification or regression. Our work is more related to multi-task learning (Caruana, 1997; Evgeniou & Pontil, 2004) and is in particular a\ngeneralization of a model by Argyriou et al. (2006). They require that all α(g) have the same sparsity pattern, so that all groups use the same small subset of dictionary elements. By allowing different groups to use different subsets of the dictionary, our model is much more flexible, though at the cost of requiring a non-convex optimization. Kang et al. (2011) used mixed integer programming to generalize the model of Argyriou et al. (2006) although our formulation is still more flexible and our optimization simpler. The approach of Liu et al. (2010) could be adapted to our setting, although their notion of task-relatedness is very different from ours.\nExisting approaches to theoretical analysis of multitask learning differ significantly from our analysis by focusing on PAC-learnability with respect to a more abstract notion of task-relatedness (Maurer, 2006; Ben-David & Schuller, 2003). Theoretical analysis of sparse coding is rather limited. Some work studies the generalization error of dictionary learning (Vainsencher et al., 2010; Maurer & Pontil, 2010) and the local correctness of the non-convex objective for dictionary learning (Geng et al., 2011). Jeong & Kim (2009) consider sparse approximability and prove an information theoretic lower bound on sparse approximability of general p-dimensional vectors. They further show, non-constructively, that the lower bound can be achieved via an optimally constructed dictionary. We instead consider sparse approximability of a variety of structured spaces with respect to a dictionary that could plausibly be learned by a practical procedure."

Let X (g) i ∈ Rp, Y (g) i ∈ Rq denote the explanatory and response variables for the ith sample in group g. For each group, we let B∗(g) = arg minB(g) R(B\n(g)) be the oracle regression matrix where we define\nR(B(g)) = EX(g),Y (g)‖Y (g) −B(g)X(g)‖2F .\nFor convenience, we will assume the sample size n is the same for all groups, noting that more generally it will vary with g.

      "text" : "The basic idea underlying conditional sparse coding is to learn a collection of low rank matrices {D1, ...,DK} (a dictionary) and estimate B̂(g) as a sparse linear combination of the dictionary entries. We optimize the overall objective function f(α,D) defined by\nf(α,D) =\n1\nG\nG∑\ng=1\n{ 1\nn\n∥∥Y (g) − ( K∑\nk=1\nα (g) k Dk\n) X(g) ∥∥2 F + λ‖α(g)‖1 }\nwhere the optimization minα minD∈CD(τ) f(α,D) is carried out over the set\nCD(τ) = { D ∈ Rq×p : ‖D‖∗ ≤ τ and ‖D‖2 ≤ 1 } .\nThe ℓ1 norm penalty induces sparsity on the α vectors and the nuclear-norm restriction forces the matrices Dk to be low rank. The spectral norm constraint ensures no particular dictionary entry can be too large, and serves as an identifiability constraint; a similar constraint in sparse coding requires that all dictionary vectors must have norm no larger than one.\nThe objective function is biconvex but not jointly convex in α and D. Thus, we follow the standard sparse coding approach and alternately optimize over {α(g)} with fixed {Dk}, and optimize over {Dk} with fixed {α(g)}. We refer to the algorithm as conditional sparse coding (CSC) since it is a coding procedure for the response vectors Y conditioned on the covariate vectors X.\nAlgorithm 1 Conditional Sparse Coding (CSC)\nInput: Data {(Y (g),X(g)}g=1,...,G, regularization parameters λ and τ .\n1. Initialize dictionary {D1, ...,DK} as random rank one matrices.\n2. Alternate between the following steps until convergence of f(α,D):\na. Encoding step: {α(g)} ← argminα(g) f(α,D) b. Learning step:\n{Dk} ← argminDk∈CD(τ) f(α,D)\nThe encoding step is equivalent to an independent ℓ1constrained least squares fit, or lasso optimization, for\neach group g:\nmin α(g)∈RK\n1\nn\nn∑\ni=1\n∥∥∥Y (g)i − G∑\ng=1\nα (g) k (DkX (g) i )\n∥∥∥ 2\n2 + λ‖α(g)‖1.\n(4.1) A variety of algorithms are available to solve the lasso efficiently, notably iterative soft thresholding, a form of coordinate descent (Friedman et al., 2007).\nFor optimizing the dictionary entries, we designed both a projected gradient descent algorithm and a fast iterative shrinkage and thresholding algorithm (FISTA) following Beck & Teboulle (2009). A complication is that since the constraint set CD(λ) is an intersection of nuclear norm and spectral norm balls, the projection needs to be done with care. We leave details of the optimization algorithms and the projection procedure to the appendix.\nRemarks on implementation details Although learning the dictionary is computationally intensive, fitting the coefficients to the dictionary is very fast due to efficient lasso optimization algorithms. Thus, an easy way to speed up CSC is to learn the dictionary with a smaller number of groups. The CSC optimization, being non-convex, is sensitive to initialization. We suggest random initialization both because our theoretical guarantees assume random initialization and because it works well in practice.\nIn sparse coding, one never picks a dictionary size K equal to or greater than number of vectors to encode to avoid the trivial solution of letting each vector be a dictionary element itself. In CSC however, one can choose K > G because of the nuclear-norm constraint on the dictionary entries. Based both on theory and experimental results, we recommend that τ is held to a constant between 1 and 0.5, and that λ is then chosen with cross-validation."

      "text" : "To get a more complete understanding of CSC, we perform both a pessimistic analysis and an optimistic analysis. In the pessimistic analysis, we do not assume that our model is correct, and we do not assume any underlying common structure among the the groups. It is obvious that, under the general pessimistic setting, we cannot achieve higher statistical accuracy with CSC than with the alternative of estimating separate low-rank matrices for each group. Our pessimistic analysis provides a simple rule for determining, in the worst case, how much worse CSC is than the alternative.\nIn the optimistic analysis, we focus on a very specific\nsetting where we only have to fit the coefficients to a pre-existing set of learned dictionary entries. We assume that the learned dictionary has thus captured common structure that exists among the groups. We show that in this setting CSC can produce an accurate estimator with fewer samples than the alternative of estimating separate matrices.\nIn all of our analyses, we measure statistical accuracy through non-asymptotic bounds on the excess risk R(D,α(g)) − R(B∗). For clarity of presentation, we will use same symbols c and C to represent possibly different, generic constants in the theorem statements.\nBefore beginning the analysis, we enumerate and justify the underlying assumptions.\nA1. For all groups g, X(g) and Y (g) are zero mean Gaussian random vectors. Let Σ be the (p + q) × (p + q) covariance matrix Σ = E[(X(g), Y (g))(X(g), Y (g))T]. Then the spectral norm ‖Σ‖2 is a constant independent of n. A2. For all groups g, ‖B∗(g)‖∗ ≤ L and B∗(g) is of rank at most r.\nA3. The sample size satisfies n ≥ (p + q).\nWe make assumption A1 only to leverage results on concentration of measure; we do not use any other properties of the Gaussian distribution. Our analysis will thus easily extend to subgaussian random vectors. Assumption A2 is merely notation, allowing us to state our bounds in terms of L and r. Assumption A3 is made so that many of the results in our pessimistic analysis can be stated more compactly; we do not make this assumption in our optimistic analysis.\nIt should be emphasized that since we are carrying out an excess risk analysis, we do not require incoherence conditions on our samples X (g) 1 , . . . ,X (g) n , as are often assumed in high-dimensional statistical analysis of sparsity.\nBecause we will repeatedly compare the excess risk rate of CSC against estimating separate matrices, we first prove an excess risk bound for using nuclear-norm regularization in each group.\nTheorem 5.1. Suppose that assumptions A1, A2, A3 hold.

But because the oracle coefficients α init(g) oracle are not sparse, the learned coefficients α init(g) λ will be a poor estimate of the oracle coefficients, and the resulting excess risk may be significantly larger.\nProposition 5.1 and the preceding discussion motivate the need for learning the dictionary—we may improve statistical accuracy if we can customize the dictionary, allowing reconstruction of B∗(g) from the dictionary using sparse coefficients. Our main theorem in this subsection formalizes this intuition.\nTheorem 5.2. Suppose assumptions A1, A2, A3 hold. Suppose K ≥ max(n, r(p + q)), λ ≤ √\nlog K n ,\nand τ ≤ 1.

Of course, the excess risk can be worse if ‖αlearn(g)λ ‖1 increases with (p + q) or n; we cannot rule out this possibility because the dictionary learning optimization is nonconvex and does not admit a direct analysis. We note in our experimental section, however, that α learn(g) λ is very sparse in our simulations. We note also that our proof uses critically the fact that our algorithm places a nuclear-norm constraint on the dictionary entries, thus showing that the constraint is necessary to reduce overfitting when learning the dictionary.\nTheorem 5.2 and Proposition 5.1 suggest a rule of thumb in applying conditional sparse coding. If the sparsity levels of the coefficients do not decrease with the iterations of dictionary learning, then the resulting statistical accuracy may be poor."

Theorem 5.1 then follows from a standard argument.\nProof sketch of Proposition 5.1. The proof is constructive. It uses a theoretical procedure, similar to orthogonal matching pursuit, but infeasible to implement, to produce a α(g) with sparsity level s for the random rank 1 dictionary entries so that the reconstruction error ‖B∗(g) − ∑Kk=1 Dinitα (g) k ‖F and the associated excess risk would be sufficiently low. Since αinitoracle is the optimal set of s-sparse coefficients, we can upper bound its risk with the risk of our constructed coefficients.

Thus, we have immediately that (5.2) is at most λ‖αinit(g)oracle ‖1. A bound on (5.4) follows from Proposition 5.1.

More precisely, we have X as a design matrix of neural signals with dimension (p = 434) × (n = 60) and Y as the response matrix with dimension (q = 192) × (n = 60) of semantic features of the 60 nouns being shown to the subjects. We let each subject be a group and hence we have that G = 9.\nThe goal is to predict the semantic features of the noun being shown to the subject, based only on the neural signal of the subject’s brain. The predicted semantic features can then be used to guess which word the subject was viewing and thus “read the subject’s mind.”\nFollowing Mitchell et al. (2008), we use hold-two-out cross-validation for evaluation. In each run of the experiment, we hold out two words, using the remaining\n58 words for training, and then compute three evaluation metrics: 2 vs. 2 classification, 1 vs. 2 classification, and squared error. Let y1, y2 be the semantic feature vectors of the heldout words. Let ŷ1, ŷ2 be the predicted semantic feature vectors. We say that we correctly made a 2 vs. 2 classification if d(y1, ŷ1) + d(y2, ŷ2) < d(y1, ŷ2) + d(y2, ŷ1) and we say that we correctly made a 1 vs. 2 classification if both d(y1, ŷ1) < d(y1, ŷ2) and d(y2, ŷ2) < d(y2, ŷ1). If we make random predictions, then the expected 1 vs. 2 classification accuracy is 0.25 and the expected 2 vs. 2 classification accuracy is 0.5. Our parameters are tuned by separate cross-validation trials. We used K = 20 dictionary entries.\nIn Figure 3, we compare the performance of CSC to separate trace-norm-regularized regressions for each subject. CSC often shows significant improvement in both 2 vs. 2 and 1 vs. 2 classification tasks, with very few cases of significant degradation. In terms of squared error, CSC shows improvement for most subjects, although on average, the improvement is statistically insignificant.\nAlthough there is indeed sharing of dictionary entries across the various groups (subjects), it is important to mention that the pattern of sharing is unstable from trial to trial. Figure 6.2 shows two patterns of group-dictionary utilization derived from the α(g) coefficients. We see that in the first trial, subject 3 shares significantly with subject 7, while subject 1 shares with no other subjects; in the second trial, subject 3 shares with subject 5 and subject 1 shares with subjects 6 and 9. The instability is possibly due to the low sample size. As a result of this instability, we cannot deduce subject-subject similarities from the dictionary utilization patterns."

We propose an approach in which a dictionary of low rank parameter matrices is estimated across groups, and a sparse linear combination of the dictionary elements is estimated to form a model within each group. We refer to the method as conditional sparse coding since it is a coding procedure for the response vectors Y conditioned on the covariate vectors X. This approach captures the shared information across the groups while adapting to the structure within each group. It exploits the same intuition behind sparse coding that has been successfully developed in computer vision and computational neuroscience. We propose an algorithm for conditional sparse coding, analyze its theoretical properties in terms of predictive accuracy, and present the results of simulation and brain imaging experiments that compare the new technique to reduced rank regression.",
