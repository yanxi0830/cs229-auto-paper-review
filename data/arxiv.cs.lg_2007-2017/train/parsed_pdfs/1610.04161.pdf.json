      "text" : "Recently there has been much interest in understanding why deep neural networks are preferred to shallow networks. In this paper, we show that, for a large class of piecewise smooth functions, the number of neurons needed by a shallow network to approximate a function is exponentially larger than the corresponding number of neurons needed by a deep network for a given degree of function approximation. First, we consider univariate functions on a bounded interval and require a neural network to achieve an approximation error of ε uniformly over the interval. We show that shallow networks (i.e., networks whose depth does not depend on ε) require Ω(poly(1/ε)) neurons while deep networks (i.e., networks whose depth grows with 1/ε) require O(polylog(1/ε)) neurons. We then extend these results to certain classes of important multivariate functions. Our results are derived for neural networks which use a combination of rectifier linear units (ReLUs) and binary step units, two of the most popular type of activation functions. Our analysis builds on this simple observation that the binary approximation of a real number in the interval [0, 1] can be represented by a deep neural network which uses a “small” number of neurons."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "Neural networks have drawn significant interest from the machine learning community, especially due to their recent empirical successes (see the surveys (Bengio, 2009)). Neural networks are used to build stateof-art systems in various applications such as image\nrecognition, speech recognition, natural language process and others (see, Krizhevsky et al. 2012; Goodfellow et al. 2013; Wan et al. 2013, for example). The result that neural networks are universal approximators is one of the theoretical results most frequently cited to justify the use of neural networks in these applications. Numerous results have shown the universal approximation property of neural networks with one hidden layer in approximations of different function classes, (see, e.g., Cybenko 1989; Hornik et al. 1989; Hornik 1991; Chui and Li 1992; Barron 1993).\nAll these results and many others provide upper bounds on the network size and assert that small approximation error can be achieved if the network size is sufficiently large. More recently, there has been much interest in understanding the approximation capabilities of deep versus shallow networks. Delalleau and Bengio (2011) and Telgarsky (2016) have shown that there exist deep networks which cannot be approximated by shallow networks unless they use an exponentially larger amount of units or neurons. Eldan and Shamir (2015) have shown that, to approximate a specific function, a two-layer network requires an exponential number of neurons in the input dimension, while a three-layer network requires a polynomial number of neurons. These recent papers demonstrate the power of deep networks by showing that depth can lead to an exponential reduction in the number of neurons required, for specific functions or specific neural networks. Our goal here is different: we are interested in function approximation specifically and would like to show that for a given upper bound on the approximation error, shallow networks require exponentially more neurons than deep networks for a large class of functions.\nThe multilayer neural networks considered in this paper are allowed to use either rectifier linear units (ReLU) or binary step units (BSU), or any combination of the two. The main contributions of this paper are\n• We have shown that, for ε-approximation of functions with enough piecewise smoothness, a multilayer neural network which uses Θ(log(1/ε)) lay-\nar X\niv :1\n61 0.\n04 16\n1v 1\n[ cs\n.L G\n] 1\n3 O\nct 2\n01 6\ners only needs O(polylog(1/ε)) neurons, while Ω(poly(1/ε)) neurons are required by neural networks with o(log(1/ε)) layers. In other words, shallow networks require exponentially more neurons than a deep network to achieve the level of accuracy for function approximation.\n• We have shown that for all differentiable and strongly convex functions, multilayer neural networks need Ω(log(1/ε)) neurons to achieve an εapproximation. Thus, our results for deep networks are tight.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we present necessary definitions and the problem statement. In Section 3, we present upper bounds on network size, while the lower bound is provided in Section 4. Conclusions are presented in Section 5."

      "text" : "In this paper, we focus on bounds on the size of the feedforward network function approximation. Specifically, we aim to answer the following two questions.

The second question asks, for a fixed depth, what is the minimum size of a neural network required to guarantee an εapproximation. Obviously, tight bounds in the answers to these two questions provide tight bounds on the network size and depth required for function approximation. Besides, solutions to these two questions together can be further used to answer the following question. If a deeper neural network of size Nd and a shallower neural network of size Ns are used to approximate the same function with the same error, then how fast does the ratio Nd/Ns decay to zero as the error decays to zero?"

Before stating the results, some notations and terminology deserve further explanation. First, the upper bound on the network size represents the number of neurons required at most for approximating a given function with a certain error. Secondly, the notion of the approximation is the L∞ distance: for two functions f and g, the L∞ distance between these two function is the maximum point-wise disagreement over the cube [0, 1]d."

      "heading" : "3.1 Approximation of univariate functions",
      "text" : "In this subsection, we present all results on approximating univariate functions. We first present a theorem on the size of the network for approximating a simple quadratic function. As part of the proof, we present the structure of the multilayer feedforward neural network used and show how the neural network parameters are chosen. Results on approximating general functions can be found in Theorem 2 and\nTheorem 1. For function f(x) = x2, x ∈ [0, 1], there exists a multilayer neural network f̃(x) with O ( log 1ε ) layers, O ( log 1ε ) binary step units and\nO ( log 1ε ) rectifier linear units such that\n|f(x)− f̃(x)| ≤ ε, x ∈ [0, 1].\nProof. The proof is composed of three parts. For any x ∈ [0, 1], we first use the multilayer neural network to approximate x by its finite binary expansion ∑n i=0 xi 2i . We then construct the a 2-layer neural network to implement function f (∑n i=0 xi 2i ) . For each x ∈ [0, 1], x can be denoted by its binary expansion x = ∑∞ i=0 xi 2i , where xi ∈ {0, 1} for all i ≥ 0. It is straightforward to see that the n-layer neural network shown in Figure 1 can be used to find x0, ..., xn.\nNext, we implement the function f̃(x) = f (∑n\ni=0 xi 2i\n)\nby a two-layer neural network. Since f(x) = x2, we then rewrite f̃(x) as follows:\nf̃(x) =\n( n∑\ni=0\nxi 2i\n)2 = n∑\ni=0\n xi ·   1\n2i\nn∑\nj=0\nxj 2j\n   \n=\nn∑\ni=0\nmax  0, 2(xi − 1) + 1\n2i\nn∑\nj=0\nxj 2j\n \nThe third equality follows from the fact that xi ∈ {0, 1} for all i. Therefore, the function f̃(x) can be implemented by a multilayer network containing a deep structure shown in Figure 1 and another hidden layer with n rectifier linear units. This multilayer neural network has n + 2 layers, n binary step units and n rectifier linear units.\nFinally, we consider the approximation error of this multilayer neural network,\n|f(x)− f̃(x)| = ∣∣∣∣∣∣ x2 − ( n∑\ni=0\nxi 2i )2∣∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ 2 ∣∣∣∣∣x− n∑\ni=0\nxi 2i ∣∣∣∣∣\n= 2 ∣∣∣∣∣ ∞∑\ni=0\nxi 2i −\nn∑\ni=0\nxi 2i ∣∣∣∣∣ = 2 ∣∣∣∣∣ ∞∑\ni=n+1\nxi 2i ∣∣∣∣∣ ≤ 1 2n−1\nTherefore, in order to achieve ε-approximation error, one should choose n = ⌈ log2 1 ε ⌉ + 1. In sum-\nmary, the deep neural network has O ( log 1ε ) layers,\nO ( log 1ε ) binary step units and O ( log ( 1 ε )) rectifier linear units.\nNext, a theorem on the size of the network for approximating general polynomials is given as follows. Theorem 2. For polynomials f(x) = ∑p i=0 aix\ni, x ∈ [0, 1] and ∑pi=1 |ai| ≤ 1, there exists a multi-\nlayer neural network f̃(x) with O ( p+ log pε ) layers,\nO ( log pε ) binary step units and O ( p log pε ) rectifier linear units such that\n|f(x)− f̃(x)| ≤ ε, x ∈ [0, 1].\nProof. The proof is composed of three parts. We first use the deep structure shown in Figure 1 to find the n-bit binary expansion ∑n i=0 aix\ni of x. Then we construct a multilayer network to approximate polynomials gi(x) = x\ni, i = 1, ..., p. Finally, we analyze the approximation error.\nUsing the same deep structure shown in Figure 1, we could find the binary expansion sequence {x0, ..., xn}. In this step, we used n binary steps units in total. Now we rewrite gm+1( ∑n i=0 xi 2n ),\ngm+1\n( n∑\ni=0\nxi 2i\n) = gm ( n∑\ni=0\nxi 2i\n) ·   n∑\nj=0\nxj 2j\n \n=\nn∑\nj=0\n[ xj · 1\n2j gm\n( n∑\ni=0\nxi 2i\n)]\n=\nn∑\nj=0\nmax [ 2(xj − 1) + gm ( n∑\ni=0\nxi 2i\n) , 0 ] (1)\nClearly, the equation (1) defines iterations between the outputs of neighbor layers. Therefore, the deep neural network shown in Figure 2 can be used to implement the iteration given by (1). Further, to implement this network, one should use p layers with pn rectifier linear units in total. We now define the output of the multilayer neural network as\nf̃(x) =\np∑\ni=0\naigi\n  n∑\nj=0\nxj 2j\n  .\nFor this multilayer network, the approximation error is\n|f(x)− f̃(x)| = ∣∣∣∣∣∣ p∑\ni=0\naigi\n  n∑\nj=0\nxj 2j\n − p∑\ni=0\naix i ∣∣∣∣∣∣\n≤ p∑\ni=0\n |ai| · ∣∣∣∣∣∣ gi   n∑\nj=0\nxj 2j\n − xi ∣∣∣∣∣∣  \n=\np∑\ni=0\n i|ai| · ∣∣∣∣∣∣ n∑\nj=0\nxj 2j − x ∣∣∣∣∣∣   ≤ p 2n−1\nThis indicates, to achieve ε-approximation error, one should choose n = ⌈ log pε ⌉ + 1. Besides, since we used n+p layers with n binary step units and pn rectifier linear units in total, this multilayer neural network thus has O ( p+ log pε ) layers, O ( log pε ) binary step units\nand O ( p log pε ) rectifier linear units.\nIn Theorem 2, we have shown an upper bound on the size of multilayer neural network for approximating polynomials. We can easily observe that the number of neurons in network grows as p log p with respect to p, the degree of the polynomial. We note that both Andoni et al.(2014) and Barron(1993) showed the sizes of the networks in grow exponentially with respect to p if only 3-layer neural networks are allowed to use in approximating polynomials.\nBesides, every function f with p+1 continuous derivatives on a bounded set can be approximated easily with a polynomial with degree p. This is shown by the following well known result of Lagrangian interpolation. By this result, we could further generalize Theorem 2. The proof can be found in the reference (Gil et al., 2007).\nLemma 3 (Lagrangian interpolation at Chebyshev points). If a function f is defined at points z0, ..., zn, zi = cos((k + 1/2)π/(n + 1)), i ∈ [n], there exists a polynomial of degree not more that n such that Pn(zi) = f(zi), i = 0, ..., n. This polynomial is given by Pn(x) = ∑n i=0 f(zi)Li(x) where\nLi(x) = πn+1(x)\n(x− zi)π′(zi) and πn+1(x) =\nn∏\nj=0\n(x− zj).\nAdditionally, if f is continuous on [−1, 1] and n + 1 times differentiable in (−1, 1), then\n‖Rn‖ = ‖f − Pn‖ ≤ 1\n2n(n+ 1)!\n∥∥∥f (n+1) ∥∥∥ ,\nwhere f (n)(x) is the derivative of f of the nth order and the norm ‖f‖ is the l∞ norm ‖f‖ = maxi∈[−1,1] f(x).\nThen the upper bound on the network size for approximating more general functions follows directly from Theorem 2 and Lemma 3.\nTheorem 4. Assume that function f is continuous on [0, 1] and ⌈ log 2ε ⌉ + 1 times differentiable in (0, 1). Let f (n) denote the the derivative of f of nth order and ‖f‖ = maxx∈[0,1] f(x). If ∥∥f (n) ∥∥ ≤ n! holds for\nall n ∈ [⌈ log 2ε ⌉ + 1 ] , then there exists a deep neural\nnetwork f̃ with O ( log 1ε ) layers, O ( log 1ε ) binary step\nunits, O (( log 1ε )2) rectifier linear units such that\n|f(x)− f̃ | ≤ ε for ∀x ∈ [0, 1].\nProof. Let N = ⌈ log 2ε ⌉ . From Lemma 3, it follows that there exists polynomial PN of degree N such that for any x ∈ [0, 1],\n|f(x)− PN (x)| ≤ ∥∥f (N+1) ∥∥ 2N (N + 1)! ≤ 1 2N .\nLet x0, ..., xN denote the first N + 1 bits of the binary expansion of x and define\nf̃(x) = PN\n( N∑\ni=0\nxi 2N\n) .\nIn the following, we first analyze the approximation error of f̃ and next show the implementation of this function. Let x̃ = ∑N i=0 xi 2i . The error can now be upper bounded by\n|f(x)− f̃(x)| = |f(x)− PN (x̃)| ≤ |f(x)− f (x̃)|+ |f (x̃)− PN (x̃)|\n≤ ∥∥∥f (1) ∥∥∥ · ∣∣∣∣∣x− N∑\ni=0\nxi 2i ∣∣∣∣∣+ 1 2N ≤ 1 2N + 1 2N ≤ ε\nIn the following, we describe the implementation of f̃ by a multilayer neural network. Since PN is a polynomial of degree N , function f̃ can be rewritten as\nf̃(x) = PN\n( N∑\ni=0\nxi 2i\n) = N∑\nn=0\ncngn\n( N∑\ni=0\nxi 2i\n)\nfor some coefficients c0, ..., cN and gn = x n, n ∈ [N ]. Hence, the multilayer neural network shown in the Figure 2 can be used to implement f̃(x). Notice that the network uses N layers with N binary step units in total to decode x0,...,xN and N layers with N\n2 rectifier linear units in total to construct the polynomial PN . Substituting N = ⌈ log 2ε ⌉ , we have proved the theorem.\nTheorem 4 shows that any function f with enough smoothness can be approximated by a multilayer neural network containing polylog ( 1 ε ) neurons with ε error. Further, Theorem 4 can be used to show that for functions h1,...,hk with enough smoothness, then linear combinations, multiplications and compositions of\nthese functions can as well be approximated by multilayer neural networks containing polylog ( 1 ε ) neurons with ε error. Specific results are given in the following corollaries.\nCorollary 5 (Function addition). Suppose that all functions h1, ..., hk satisfy the conditions in Theorem 4, and the vector β ∈ {ω ∈ Rk : ‖ω‖1 = 1}, then for the linear combination f = ∑k i=1 βihi, there\nexists a deep neural network f̃ with O ( log 1ε ) layers, O ( log 1ε ) binary step units, O (( log 1ε )2) rectifier linear units such that\n|f(x)− f̃ | ≤ ε for ∀x ∈ [0, 1].\nRemark: Clearly, Corollary 5 follows directly from the fact that the linear combination f satisfies the conditions in Theorem 4 if all the functions h1,...,hk satisfy those conditions. We note here that the upper bound on the network size for approximating linear combinations is independent of k, the number of component functions.\nCorollary 6 (Function multiplication). Suppose that all functions h1,...,hk are continuous on [0, 1] and⌈ 4k log2 4k + 4k + 2 log2 2 ε ⌉ + 1 times differentiable in (0, 1). If ‖h(n)i ‖ ≤ n! holds for all i ∈ [k] and n ∈ [⌈ 4k log2 4k + 4k + 2 log2 2 ε ⌉ + 1 ] then for\nthe multiplication f = ∏k i=1 hi, there exists a\nmultilayer neural network f̃ with O ( k log k + log 1ε )\nlayers, O ( k log k + log 1ε ) binary step units and\nO ( (k log k)2 + ( log 1ε )2) such that\n|f(x)− f̃(x)| ≤ ε, for ∀x ∈ [0, 1]. Corollary 7 (Function composition). Suppose that all functions h1, ..., hk : [0, 1] → [0, 1] satisfy the conditions in Theorem 4, then for the composition f = h1◦h2◦...◦hk, there exists a multilayer neural network f̃ with O ( k log k log 1ε + log k ( log 1ε )2) layers,\nO ( k log k log 1ε + log k ( log 1ε )2) binary step units and O ( k2 ( log 1ε )2 + ( log 1ε )4) rectifier linear units such that\n|f(x)− f̃(x)| ≤ ε, for ∀x ∈ [0, 1].\nRemark: Proofs of Corollary 6 and 7 can be found in the appendix. We observe that different from the case of linear combinations, the upper bound on the network size grows as k2 log2 k in the case of function multiplications and grows as k2 ( log 1ε )2 in the case of function compositions where k is the number of component functions. In this sbsection, we have shown a polylog ( 1 ε ) upper bound on the network size for ε-approximation of both univariate polynomials and general univariate functions with enough smoothness. Besides, we have shown that linear combinations, multiplications and compositions of univariate functions with enough smoothness can as well be approximated with ε error by a multilayer neural network of size polylog ( 1 ε ) . In the next subsection, we will show the upper bound on the network size for approximating multivariate functions."

We next present a theorem on the upper bound on the neural network size for approximating general multivariate polynomial functions. Finally, similar to the results in the univariate case, we present the upper bound on the neural network size for approximating the linear combination, the multiplication and the composition of multivariate functions with enough smoothness.\nTheorem 8. Let W = {w ∈ Rd : ‖w‖1 = 1}. For f(x) = ∏p i=1 ( wTi x ) , x ∈ [0, 1]d and wi ∈ W , i = 1, ..., p, there exists a deep neural network f̃(x) with O ( p+ log pdε ) layers and O ( log pdε ) binary step units and O ( pd log pdε ) rectifier linear units such that\n|f(x)− f̃(x)| ≤ ε, ∀x ∈ [0, 1]d.\nTheorem 8 shows an upper bound on the network size for ε-approximation of a product of multivariate linear functions. Furthermore, since any general multivariate polynomial can be viewed as a linear combination of products, the result on general multivariate polynomials directly follows from Theorem 8.\nTheorem 9.

By further analyzing the results on the network size, we obtain the following results: (a) fixing degree p, N(d, ε) = O ( dp+1 log dε ) as d → ∞ and (b) fixing\ninput dimension d, N(p, ε) = O ( pd log pε ) as p → ∞. Similar results on approximating multivariate polynomials were obtained by Andoni et al.(2014) and Barron(1993). Barron(1993) showed that on can use a 3-layer neural network to approximate any multivariate polynomial with degree p, dimension d and network size dp/ε2. Andoni et al.(2014) showed that one could use the gradient descent to train a 3-layer neural network of size d2p/ε2 to approximate any multivariate polynomial. However, Theorem 9 shows that the deep neural network could reduce the network size from O (1/ε) to O ( log 1ε ) for the same ε error. Besides, for a fixed input dimension d, the size of the 3- layer neural network used by Andoni et al.(2014) and Barron(1993) grows exponentially with respect to the degree p. However, the size of the deep neural network shown in Theorem 9 grows only polynomially with respect to the degree. Therefore, the deep neural network could reduce the network size from O(exp(p)) to O(poly(p)) when the degree p becomes large. Theorem 9 shows an upper bound on the network size for approximating multivariate polynomials. Further, by combining Theorem 4 and Corollary 7, we could obtain an upper bound on the network size for approximating more general functions. The results are shown in the following corollary.\nCorollary 10. Assume that all univariate functions h1, ..., hk : [0, 1] → [0, 1], k ≥ 1, satisfy the conditions in Theorem 4. Assume that the multivariate polynomial l(x) : [0, 1]d → [0, 1] is of degree p. For composition f = h1 ◦ h2 ◦ ... ◦ hk ◦ l(x), there exists a multilayer neural network f̃ of\ndepth O ( p+ log d+ k log k log 1ε + log k ( log 1ε )2) and of size N(k, p, d, ε) such that |f̃(x) − f(x)| ≤ ε for\n∀x ∈ [0, 1]d, where\nN(k, p, d, ε) = O ( p2 ( p+ d− 1 d− 1 ) log pd ε\n+k2 ( log 1\nε\n)2 + ( log 1\nε\n)4)\nRemark: Corollary 10 shows an upper bound on network size for approximating compositions of multivariate polynomials and general univariate functions. The upper bound can be loose due to the assumption that l(x) is a general multivariate polynomials of degree p. For some specific cases, the upper bound can be much smaller. We present two specific examples in Corollary 11 and Corollary 12.\nCorollary 11 (Gaussian function). For Gaussian function f(x) = f(x(1), ..., x(d)) = e− ∑d i=1(x\n(i))2/2, x ∈ [0, 1]d, there exists a deep neural network f̃(x) with O ( log dε ) layers, O ( d log dε ) binary step units and\nO ( d log dε + ( log 1ε )2) rectifier linear units such that |f̃(x)− f(x)| ≤ ε for ∀x ∈ [0, 1]d. Corollary 12 (Ridge function). If f(x) = g(aTx) for some direction a ∈ Rd with ‖a‖1 = 1, a 0, x ∈ [0, 1]d and some univariate function g satisfying conditions in Theorem 4, then there exists a multilayer neural network f̃ with O ( log 1ε ) layers, O ( log 1ε ) bi-\nnary step units and O (( log 1ε )2) rectifier linear units such that |f(x)− f̃(x)| ≤ ε for ∀x ∈ [0, 1]d.\nIn this subsection, we have shown that a similar polylog ( 1 ε ) upper bound on the network size for εapproximation of general multivariate polynomials and functions which are compositions of univariate functions and multivariate polynomials.\nThe results in this section can be used to find a multilayer neural network of size polylog ( 1 ε ) which provides an approximation error of at most ε. In the next section, we will present lower bounds on the network size for approximating both univariate and multivariate functions. The lower bound together with the upper bound shows a tight bound on the network size required for function approximations.\nWhile we have presented results in both the univariate and multivariate cases for smooth functions, the results automatically extend to functions that are piecewise smooth, with a finite number of pieces. In other words, if the domain of the function is partitioned into regions, and the function is sufficiently smooth (in the sense described in the Theorems and Corollaries earlier) in each of the regions, then the results essentially remain unchanged except for an additional factor which will depend on the number of regions in the domain."

We now prove that if multilayer neural network f̃ has no break point in [x1, x2], then f̃ should have a break point in [x0, x1] and a break point in [x2, x3]. We prove this by contradiction. We assume the neural network f̃ has no break points in the interval [x0, x3]. Since f̃ is constructed by rectifier linear units and binary step units and has no break points in the interval [x0, x3], then we f̃ should be a linear function in the interval [x0, x3], i.e., f̃(x) = ax+ b, x ∈ [x0, x3] for some a and b. By assumption, since f̃ approximates f with error at most ε everywhere in [0, 1], then\n|f(x1)− ax1 − b| ≤ ε and |f(x2)− ax2 − b| ≤ ε.\nThen we have\nf(x2)− f(x1)− 2ε x2 − x1 ≤ a ≤ f(x2)− f(x1) + 2ε x2 − x1 .\nBy strong convexity of f ,\nf(x2)− f(x1) x2 − x1 + µ 2 (x2 − x1) ≤ f ′(x2).\nBesides, since ρ > 1 and\nµ 2 (x2 − x1) = √ ρµε = 2ρε x2 − x1 >\n2ε\nx2 − x1 ,\nthen a ≤ f ′(x2). (2) Similarly, we can obtain a ≥ f ′(x1). By our assumption that f̃ = ax+ b, x ∈ [x0, x3], then\nf(x3)− f̃(x3) = f(x3)− ax3 − b = f(x3)− f(x2)− a(x3 − x2) + f(x2)− ax2 − b ≥ f ′(x2)(x3 − x2) + µ\n2 (x3 − x2)2 − a(x3 − x2)− ε\n= (f ′(x2)− a)(x3 − x2) + µ\n2\n( 2 √ ρε/µ )2 − ε\n≥ (2ρ− 1)ε > ε\nThe first inequality follows from strong convexity of f and f(x2) − ax2 − b ≥ ε. The second inequality follows from the inequality (2), while the third follows from ρ > 1. Therefore, this leads to the contradiction. Thus there exists a break point in the interval [x2, x3]. Similarly, we could prove there exists a break point in the interval [x0, x1]. These indicates that to achieve εapproximation in [0, 1], the multilayer neural network f̃ should have at least ⌈ 1 4 √ µ ρε ⌉ break points in [0, 1]. Therefore,\nM(ε) ≥ ⌈ 1\n4\n√ µ\nρε\n⌉ , ∀ρ > 1.\nFurther, Telgarsky (2016) has shown that the maximum number of break points that a multilayer neural network of depth L and size N could have is (N/L)L. Thus, L and N should satisfy\n(N/L)L >\n⌈ 1\n4\n√ µ\nρε\n⌉ , ∀ρ > 1.\nTherefore, we have\nN ≥ L ( µ\n16ε\n) 1 2L\n.\nBesides, let m = N/L. Since each layer in network should have at least 2 neurons, i.e., m ≥ 2, then\nN = m\n2 log2m log2 ( µ 16ε ) ≥ log2 ( µ 16ε ) .\nNow we consider the multivariate case d > 1. Assume input vector to be x = (x1, ..., x(d)). We now fix x(2), ..., x(d) and define two univariate functions\ng(y) = f(y, x(2), ..., x(d)), and g̃(y) = f̃(y, x(2), ..., x(d)).\nBy assumption, g(y) is a strongly convex function with parameter µ and for all y ∈ [0, 1], |g(y) − g̃(y)| ≤ ε. Therefore, by results in the univariate case, we should have\nN ≥ L ( µ\n16ε\n) 1 2L and N ≥ log2 ( µ\n16ε\n) .\nNow we have proved the theorem.\nRemark: Theorem 13 shows that all strongly convex cannot be approximated with error ε by any multilayer neural network with rectifier linear units and binary step units and of size smaller than log2(µ/ε)− 4. Theorem 13 together with Theorem 1 directly shows that to approximate quadratic function f(x) = x2 with error ε, the network size should be of order Θ ( log 1ε ) . Further, by combining Theorem 13 and Theorem 4, we could analytically show the benefits of deeper neural networks. The result is given in the following corollary.\nCorollary 14. Assume that univariate function f satisfies conditions in both Theorem 4 and Theorem 13. If a neural network f̃s is of depth Ls = o ( log 1ε ) , size Ns and |f(x)− f̃s(x)| ≤ ε, for ∀x ∈ [0, 1], then there exists a deeper neural network f̃d(x) of depth Θ ( log 1ε ) , size Nd = O(L2s log2Ns) such that\n|f(x)− f̃d(x)| ≤ ε for ∀x ∈ [0, 1].\nRemark: Corollary 14 shows that in the approximation of the same function, the size of the deep neural network Ns is only of polynomially logarithmic order of the size of the shallow neural network Nd, i.e., Nd = O(polylog(Ns)). Similar results can be obtained for multivariate functions on the type considered in Section 3.2."

In this paper, we show that, for a large class of piecewise smooth functions, the number of neurons needed by a shallow network to approximate a function is exponentially larger than the corresponding number of neurons needed by a deep network for a given degree of function approximation. First, we consider univariate functions on a bounded interval and require a neural network to achieve an approximation error of ε uniformly over the interval. We show that shallow networks (i.e., networks whose depth does not depend on ε) require Ω(poly(1/ε)) neurons while deep networks (i.e., networks whose depth grows with 1/ε) require O(polylog(1/ε)) neurons. We then extend these results to certain classes of important multivariate functions. Our results are derived for neural networks which use a combination of rectifier linear units (ReLUs) and binary step units, two of the most popular type of activation functions. Our analysis builds on this simple observation that the binary approximation of a real number in the interval [0, 1] can be represented by a deep neural network which uses a “small” number of neurons.",
