In biomedical time series analysis, e.g., in vivo neural recording and electrocorticography (ECoG), some measurement artifacts take the form of piecewise exponential transients. The proposed method is formulated as an unconstrained convex optimization problem, regularized by smoothed ℓ1-norm penalty function, which can be solved by majorization-minimization (MM) method. With a slight modification of the regularizer, ETEA can also suppress more irregular piecewise smooth artifacts, especially, ocular artifacts (OA) in electroencephalography (EEG) data. Examples of synthetic signal, EEG data, and ECoG data are presented to illustrate the proposed algorithms."

      "heading" : "1 Introduction",
      "text" : "This work is motivated by the problem of suppressing various types of artifacts in recordings of neural activity. In a recent study [25], typical artifacts in in vivo neural recordings are classified into four types (Type 0 to 3, see Section 2.2 and Figure 3 in [25]). This classification covers many artifacts in the scope of human brain activity recordings, e.g., electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocorticography (ECoG). In this paper, we consider the suppression of Type 0 and Type 1 artifacts. For the purpose of flexibility and generality, we redefine them in terms of morphological characteristics:\n• Type 0: a smooth protuberance that can be modeled as x̂(t) = te−αt, when t > t0.\n• Type 1: an abrupt jump followed by an exponential decay that can be modeled as x̂(t) = e−αt, when t > t0.\nFigure 1 shows examples of the two types of artifacts. We do not consider the other two types in this work because our previous works have addressed efficient algorithms to remove such artifacts. For instance, lowpass filtering/total variation denoising (LPF/TVD) [61] suppresses Type 2 artifacts (Figure 1c), and lowpass filtering/compound sparse denoising (LPF/CSD) [60, 61] can remove sparse and blocky spikes (Type 3 shown in Figure 1d).\nThe approach proposed in this paper is based on an optimization problem intended to capture the primary morphological characteristics of the artifacts using sparsity-inducing regularization. To formulate the problem, we model the observed time series as\ny(t) = f(t) + x(t) + w(t), (1)\nPreprint submitted to Signal Processing (Manuscript) Corresponding author: Yin Ding (yd372@nyu.edu)\nwhere f is a lowpass signal, x is a piecewise smooth transient signal (i.e., Type 0 or Type 1 artifacts), and w is stationary white Gaussian noise. More specifically, f is assumed to be restricted to a certain range of low frequencies. In other words, H(f) ≈ 0, where H is a high-pass filter. Note that in the signal model (1), conventional LTI filtering is not suitable to estimate either f or x from y, because component x, as a piecewise smooth signal comprised of transients, is not band limited.\nIn order to estimate the components, we combine LTI filtering with sparsity-based techniques. We formulate an optimization problem for both decomposition and denoising. A computationally efficient algorithm is derived to solve the optimization problem, based on the theory of majorization-minimization (MM) [15, 24, 36].\nIn addition, this paper specifies how to generate a smoothed penalty function and its majorizer from a non-smooth one, in order to overcome a numerical issue that arises when the penalty function is not differentiable."

      "text" : "Some recent works recover signals with transients by various algorithms. In [19], a slowly varying signal is modeled as a local polynomial and an optimization problem using Tikhonov regularization is formulated to capture it. In [47], the slowly varying trend is modeled as a higher-order sparse-derivative signal (e.g., the third-order derivative is sparse).\nInstead of estimating the slowly varying component via regularization, the LPF/TVD method [61] estimates a lowpass component by LTI filtering and a piecewise constant component by optimization. In this case, an optimization problem is formulated to estimate the piecewise constant component. The approach proposed here uses a similar technique to recover the lowpass component, but in contrast to LPF/TVD, it is more general — the regularization is more flexible with a tunable parameter, so that LPF/TVD can be considered as a special case.\nAnother algorithm related to the approach taken in this paper is the transient artifact reduction algorithm (TARA) [60] which is utilized to suppress additive piecewise constant artifacts and spikes (similar to a hybrid of Type 2 and Type 3 artifact). The approaches proposed in this work target different types of artifacts (Type 0 and Type 1) and applied in different applications.\nThe irregularity of Type 0 transients leads to a more complicated artifact removal problem, where the artifact are irregular fluctuations. A typical example in EEG is ocular artifacts (OA) caused by the blink and/or movement of eyes. To suppress OA, there are approaches based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) [41, 42, 43, 69], and on independent component analysis (ICA) methods [1, 12, 20, 26, 37, 48]. The concept of spatial-frequency in acoustic analysis is also used to remove OA from multichannel signals [44, 64]. In this work, we present a new method to suppress ocular artifacts by proposing a specific model and using sparse optimization.\nThis paper adopts a regularizer inspired by the generalized 1-D total variation [27], wherein the derivative operator in conventional total variation regularizer is generalized to a recursive filter. The regularizers adopted in ETEA and second-order ETEA coincide with first-order and second-order cases of generalized 1-D total variation, respectively. Some differences to the problem discussed in [27] are as follow. Firstly, the signal model (1) allows a lowpass baseline as a component, hence, ETEA can be seen as a combination of conventional LTI filtering and generalized 1-D total variation. Secondly, we consider a formulation in terms of banded matrices, for computational efficiency. Thirdly, we give optimality conditions of the proposed problems, and use these conditions as a guide to set the regularization parameters."

However, each of these functions is non-differentiable at zero, where φ′(0−) 6= φ′(0+).

Here, we consider the optimality condition indirectly via an equivalent problem, similar to the discussion of optimality condition for total\nvariation problems in [2, 17] and for LPF/TVD in [61].\nTo facilitate our derivation, we firstly denote the optimal solution of (22) by x∗. We then define v∗ = Rx∗\nwhere R is given by (17). We define G ∈ RN×(N−1),\nG :=\n\n            \n0 1 0 r 1 0 r2 r 1 0 ... . . . . . . rN−3 · · · · · · r 1 0 rN−2 · · · · · · r2 r 1\n\n            \n(28)\nwhich satisfies\nRG = I. (29)\nThe operatorG acts as an inverse filter ofR. Using the above assumptions, we derive the following proposition regarding optimality conditions for (22).\nProposition 2. If x∗ is an optimal solution to (22), then v∗ = Rx∗ is an optimal solution to problem\nv∗ = argmin v Q(v), (30)\nwhere\nQ(v) = ‖H(y0 −Gv)‖22 + λ ∑\nn\nφǫ([v]n). (31)\nand y0 = y − (x∗ −GRx∗).\nProof. We define x0 ∈ RN as\nx0 := Gv ∗ = GRx∗ (32)\nwhere x∗ is the optimal solution to (22). Note that x0 and x ∗ share an identical v∗ = Rx0 = Rx ∗. Moreover, we define the difference between x∗ and x0 as\nd := x∗ − x0. (33)\nIt follows that Rd = Rx∗ −Rx0 = 0. As a consequence, x0 is the optimal solution to problem\nx0 =argmin x P1(u) (34a)\ns.t. x = u− d. (34b)\nNote x0(0) = 0 must be satisfied in (34) because of the definition of G. Thus, we can write an equivalent problem to (34) using (32),\n{x0,v∗} = argmin x,v P1(u) (35a)\ns.t. x = u− d (35b) x = Gv (35c)\nwhere {x0,v∗} must be the optimal solution. In problem (35), u is uniquely determined by linear functions of v and d, so problem (35) can be simplified by substituting the variables,\n{x0,v∗} = argmin x,v Q(v) (36a)\ns.t. x = Gv (36b)\nwhere Q(v) = P1(u), with u = Gv + d, and can be written explicitly,\nQ(v) = ‖H(y −Gv − d)‖22 + λ ∑\nn\nφǫ([RGv +Rd]n). (37)\nBecause RG = I and Rd = 0, we simplify (37) as\nQ(v) = ‖H(y0 −Gv)‖22 + λ ∑\nn\nφǫ([v]n) (38)\nwhere y0 = y − d. In this case, the equality constraint in (36) is redundant. We can solve the unconstrained problem (30) first, and then compute x0 by (32). This implies that v ∗ is the optimal solution to (30) and satisfies ∇Q(v∗) = 0.\nUsing Proposition 2, instead of problem (22), we alternatively consider the optimality condition of problem (30) where as long as x∗ is an optimal solution of (22), v∗ is an optimal solution of (30). Moreover, we can rewrite the optimality condition of (30) as\np(n) = λφ′ǫ([v ∗]n) = λφ ′ ǫ([Rx ∗]n), (39)\nwhere p = 2GTHTH(y0 − x0), which can be rewritten as\np = 2GTHTH(y − x∗). (40)\nNote that, writing p as (40) does not require the solution to problem (30) or to compute d and y0. Therefore, although we derived an indirect way to verify the optimality condition for (22), the final procedure is direct.\nSetting parameter λ. The equation (39) can be used as a guide to set the regularization parameter λ. Suppose the observation data is composed of Gaussian noise only, then a proper value of λ should make the solution of (22) almost identically zero. Thus, its sparse representation v∗, given by (20), should be all zero as well. In this case, we can calculate a vector q, which depends only on noise,\nq = 2GTHTHw. (41)\nWhen p is calculated by (40), we find a constraint that −λ < p(n) < λ, by the property of φǫ. Furthermore, since x∗ ≈ 0 is expected when the observation is pure noise (i.e., y = w), the values of q ≈ p can be\nconsidered bounded\nq(n) ∈ [−λ,+λ], when |v(n)| 6 βǫ, for n ∈ ZN (42)\nwith high probability. The value βǫ here is related to ǫ, and since ǫ is extremely small, it can be simply assumed to be 0. As a consequence, the value of λ needs to satisfy\nλ > max { |2[GTHTHw]n|, n ∈ ZN } . (43)\nFurther, if the statistical property of the noise can be exploited, e.g., w(n) ∼ N (0, σ2w), λ can be set statistically, such that\nλ = 2.5σw‖2h1‖2 (44)\nwhere σw is the standard deviation of the noise and h1 is the impulse response corresponding to system GTHTH. Note that, GTHTH is a filter with a transfer function P1(z) = H 2(z)/R(z). Hence, although we give the matrix G to derive the approach to set λ, it is not required to compute h1 because the filter P1(z) can be implemented directly using H(z) in (8), and R(z) in (18)."

The noisy observation is shown in Figure 3 in gray.\nDenoising. The result of conventional lowpass filtering is shown in Figure 4a. The result is smooth, but the step edges of each pulse are diminished. Moreover, if compared to the true low-pass baseline, the result is also distorted. The result of using LPF/TVD [61] is illustrated in Figure 4b. Although the abrupt jumps have been preserved, serious staircase effects appear. LPF/TVD uses the first-order derivative operator D in regularization. The derivative of an exponential is another exponential, therefore the derivative is unlikely to have a sufficiently sparse representation. A compensative method is to widen the bandwidth of the lowpass\nfilter, however, this leads to a noisy result. The result presented in Figure 4b is selected by tuning all necessary parameters of LPF/TVD to optimize RMSE (root-mean-square error) value.\nThe result of the proposed ETEA method is shown in Figure 4c. The step edges and decay behavior are well preserved (RMSE = 0.057). We use a smoothed ℓ1-norm penalty function. In this example, we set ǫ = 10−10, r = 0.94, filter order parameter d = 1, cut-off frequency fc = 0.013 cycle/sample, and regularization parameter is calculated by (44) based on the noise principle.\nDecomposition. Wavelet-based methods for artifact correction have been described in [1, 25, 40, 56]. In Figure 5a, we illustrate denoising and decomposition results obtained using the stationary (un-decimated) wavelet transform [11] with Haar wavelet using hard-threshold determined by the √ 2 logNσw thresholding scheme. The denoised result is further enhanced by the artifact-free denoising method [13, 14] which uses total variation minimization to overcome pseudo-Gibbs oscillations. Although the denoising output is relatively smooth and captures the discontinuities, the decomposed components are both distorted. Compared to the true components in Figure 3, the lowpass subband deviates from true lowpass component (especially at about n = 100). The transient component, reconstructed from other subbands after denoising, has to compensate for the error. Hence, the estimated transient component does not have a zero baseline (see bottom of Figure 5a).\nNon-convex penalty functions can be used to improve the result of ETEA. Here we use the smoothed non-convex logarithm penalty function in Table 1 (a = 2). The filtering result is shown in Figure 5b, where discontinuities are more accurately preserved, and the RMSE is reduced to 0.043 compared with the result in Figure 4c. We also illustrate the decomposed f and x components in Figure 5b. ETEA recovers both of the components accurately. The algorithm run-time is not affected by the choice of penalty function. In this example, 50 iterations of the algorithm takes about 25 ms on a MacBook Pro 2012 with a 2.7 GHz CPU, implemented in Matlab 8.4."

Advanced measuring methods such as ECoG records multichannel cortical potentials from the micro-electrodes located inside human skull with a higher sampling rate.

There are two Type 1 artifacts identified in this 5-second epoch. One is at about t = 1.20 second, and the other is at about t = 3.60 second. In signal model (1), suppressing component x which represents artifacts, the corrected data (f + w) should preserve the components. We show the corrected data in Figure 6a, where the two Type 1 spikes are correctly removed. The decomposed artifact is illustrated in Figure 6a as well, which adheres a zero-baseline.\nSince wavelet-based methods have been successfully applied to suppress artifacts [1, 25, 40]. a comparison with a wavelet-based method is shown in Figure 6b. We use the stationary (un-decimated) wavelet transform [11] with Haar wavelet filter and the non-negative garrote threshold function [18],as recommended in [25]. The thresholding has been applied to all the subbands except the lowpass band, and the artifact component is obtained by subtracting the corrected data from the raw data. As shown, this approach estimates transient pulses but the estimated pulse adheres to the shape of the Haar wavelet filter: a positive-negative pulse (see the bottom square box in Figure 6b), but not the true Type 1 artifact in Figure 1b.\nTo more clearly illustrate the estimated results by the two methods, we show the details of the corrected data and the artifact from t = 3.50 to 3.65 second in dashed line boxes in Figure 1a and Figure 1b, respectively. Since the wavelet-based method cannot correctly estimate Type 1 artifact in this case, a ‘bump’ can be observed in Figure 6b to compensate the error. Moreover, this inappropriate estimation will cause the corrected data to change before Type 1 artifact actually occurs (see Figure 1b). In contrast, ETEA estimates the artifact as the abrupt drift with a decay, then it exicises the artifact without influencing the data before the transient occurs (see Figure 1a).\nIn this example, for the signal with a length of 13565 samples, the proposed algorithm converges within 40 iterations, and takes about 330 ms on a MacBook Pro 2012 with 2.7 GHz CPU, implemented in Matlab 8.4.

The impulse response of system R−12 (z) is (n+ 1)r n, when n > 0. It has the same shape as Figure 1a, which is a suitable model for the Type 0 artifacts in [25]. Therefore, R2x is sparse when x is composed of such piecewise smooth transients. Similar to (22), we formulate the problem\nx∗ = argmin x\n{\nP2(x) = ‖H(y− x)‖22 + λ ∑\nn\nφǫ([R2x]n) }\n(47)\nto estimate the transient component x, so that the corrected data is y − x̂, and the low-pass trend f can be estimated by (21). Additionally, (47) can be easily solved by ETEA (in Table 2) substituting R by R2.\nAn example of complicated and irregular artifacts is the eye blink/movement artifacts in EEG data, which may have various morphologies and durations. In this case, we assume that the artifacts can be estimated by a continuous piecewise smooth waveform, generated by applying a certain sparse impulse sequence to R−12 (z)\n(46). In other words, we broaden our signal model so that the artifact is not only equivalent to an isolated Type 0 transient as in [25], but also a superposition of multiple such transients, with some freedom of scaling and shifting. The problem of estimating x can be solved by (47) in this case as well."

      "text" : "Figure 8 shows the simulated data and its lowpass and transient components. The transient component has several pulses with different heights and widths. They are obtained by feeding a sequence of impulses into system R−12 (z). The filter is given in (5) with ak = [1,−2r, r2], b0 = 1, and r = 0.950. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) [22, 23], a powerful method for analyzing signals, has been successfully utilized in different fields, including neuroscience, biometrics, speech recognition, electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, and fault detection [8, 16, 21, 39, 54, 62, 65, 67].\nAs a comparison to the proposed approach, we use the EMD based denoising algorithm in [32], which uses wavelet coefficient thresholding techniques on decomposed IMFs. More specifically, we use clear first iterative interval thresholding (CIIT) with smoothly clipped absolute deviation (SCAD) penalty thresholding [31, 32], with 20 iterations, and the result is shown in Figure 9b. In this example, in order to perform decomposition, among the entire eight IMFs, the thresholding is performed on IMFs 1-5, their summation is considered as the transients illustrated in Figure 9a, and IMFs 6-8 are considered as the estimation of the lowpass component. The EMD based method achieves a decent denoising performance, but does not accurately estimate the components. For instance, the simulated data has a smooth dip at about n = 700 (circled in Figure 9a). EMD decomposes it into higher IMFs since they are varying slowly, which degrades the estimation. We may group the lowpass and transient components differently to avoid this problem, for instance, grouping IMF 1-6 together in order to include more oscillations into transient component, but this causes other distortion, where the decomposed transient component contains a lowpass signal and does not adhere to a baseline of zero.\nThe result obtained using second-order ETEA is illustrated in Figure 9b. ETEA estimates both the lowpass and transient components well, and recovers the signal by x+ f precisely with RMSE = 0.87 (with the smoothed ℓ1 penalty function). The regularization parameter λ for problem (47) was similar to (44),\nλ ≈ 2.5σw‖2h2‖2, (48)\nwhere h2 is the impulse response of system H 2(z)/R2(z), and R2(z) is defined in (46). The decomposition is accurate. There are no compensating waveforms between the estimated x and f at n = 700, comparing to the estimation in Figure 9a.\nThrough numerical experiments, we found that second-order ETEA is not very sensitive to parameter r. Figure 9c shows the RMSE of denoising the data in Figure 8a, using r ∈ [0.85, 0.99]. In this test, all filter parameters (fc and d) are the same and λ is set by (48). In most cases, the results are better than EMD-CIIT. In addition, r should not be too small or very close to 1. If r has to be very small to yield a good estimation of component x, it must fluctuate extremely rapidly, then it must be closer to a sequence of sparse spikes (i.e., Type 3 artifacts in [25]), which differs from the signal model. For such a signal, other algorithms are more suitable, e.g., LPF/CSD [60, 61]. Similarly, if r has to be very close to 1 to fit the transients, then the transients must be very close to a piecewise linear signal, which is also not how we model the signal initially. As a consequence, we suggest to set r in the range 0.90 < r < 0.98."

      "text" : "In this example, we use ETEA with R2 to correct EEG with eye blink/movement artifacts. Figure 10a shows a 10 second signal from channel Fp1, with sampling rate fs = 256 Hz, downloaded from [38]. As a channel located on forehead, Fp1 is very sensitive to the motion of eyes and eyebrows, and in this example, eye movement artifacts with large amplitudes are present through the entire signal. Applying second-order ETEA with r = 0.95, the results for corrected data and extracted OA are illustrated in Figure 10b.\nAs a comparison, we use multivariate empirical mode decomposition (MEMD) [52] to correct the data. MEMD is a recently developed algorithm extending conventional EMD. It has been used in different aspects of EEG signal analysis and applications [9, 50, 49], including removing the ocular artifacts (OA) from multichannel EEG data [53, 42]. In this example, we use 4 EEG channels (Fp1, Fp2, C3, C4) measured simultaneously as the input, and decompose the higher-index IMFs (low-frequency subbands) considered to be artifacts [53, Section V]. More specifically, among all 14 IMFs decomposed in this example, we use IMF 1-4 as the corrected data, and the rest as artifacts. The corrected data and estimated OA are shown in Figure 10c.\nFrom the results in Figure 10b and Figure 10c, ETEA estimates artifacts more clearly than MEMD. In the MEMD result, some small-amplitude higher frequency oscillations leak into the artifact (e.g., about t = 5.5 and 9.0 second). Moreover, some artifacts are introduced after applying MEMD method to correct the data,\n(e.g., about t = 3.0 and 9.5 second in Figure 10c). Some oscillations are generated as transients where the abrupt artifacts occur. In contrast, in Figure 10b, there are no oscillations introduced either in the estimated artifacts or the corrected data.\nComputational Efficiency. Figure 11 shows the average computation time as a function of the signal length. In this experiment, we calculate the time of computation of ETEA (22) and second-order ETEA (47) with different filter settings (controlled by parameter d), using input signal lengths from 5000 to 105. For each length, we average the computation time over 10 trials. For each trial, run 40 iterations of each algorithm. The experiment is implemented in Matlab 8.4 on a MacBook Pro 2012 with 2.7 GHz CPU.\nAs shown, the proposed algorithms have a run time of order O(N). Most of the computation time is consumed by the step of solving the linear system Q−1b in Table 2, where Q is a banded matrix and we use a fast banded solver.\nAdditionally, fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) [3, 7], which is an acceleration scheme for iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA) [6], (a special formulation of MM) may be used to further accelerate the algorithm."

      "heading" : "6 Conclusion",
      "text" : "This paper proposes a new algorithm for denoising and artifact removal for signals comprising artifacts arising in measured data, e.g., neural time-series recordings, using sparse optimization. The first algorithm, ETEA, assumes the signal is composed of a lowpass signal and an exponential transients (Type 1). It is formulated as an optimization problem regularized by differentiable and smooth penalty function. The second algorithm is an extension of ETEA, using a higher-order recursive filter, which is applicable for correction of continuous protuberance transients (Type 0), and more irregular artifacts. As applications, we have shown that ETEA with different regularizers (R and R2) are suitable for the suppression of Type 1 artifact in ECoG data and ocular artifacts (OA) (as sequential Type 0 artifacts) in conventional EEG data, with detailed comparisons to some state-of-the-art methods. Both of the above algorithms are computationally efficient because they are formulated in terms of banded matrices. A promising future work is to extend the above data correcting methods to multichannel data."

      "text" : "Proof. Substitute the variables u and v in (14) by\nu = √ x2 + ǫ, and v = √ z2 + ǫ. (49)\nTherefore, for x, z ∈ R, the inequality holds:\nφ′( √ z2 + ǫ)\n2 √ z2 + ǫ\n(x2 + ǫ) + φ( √ z2 + ǫ)− √ z2 + ǫ\n2 φ′(\n√ z2 + ǫ) > φ( √ x2 + ǫ). (50)\nThe right of the inequality is the majorizer of the smoothed penalty function φ( √ x2 + ǫ). 1) If z 6= 0, we can multiply z to the nominator and denominator of the first term on the left side of (50),\nφ′( √ z2 + ǫ)\n2 √ z2 + ǫ\n(x2 + ǫ) = x2\n2z\n(\nφ′( √ z2 + ǫ) z√\nz2 + ǫ\n)\n+ ǫ\n2z\n(\nφ′( √ z2 + ǫ) z√\nz2 + ǫ\n)\n= x2\n2z φ′ǫ(z) +\nǫ\n2z φ′ǫ(z).

(52)\nUsing the results in (51) and (52), the inequality (50) can be rewritten as\nx2 2z φ′ǫ(z) + ǫ 2z φ′ǫ(z) + φǫ(z)− z 2 φ′ǫ(z)− ǫ 2z φ′ǫ(z) > φǫ(x), (53)\nwhich can be reorganize into\ngǫ(x, z;φǫ) = φ′ǫ(z)\n2z x2 + φǫ(z)−\nz 2 φ′ǫ(z) > φǫ(x). (54)\n2) If z = 0 and x 6= 0, by Lagrange’s Mean Value Theorem [55, Theorem 5.10], since function φ(x) is continuous and φ′′(x) 6 0 on x > 0, there exists a value ξ in the range √ ǫ < ξ < √ x2 + ǫ that φ′( √ ǫ) > φ′(ξ) > φ′( √ x2 + ǫ) satisfying\nφ′(ξ) ( √ x2 + ǫ−√ǫ ) = φ( √ x2 + ǫ)− φ(√ǫ). (55)\nMoreover, consider the square that is always positive\n( √ x2 + ǫ −√ǫ)2 = x2 + ǫ− 2 √ ǫ(x2 + ǫ) + ǫ > 0, (56)\nwhich implies the inequality\nx2 > 2 √ ǫ(x2 + ǫ)− 2ǫ. (57)\nFurthermore, we can multiply both sides of (57) by a positive term φ′(\n√ ǫ)\n2 √ ǫ , and then adopt the result from\n(55), so that:\nφ′( √ ǫ)\n2 √ ǫ\nx2 > φ′(\n√ ǫ)\n2 √ ǫ\n(\n2 √ ǫ(x2 + ǫ)− 2ǫ )\n(58a)\n= φ′( √ ǫ) ( √ x2 + ǫ−√ǫ )\n(58b)\n> φ′(ξ) ( √ x2 + ǫ−√ǫ )\n(58c)\n= φ( √ x2 + ǫ)− φ(√ǫ), (58d)\nwhich leads to\nφ′( √ ǫ)\n2 √ ǫ\nx2 + φ( √ ǫ) > φ( √ x2 + ǫ). (59)\nBecause φǫ in (13) is differentiable on R, we can find its second-order derivative at zero,\nlim z→0\nφ′′ǫ (z) = φ′( √ ǫ)√ ǫ , (60)\nand by L’Hôpital’s rule [55, Theorem 5.13], we have\nlim z→0\nφ′ǫ(z)\n2z = lim z→0\nφ′′ǫ (z)\n2 =\nφ′( √ ǫ)\n2 √ ǫ , (61)\nwhich implies that (59) is in the same form of the majorizer (54) at z = 0. 3) If x = z = 0, then the condition (9) follows immediately."

    "abstractText" : "This paper describes an exponential transient excision algorithm (ETEA). In biomedical time series analysis, e.g., in vivo neural recording and electrocorticography (ECoG), some measurement artifacts take the form of piecewise exponential transients. The proposed method is formulated as an unconstrained convex optimization problem, regularized by smoothed l1-norm penalty function, which can be solved by majorization-minimization (MM) method. With a slight modification of the regularizer, ETEA can also suppress more irregular piecewise smooth artifacts, especially, ocular artifacts (OA) in electroencephalography (EEG) data. Examples of synthetic signal, EEG data, and ECoG data are presented to illustrate the proposed algorithms.",
